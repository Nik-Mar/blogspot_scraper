{"title": "Autumnal Thoughts", "date": "Monday 2 October 2023", "text": "Summer's ended, Autumn is here. The cherry tree leaves are turning.A day of rain and wind today, I've not been tempted to go out at all. The seasons turn so quickly, we had several days of high temperatures earlier in September, now it's jumper weather again. Cyclamen are out in force and shrubs are glowing their final hurrah of the year before they settle down for winter. The hedgehog visits the terrace at dusk, almost on the dot of seven now and I must remember to put out food betimes. It'll have to be earlier and earlier I suspect, until they go into hiding for winter. There are often two of them and there may even have been three last night. By morning the dish is licked clean.There seems to be a trend at the moment for decluttering. I've wanted to do it for a long time but never quite got round to it. I have now, but I'm starting gently, with a drawer full of digital cables and such, all the stuff that comes with new gadgets which you never use. Also theatre programs of the last 30 odd years, London Westend ones, and from all sorts of theatres in the South East, South West of the country, the Edinburgh Festival and the Midlands. My, we must have seen hundreds of plays. I am keeping the Stratford programs for now. I don't know quite what to do with concert and opera programs. They will probably end up in recycling. These things cost a lot of money, yet you buy them, read them and put them into a box somewhere.A young woman took them. I had asked the local book charity shop if they wanted any. No they didn't but they might know someone who does. All my unwanted programs are going to be exhibits in a tea room in the Shropshire Hills, for customers to look at while they recover from long hikes over a scone and a cuppa. She was a very pleasant young woman, within the first ten minutes she had confided half her life story to me, her past and plans for the future. She and her partner also rescue dogs in the next county, which pleased me no end and made handing over two large boxes full of programs a pleasure. Jennifer, the young woman, is interested in stars of yesterday and has posters of what we used to call 'divas' on her walls, European film stars of the 60s and 70s; I have some posters of opera performances of the period which I might pass on to her. She promised me a freebie in March when she opens up again and it'll be interesting to see what she's done. A quaint idea, don't you think?My son was here for a few days, one of his regular tri-monthly visits. When he comes, he does some jobs I've saved up for him and he always takes a load of stuff to the local recycling centre, often needing two or three trips to get rid of it. There is also a day in the middle when he offers to take me anywhere I can't get to now, either because I no longer drive or it's just too far. You'd think I'd ask for a trip to somewhere special, somewhere of great interest, somewhere totally out of my reach now. Sad to say, I can only come up with a particular garden centre in spring and summer and a very posh supermarket the rest of the year.  What a sad state of affairs when my heart yearns exclusively for plants and fancy groceries. I couldn't even take him to the restaurant I'd promised him, the place was fully booked and we had to make do with the nice but ordinary White Horse, the local pub.We spent a few pleasant days together; we don't have a great many interests in common, but we are family and family matters. We have the past, of course, life in Germany, where he spent his formative years, so we always have the German side of the family for reminiscing over. At one point we mentioned his sister with whom he also has little contact and when I asked if a reconciliation between her and me would ever be possible he said  \"No Mum, that ship has sailed.\"That must be one of the saddest phrases in the English language.Apart from decluttering I am also trying to sort out financial and legal matters, which meant going through two desks. Would you believe that I have bank statements from over twenty years ago? Not any longer. Neither do I any longer have ancient receipts and invoices and credit card slips. What on Earth was I thinking? Sure, keep them for a year but don't file them away tidily in envelopes marked with the year where such transactions took place. Last century, anyone?While I've been typing night has fallen and I quickly rushed out with my dish of cat food for the hedgehogs. Now of course I will have to loiter by the back door to await their arrival.I've been feeling a bit gloomy again hence the delay in posting; Perhaps all this decluttering means that I am tidying away one kind if life and starting another? Who knows."},
{"title": "Who gets to choose, me or someone else?", "date": "Wednesday 6 September 2023", "text": "Recently I went for a meal out in a restaurant with a small group of people. There were six of us. The restaurant was somewhat better than the usual pub style and I was very happy to be able to go. Beloved and I often went out for a meal and occasionally we treated ourselves to a fancier, classier place. Since he's been gone that's happened less and less for me, so an opportunity for a smart meal out is something I enjoy.One of my fellow diners was new to me, that is to say I knew them but had never been to a restaurant with them. I was sitting at one end of the table and the waitress came to me first to take my order; I gave it and chose a glass of wine to go with the meal. It honestly never occurred to me to wait and see what everybody else was having, as we were all going to pay for our meals and drinks ourselves.Gradually I became aware that ordering took the others rather a long time and there was much discussion as to what everybody should have and which wine to choose. And the new-to-me person decided that they should choose the wine and buy a bottle rather than for everybody to have a glass of their own preference.As I had already ordered this did not apply to me and I kept quiet. The waitress had gone and promised to be back once the table was ready to order.Eventually the discussion ended and the meals plus a bottle of wine were duly ordered. Embarrassment over, for now.The meal was good and we had a pleasant evening with everybody happy to talk and laugh.Until it was time to pay up. Again my bill was relatively easy and straightforward. I paid, added my tip and awaited events. There was now a great need for debate on how to pay; should everybody pay for their own meal and share the cost of the wine, or add up the cost of the total bills and wine; one person would pay by card; they would then get out their calculator and work out how much everybody's share came to. That also meant that everybody would have to have the exact amount of cash in their wallet to reimburse.The waitress had disappeared once more and I was embarrassed all over again. Eventually they sorted it out somehow, I am not sure how they did it in the end. I went to the bathroom.What would you have done? Waited and consulted everybody else?  I get to go out so rarely nowadays that I feel entitled to choose my own meal and drink. I also heartily dislike the kerfuffle arising when it comes to paying. I eat and drink what I like and pay for it myself.  Right? Or bad manners?"},

It seems that my neighbours somehow got hold of my blog and even read it. Could they be the only people in Valleys End to do so?In any case, I am happy to retract the above statement. After the National Grid engineers had finished next door they came to me and explained what they had done, showing me a photograph of the underground cables before and after repairs and pointed out the work they had done to the meter on my outside wall.It was this engineer who was of the opinion that builders had caused the damage to my power supply. \"Someone probably put a spade through it,\" he said. I accept that I did not see any of the damage myself, only a photograph, which would have told me very little. I simply took the engineer's word for it. He seemed to base his opinion on the age of the material used as shown in the photograph. The engineer also stated that whoever had done it had \"done a bodge job\". His words, not mine. I have no idea who carried out the work.My neighbour kindly called on me the day after to assert that the fault could not possibly have been caused by his builders. I appreciated the visit; I took it for a sign that there might be a thaw in our relationship and under no circumstances do I want to imply that he might have been wrong. Whatever the truth of the matter, I have no personal knowledge either way and hereby apologise for my statement. I am sorry that I accepted the engineer's explanation over that of my neighbour.This is the letter I received from my neighbour, all names and addresses removed:27August 2023Dear …You have recently published some incorrect comments in your blog which I am concerned may cause yyou some embarrassment, and I felt you should have the opportunity to correct your inaccuracies as soon as possible.You may recall (although perhaps you don’t), the day after your electricity supply was restored I came around to your house to ensure that the repair was sound and your electricity supply had remained intact. I explained that, contrary to the obvious conclusion, the damage to your electricity cable was not recent, and the builder’s activity in my drive was not the cause of the disruption.However, your memory does appear to be selective, as you stated in your blog that it was our builder’s activity that had caused the damage.I’d be grateful if you could publish a retraction of your earlier statement with an explanation of your original mistake. Otherwise any local readers of your blog who are not in full possession of the facts may draw the conclusion that I am a person of dubious character who is willing to tell lies and mislead, and that the building firm I have been using is cavalier and incompetent, which it is not.I would also be grateful, in the future, you choose to pass comment on me or my activities, that you check with me first to ensure you don’t write something about me which isn’t true and which may cause offence.Yours sincerely….PS: italics and highlighted phrases mine"},
{"title": "Mood Swings, from the Garden to The Swan", "date": "Friday 4 August 2023", "text": "Those of you who have commented on my state of mind in the previous post are quite right. I do indeed sound sad and unhappy. Rereading the post has confirmed that I really must do something to retrieve my mojo before it is too late.But, hang on a minute. Must I? However we happen to feel at any given moment, are we not free and entitled to do so? These feelings are our very own and are we not allowed to feel them? If not why not? Who says? Since Beloved's death six years ago now I have missed him tremendously and, in spite of being a person who enjoys solitude, I often feel lonely. Agreed, it is not good to overindulge in the \"poor me\" side of things; on the other hand I am not going to feel guilty for allowing myself a heartfelt, deep sigh now and then.However, thank you for picking up on my unhappiness; it means that you gave attention to my post and felt close enough to say so. Thank you. I appreciate it.If only I could get my hands back into the earth. August is a slow month in the ornamental garden, although spring and early summer have left gaps and tired patches, high summer brings exuberance and colour, and even though it is all a bit wild and woolly, I don't want to mess with it until September. I've been pruning the shrubs that flowered early, leaving them ready for next year . But the real hard work  must be left for now. In September hedges will be cut which means piles of bonfire material. From October onwards herbaceous clumps will have to  be divided and replanted. Hm, writing this makes me look forward to the work. Perhaps my mojo will return? I told you it is all a bit of a wilderness, very English cottage garden.Have you ever allowed yourself to be shamed into reading a book? I have. The 2020 Winner of the Women's Prize for Fiction was 'Hamnet' by the esteemed Irish writer Maggie O'Farrell and several friends were praising it to the skies. I had actually started to read the novel, the part-imagined life of Hamnet (Shakespeare's son) and the effect his early death from the plague at the age of eleven had on Agnes (Anne Hathaway) and the family. But I had given up  fifty pages in; although able to appreciate O'Farrell's  luminous language I simply found the casual violence and brutality of the 16th century hard to take; perhaps I was in one of my 'delicate' phases when only escapism would do. The review in The Guardian was glowing and I trust The Guardian's critic to get it right. \"Hamnet is evidence that there are always new stories to tell, even about the most well-known historical figures. It also confirms O'Farrell as an extraordinarily versatile writer, with a profound understanding of the most elemental human bonds – qualities also possessed by a certain former Latin tutor from Stratford.\"What finally persuaded me to read it was that friends and I had been lucky enough to get much coveted tickets for the adaptation of the novel  for the stage. The whole run was sold out and this was the show chosen to reopen The Swan in Stratford after two years of Covid closure and extensive refurbishment. Tickets were like gold dust and my friend had booked our seats almost twelve months earlier.That meant I simply had to read the book. I picked it up and started from the beginning and found I could not put it down. I think I must have read it in maybe two or three sittings. It is a wonderful book. Even those whose interest in Shakespeare is less than mine will find something in it. The one thing you do have to have to read it is a an appreciation of good writing and a deeply human story.We had quite a good time in Stratford, I'll have to get back to it. The first outing away from Valley's End for two years!"},
{"title": "Did you think I had given up? well, nearly.", "date": "Friday 21 July 2023", "text": "Is there any place on this, our one and only home planet, where the inhabitants are not dreading each new day's weather? And if you are a climate change denier don't bother to tell me, the science and the poor blighters who fear for their continued existence are against you. As are the young, your children and grandchildren, whose protests are drowned out by the fossil fuel industry, run by fat cats who will all long be dead when Earth becomes uninhabitable.I am so tired of it all. Even my garden gives me less and less pleasure. The plants that didn't die during last winter's unusual week of hard frost gave up when the temperature climbed to unseasonable heights and prolonged drought in late spring. For six weeks I worked like a maniac to get it all done, at least on the surface, for the Open Gardens weekend. And ended up with a wilderness of volunteer plants and weeds instead of a finely graded display of colourful perennials and flowering shrubs. The people who traipse round the gardens don't look too closely, luckily, but simply stroll through and throw a vague \"very nice, thank you\" at the owners. I don't really care all that much anymore. I will chat with the few knowledgeable ones who ask intelligent questions or praise a particular arrangement, the others can come and go with as much attention as they pay the space I have worked so hard on.So, May and June were almost completely taken up with outdoor work. And when I wasn't working outdoors I was inside, out of the heat, my feet up and devouring books. Mostly rubbish, but there were two which I really liked, a Louise Penny Inspector Gamache thriller and a delightful book from an author hitherto unknown to me, namely Stephanie Butland's 'Found In A Bookshop'. It deals with the lives and misfortunes of a group of people during Covid lockdown, mostly unknown to each other, some sad, some uplifting, all very human. And all connected to each other via a bookshop struggling to keep afloat during this most unhappy time. 'A perfect summer read', says the blurb and I agree, although it would have pleased me just as much during any other season. I must warn you it really is for true book lovers only. At the end of each chapter you even get a list of books suitable to cure the particular heartache the chapter deals with. It will not be the last of her novels I read.And Louise Penny? I just love Chief Inspector Gamache, a man after my own heart. The characters, mostly the inhabitants of the hamlet of 'Three Pines', are people with whom I would love to be friends. Apart from physical work and eye strain from reading I have been utterly lazy. There are piles of correspondence gathering dust on my desk, even my solicitor felt it incumbent upon her to threaten me with the imminent \"closure of my file\" if I didn't reply to her last letter within two weeks. Sad to say she has reason. This is still about my new will and provisions for such time as I am no longer able to take care of myself. Do we ever seriously consider a time when we aren't master of our fate? I hate the thought. My problem is that, for one reason or another, I feel there is really no one who deserves a share of the spoils. I am not rich but my house is worth a fair bit. I can't actually see my daughter being willing to take an inheritance from me, she quite clearly wants nothing to do with me. Or is inheriting money a different matter? My son would gladly take as much as I am willing to leave him, he is the only one in the combined family who needs it. In his case the problem is our differing philosophy and the fact that I have little sympathy for his way of life. I think I am being unreasonable to some extent, his way of life is entirely his own decision. However, seeing that God will get all the credit for whatever I do for him irks me. Beloved's lot will get a just percentage, not that I have any close contact with any of them but fair's fair. As for the rest, there's the charities which have seen me  and my pets through some hard times.It really shouldn't be as difficult as all that to make a final decision, should it? I think that I am using this post to gain clarity in my own mind; also to get some things off my chest that have been bothering me for ages. It is six years since Beloved up and died on me, the rotter. I hate that I am entirely on my own and have no one to consult; the thought of a long dark lonesome winter frightens me. I have an acquaintance, also a German, who lost her husband only at Easter time. She has already booked herself a cruise for this autumn and people tell me she is never at home, always on the trot. After more than fifty years of marriage. It really takes all sorts to make a world and all of us react differently to the vicissitudes of life.What was it someone said? At the end of life we regret the things we didn't do more than the things we did.  Ah yes, that wise old bird Mark Twain."},

First, Google takes over and messes up the system, removes followers and makes commenting into a problem. Not to mention adding photographs. What used to be so easy always takes many attempts now.And then it starts removing my posts. Apparently some of my posts are offensive and must be taken down. Eh? One of them is a poem, fully in the public domain and not in the least offensive. There are two others which are purely history and deal with people surviving killing cold in post war Germany. Where on earth is the offence? These posts are 10 years old and more!And when I opened my blog today I find that I have 45, yes 45, items of spam. Naturally, I checked and found that 43 of them were bona fide comments, going back to 2013! The remaining 2 were simply from people who wanted some attention.Who is it who is messing with my blog?  And why? Does anyone else suffer this fate? I see a sad little old person hunched over a screen and painstakingly going through years and years of blogs, trying to find something to wet themselves over. Somebody with the mindset of the parents who consider the greatest sculpture ever, Michelangelo's David, a biblical figure, to be pornography? Or could it be somebody who has a grudge against me personally?I expect not, I expect it's simply an algorithm which homes in on certain words. So let's go out into the garden for now.My helpful son took me to several nurseries, patiently following me around and pushing trolleys without complaint. I bought a lovely lot of goodies, most of which have been planted but here's a picture of some remaining.This is only a very narrow strip of raised bed, it's amazing what you can cram into it if you take care of it, feeding and watering when necessary.Here's my \"ballerina tree\", the leaves out now, even if they are still small. The strangest thing, I had never before noticed that there is blossom too, but of course there must be, it's real name is 'weeping pear' and pear trees, ornamental or purely decorative, have flowers. The white flowers peering through near the ground are more of my dreaded daffodils. I must have got rid of thousands and still they come. The blossom on the cherry tree to the left are almost finished and the new rusty red leaves dominate that end of the garden now. And some tulips, just for fun.  I like tulips but, like daffodils, they die horribly, messing up their beds in a very rotten (literally) way. Proper gardeners will dig them up and store them until autumn, when they replant the bulbs, but I can't be bothered. I am already storing enough plants over winter in the conservatory and I simply don't have enough space for more. I am a bit old to install a greenhouse now.0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0If you cannot automatically comment please leave me your name or, even better, your blog name; it is nigh on impossible to visit your blog if I don't know who you are.

Taking out compacted and overgrown herbaceous perennials, freeing them from thick mats of weeds, split them, then replacing the soil, adding fertiliser and water retentive material like vermiculite, perlite or garden compost. Only hardy perennials have gone back into the pots, anything tender will have to wait until mid May. Rarely, if ever, do I manage to wait that long; I usually start half way through April, hoping for the best; I have lost many a choice specimen due to my impatience.I've been rather foolish, twice, in fact. I did some push ups (against a large chest of drawers, not the floor) and forgot to warm up first, another sign of my pig headed impatience. Naturally, I injured my shoulder.

I scroll youtube a lot on rainy days like today and sometimes get stuck on those 'recognise yourself' sites which pretend to help you find deep insights into your psyche. \"5 Signs You've Been Emotionally Neglected In Childhood\". Okay, let's see. I said it was raining, so no chance of going out and doing something worthwhile.Emotionally neglected in childhood, yes, that's me. All 5 signs present and correct. When I finished, my first thought was: \"the poor blighters didn't have the first idea themselves. How would they have known how to be emotionally available?\"My next thought was: \"Hm, did I pass that on, maybe? Is that why?\" Maybe. But there is nothing I can do about it now. And there comes a time when we must grow up and take responsibility for our lives ourselves.There is a reason for this long introduction.A couple of times a months I meet with a group of people for German Conversation. Not long ago a lady rang our group and asked if she could bring her Dad to a meeting. She said he had been a soldier in the British Army in Germany and had learned to speak almost fluent German. She warned us that he was very forgetful now, but she hoped that people speaking German would trigger his knowledge of the language and stimulate him. Of course, we said, bring him along.It turned out that he was far gone into dementia. Not only did he not understand what we were saying in German, it became quite obvious that even an English conversation was beyond him. His poor daughter was distraught. \"Oh, we are having a bad day today\", she kept saying. \"You were so much brighter yesterday.\" Throughout, she was calm and caring, constantly addressing him, in English, making remarks, asking did he understand, did he remember, while we in the group did our best to include him and her, in English, but with no real sense of penetrating the fog in his head.And that's where the Kind and Loving Heart came in. This lady was the warmest, most patient, most loving daughter I have ever seen, totally focussed on her Dad, sitting close to him, calming and comforting him the whole time. The most shocking thing was that she herself was seriously disabled, suffering from a debilitating and progressive disease which would inexorably lead to her complete disablement and early death. She was entirely dependant on crutches. At first I thought she might have broken a leg or something, but no, she smiled sweetly and almost apologised for her physical condition.How many of us could bear this load? When I think how I complain now and have complained in the past about small and large misfortunes, I feel ashamed."},

I have been putting in a few hours of hard work in the garden, on my own, sadly.  Handsome Hunk works well, when he comes, that is. No matter how intensely I beg him to come at least every two or three weeks, all he says is \"I'll ring you\", and then doesn't. Wiry and Willing hasn't properly worked for weeks either, but he has an excuse. He has sciatica badly. He is seeing doctors and physios but nothing seems to work. He came last week but after an hour I sent him home. He looked bad and sat on an upturned bucket to rest his back and leg. He will come when he can, of that I am sure. HH will come too, I just don't know when.In the meantime it's down to me. I am still pruning and cutting back, there is little point in doing much else, this weekend there will be mild frost again. I can't say that I am totally happy with the hellebores and hyacinths in the first and third pictures. I find the colours rather garish. But I do love the gorgeous quince flowers. (Japanese quince or Chaenomeles) The whole wall is covered in them. If the frosts don't kill them I will have masses of shiny yellow quince in late summer. I no longer make quince jelly, it's far too much work and I don't eat much in the way of sweet jellies. The fruits are not to be eaten raw, they are potentially harmful, but boiling them takes many hours.I had great pleasure at the garden society last night. A delightful, very enthusiastic grower and gardener gave a talk on how to create a border with interest and appeal for the whole year. Whenever I watch garden programmes on the TV (some of you may have heard of Monty Don and Gardeners' World?), or visit a show garden, or attend a talk on garden design, I come over all itchy and raring to go. While I am sitting watching, I can do anything. In practice not so much. But until such time that it becomes impossible I will struggle on. Did I mention that I have agreed to open again at the end of June? The saints preserve us! Next week I am planning a visit to a nursery for a splurge on plants. Well, why not, I rarely treat myself to anything nowadays.I've also attended my first concert of the year. Excellent but very complicated music. I was exhausted from just listening. I hadn't realised it was a private performance, by invitation only. The concert was given in the barn of a friend (good acoustics), there was wine and nibbles beforehand and during the interval, and altogether it was quite an occasion. I was fully aware of the honour of being on the guest list in spite of having initially misread the invitation. I had thought there was something funny about it, no tickets to purchase! Still, I enjoyed the outing and behaved impeccably! The performers were doing it all again the next night, this time on a stage, with a ticket price. Afterwards, I thanked the cellist for inviting me and he let out that they were, in fact, using the barn performance as a kind of dress rehearsal and needed a knowledgeable audience to be present, with the feel of a proper performance. Ah well, gift horses spring to mind. But a pleasure and an honour all the same."},

I planned it like in the old days, a proper lunch, with a starter, main course and pudding. Simple fare, but much fancier than my solo lunches. So what happens? First one rings up to say she can't make it out of her front door and the other one rings to say she can't make it down the hill from her house into the village. Actually, they would probably not have made it down my drive from the road either. Even a  delivery man refused to drive his van up to the house, but rang to say the drive had disappeared. I KNOW that, silly man, so I suggested he could just carry the stuff up. \"Oh, but I am wearing ordinary shoes,\" he said, \"my feet and trousers will be soaked.\" I am afraid that I said, \"that's not very intelligent, you must have known about the snow on your delivery round.\" You'd think their depot would encourage them to carry suitable footwear for their rural deliveries, wouldn't you? Apparently not. I stayed heartless. His final feeble excuse was that, yes, he knew it had been snowing for 24 hours, but nothing like this in the town he came from. Pathetic.So, for the last two days and the next two, I am eating the vegetables I had defrosted for my lunch party, a mediterranean mixture of red and yellow peppers with courgettes, shallots, a carrot, celery sticks, sun dried tomatoes, lots of herbs and spices. I didn't want to risk refreezing the dish. Also, four individual portions of tender chicken thighs remained on the menu. Luckily, I could freeze the smoked salmon starter and the garlic bread to go with the main course. But the chocolate puddings still smile at me every time I open the fridge.

Come to think of that, I recently had a comment which asked me to contact them because they \"had had an interviewee who praised my blog\" many years ago. They did refer to an old blogpost, nothing recent, and would like to interview the person behind the blog.Is that at all likely or is it just a phishing expedition for nefarious purposes? My old friend is still with me, the one who has caught me many times  (he emails at least once a week ) accessing porn and would really like to be paid now for not spreading the tale. He still hasn't learned to spell properly. I assume it's a he, would a woman bother endlessly?In the garden it's pruning time mostly. Too cold still for dividing herbaceous clumps but pruning shrubs is ok provided I don't do it before frosty nights. There are a few signs of spring but much is still brown and dead looking. Handsome Hunk has been to clear the builders' rubble in the side corridor and repair the dry stone wall around the beds. I have paid him but I am going to take the bill to my neighbour; will they actually reimburse me? There are still plants to replace, they have shot up in price enormously, like foodstuffs and electricity.This is the ballerina tree in winter, looks dead, doesn't it? I will try to remember to show it again in a month's time when it should have started to colour up a bit with new buds.As far as gardening is concerned I am becoming aware that there are many jobs I can't really do easily now. Back to the old conundrum, do I move? But, I love my house and garden!  I really do! Last winter has been difficult. I have been lonelier than during the Covid winters and often thought how much easier it would be to live in the gorgeous town of Ludlow, just down the road twenty minutes' drive away. Oh, talking of driving, I have given my car to my son and daughter-in-law; well, not given, but handed over for a generous price. I have regretted it ever since, I may buy another car, there is no public transport here, taxis are very expensive and I can't constantly beg my friends to give me lifts.Talking of money, I have also updated my Will. It was necessary. According to my solicitor it should be done every two years or so. I am hoping to spend a fair chunk of the money myself, of course, skiing, = (spending the kids inheritance). When I think how little or not at all any of them have been interested in how I survived Covid on my own, it makes me quite angry. Am I oversharing? Too bad.However, things are looking up. The theatre visits will be resumed soon. More of that anon.There is something I would like to ask help with. Many blogs do not let me comment any more. Either not at all or only as anonymous, which means I have to remember to add my name at the end. I often don't.How do I overcome that? It's Google who says I need to adjust/reset/do something before they let me through again. What do I need to do? Any advice is appreciated. My gadgets are Apple."},
{"title": "New Hope", "date": "Saturday 4 February 2023", "text": "After a mild period where lots of brave little souls have pushed their first cautious heralds above ground we have now been promised another cold spell with night frosts. Ah well, we may all be looking forward to Spring here in the northern hemisphere but February and March are often the coldest months of the year around here. Still, aren't they pretty, my aconites and snowdrops?The pure gold of aconitesSnowdrops to gladden the heartI saw the GP about my night terrors. There is nothing much she can do, there are no easy medications which would see them off.  The subconscious will throw up all sorts of detritus from a long life which has most certainly had its shadows and dark sides, and still has. What she suggested I do is to see a counsellor if the terrors don't end. In the meantime, I am to calm my mind as much as possible before bed and try to discard anything, people, activities, thoughts, that endanger my equilibrium. She is quite right, of course, now, at the end of my years, I really do not need to accommodate the toxicity of unwanted intrusion by whatever, whomever, whenever. That includes people like Freda. I slowly came to understand over the last few weeks that people like Freda are bad for me and that I am under no obligation to put up with them.I went to a very interesting lecture and slide show on compost the other night. Yes, you read that right, a lecture on compost! Those who have read my burblings for some years may remember that I love compost and am quite a whizz at producing quantities of the stuff which then, with the help of the handsome hulk, get spread inches deep on my flower beds, there to await worms and other crawlies to pull the brown and crumbly treasure into the soil beneath. However, this is not really what I wanted to say. The lecturer was a German who had been a physician in civilian life (pre garden lecturing) and owns an ancient farmhouse with land attached to it, which he has turned, over 35 years, into a splendid show garden and woodland. During a break I asked what he thought of the UK, the dreaded Brexit and the political turmoil of the last few years and was he ever tempted to return to Germany. He smiled very nicely and calmly explained that he lives on his land, tends his garden, enjoys his labours and pays little attention to the machinations of the great and not-so-good. He said : \"I have my settled status, I have my garden, my hobbies and some good friends\". In other words, he lives in a comfortable bubble and cares little for the ills the great and not-so-good visit upon us. I too have my settled status (it means we can stay in the UK after Brexit), my garden, my books, a few good friends, what more is there?  And yet, I find it hard to turn my back on the world and ignore the state of it. Perhaps I must turn my attention more often back to my great love, poetry. Poetry to soothe the troubled spirit and calm the unhappy mind.This short poem by the Welsh poet Edward Thomas conveys a message of optimism about the approach of Spring:Over the land freckled with snow half-thawedThe speculating rooks at their nests cawedAnd saw from elm-tops, delicate as flower of grass,What we below could not see, Winter pass."},
{"title": "Night Terrors", "date": "Saturday 28 January 2023", "text": "I looked the term up, they are a thing. Maybe you knew? I didn't, until now.\"Night terrors are episodes of screaming, intense fear and flailing while still asleep. . . . . .Like sleepwalking, sleep terrors are considered a parasomnia — an undesired occurrence during sleep. A sleep terror episode usually lasts from seconds to a few minutes, but episodes may last longer. Causes are unknown but can be related to extreme tiredness, fever, stress or trauma.\" I am rarely extremely tired nowadays and haven't had a fever for years.For several years I have had nightmares, long, unpleasant dreams, which leave me breathing hard, heart pumping, but remembering the dream. I am usually trying to escape from some danger. Night terrors are different. I appear to wake myself up with a scream or shout, sometimes a speech. Several times lately I have been violent, for instance thumping my elbow into my own pillow and once fighting with the bedside lamp, knocking it over.  I must have won that fight but my hand was bruised afterwards. Once I was half out of bed, one foot on the floor, fighting the bed clothes. One of these days I will find myself on the floor, with no idea how I got there.I am the least violent person, I have actually been afraid of violence since childhood. I run away from people shouting at each other rather than towards them, my curiosity in such events is nil. I would say that emotional violence or aggression are not part of my nature either. I'd rather avoid any such turmoil.I have booked an appointment with my GP. I'll come back and tell you what she said. Am I going mad? Is it dementia? Or is it stress?Now for something entirely different, or maybe not.Let's invent a couple, let's call them Fred and Freda. You've got to know them better during the last two plus years, you have spoken on the phone more often and you have actually seen more of them during visits which have lasted from between two to three days. You've tried your best but have realised that you simply don't like Freda. You consider her to be a bossy, manipulating bully who is trying to bully you as she bullies her family. For Fred's sake you have put up with her, mostly walking on eggshells, keeping quiet. Obviously, you have not allowed her to bully you, which makes her stomp off in a huff.You like Fred although you can see that he is very much under Freda's thumb. There are other circumstances which make the relationship tricky. But although you are sometimes offended by their actions you put up with them, again, keeping quiet. You'd like to remain on reasonably good terms with Fred.WTF are you going to do? Did I mention stress earlier? The night terrors may have nothing to do with this relationship but the time line is similar. Coincidence? Possibly. yyyyyyyyyyyyyy"},

The end of 2022 was the time when I literally had sleepless nights for the thoughts percolating inside my skull. Poverty, war,  social and political disintegration, the health system collapsing, people debating what to go for, eating or heating. The homeless freezing in bitter cold, single mothers, pensioners, people on the minimum wage, resorting to food banks and, this winter, for the first time, to warm banks; working people taking on several jobs and still unable to make ends meet. And the rich getting richer all the time. Energy firms laughing in the face of our children's future, making heaps of money, crooks making millions out of Covid by supplying unusable PPE (personal protective equipment) and walking off with the cash, unhindered. I am spitting nails.The impulse when one has seen as much chaos and unkindness for so many years is to turn your back on it. Greed is everywhere, lending a helping hand or doing a kindness are concepts which appear to be getting lost in the general praise for taking care of number one.  I am one of those cowards who find coping with the state of the world ever harder, turning my back on it all easier and easier to do.That is wrong too, it makes me into just another 'me-me-me'. But what is there one individual can do? What can we do? Maybe kindness is the answer. Kindness to each other and kindness to our environment, our planet. If we think of kindness, the freedom to be our best selves may follow. That is my wish and personal resolution for 2023.I have been poorly and very lonely for most of December, I have still not quite recovered but things are looking up. It is probable my physical health has played a part in my emotional unhappiness but the despair at what I see and read day after day is no less real for that. I promise to be kinder in 2023, to myself and others."},
{"title": "This And That", "date": "Tuesday 29 November 2022", "text": "Considering that I reckon myself to be a keen gardener it is really quite astonishing that I should have forgotten to prune my roses, all 50+ of them, including shrub, bush, climbing, rambling and dog roses. I have made a start and pruned more than half of them over the past few days. I have the holes in my arms to prove it. Roses are pruned twice a year round here, once in autumn to stop the wind rocking and loosening the roots and once in early spring to encourage new growth. Sadly, there were quite a few buds and open flowers left, but I cut them all back ruthlessly. I haven't done so always but that means that the new season's growth is all topsy turvy and wrong. Pity. I do so love the last rose of summer, left blooming all alone, (as Nana Mouskouri used to sing). I often brought the last one into the house at Christmas.Several of you expressed an interest in what I called my ballerina tree (weeping pear); here it is with the golden leaves of autumn which are silver in spring and summer. The leaves are all off now and the thin silver branches which you can just make out are all that's left.Enough of gardening.I have started to go out to one or two of the social clubs again. Admittedly, I have to force myself, particularly now that it's dark by 4pm and often cold and windy and wet. Yes, the rains have come back with a vengeance. Mustn't grumble because the soil really needs it.People's habits have changed a great deal over the Covid years, I am not the only one who has become a recluse. When I drag myself out I usually enjoy the get togethers, I chat and show an interest with the best of them but, truth be told, there are very few people whose company I have seriously missed. Over the two years I have \"lost\" two formerly close-ish friends; one hasn't said why and the other believed I had criticised their Covid behaviour. Sad, but I'll get over it. So little touches me deeply nowadays there must be something wrong with me, something I inherited from my Dad, who also rarely felt the need to socialise; strangely, when he did, he was the life and soul of the party. People used to think of him as a jolly good fellow, which he really wasn't. Certainly not as far as company was concerned.Losing friends for rather trivial reasons means that the friendship wasn't all that solid anyway.I've had a couple of jobs done round the house and garden. The terrace has been relaid, and a bathroom  has been retiled. So much for moving! I emailed a friend today simply to restart post Covid relations. To my surprise I learned she and her husband want to downsize, they have sold their house and are in the process of getting rid of \"stuff\" prior to a move closer to family. Here's hoping that their family doesn't up sticks for a new job or something like that. It so often happens. Besides, the couple have many friends round here and will have to start from scratch in their mid 80s. People do the strangest things."},
{"title": "Books, Gardens, and a little Lesson in Humility", "date": "Monday 14 November 2022", "text": "I have only very recently discovered a new to me, very powerful, story teller: Elizabeth Strout.  \"Olive Kitteridge\" is a beautifully observed novel, each chapter introducing and later revisiting and fleshing out a set of characters, all interconnected, living in a small town in coastal Maine, New England. It took me a long time to accept the emotional pain and troubled lives Strout uncovers for the reader, but she is gentle and empathic at all times and her characters, though complicated and flawed, become likeable in spite of themselves. I am glad I persevered, I have already bought \"Olive Again\" and will certainly explore more of her books, which are quite famous in the UK now, since she won the Pulitzer Prize.I have been reading a lot of lightweight mysteries, as well as rubbishy novels which I've given up on (life's too short to let irritation take hold); lately I have felt that a better reading diet would do me good, so I've downloaded Anne Tyler, Penelope Lively, Rose Tremain, Maggie O'Farrell, Ali Smith, and a few others whose work I don't know yet; and for light relief, Nancy Mitford and P.G. Wodehouse. I have just counted the unread books on my Kindle, including non fiction, Travel, Myths, Nature and Poetry, there are 40 books in total. The unread books on my shelves come to a hundred or more; is it time I stopped buying new books?  Is it possibly an excuse that my Kindle books are all very cheap, under one £Sterling, all offers by clever booksellers and publishers to draw the unwise in? Winter is coming, it's too cold and wet to do much gardening, and I can most often be found curled up in a comfy chair with a book (or Kindle) in my hand. Talking of gardening: I haven't yet mentioned the Open Gardens on the last weekend of June. As always, visitors seemed to enjoy themselves. Saturday was cool and damp and windy and there were fewer than a hundred people all told.On Sunday the weather was glorious, warm and balmy, neither too hot nor too cold and crowds turned up.I sat on the sun terrace and had generously placed a few garden chairs around, there are always lots of people who have need of a sit down and many gardeners enjoy a natter about all things horticultural. As do I. There are also a few benches dotted about here and there and visitors are always welcome to make use of them.I had quite a number of enquiries this year about trees; I watched a group of people clearly wondering what sort of tree my elderly walnut tree was and seemed unwilling to accept my explanation - in a nice way and with much exclamation of surprise. Not many people nowadays have walnut trees in cottage gardens. Another couple was smitten with my weeping pear tree. I admit it is a rather splendid specimen, I hadn't cut its umbrella of thin, graceful ash grey branches and silver leaves at all this year. It looks like a ballerina in a wide hoop skirt about 2 ½  metres across. I too would admire it if I came across it in somebodies garden.I am glad that I decided to put myself through the effort and hard work; I freely admit quite an important reason for my decision was to show the world my \"suffering at the mean hands\" of my neighbours. (He actually turned up, the cheek of the man!) That's not all, of course, I like gardening and am quite proud of the result of my labours, as well as the positive feedback from visitors. Nearly everybody always praises my views; like I told the estate agent who came to value my house \"It's a location to die for\". Well, maybe not quite.There is something I learned from the Open Gardens too, something about a failing I know I have and have had forever: I am inclined to judge people by their appearance.There was this elderly couple, late 60s maybe, a little drab, even shabby looking, with the colour of people who work outdoors, gently strolling about. By and by they reached the sun terrace where I was sitting and stopped to chat about a plant or two, I forget which. I don't know how it happened - did they ask who tended the garden?, was I the only gardener?,  did I live alone? how did I cope? ; eventually, in the most unassuming manner, without in the least pushing themselves forward, they opened up and said that they had both been widowed and quite accidentally found each other and saved each other from the blight of loneliness. I was right to think that they lived on and off the land. She said \"he brought a flock of sheep into the union.\" They were quietly happy and contented, probably not very well off. I had the impression they had everything they needed. So there was I, sitting on my sun terrace, with a house behind me larger than one person needs and proudly showing off my garden to these people who have so much more than I have in my lonely existence. Me and my stupid middle class superiority, I have swallowed wholesale the idiotic English attitude that class matters. Time I remembered where I come from.  I have envied the little couple ever since."},

Soon we'll be saying \"we must have frost, otherwise the bugs won't die and the fruit trees and shrubs that need a touch of frost to fruit next year will stay barren.\" For now I am glad the heating can stay off. Radiators on for an hour in the evening is all that's needed at the moment to stay comfortably cosy.This tray of tomatoes is the end of them, There were more green ones than ripe ones, I'd left the whole lot on the table in the conservatory for more of them to turn red.  I could have made green tomato chutney or fried green tomatoes, but turning the red ones into soup was already enough work for just two bowls of it. These are called Gardener's Delight and although the plants are very prolific producers the tomatoes are quite watery, not worth hours simmering down to a pulp. The soup was tasty and it felt good to be eating something entirely down to me, but that's where the pat on the back ended. Anyway, the compost heap is grateful for any offerings. Il Gatto had to come in too. We've had him for years; I fell in love with him in the art department of a London Department store and had to have him although it took many months for the Italian artist to produce him and ship him to the UK. In winter Il Gatto stays indoors, I am not sure that he is totally frost hardy.A last look over to the hills and time to go in. Tools can stay out until tomorrow. The rays of the late afternoon sun turn the tips of trees, shrubs, spiky herbaceous plants and the fields the opposite side of the valley golden. There is a nip in the air and it's been a good days work outside. Time for a rest and a mug of something hot, possibly even a chocolate biscuit to tide me over until supper time."},

But Griddy was trapped, the ladder out had rotted and he was very lucky that the girls saw him and had the sense to get in touch with the Hedgehog Preservation Society.In spite of their ferocious appearance hedgehogs are really quite delicate. Had the girls not rescued him he could have died from hypothermia, dehydration, starvation, or a combination of all three. After 48 hours on a heat pad, warming up and resting, he was eating well and putting on much needed weight before returning to the wild. In the meantime, local craftsmen have installed a new ladder in the cattlegrid. In future there is a way out for any creature that falls into it.The local representatives of the Hedgehog Preservation Society kept me informed of developments and when Griddy was ready for the great outdoors again, they came to me and asked if I would have him to be released. I was gratified to hear that they could think of no better place for a hedgehog than my garden and the surrounding banks, overgrown with brambles, shrubs, hedges and furnished with piles of wood and plenty of hiding places for such a shy creature. I know he is still here, he leaves me signs in the form of black hedgehog poo, although he has possibly started to furnish himself a winter den for hibernation. The weather is still rather warm and I hope he is eating as many slugs as he can find before he withdraws. Any food I leave out is usually gone in the morning, I sincerely hope it's not the marauding cats who eat it."},
{"title": "Autumn in the Garden", "date": "Sunday 16 October 2022", "text": "In spite of the month being October there are still areas of wonderful displays. The hedge is full of berries and hips; does that mean we are going to have a hard winter?  Some say so, but I am not sure; our winters have been rather mild in recent years. The hedges are magnificent, wildly overgrown and full of life. I love it that all kinds of creatures have taken up residence. I am providing them with water in large shallow trays; It's such a pleasure to watch  birds by day taking a bath and surprise hedgehogs coming for a drink at dusk. Soon the latter will take up cosy winter quarters in wood and leaf piles which I have deliberately left in various nooks and crannies. The more birds, frogs, toads, and hedgehogs I encourage to eat slugs the better pleased I am during the summer. And if the foxes come and eat that rat of the sky, the pigeon, I don't mind either. They leave the coloured doves alone, these are too fast for predators.The next three pictures are showing part of the drive. It's a difficult area to cultivate because there  are several trees and the ground is shaded and dry. I think various kinds of conifers might be suitable, I am busy studying Pinterest ideas. Algorithms can be quite handy, Pinterest obviously knows what takes my clicking fancy. Maybe a visit to a plant nursery is in the offing during autumn when the time is right to plant plants shrubs and trees.I don't know why I have so many cyclamen everywhere, perhaps the birds helpplant the seeds.Last year I planted a weeping cedar along the drive,it's doing quite well. There's a Mediterranean  pencil pine under the ash tree,in a year or two it will add a few inches and become more of a picture.For now the normally boring ash tree itself and its butter yellow autumn leavesdraw the eye. I am glad that I have recovered my gardening mojo, the opening in the summer was a great success; several hundred people came to visit during the last weekend of June. ( More of that some other time). The back garden was the showstopper then, the drive borders on the front of house, which are quite spectacular now, less so. You can't have everything."},
{"title": "Sunday with Hildegard of Bingen (1098 - 1179)", "date": "Sunday 9 October 2022", "text": "my ornamental Japanese cherry tree in full autumnal splendour This morning I woke up a little subdued - I don't want to make my mood sound darker than that; subdued is a good enough word for now. I have been very aware of the days getting shorter, the nights drawing in and leaves turning colour prior to tumbling off the trees. Loneliness is so much worse in winter. Time to beware of the black dog.So, what to do to make today, Sunday, a little special? It is all too easy for me to let one day run into another without any marker, and time at this time of life speeds up and before you know it, another month has passed. Let's start with breakfast, maybe a couple of slices of fruit bread and marmalade? Some ham and a sliver of mature Welsh cheddar? During the week I eat muesli and stewed fruit and nothing else; it's quick and easy and fairly healthy because of the dried fruits, nuts and seeds that I add myself.  And how about a large mug of fennel tea to wash it down. The main thing is to eat consciously, taste every bite and savour the hot drink going into my stomach. And while I am eating breakfast I have chosen to be accompanied by Hildegard of Bingen's heavenly sounds. Instead of almost deliberately depressing myself - I know what happens when I read the daily news reports - why not refresh my knowledge of this early medieval polymath, visionary, composer, writer, poet, botanist, philosopher, medical writer and practitioner and abbess of two convents, which she founded. Hildegard was born into the Rhenish aristocracy in 1098, she spent the remainder of her eighty years as a nun.Hildegard von Bingen. Line engraving by W. MarshallHildegard became very powerful in a male dominated Church. She prevailed against various abbots and bishops and even attracted the attention of the pope in Rome who gave her permission to record her visions. She completed her great musico-poetic work around the year 1150. Seventy-seven songs and a music drama are extant today, more than of any other single medieval composer. When the mood takes me I will happily spend an hour in her company.Hildegard was not universally popular in her time, powerful women were not then and are not now. Nothing much changes. It is said that her nuns, all noble ladies, wore jewellery and extravagant headdresses, and pursued an active life of the mind - without spending too much time in hair shirts, or on bread and water in freezing cells. (I made that last bit up.)In spite of a lifetime of poor health Hildegard had a vast output of work. She has become important in our time for many reasons. The Feminist movement has embraced her and her ideas on holistic natural healing have been incorporated into the New Age canon.On Oct. 7, 873 years after her death, the Vatican finally gave her the highest recognition for her considerable achievements. She was elevated to Doctor of the Church, a rare and solemn title reserved for theologians who have significantly impacted Church doctrine. There are 34 Doctors of the Church, and only four are women (Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Ávila, Thérèse of Lisieux and now, finally, Hildegard von Bingen).I admire her but most of all I like to listen to her music. Nothing can soothe the anxious spirit like her music can. for today the black dog is banished."},
{"title": "Neanderthals", "date": "Tuesday 4 October 2022", "text": "I read today that \"The Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to Sweden's Svante Paabo for his work on human evolution.\"Neanderthals and, to a lesser extent Denisovans, have been in scientific news for a year or more. There are fewer finds of Denisovan material, hence less is known about them, although they definitely existed as hominin ancestor of Homo sapiens, the modern humans, i.e. us. (The first traces of Denisovans were found at Denisova Cave in Siberia in 2010. Fossilized teeth from Denisovans were later discovered in the same cave. Two upper and one lower molar were found in sediments that were dated to between 195,000 and 52,000 years ago)Ever since I was taken to the cave in the Neander Valley in Germany as a young teenager I have been fascinated with human evolution. It was a study visit arranged by the school. This visit was a long time ago, the whole class was taken on 'retreat', a kind of religious meditation and a rite of passage between childhood and emergence as young women. That my main 'take-away' from this three day outing would be seeding the first doubts in my mind that maybe the theologians at my school were not 100% the font of all wisdom was probably not the intention, although I have to stress that our religious teachers were not creationists. We had science lessons too, physics and chemistry as well as pre-history and history. Modern science has advanced in huge leaps since the days in 1856 when the skeleton of homo neanderthalensis *1 was first discovered. The Neander Valley was originally a limestone river canyon with rugged scenery, waterfalls and caves. Large scale quarrying changed the shape of the valley dramatically. During quarrying works the bones of the original Neanderthal man were found in a cave called Kleine Feldhofer Grotte, which is the cave we were taken to on a visit during the retreat; perhaps the school needed to imbue us with scientific zest as well as religious zest. Sadly, neither the cave nor the cliff where the bones were located still exists. Still, perhaps the destruction of the valley was not altogether a bad thing, without the quarrying operations the bones of Neanderthal *1 would not have been discovered. Since then many more traces have been found not only in the Neander Valley but in many other places all over southern, central and eastern Europe, 400 separate Neanderthals so far.Paleontologists and geneticists have established that Neanderthals lived between 130 000 and 40 000 years ago; they coincided and bred with Homo Sapiens between 2600 and 5400 years ago, before they disappeared as separate hominids. One of the recent discoveries is that between 1 - 4% of modern human DNA comes from our Neanderthal relatives. And it turns out that Homo sapiens bred with Denisovans too: in parts of South East Asia up to 6% of people's DNA is Denisovan.Fascinating stuff. Perhaps the Neanderthals really were the knuckle dragging, grunting, sub humans that we imagine when we now call certain types of man \"neanderthal\". It is somewhat unlikely though, because these early relatives of ours left art behind, in the form of cave paintings. They also lived on earth for far longer than Homo sapiens before they finally became extinct. No doubt paleogeneticists will find out much more about them as methods of scientific exploration continue to develop.As for my visit to the cave in the valley of the Dussel in North Rhine Westphalia I remember only how very disappointed I was. We had been told that we were to be present in a place where the ancestors of early humans had lived and, being an imaginative soul, I envisaged visible and detailed traces, with maybe the odd domestic arrangement preserved for me to marvel over. There was nothing, just a cave in bare rock, without even the obligatory fire pit. They do it so much better in films."},

I have never watched so much daytime TV in all my life. And I'm not even a royalist. Neither royalist nor republican, just someone who is, in spite of herself, fascinated by the seamless perfection of the colourful spectacle, the matchless uniforms and splendid head dress of diverse Royal Armed Forces, some regiments, aristocratic Royal servants and court dignitary offices centuries old, with names to fit the archaic origins. It is coming up to three o'clock in the afternoon on Monday 19th and there is now only the actual committal service and interment to go. We are being told that this occasion will be far more modest and private than the huge service in Westminster Abbey, where the great and good of the world were in attendance, wonderful music was being sung and played and ladies displayed splendidly exotic black hats. Church dignitaries, equally resplendently dressed, preached and eulogised and praised, mourned and prayed and told us all to be as good and kind, noble and god-fearing as the late queen had been.For these eleven days commentators have repeated themselves over and over again, rehearsing the same phrases, vying with each other to find something new to say, to dig up the most telling character trait of the queen; interviewees have repeated the same anecdotes, and queues to walk past the coffin during its time of lying-in-state have grown and grown. And the phrase \"paying their respects\" was used by all and sundry, from on high to down low. Some of the people  in the queues appeared to be full of excitement at being present on this momentous occasion, some no doubt projected their own grief at personal losses during the period of covid when they couldn't properly mourn their loved ones, and others were there to say they hd been there, the kind who would attend anything from the opening of an envelope to a state funeral.  Last Thursday, after the Palace had told us that the queen was gravely ill, the first five hours until her death was confirmed, commentators were almost grotesque in filling the resultant void of news with guesswork. They couldn't start praising the monarch and neither could they give any definite information. So they waffled on and on, repeating each statement \"for the benefit of those who have just joined us\" time and time again. It was quite painful to watch. In the end I switched off and therefore missed the announcement. And from then on it was wall-to-wall overhead drone footage of the journeys the queen's coffin took from Balmoral, where she died, to the various stages on the way to Edinburgh. Then followed various stops in London, from Buckingham Palace to the Great Hall at Westminster, to Westminster Abbey, all of them accompanied by the same sombre tones of endless commentary. If there is anybody in this country who is still crying over her death, they show remarkable staying power. Apart from the family, of course, who have shown themselves in a very good light, united and dignified, in spite of what the tabloids say about some of the family's members, Camilla and Meghan provoking the most hate speech in media and press.Heavens, when I started this post an hour ago the Windsor Palace bit had only just started; guess what? they are still marching to the same Beethoven Funeral Marches, a whole hour later! The TV is on in the background. The procession is now finally inside the walls of the castle where the public is no longer welcome. But TV is.So, now the UK has a new King. I met him once at a Royal Garden Party when we were lucky to have been singled out for a brief conversation with the then Prince of Wales; this was a long time ago, in the days when Diana was still around and Camilla no more than a tear of regret in Charles' eye. My daughter and I rather monopolised the conversation with Prince Charles who had really been wanting to meet my Beloved in his capacity as a musician at the Royal Opera House. Charles was nice and friendly and approachable, but nothing compared to Diana, who was joking and laughing with the people she had been delegated to meet.Finally, the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor has started. And so ends an era. What history has to say we will find out in due time."},
{"title": "Things on my Mind.", "date": "Monday 5 September 2022", "text": "When I finally rolled out of bed this morning, a little later than normally because I had no plans at all for today, and filled the kettle for a cup of tea I looked at the smart meter which sits right by the breakfast counter. At first I thought it had gone wrong, perhaps it was broken? But no, everything else looked fine and I had to believe the rather alarming figure the meter showed. By midday, the total consumption for the day so far, without using any electricity except that first cup of tea and things like fridge and freezer, clocks and other stand-byes, had reached the charge that even last week would be my total cost for an ordinary day without laundry, vacuum cleaning or other heavy uses of electricity. Twice the cost already and in October energy prices are increasing by another 80%! And again in January. There are people in this country whose income is less than the cost of their energy. How are they going to manage? It's utterly frightening. And winter's just around the corner.At the same time there are \"preppers\", millionaires and billionaires, I read this morning, who are discussing among themselves and with consultants, how best to organise life in underground bunkers come the inevitable collapse of society, for whatever reason. Climate change, mass migration, nuclear winter, a plague worse than Covid, you name it, they are preparing for it. Or so they think. Several of them have already retained small armies to defend their underground fortresses. When it's all over and they crawl back into whatever light of day there still is, do they think that their money will see them through? Money will be worthless in a post-apocalyptic world and they themselves will be surplus to requirements. Strikes me that only skilled people will survive, bakers, gardeners, engineers, etc. and any Navy Seal who knows the whereabouts of the preppers' food and water stores will make damn sure they will get their share of it, by whatever means.For those of you who say 'don't believe everything you read' this very long and reputable article named names, quoted sources and was signed off by a 'consultant' who had been hired to advise the tech titans.Some of you have asked \"is the shroud + scaffolding gone?\" No it isn't, and not likely to for some time, the very least until the end of October. As if I weren't miserable enough yet. I have cut small holes and gaps into the shroud, but I will soon be cutting larger windows. I have asked my solicitor to explore if I can have compensation. If only it weren't so expensive to involve legal experts like solicitors and judges.On a lighter note: I watched the 1940 film of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' with Greer Garson, Maureen O'Sullivan and Laurence Olivier on TV at the weekend. (Do those names mean anything to people nowadays other than to such as me at my advanced age?) I have seen many newer versions on the BBC, some very recent, and I have to admit that the MGM 1940s version was a bit of a letdown. Large chunks of plot were left out, the women wore clothes from different eras, Regency customs were mercilessly adulterated, and the characters hardly developed from beginning to end of the film. Jane Austen's old dragon Lady Catherine de Burgh was turned into a fond aunt, I ask you. Mr. Darcy did not rise from the lake in his frilly shirt as Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy did in the 1995 version, much the best in my opinion of all the many adaptations. And then best news of all: it's finally raining!"},
{"title": "Guns in America", "date": "Tuesday 23 August 2022", "text": "I had never heard of gun buyback events until I read about it during one of my idle news scrollings. So, you live in the US, could do with a little money top up; what to do? Swap one your old guns for $150, that's what.The queue of cars was long, the drivers waving every kind of gun about. Not that I would know the difference between a hacksaw and a handgun but even I could see that these were dangerous weapons.Drivers were being interviewed, the common denominator was that none of them saw any harm in them or their possession. From handguns to assault rifles, they were fine with all of them.The comment which brought me up short was: \"I like guns, if I counted them I'd say I have about thirty back home. To me guns mean freedom. We have freedom in America and we don't let anyone take that away from us. In fact, what I'm probably going to do is turn this one in, get my $150 and buy one for my son whose birthday is coming up. He wants one for his birthday.\" The boy, no more than maybe 11 or 12 years old, was sitting right next to him, sheepishly staring out of the window straight ahead.One old fellow trotted out the usual explanation: \"Guns don't kill people, it's people who kill people. Guns are good. Bad guys are bad guys.\"Only one middle aged woman in the whole of that long chain of cars seemed to be neutral, neither for nor against. I have this gun - she showed the camera a small handgun - I have never used it and never will; I don't need it. But I need $150.\" In the UK the police have the occasional \"handing-in knives-event.  But you don't get paid;  here, carrying a knife is illegal, - unless you can prove it is carried for a good reason -  and the access the public have to guns is very tightly controlled by law.  There is less gun crime in the UK than anywhere else in the world."},

The only door wide open is the kitchen door, mainly to aid the heat from the ever-on Aga to escape. England is sweltering. There are two more days of extreme heat forecast before thunderstorms are predicted. All heat waves in England end in thunderstorms, we desperately need rain. This is all so very un-English; very few houses in the country have AC, up to now you are more likely to need functioning insulation to keep your house sheltered from the winter cold, also normally a moderate affair, Moderate temperatures is what the weather amounts to here, winter and summer, with rain more often than not. Not any longer.Climate change is here. Many parts of the world suffer far worse than we do. Because I keep the windows wide open during the night and early morning and then march through the rooms sealing everything hermetically, it is bearably cool. I cannot imagine what people in small flats without easy access to greenery have to live with. Just like it was during lockdown, unimaginable. The weather has captured the main part of the news. The elderly are warned to stay hydrated, keep out of the sun, work as little as we can get away with, forget about BBQs because of fire danger. There is this panic in the air, as if heat is an enemy threatening our very existence.As if we didn't have enough to contend with; after Covid - which is still rampant and predicted to be worse during winter - came Ukraine. The Russians are occupying the biggest nuclear power station in Europe which happens to be in Ukraine. Shelling and bombardment put the plant at risk and we are back to the fear of a nuclear holocaust in Europe. Want more? How about the energy crisis? Millions of people  in the UK face energy poverty. Eat or heat, that is the question. How do you tell your children that you cannot afford to keep them fed as well as warm? Energy bills have doubled this year and will again from October and then again increase in January. Add to that increased food bills, crops dying in fields and shortages on supermarket shelves, hosepipe bans and water shortages.But there is always the government to make things better, isn't there? Oops, the Tories are shredding themselves and each other in a farcical fight to 'appoint' a new prime minister, after having finally got rid of the utterly incompetent and endless liar Johnson. So no help there, I'm afraid. 160.000 mostly white, mostly old, mostly middle-class members of the Tory party are about to decide this country's fate.I have always felt that politics have no place in this blog, although nobody can possibly have got the impression that I am right wing. If I am to continue writing here then politics may come into it now and then.So, some of you have asked, what happened, why have I gone awol? Thank you for your concern but I needed to withdraw for all sorts of reasons.  I have not been ill, nor more than usually depressed; all the same, I've missed writing. Maybe I'll catch up now."},
{"title": "Decisions, Decisions........", "date": "Saturday 9 April 2022", "text": "my favourite Japanese Acer hidden under the shroud.space - you need more?Now that my desktop is back  I can finally get back to boring the pants off you. What fun. Why you keep on reading this drivel is a mystery to me.For the past several weeks I have been in a state of permanent confusion. \"What am I going to do, am I leaving, am I staying, what is best?\" has been the refrain accompanying my days and sometimes nights. Nothing very dreadful has happened, but there are times when it seems that you have to make changes to your life; at the same time it is difficult to come to a decision that is both suitable and sensible.It started with one of next door's scaffolders. \"Lovely house you got here\", he said, \"must surely be worth a bit.\" The last time I had the house valued was more than five years ago, since then house prices have risen sharply and it is said that many town dwellers have seen the error of their ways during Covid and want to change to a calmer, greener pace of living. Working from home has made it possible and space and fresh air is now something to aspire to. more space, if you want to go exploring Space and fresh air I have aplenty, I needed an estate agent (realtor) to put a price on it. A smartly dressed man turned up in a largish gas guzzler with a bundle of glossy, colourful brochures under his arm. The brochures were specialist ones in their range of 'Fine and Country' properties, nothing commonplace and everyday for a property I had described to him on the phone as \"with a location to die for\". I wasn't even exaggerating, who else can say they live right next to an English Heritage castle ruin with three gates directly into its grounds? Estate agents in the UK have three requirements for properties out of the ordinary: location, location, location. 'my castle'The agent came up with an astonishing estimate, three times the price we had paid 23 years ago. The country housing market is in a fix, too many people chasing too few houses; that meant that the agent more or less begged me to put my house on the market NOW. With his firm. Quite innocently I mentioned that I had nowhere to go and that I'd have to dispose of lots of contents first. Oh yes, they'd be able to help all along the way, finding me somewhere to live and auctioning off my goods and surplus chattels. They do indeed have an auction house as part of their set-up, a reputable one (in case you are warning me off).After quite some time and a long chat I finally managed to get him to the door without committing myself in any way. Since then I've been deliberating along these lines:First and foremost: I like my house. It's large and so is the garden, but it is also convenient and comfortable. I know the village, my friends live here. I can afford modest help around house and garden and if (not when) I get too infirm to go upstairs I have a shower room downstairs and can turn my study into a bedroom. On the other hand, house and garden are too large for one elderly lady. I am a little isolated from the village and nobody ever comes all the way up the drive just on the off chance. Isolation means utter peace and quiet, and endless green space and fresh air around me. And then there's the neighbour and his shroud which is actually damaging a part of my garden for which they may not be willing to compensate me, in spite of having undertaken to do so officially. However, everything passes, as will the shroud.the shroud along one side of my garden wall.under it is their barn, their house is further away.Then there's the money. I'd want to downsize of course, and although I'd have to pay a fair chunk for a new house I might have a (smaller) chunk of cash over. But, is that such a good idea? In the UK interest rates are minimal, inflation is high, property is the only valuable asset to have, unless you are rich, of course. I'm not.All things considered, I think selling up and leaving my little haven now would be a bit silly. As I said, I like my house. I'll never find another location to equal it. When the time comes I will probably move into a retirement apartment, there is quite a choice in my county town and rather than move twice, once into a smaller house with garden now and later into a retirement apartment when living on my own becomes more difficult would surely use up more energy, nerves, stress as well as cash than is sensible..the flower bed hidden under the shroudI may be elderly (OK, I am) but mostly I forget about it. Unless admitting to my elderly status comes in useful, which it does, at times, particularly when I need physical assistance. Many elderly people start the gradual process of reorganising their last years much sooner than me and maybe I am being foolish. But, while I can, I would like to continue enjoying my garden in particular, for a little while longer.Sorry, Mr. Estate Agent, but not just yet. Maybe next year, maybe never. I am not ready to discard my hand trowel for good.PS: apart from the shroud picture all others were taken at different seasons.It's a bit early for such splendour."},

{"title": "Old Ladies", "date": "Thursday 3 March 2022", "text": "Just now I finished a phone call with a very old lady friend. Old in years, not so much old in friend years. One of these sweet old dears who rarely, if ever, have a bad word to say about anyone, gentle and mild, a white halo for hair, small in size, frail and delicate. Articulate, educated, well-mannered, a lady. Sometimes I have wished that she might drop the sweetness, even if just by accident and join the rough, crude, occasionally cross and sweary world I inhabit.We got talking about Putin and the invasion of Ukraine. Is there anyone cognisant who doesn't? I said I want him dead, shot, eliminated.\"Shot?\", she said. \"Shooting is too good for him, I want him hung, drawn and quartered\", she thundered, \"I want him torn limb from limb\". To my great delight the old lady was spitting nails. Obviously, I agree with her and told her so and it gives me hope that old does not automatically have to equate to lacking spirit.Life is slowly, in minute increments, resuming pace. A well attended garden club meets monthly again in a village hall a twenty minute drive away. When I heard that two ladies (yes, oldish) from my neck of the woods were on the committee and would therefore go I asked for a lift. The driver very kindly agreed. These meetings take the form of a paid speaker giving an illustrated talk on their subject of choice with open questions at the end. I have in the past attended many such meetings elsewhere and enjoyed them and sometimes I didn't.What is wrong with non-professional speakers? You'd think that, as they get paid, they'd get the basics right. The speaker that evening started by getting her microphone upside down, she then sat with her back to the audience staring down at her laptop, and mumbled her way through a very uninspiring talk with few and mainly boring photographs presented on the screen. How many beds of snowdrops can you take, how many pictures of men at work and heaps of earth waiting to be turned into flower beds? And finishing off with a picture of more old ladies crowding the cake counter in the cafeteria of the garden she was supposed to delight us with simply made me even more cross. All this and when you go to the rather famous garden's website you get some beautiful vistas.As I had been given a lift by two friends active in the club I thought I'd better not say anything on the way home. Imagine how pleased I was when one of them said that the evening had been a waste of time, the speaker quite poor and not to be invited again. One of them asked the other if they should not point out to potential speakers that they should face the audience and speak clearly. \"Not really,\" the other one said, \"they might be offended\". Such very good old lady manners, spend a boring evening rather than give offence.The entire audience consisted of nice old ladies with just a sprinkling of old gentlemen. I didn't see anyone above middle height, under 65, and with any colour hair other than grey. I have a friend who says I am incredibly negative; she's right, of course. I must learn to stop being so judgemental and keep shtum, unless I find genuine cause for praise. I have my doubts, however, that I will succeed.I have mentioned the German Conversation group before, well, we have commenced face-to-face meetings again; we are slowly working our way through \"Die Deutsche Seele\" (the German Soul) a many-paged book with essays on such German terms as Fussball, German Angst, Bauhaus, Wanderlust, all the way from A through to Z. Alternatively, we watch DVDs on German history, starting with the 9th Century and ending with the Weimar Republic, a thousand years later. That should keep us old ladies busy for some time to come.All in all, life is picking up."},
{"title": "Thoughts and What Have Yous", "date": "Saturday 19 February 2022", "text": "Still reading old diaries off and on; more off than on now because my trials and tribulations of long ago follow me into unquiet dreams as well as causing me embarrassment at reminding myself what an unhappy idiot I was, endlessly regurgitating, in great detail, all the reasons why I should have brought that period in my life to an end but never quite having the courage to do so. There were times, there still are, when concentrating very hard I can find myself not altogether unintelligent. Maybe I just wasn't concentrating hard enough.However, it was all a long time ago. The entry which made me exclaim that nothing ever changes is from the days between Christmas and New Year 1980/81 and runs as follows:\"I'm reading JB Priestley's 'Festival at Farbridge' and some of Louisa Casey's (a character in the novel) reading of the state of people's minds really resonates with me. She says \"what's wrong... is just that we don't feel enough. There isn't enough richness and joy and glory in our lives. We're all living this flat sort of existence... if you were glad, you'd light up. Hardly anybody does. How much gladness is there about? Life ought to be wonderful...  instead mountains of misery ... Even all their betting and boozing and sex are dreary, just another kind of routine.\"Well, it resonated with me then and it resonates with me now. Priestley's character speaks about the 1950s. Has much changed? I don't think so. Sure, we can blame a lot on the pandemic, even so, it's been a long time since I saw anybody light up. Me included. Is it age which turns the world grey?  What causes us to light up? Falling in love? Winning the lottery? How do we get 'enough richness and joy and glory' into our lives? How do we enjoy ourselves during a period of mingled unhappiness, anxiety and boredom?I seem to have devoted much of my life to wishful thinking. It was Ellery Queen of all people (yes, yes, I know it's not a real name) who said \"No-one outside the realm of fairy tales ever scaled a mountain by standing at its foot and wishing himself over its crest. This is a hard world, and in it achievement requires effort.\"Not bad for a whodunnit and how true - wish I could get that bit into my head and live up to it.This post incorporates a question I have asked in some form or other many times before; I suppose I have reached the age when one doesn’t realise how often one says the same thing and doesn’t really care. One of the many compensations of growing older.So, anyone, how do we get the joy back into our lives? What works for you?"},
{"title": "What to do?", "date": "Monday 14 February 2022", "text": "I've been struggling, the black dog came down for a visit and, as always when that happens, I felt unable to blog. You all appear so positive, upbeat, competent, even-minded in the posts I read that it's almost embarrassing to admit to my failings. I blame Covid and the solitude caused by Covid.I've been having poor sleep as well, many hours of wakefulness when the thought carousel whirls and twirls; in the end I give up and go downstairs to the warm kitchen, pour a glass of sherry, have some crackers, read a bit and am shocked when I realise that it's almost morning and sleep has once again been unattainable. Naturally, that leaves me even more depressed and tired.Last night was a bit better. What a difference a few hours of sleep makes. I wrote the above very late on Sunday evening, still feeling a tad sorry for myself but having sent the black dog into kennels for a while. So, what to do indeed.First of all, when I got up, even before making breakfast, I rooted around in the music cabinet ( no longer holding sheet music since Beloved died) for some mood changers. In the olden days, when we still listened to radios back in the old country, Mum always had Sunday morning concerts on. So music was the first go-to, some CDs from the classical collections, a Beethoven symphony (Pastoral) on full volume. Music is magic, Beethoven helped right away. Toasted sweet fruit bread, tea, a sliver of well aged cheese, marmalade, and my inner woman was quieted. Roasted duck breast (a repetition of Christmas dinner) and a tasty lentils mess for a late lunch, followed by a long phone call with my son, both of us opening up about aspects of our lives which are not entirely pleasing, helped things along nicely. A walk in the garden next; looking closely with open eyes, I found a few welcome friends, much too early some of them. In spite of a mostly grey day I was cheered by aconites and hellebores in the woodland garden,and snowdrops everywhere else, carpets of them. Ditto cyclamen.I've taken and posted so many pictures of all three of them in the past I don't want to bore readers of this blog by posting yet more.In the evening I finished off Frederik Backman's \"My Grandmother Sends Her Regards and....\" . I have enjoyed his humorous yet slightly bizarre writing (if you've read \"A Man Called Ove\" you'll know what I mean: depth and comedy at the same time. Backman is definitely one of my recently discovered favourites for a rainy afternoon.A couple of documentaries on the BBC came next: the delightful and evocative \"Wonders of the Celtic Deep\". about animals and birds (are birds animals? Hm, yes, they must be) on the Pembrokeshire coast of Wales, the nearest stretch of ocean to Shropshire, and then, deeply disturbing, the beginning of a Paul Theroux series called Forbidden America about the impact of social media on US society; he begins the series by meeting the new online influencers of the far right. As faaaar right as can be, deeply frightening, in fact. Normally, I avoid such programmes. A pity that I should end the day on such a distressing topic. Maybe not the best idea after a few weeks of the black dog.However, he has stayed away today too in spite of the scaffolding having gone up next door. No doubt I'll be woken by the noise of metal on metal tomorrow morning."},
{"title": "A Miscellany of Housekeeping", "date": "Sunday 23 January 2022", "text": "Just when I feel I have rediscovered my blogging mojo my internet connection gets dodgy. Three times in the last week my connection failed and I have spent many hours waiting for my IP to respond to phone calls; if I have to listen once more to the tinkling muzak while they keep me on hold, constantly reminding me that it would be so much easier if I just went online to FAQ, I shall do them an injury. I must make sure that I get a post out before the connection fails again.There is a development in the dispute with the neighbour; after much to-ing and fro-ing, and at great cost, we have reached an agreement. I am giving permission for the barn to be repaired and for three months they can erect scaffolding on my land, provided they arrange for the scaffolding to leave me full access to  the passage between the front and back of my house, they replace any plants they damage to a comparable standard, make good any disturbance on my land, and they do not extend the time limit;  furthermore, my permission is valid only for the barn's back wall acc. to the \"meaning of the act\" (legalese); I am not obliged to grant permission for rebuilding any other side or the interior. Some success, I suppose. Blogging mojo is not the only mojo I have rediscovered, after several years of the garden receding into the background of my life I am feeling the urge to get back out and create a place of peace, beauty and solace, culminating in opening again in the summer when the village gardens display their charms to visitors, once covid restrictions are over. We'll see. It's easy to plan an active gardening life from the comfort of my cosy study, but it might not feel quite so urgent when the work outside starts. In the cold of early spring at that. However, gardening is good for body, soul and spirit.Opening the garden might have a further benefit: mild revenge on my neighbours; if that strip of land cannot be cultivated for months it will show and I'd know whom to blame, publicly. Yes, I know I am acting quite childishly. A friend lent me her copy of Colm Toibin's \"The Magician\"; a fictionalised biography of the German writer and Nobel Prize Winner Thomas Mann; she said she wanted to have my opinion on it. Although Toibin is a greatly admired author I have not previously read any of his work. I am ashamed to admit that I had a prejudice against (Northern) Ireland. For years, before the Peace Process, the news was always bad, I hated the endless murders and maiming, the fighting, the violence, the religious bigotry; I lost count of the number of times I had to leave the underground on my way to and from work, how terrified we passengers were if we saw an unattended bag anywhere in the carriage or how we suspiciously watched each other, looking for signs of terrorism. The relief was great in 1998 when the Troubles finally ended although Brexit is having an alarming effect on the Peace Process.None of that is anything to do with Toibin, he is Dublin Irish, and a marvellous writer. After nearly two years of choosing lightweight reading material, lots of it, some of it boring and toe-curlingly badly written, I was a bit worried about having to read a book of literary merit and give an opinion. I needn't have worried. Toibin's style is fluent, limpid, even simple. He is totally accessible. The Magician is first and foremost a portrait of the artist as a family man with  Germany's decline and fall always in the background. I can honestly say that I loved the book and will now most certainly delve further into Colm Toibin's work."},

Receiving and writing hand written letters.Thoughtful greetings, thank-you and keeping-in-touch cards.A hot cup of soup coming back from a long winter walk.Swimming, gently floating, turning, stretching, then, in a flurry of speed, reach the side of the pool,  terra firma, a boat moored in a bay, the bank of a river.My bed after changing the sheets and straight after a luxurious bath.Candlelight.Fresh brown bread.Walking along the seafront in a stiff breeze with the spray foaming up high on the promenade.I could go on. Something this exercise has taught me: I am not as grumpy as I thought I would be but I do show my age. Fountain pens, indeed. Maybe I'll start a gratitude journal. Many students of human nature and the human psyche recommend doing it during rough times."},
{"title": "Kavli", "date": "Thursday 6 January 2022", "text": "Continuing reading ancient diaries and opening up old history I came across an entry for March 85, which made me cry all over again. For many years I had a cat, a female called Makarios (like the Cypriot Archbishop of the time), picked up as a tiny kitten on a building site in London, probably the runt of a feral cat's litter, abandoned and still dependant on the mother. After great efforts on my part the tiny thing survived, and as she grew we gave her all sorts of nicknames, Mac, Kavli, Fav, Kav, among others. This is how the entry went:-Sunday 31 March 1985Start of British Summertime today. Not that it makes any difference, the weather is still foul. Rainy and windy. Kavli is a little better again. She eats and drinks, she moves about a little, she washes and grooms herself, but I think the heart has gone out of the brave little fighter, literally. Our tough old boot is being knackered by her worn out heart. She breathes laboriously and sometimes she makes a whistling sound over and over. And still she seems happy and grateful for everything I do. The Vet also said that she must be able to see very little now. I can't quite believe that, she doesn't seem to have any difficulties negotiating her way around the furniture. Be that as it may, the signs of extreme old age are abundant: few teeth, loss of weight, shaggy fur, ill-health, etc. And still she manages to look beautiful and arrange herself absolutely adorably. Just now the silly baggage tried to climb on to my window sill through the open window. It broke my heart to have to stop her because I think she might slip off; her footing is very unsteady.Oh, I do love the beastie very much and when she's gone there is nobody left for me to  love and cuddle and stroke. And there'll be nobody to show me, over and over, how much she loves me. Kav comes running to the front door when she hears my step; she follows me up and down the stairs - often two or three times in a row; she says good morning and good night in her own inimitable way by purring loudly and winding herself round and round my legs, thumping her head on my feet and finally rolling over in front of me for a tickle on the tum. Every time I touch her lightly she purrs with happiness. She insists on being in the same room with me at all times; her eyes follow me about when she's not sleeping. She follows me into the garden like a dog at heel, but when I stay in, she stays in, no matter how nice the weather. If I am sitting out there, however, old Kav quite happily trots around the plants, tearing them up to cover her toilet.Kav has been with me for fifteen years. She sat on my lap, night after night, when the children were in bed and P off on his nightly travels. Kav and the bottle were my only company for a long time. I gave up on the bottle but Kav didn't give up on me. She turned cross and cantankerous in her middle years with everyone but me. Like any proud and beautiful creature Kav always knew what was due to her but she paid back the homage with undying loyalty and great affection. So many people think only dogs love you; cats may not accept you as their master, but their love and loyalty can be as great as that of any other creature on this Earth. I swear old Kav knew when I was sad or when I was crying, she would come for extra rations of stroking and tickling at such time. And I also swear to it that she knew how to make me feel better.I will miss her so very much when she dies, I am crying at the thought of it. She is a part of me in a way nobody and nothing else is. With her I've always been myself, never ever have I needed \"to put on a front\". Maybe I didn't want to hurt the children, so I'd pretend to be ok. With Kav that wasn't necessary. There were times she sat on my lap, my hands playing in her silky fur and tears would stream down my face.With Kavli gone a whole chapter of my life will close, I will not be able to show weakness to any other living creature. A and Mum would rather not know, they want me strong; S would be deaf and blind to it and P would exploit it. Darling little Kavli, you have been a truer friend to me than any human being.-------------Kavli died on 6th of June 85, just over two months after this entry. The Vet had been on at me for weeks to make an end. All treatments only worked for a few days, then she deteriorated again. I wish I had gone sooner than I finally did."},
{"title": "So this was Christmas", "date": "Wednesday 29 December 2021", "text": "At Christmas little children sing and merry bells jingle.The cold winter air makes our hands and face tingle.And happy families go to church and cheerily they mingle.And the whole business is unbelievably dreadful if you're single.Wendy CopeWell maybe not quite as unbelievably dreadful as Wendy Cope says but nothing much in the four lines is actually very realistic, is it now? Little children sing and merry bells jingle? Of course they do, can't you hear presents being handed over in return and cash till bells ring out in happy abandon? Cold winter air has been pushed out by climate change, we've had mild airs and uniformly grey clouds raining on us. As for the happy families trooping off to church, you couldn't fill one of our Anglican churches if you had just one service for half a dozen villages.I was one of those who spent Christmas in splendid isolation. My son and daughter-in-law came for two nights before Christmas.They didn't have more time because they were expecting their entire mixed clan at their house for Christmas and needed to get ready for the onslaught. Don't pity me, I would not have enjoyed myself among the throng, not that I was asked.Instead I spent Christmas Eve, the most festive afternoon and evening in the German calendar, by doing first my annual tax return and then, after successfully and relatively painlessly finishing that, by celebrating on my own, treating myself to a (genuinely) festive German TV programme, music, good food and drink and a few chapters in a favourite Christmas book, one I get out every Christmas Eve. Yes, I would have liked some company, but no, it was not unbelievably dreadful.I usually leave my tax return until the last minute (deadline is 31st Jan), so getting it done and paying the tax due by 24th Dec is quite an achievement for me. Something to be proud of, actually; I dread and fear filling in these forms online. Other years I have to have go after go, getting it wrong each time and getting more and more flustered. This time, I firmly shut my eyes, and begged the taxman to grant me an even path, a boulderless advent to the heights of access to my account and, hey presto, it worked. It shouldn't make me happy to be allowed to pay income tax, but acc to Benjamin Franklin \"nothing is certain except death and taxes\", so I'd like both processes to be relatively pain free. I have yet to experience the first of them, of course. but one can always hope.Christmas Day wasn't bad at all. Also solitary, I was still full of a sense of achievement (pathetic, aren't I?).  I had planned an indulgent day, so this is what I did: I finished cooking a delicious meal of duck breast in Hoisin and plum sauce, with a home made potato pancake and red cabbage with apple and wine. Most of the meal was part cooked already and I certainly didn't slave over a hot stove. It was delicious. While the vast majority of people in the country was choking on dry turkey I tucked into a beautifully tender and juicy duck breast. Result! To cap it all I opened a bottle of 2006 Rioja Reserva. After a chocolate pudding I had not the tiniest space left in my tummy, so sat and watched the Queen do her 10-minute-stint and promptly fell asleep.By about six pm on Christmas Day I usually have become bored with the whole palaver, solitary or not, and I want it all to be over. So sitting watching what passes for TV holiday specials for as long as I can bear, then grabbing a favourite book, more often than not ends the big day for me. There was a time when the evening was spent reminiscing but those days are long over. Families disperse, the older generations die and youngsters find anyone over thirty boring, unless they are a favourite grandparent who is allowed, and even encouraged, to be ancient. Right, only New Year's Eve and Day to go. And a Happy New Year to all and sundry. If only."},
{"title": "Insanity,", "date": "Friday 10 December 2021", "text": "it's sheer insanity.More (metaphorical)  rocks thrown at me. This time over the wall, by my new neighbours. For a long time I heard nothing more about their plans to put up scaffolding on my land to rebuild the boundary barn. I assumed they hadn't had permission from the Planning Office. I was clearly wrong. A few weeks ago I received a letter from their solicitors telling me that I'd better change my mind and allow them access for however long they needed. According to item X paragraph Y I was obliged to do so.What else was I to do? Much against my inclination I also employed a solicitor, mainly to question the other side's solicitor's statement. My solicitor examined the situation and found that I might have a point, particularly as erecting scaffolding in the narrow corridor between the back of their barn and my house wall would prevent unhindered access from the front to the back of my property, to my bins, the flower bed running alongside, a frequent path for my wheelbarrow; I use that passage countless times during the day, and being a clumsy old woman, not as agile as I once was, I'm bound to walk into the scaffolding and knock myself black and blue.What else could I do? I paid my solicitor a fair sized advance and she is now looking into a solution. It's not as if I utterly refuse access, of course not; the barn, which has been restyled 'The Lodge' by my bully neighbour, needs repairs. But repairs that take an indefinite time - at least three months and probably more (as I've mentioned before they are turning it not only into a storage facility but also a small holiday house, hence the new designation 'The Lodge') - that's far too much. Anyway, my solicitor says I have a case.She has also said, that if it goes to court, it may take eighteen months and cost in the region of £15 000.Help, that is not what I want, and I've told her so. Eighteen months of stress and a large sum which I'll never get back, it would be better if I went away for the duration. Everything is happening now that I am old and lonely, (sob), with nobody in my corner unless I pay them. I've felt so low at times that I've toyed with the idea of leaving the place where I am still comfortable and where my happy outdoor space still gives me pleasure, and sell up and move to a nearby town. But, and this is the big question, can I let that man drive me from my home? Sooner or later I may have to move somewhere smaller and more conveniently situated, but when I want to and am ready, not because someone else is pushing me.Like I said, it's insanity, sheer insanity. we are neighbours and should be able to come to a civilised arrangement. If only.PS: I am having trouble commenting on a number of blogs. Sorry about that, I'll try and sort it out."},
{"title": "Past lives", "date": "Saturday 27 November 2021", "text": "I have mentioned before that I am slowly working my way through old handwritten diaries; they are destined for the bonfire eventually, no way do I want to leave them for others to read.What a dismal, unhappy life it was; how bleak. I have much forgotten since then, perhaps life was too unpleasant to retain much of it. I have nearly come to the end of the years of misery, within eighteen months I will have met Beloved and then everything changed. Most of what I have forgotten over the years isn't worth remembering except as a blueprint for how not to do things.There was one man who helped me enormously during the time when the ceiling came crashing down threatening my very existence: a psychiatric social worker/probation officer; sadly, him too I had forgotten. But there he was, in the diary, name and all; one lesson of many he drummed into me over a period of counselling was this: \"One thing I absolutely have to learn to survive: Recognise other people's attempts at moral blackmail,  \"laying guilt trips\" on me and reject them without actually feeling guilty as a consequence.\"How right he was; for years my nearest and dearest lumbered me with their ideas of how I should live my life, how I could then take care of all and sundry, and how wonderful their lives would be if I only saw sense. And how bloody guilty they made me feel.When I found the name I thought it would be a kind thing to do to find him and say thank you for what he had done for me. I found an obituary instead. Both he and his wife had died of Covid within a few weeks of each other earlier in the year. I still recognise the trait in me, still, so many years later, I am tempted to see myself as the person who \"sorts things out\", who carries everybody's burden, who is destined to smooth the way and accept responsibility. My recent car crash was a prime example: others were blocking the way but I felt I had to unblock it. The damn snarl-up was not my doing!Reading old diaries I am learning something about myself: No matter how bleak life is, things will change. But first I had to change. And imagining and worrying about what might or might not happen in the future is just so much wasted energy. \"Sit still and let time pass,\" or, in other words, \"some situations never arise.\""},
{"title": "Coming up for Air", "date": "Friday 12 November 2021", "text": "BuildersFallPlumbersCar Crash TilersFloor layersBuildersand throughout, from beginning to end, dealing with insurance companiesExcept for one lot of tiles which are nothing to do with the leak, all the dirty work is done. It's been a nightmare. Having a serious fall in the kitchen and crashing the car were optional extras I could have done without. The fall was worse than the crash, I was black and blue for many weeks and am still not able to  to walk easily. The crash was minor but, because my car is old, the insurance company wrote it off. I consulted my wonderful mechanic who said the only damage was to the bodywork and he'd be able to fix it within the financial limits of the claim. The car is finally back, it took ages for the materials to arrive from Europe. I probably will give up driving when the next tax, insurance, MOT etc. fall due but until then I have the car I am used to. It looks better than it did, all the incidental scratches and scars I caused it over the years have been ironed out. We also found a mouse nest under the bonnet and several pounds of bird peanuts which the rodent tenant must have squirrelled away since the previous service. Mice don't bother me, you can't live deep in the country and fear mice.The building repairs were far more serious than thought at first, a whole wall was damp and mouldy inside and out and had to be taken down. It turned out that there was a second leak which was only discovered when the builders removed the wall. Before the fall,  stupidly over the Sketchers on my feet, I worked very happily in the garden but that came to an abrupt end, of course. I really could have done with some assistance throughout, but it is what it is. When I consider the things some of you who are my age do I can only hang my head in shame. I no longer need to look after aged parents, grandchildren or work for a living. I don't need to move house and pack the household into dozens of boxes. I don't have to get used to a whole new regime unless I want to. I can afford to pay people to do the jobs that are now beyond me. As I would probably have bored everyone rigid with tales of woe I felt blogging should take a back seat until progress was on the horizon. It now is.There is still Covid, of course. Three vaccinations later I dare stick my head above the parapet and hope for the best. Sadly, there are still people of my acquaintance who refuse vaccinations."},
{"title": "The brickbats keep on coming,", "date": "Monday 19 July 2021", "text": "for weeks now. I am so tired of them.  Wah-wah-wah. And I don't mean the sound of a trumpet. The only respite is getting out into the garden and working, when it's neither too wet, cold or hot. At the moment it's too hot. I know, I know, I am wailing about the changeable UK weather when other places are burning, sizzling or drowning. But then I freely admit that I am a whingeing Minnie, forever complaining. Luckily there's no one to hear me. On the other hand, if there were someone maybe I wouldn't complain so much. Part of the problem is that it's me who has to catch all the brickbats single-handedly and there's never anybody to share in finding solutions.About those brickbats: they are draining me of every drop of pleasure in life. As if Covid alone wouldn't be enough to do that. You know about the leaking and rotting shower room. The third or fourth delegation has been to assess the damage, take endless pictures and do a bit of umming and ahing. Finally, the last chap from the actual people who do the work came and left me a lot of paperwork to fill in regarding the materials I want to be used, the colour of paint, which tiles, the whole palaver. When I threw myself on his mercy and asked him to just look at everything and replace it with similar or identical he made the job'sworth noises. \"We can't do that\", he said, \"we need you to specify exactly what you want, within the cost limits, of course. We only get paid once for every job and if you change your mind when the job is finished we don't get paid again.\" Well, blow me down with a feather, there was I thinking I could go on and on demanding a change of paint or tiles as the fancy takes me. NOT.I know nothing of such matters, those of you who do will ask yourselves why is this woman moaning, she should be glad she has got her Insurance Company to take over the repairs. Maybe so but I DON'T WANT THE HASSLE.Next I had a letter from my energy provider. \"We are ever so pleased to be able to tell you that we have gone all efficient and up-to-date and sold out to XXX, who will be happy to accept you as their customer. All you need to do is rearrange everything, get a new Direct Debit going, and make plans for your future energy consumption. The sensible thing for me to do is look carefully at the paperwork, compare prices and conditions with other providers and make a decision. DO I WANT THE HASSLE? Of course not.Next thing I dropped and shattered my phone. Again, a minor problem you might say. My contract had run out and all I needed to do was spend a morning on the phone and get a new phone and contract. The sensible thing to do was to look carefully at the paperwork, investigate and compare prices. MORE HASSLE. I want things to STAY THE SAME!I am all Apple computerised. Yes, I know they are expensive, but the gadgets last and there's rarely any trouble. And if there is trouble I have this lovely man in the next village who is a whizz at all things Apple and has always seen me right. In the past. My iPad was slowing down seriously - it is old in years, like its owner -, the new phone needed tweaking and my desktop, which is also very old, could really do with a sort-out too. Besides, I had the distinct impression that my backup disc had given up the ghost when I last updated the desktop. I rang the lovely man's office. HE HAS RETIRED! With some trepidation I asked was there a replacement Apple specialist? Don't forget I live in the depths of the countryside and specialists for anything are few and far between. \"Well, not exactly a specialist but yes, someone would come and look at my gadgets\". The phone lady also said that the replacement technician was rather slow in replying and I had better be patient. The man eventually came, a real computer nerd, who said little, smiled less, sat at my desktop with phone and iPad also in front of him and fiddled. And fiddled. And fiddled some more, for several hours. I foresaw a bill of several hundred Pounds but, contrary to my inclination and habit, said nothing. Nerds must be treated with kid gloves, their social skills are not instantly evident, and I needed the man, and practised patience. I am not at all sure how good he was, there have been a few glitches since he was here and I decided to buy a new iPad because the old one slowed down even more after his ministrations. Suffice to say that he walked off with my external hard-drive (Backup), found it to be dead, and returned with a new one a week or two later. His bill was very reasonable for all the hours he spent on my gadgets - do nerds not need food? The new iPad arrived; just to be on the safe side I set it up myself.You may think that I have come to the end of my brickbats, but no, there's more. You all know about Brexit, the most pointless, masochistic ambition this country has ever gone in for. You may also know that I am one of the EU nationals \"who shouldn't be here anymore, having had the gall to come, take over \"our jobs\", live off social security, never pay taxes, and should all be sent back to where they come from\". Etc. etc.  June 30th the period for applying for resident status came to an end and, as I had applied a long time ago and been accepted I thought that was that. BUT I HAVE NO PROOF! None of us \"bloody foreigners\" has proof. There is no mechanism for proof! What larks there'll be when we want to use the NHS or, God forbid, go travelling!And, to cap it all, the Fatherland, which sends me a small amount of pension every month, has had second thoughts as to my actual existence. How do you prove that you are alive?"},
{"title": "Dripping mad", "date": "Tuesday 15 June 2021", "text": "In my previous post I said \"When you get to my ripe old age you realise that nothing much matters...\" I haven't changed my mind about that but you can still be surprised. One often says \"I've seen it all before, and, equally often, that is true; yes, I frequently use the claim that old age prevents me from doing things I really don't want to do and yes, my slightly crafty and ever so slightly dishonest wheeze gets the required result in that somebody kind and helpful will do that job for me.But back to the surprise. I appear to have a leak behind the tiles in the new shower room, not a very heavy one but the sort that will eventually cause damage if it isn't rectified. I can hear the steady drip drip when I use the bathroom quietly and listen for it. I have never made a claim on the house and contents insurance and it came to me that perhaps this is a job they would pay for. There's nothing wrong in asking, after all.Believe me, asking is fine but the reply astounded me. In my innocence I thought that insurance companies either turn you down or they send a workman to check the claim. Was it ever thus? First of all the insurance lady at the end of the phone line, who is so sweet and helpful when it's time to renew my policy was not at all nice now that I was asking for their money. After an exhaustive list of questions which I answered to the best of my ability she ungraciously accepted that my claim might - just might - be accepted but first there were several hurdles to overcome. First of all they'd have to send a building firm who would establish where the leak is. Following that they'd have to send a surveyor who would establish the extent of the job, the probable cost and determine whether the job would indeed constitute a genuine claim acceptable to the insurance company. I would have to pay the builders' fee (£300, the excess on my policy for \"escape of water\") upfront regardless of my claim being acceptable or not. The final insult was that the company to whom I pay my annual premium is not the company with whom I am insured but is underwritten by yet another company.To recap, my relatively small claim involves two insurance companies (both well known and reputable), a building company representative who normally charges £800 for finding a leak but whose services I could have for the sum of £300 - I know where the leak is, I told them I know - and an official surveyor to say yay or nay. All want paying, by me, their hapless customer. And there is no guarantee that the claim will actually be accepted.Can you blame me for erupting? In a nice and polite way, of course. I find that being calm and polite always pays, nobody is going to react kindly to a foul mouthed harridan. I had two subsequent phone calls from two different company employees - I didn't even bother to understand which company either of them represented - and both were most apologetic and assured me that I didn't have to pay anything up front, that they would simply deduct the excess from any services rendered at the final reckoning. Success! Would you have quietly paid over £300 before you even knew if your claim was valid? Lots of people probably will and do and kick themselves afterwards.I still don't know how this will pan out. The builder is coming on Thursday, but I will most definitely not pay him £300. Come hell or high water (even if it's only dripping)."},
{"title": "Children", "date": "Friday 4 June 2021", "text": "So, the Chinese have changed their mind on the legally allotted number of children a couple can have. After strictly no more than one for several years it crept up to two, was very recently changed to three and probably counting, seeing how Chinese couples found that one was plenty of hassle and I am not at all sure how many couples will follow regulations. It looks like so many official roadmaps that are handed out to the masses from on high, wherever you might be: first you complain, then you fall in with what becomes the norm and in the end you resent changes to what has become an officially sanctioned way of life that has become comfortable and perfectly manageable. Besides, one costs less than two, always a consideration. The Chinese didn't work out the effect on the population numbers when they blithely ordered that a knot was to be tied in the baby producing mechanism.What are children for? Seriously. When we had no means of birth control other than some very fallible methods, children were produced, wanted or not. You may be too young to remember the days when women dreaded that time of the month, particularly when they, or more often, their partner, had let the heat of the moment overtake fear of pregnancy, a fact they may soon have come to regret. Whether you were married or indulging in sin mattered not so much, although married breeding at least didn't bring the opprobrium that unmarried mothers faced. Breeding is not a word used nowadays although I recently saw a programme which provides brides for millionaire old men; the old codger who looked every minute of his 73 years was laying down his requirements before acquirement,  viz. :  must be attractive, must breed at least two sons, have some money and means of her own, and the most astounding requirement was that he \"couldn't go above 35\" What he was not asked by the note-taker?/ agent?/marriage broker? was what he had to offer an attractive young woman with means of her own, other than an urge to impregnate her. \"So tell me, Miss Brown, what first attracted you to Mr. Shrunken-Shanks Moneybags?\" might have been a suitable question for a possible contender. I remember that wonderful scene in Sex And The City when Samantha takes an elderly man to her bed who has indulged in Viagra beforehand. When he leaves the bed to go to the bathroom (we oldies need to pee more often) her face is a picture of distate as she watches his back view recede toward the bedroom door.So, what are children for? To continue the human race, of course, you will say. Me too, when I'm feeling generous towards said race, although there may soon be no planet to house and feed all these children. In my peregrinations in blogland I have seen many female bloggers describe themselves as doting mothers, wives, grandmothers etc. In other words, apppendages first and foremost. A lot fewer mention professions, or give a precis of  interesting facets of their lives. In other words, a purpose other than caretaking. I admit that there are many women for whom  this caretaking is a holy and much loved pleasure, to be seen as the fulfilment of a woman's deepest needs, as well as her bounden duty. Fair enough, to each his own. But give those women who prefer not to have children - not the poor souls who desperately want a child but it just doesn't happen for them - I mean the ones who choose not to get pregnant -  the right to follow their own path. All that phoney pity, the intimate questions re the \"patter of tiny feet\", \"w-h-e-n  can we expect a happy event? Is there perhaps a touch of envy when the harassed mum sees her friend's active social life, her independence, her clean and tidy flat free of Lego strewn about to trip you up?Children are wonderful in their allotted sphere. They can be a joy and delight and, I suppose, mostly are. But we can no longer count on children as an insurance policy for old age, \"to take care of us as we once did for them\", which, if I remember rightly, was the way in Far Eastern civilisations (and maybe other civilisations too, but it was the Chinese which caused these ruminations), where old age and its concomitant wisdom were much revered.  We can be proud of them when they reach maturity, we can also be disappointed, we come in quite useful when the children's children require a doting grandparent to double up as unpaid childminder, we can sit and watch from the sidelines, but we cannot - or very rarely - be part of a family embracing all ages under the same umbrella, the way things once were, even in my lifetime.My son is a very good example of what I mean. He has a large family circle, with the usual chequered his- and-her children, inherited adult siblings, adoptive and inherited grandchildren, his own soon to be grandchild; I know that he is happy with the status quo and enjoys it all immensely, albeit slightly sporadically. I am no part of this family, not from any malice on any side, it just never happened that I was included, or to be honest, included myself. He does what he can for me, visits several times a year, cheerfully works his way through my extensive list of jobs reserved for him; we take the time to sit and reminisce about \"our olden days\", then he leaves to return to his busy life. That's how it should be, I must be glad that he leads a loving and contented life. For the rest, we have slightly \"dutiful\" telephone contact on Sundays, when we catch up on the week's events. I am not complaining. Besides, he means well.I also have - or had - a daughter. As those of you who have been my faithful readers for a while know, she fell out with me many years ago and has never felt any need to enquire after my wellbeing, neither during good times nor bad. For a long time I fretted and worried, but everything passes.When you get to my ripe old age you realise that nothing much matters, and that includes children. You want them to do well and live well-adjusted lives and if they pass on the better parental genes to following generations you can sit back and say:\" job done as well as can be expected under the circumstances\". One thing I would advise you to do, even though you absolutely do not need my advice: keep those pennies safe for the time when the Happy Endings facility beckons; without those pennies God Help Us All. And, in the meantime, enjoy yourselves."},

How did they get there? There have been occasions when I’d go downstairs during a sleepless night and have exactly that, some crackers and a small glass of sherry.  But downstairs in the warm kitchen, not upstairs in bed.NOT upstairs in bed. So when did they get there? And how?Answer came there none, no matter how hard I tried to recall the events of the previous night. Nothing, an absolute blank. Not even a partial recollection. A complete blackout.For the next few days I puzzled and puzzled, even going so far as thinking of a TIA (mildish transient stroke) or some such. I didn’t seem to have any further symptoms apart from being just a touch worried. Lately I have been having lots of headaches, a bit of pain here and there, more and longer lasting bouts of depression than I like. But nothing I am not used to.I decided to consult my GP, by phone. Initially, all consultations are currently by phone. My GP heard me out, asked a few additional questions and came up with an instant diagnosis. \"It’s the sleeping pills”, he said. “ you took two when you normally take only one. Besides, these particular ones (Zopiclone), nasty things they are. I personally don’t like to prescribe them”.  He hadn’t, it was another practice doctor. “Don’t worry,” he added, “there is no cause for alarm, I don’t even need to see you. Had I taken two sleeping pills I might have lost a few hours myself.”I am glad he was so certain, I had indeed been worried for several days, feeling uneasy. But doesn’t that beg all sorts of questions? Why prescribe dangerous medication? I might have fallen down the stairs during my nightly wanderings. An episode like that is frightening, how can he be so certain that nothing more untoward had happened? How do I find out that he is right, take another two pills some other night and see (or rather not see) what happens?Any ideas?"},

But today is the vernal equinox, the official beginning of spring. From today the days are longer than the nights and things will get better and better. It’s still coolish but nothing will keep me from getting out into the garden, unless spring turns contrary and throws rain and snow and ice at me between now and summer.WW (Wiry and Willing, to give him his full name) and I have already spent happy hours digging (him) and me standing over him and telling him what, where and how deep, and exactly which holes to hand over to me for new planting. He created more light by filling builder’s bag after bag with  hard hedge trimmings and shrub prunings, some of which I too have provided. Since I have my new secateurs pruning is so much easier. Decent tools make all the difference. WW brought his son and his son’s truck along and between the two of them they’ve shifted a mountain of greenery and taken it to the dump. And still the mountains never seem to be any less, I can’t wait for my son to come and help move stuff. The other evening I felt quite miserable, never having anyone to talk to and eating every meal by myself were getting to me, so I got on to my favourite garden nurseries on the net and indulged in a mad splurge. Others buy clothes and shoes, I buy plants and books. Five boxes arrived over two days, filled with two date palms, two mahonias, three hydrangeas, three cornus , a collection of lupins and some heucheras, and a honeysuckle;  apart from the date palms, which I got at a reduced price because I spent such a lot, all plants are new, unusual varieties which I have never grown before. I have dug up large flower beds and tried to weed them thoroughly before replanting, with minor success. However, lockdown has shown me how precious life is and working myself into a frenzy over weeds is not an option. Live and let live is the new motto.For the moment the new plants look bare and boring, just you wait until they start growing. I’ll have a jungle border soon.The tree doctor called today; for some time I have been worried about the taller and older trees around the edges of the garden. I have lost several already. There is one beautiful green/gold cypress of 30m, an ornamental cherry and a youngish (30yr old) walnut tree, all of which have had me worried every time one of the gales has blown up the river valley from over the border with Wales. Westerlies are often quite serious storms nowadays. Probably to do with climate change, they are occurring far more often than they did. Doctor Tree put my mind at rest. The cypress could be topped and reshaped but I’d lose the  pretty lacy curlicues right at the top and the tree would no longer look natural, but ‘doctored’, as it were. As he said that the tree had done the necessary to withstand gales by growing bumps around the trunk (yeah, me neither) there was little danger that it would topple over for the next 20 years. He pronounced the walnut tree healthy enough in spite of its gnarly and split bark; that left the cherry, which he thought should have the ends of its branches trimmed; a bit like taking the split ends off in a haircut. There is ash dieback all over the country; I have several ash trees which, cross fingers, still look healthy. Some ash trees are resistant to dieback, could I be one of the lucky owners? Not just ash, other trees are dying too; it’s a problem for which there is as yet no solution. Doctor Tree seemed quite worried.I like trees and would prefer to keep mine going for as long as I am here. Apparently, you can tell if a tree comes to the end of its life by keeping a close eye on leaf growth. If leaves grow all along the branch, right to the tip, the tree is fine, once the ends stay bare there’s trouble ahead.The work on my neighbours’ barn still hasn’t started. I think they probably haven’t been given permission. Turning the stable cum barn into a bijou residence is what is called ‘change of use’; with listed buildings the Planning Office frequently turns such requests down. I should be thoroughly ashamed of myself but, truth to tell, I don’t much care."},
{"title": "Midlife Crisis", "date": "Sunday 7 March 2021", "text": "It’s only now, when midlife has long passed, that my midlife crisis is hitting me. ( Google says that Midlife crisis” may be another name for the grief, exhaustion, and anxiety that can affect people for a prolonged period between ages 40 and 60. The origins may be physiological, emotional, or societal.) When I was in early midlife my attention was on surviving. Now, in old age, for the first time, motivation is lacking, targets and goals have vanished and there is a panic-stricken feeling that time is not only passing too quickly but also being wasted. Could that just be the effect of Covid? I would love to be able to boast that all the idleness under Covid has encouraged me to broaden my horizons, to give serious time to serious reading, to watch critically acclaimed TV programmes, to catch up on concerts, plays and philosophical discussion, documentaries and improving lectures, all widely available digitally. What riches there are to be sampled, what depths to be explored.No, sadly, what I have done is broadened my bottom instead, sitting for hours, watching endless repeats of ‘Midsomer Murders’ and ‘Morse’ and ‘Poirot’. Yes, I have spent many hours reading, book after book, mainly novels, but of the calibre that needs almost no engagement of brain cells :’Mary Stewart’, Angela Thirkell’, 'Georgette Heyer’, ‘Marcia Willett’, ‘A. Mc Call Smith’, ‘Barbara Pym’, and others, whose names I have forgotten. Whenever that diet of 'warm bath’ literature has become too cloying I have picked up slightly more demanding non-fiction but for the life of me I have not been able to choose the option of reading Kindle-downloaded writers like Hilary Mantel, H. Jacobson, Garcia-Marquez, Sebastian Faulks, or Ian McEwan. I have a highly acclaimed production of Checkhov’s'Uncle Vanya’ recorded, ditto several series of ‘Deutschland’. They are all awaiting less fraught times. For now I need that warm bath escapism. I recently had an email from a former blogger who still reads blogs but no longer writes herself, saying that she felt a little intimidated by me, because: \" You are so articulate, possessing an air of intellectualism and, with your considerable and impressive knowledge of literate, poetry, art and theatre; your husband, a Classical musician; your friends, most of whom seemed to be cultured and well educated, made it a little daunting to leave a worthwhile comment.”Well, did you ever! Dear commenter, I don’t know if I am flattered but, if you are reading this, you will have been disabused of your false impression of me for good by this post. Intimidated, Goodness, Gracious Me.As for further reading material, I picked up my March 81 diary last night, which had the following gem:“A silly clot from the Gas Board came on Monday. He pronounced our Ascot Boiler unsafe for use. It is now an offence to use the thing. We know all about the danger from gas fumes and we are all quite careful about using the bath or shower, always leaving the window open. Nobody wants to die there, after all. Still, I suppose there will be a letter soon, giving instruction on future use. The silly fool trod in Kavli’s (the cat’s) toilet tray and tipped the whole mess over his shoes. He wasn’t particularly friendly when he came, he was even less friendly when he left.\"I found some good advice easily adaptable to pouring over old diaries in \"Finding Henry Applebee” by Celia Reynolds:-\"If you want my advice, kiddo, Uncle Frank once told him, you’ll do as I do and think of the past as a casual acquaintance: warmly, but not to the point you want to invite it over for a beer every other night of the week. “Well said."},
{"title": "Words Words Words", "date": "Friday 26 February 2021", "text": "\"A word is dead, When it it said, Some say.I say, It just Begins to live That day. \"  Emily DickinsonSo many words, for good or for ill, and I am losing the power to speak them simply because the opportunities to do so are fewer and fewer. Talking to myself is just not the same. Although I have had some excellent conversations with myself, they usually finish quite soon, mainly because I tend to agree with what I am saying. As I always win every argument with myself there’s no point in it. I am also rather tired of the old ladies’ croaky voice I sport when I haven’t spoken for a few days and the endless clearing it takes before I am satisfied with what comes out of my mouth.The other day I went to the front gate to drag the bins back in after collection just as the postman drove up. He stopped, stuck his head out of the van and asked: “Are you Mrs. W?” “Yes,” I said and took the mail he was offering me. That, dear readers, was the sum total of my speech that day.Zoom meetings are such clumsy tools; you may say 'better than nothing' and I would agree, but how tiresome all the same. In small groups, say four or so, you are all waiting for the previous speaker to finish. Unless someone says your name, calls you up, as it were, after this pause you all speak at once, and nobody hears what anyone is saying. One to one is possible if both of you are polite and neither of you hogs the conversation. It’s difficult to interrupt the flow politely when facing a screen. Large meetings I find to be a nightmare. I was invited to join a group of fifty or so. The German Embassy had scheduled a virtual meeting with the subject of :”Brexit - now what?” for us Krauts resident in the UK. The speakers were ambassadorial experts on law, taxes, customs and excise, travel within the European Union and related matters, all of importance. All revised since Brexit. The experts were all men. By golly, don’t male experts talk. We could write in questions we had but were otherwise muted. And because the experts talked (and talked) our questions remained largely unanswered. I have a problem with long-windedness. I almost invariably switch off mentally. Being muted you can’t ask for the speaker to get to the point. I still don’t know if Aunt Betty can send me a jar of homemade jam without filling in reams of customs forms. And, of course, it would have been utterly impolite to ‘leave’ the meeting. Whereas, in real life, I can always find an excuse why I simply have to rush off, being properly, regretfully apologetic, of course.For many years I have kept a diary, using 1000s and 1000s of words, maybe even millions. Because I am getting old I think of death and all the stuff I am leaving behind, unless I clear most of it away. Posterity is not going to want to preserve years of my pathetic scribblings; my children certainly won’t. At random, I picked exercise books of 81/83. Dear Readers, without hesitation, I can tell you, that if I met the past me I would not like her. It seems that I spent many bottles of ink and untold school exercise books to tell myself that my life was a disaster, that I really must do something about it, that nobody understood me or my sufferings. I was unkind to myself and everybody else, although there were few mentions of others, me being to a very large extent concerned only with spineless, whingeing me. Perhaps those particular months in 81/83 were particularly difficult, I no longer recall. What I will do, though, is read on, year after year. Surely not all the time before my new life with Beloved was miserable? He certainly wouldn’t have wanted to throw in his lot with a perpetual moaner? If I come across anything worth repeating, I might repeat it here.“Be careful of the words you say, Keep them short and sweet.You never know, from day to day,Which ones you’ll have to eat.”Anonymous."},
{"title": "Thoughts on Valentine’s Day", "date": "Sunday 14 February 2021", "text": "Fat raindrops race down the window pane,  avoiding the shiny, pearly patches of earlier gusts of rain sticking to the unwashed glass, and end in splatters on the lower frame. A busy wind ruffles and drives last autumn’s remaining shrunk and shrivelled leaves across the moss infested grass, to land at the foot of hedges. Blackbirds fight each other for any crumbs left from the handfuls flung out by my generosity; angrily they chase each other and bicker with sharp cries. Mine, all mine, they seem to warn. Were they kin last year? They look adult now, the aggressive males with bright yellow beaks and the females with their brownish speckled breasts, a little in awe of the males. The females might retreat while the male struts his belligerent stuff, but she soon comes back and sneaks food when his back is turned.Neither Blackbirds nor the weather take the slightest notice of Valentine’s Day. No chocolates, hearts and flowers for me either. Except that I have already set aside a bottle of Rioja, a bit of steak and some liqueur-filled cherry chocolates for later. It’s too wet and cold to bother picking flowering stems in the garden, so no harbingers of spring indoors.Many of you will know that Valentine’s Day is another of the Christian festivals that took the place of ancient pagan celebrations, for safety’s sake, of course, just in case Christians would be tempted to follow the ancient rituals of naked rampaging and the beating of women for the purpose of ensuring fertility. Plutarch’s description of Lupercalia leaves no doubt:  \"...many of the noble youths and of the magistrates run up and down through the city naked, for sport and laughter striking those they meet with shaggy thongs. And many women of rank also purposely get in their way, and like children at school present their hands to be struck, believing that the pregnant will thus be helped in delivery, and the barren to pregnancy.”Hardy folk those ancient Romans. Surely even in Rome the middle of February is cold enough for any man running around naked to be in danger of having his bits frozen off? A tad different from Hallmark’s contribution to the happiness of modern days females, who are content with a cheesy card promising eternal love and a few chocolates in a giant heart shaped box.This must be my all-time favourite poem for Valentine’s Day;‘Valentine’ by Carol Ann DuffyNot a red rose or a satin heart.I give you an onion.It is a moon wrapped in brown paper.It promises lightlike the careful undressing of love.Here.It will blind you with tearslike a lover.It will make your reflectiona wobbling photo of grief.I am trying to be truthful.Not a cute card or a kissogram.I give you an onion.Its fierce kiss will stay on your lips,possessive and faithfulas we are,for as long as we are.Take it.Its platinum loops shrink to a wedding-ring,if you like.Lethal.Its scent will cling to your fingers,cling to your knife."},
{"title": "Appreciating blogging.", "date": "Wednesday 10 February 2021", "text": "How sweet you are, how darling. Thank you for kind words; it is true, much of the pleasure of blogging comes from the feeling of community. When a blogging friend of mine, urspo at sporeflections, recently said that he had been blogging for 15 years, I decided to check on my own length of service. Last November I had done12 years. Heavens, you get less for murder, as my dil is wont to say. Mind you, she applies it to marriage rather than blogging.When I started I was green and young at heart; if I was not, after all, going to become one of the great writers of the age I might as well try the very lowest form of writing, a positive waste of time, as my then writing teacher said. Much better to slog at something serious, she suggested. But she did agree that I had found ‘my voice’, loud and clear. Only much later did I learn what that means.In spite of feeling shy and very tentative I soon enough mastered the blog format, true,  not gathering any followers, but discovering that writing down my thoughts, however hesitantly, brought a kind of pride. So I carried on, ever more relaxed and confident. I also discovered the joy of photography.I’ve always had a horror of being deemed mediocre, something to do with kindnesses my parents felt obliged to send my way. “Is there nothing you can do properly?” was one of their favourite expressions. Heigh Ho, it’s a long time ago, yet it still rankles.Inspiration came easily, Beloved and I had decades of bouncing ideas off each other, stimulation came in the form of plays, concerts, meetings with friends and the heated debates we shared, gardening, walks in the Shropshire countryside, giving a home to dogs. I also delved into my past, my life in a newly liberated Germany, history, bits of geography. Then there were the memes, the communal writing to a subject, often funny. By now I had amassed a respectable number of followers, sadly, Google took several dozen away from me because the bloggers didn’t have a Google account. However, I persevered.Then Beloved died. It was hard to carry on, nothing made sense, much was pointless. For the last three years there have been huge gaps, my heart just wasn’t in it anymore. Covid made it worse, suddenly there was nothing to say, unless I went back to the writing I had done during the early to middle years, i.e., leave the daily boring grind behind. Skim the surface of life at present and find what gets caught in the sieve. I want to concentrate on being truthful rather than bang on about facts. After all, both in my country of residence and, say, the US, we have recently learnt that facts are easily bent out of shape, invented, and twisted to make ‘alternative facts’, which are fervently believed by millions of people. So, let it be truth, maybe a personal truth rather than a universal one.I really hope my blog will change a little, set off in a different direction, maybe use some poetry again.I blame reading poetry in bed for the very late hour, it is now 5.16 in the morning, time to go to bed."},
{"title": "A Title? for this mess?", "date": "Tuesday 2 February 2021", "text": "It’s getting harder and harder to come up with an interesting blogpost. I don’t go out socially, I only meet people very casually on a walk, when we stand and shout at each other from a distance, or the people who come to help around house and garden. The main topic of conversation is Covid and vaccinations, who’s had one and who’s still waiting. I’ve had one, the first of the two Astra Zeneca ones, which are now found to be unproven for the over 65s in European countries. I had mine last Saturday and apart from a sore arm I’ve had no ill effects so far.So, would you like me to tell you that we had a lovely morning and a very wet afternoon? No, why would you want to know? Would you like me to tell you about the several virus mutations appearing on several continents, two of them in the UK alone? No, you already know that if you are even semi-conscious. Would you like to know that a small bird flew into the window but then must have recovered and flown off again because I couldn’t see a body. (Unless, of course, a raptor chased it and snapped it up for dinner). But here’s something which might interest you: shall I tell you that I’ve put on several kilos during the lockdown lockup and decided to go easy on the chocolate and drink less wine in the new year? If I tell you that I lasted less than a week would you be interested? No, of course not, why would you.So, how about this, seeing that today, the 2nd of February, is Candlemas,’St Mary’s Feast of the Candles’,(’Mariae Lichtmess’ in Germany), officially the Feast of the Purification and the Presentation of Christ in the Temple. Today therefore, in the Catholic Church, lights and candles are blessed and candlelit services and processions are held. In Germany these candles are lit throughout the year during times of sickness and stress and personal hardship. Just the thing for an epidemic, methinks.Candlemas Day, plant beans in the clayPut candles and candlesticks all away.By this season it has grown light enough to do most ‘inside work’ without candles, the verse continues. Really? Not where I live unless people stop ‘inside work' at 5 o’clock. I hardly do any work at all in winter, inside or out, does that mean I don’t deserve light? Sometimes I wish I weren’t quite as lazy and unmotivated, had a bit more oomph. At other times I find laziness suits me.Of course, today is also Groundhog Day, a weather forecaster not only in the US, although different kinds of animals are used as forecasters, a hedgehog might be the animal being so very unkindly roused from its hibernation in Germany.If Candlemas Day bring snow and rainWinter is gone, and won’t come again.If Candlemas Day be clear and brightWinter will have another flight.And if your Candlemas Day brings both sun and rain, as mine did, what is the prognosis then? Wishy-washy weeks? And finally, a bit of advice:A good farmer should have, on Candlemas Day,half his turnips and half his hay.Sorry, I have no idea what that means. Also, for the life of me, I cannot see what possible comments this post could provoke."},
{"title": "One very good reason to be cheerful", "date": "Monday 25 January 2021", "text": "or maybe several, at that.Not the flood, naturally; that’s more or less what is expected in January, although it’s never welcome. There is a very minor river under all that water, I’ve posted many pictures of it over the years and periodically mentioned poor neighbours who regularly have to sweep mud and slime from their cottages. Today and yesterday we’ve been inundated with snow and ice on top of the floods and I’ve not wanted to risk going out.Enough of the weather; I’ve learned a lesson on a totally unrelated matter, i.e., decision making is good for you. Very good. Coming to terms with, and accepting what one cannot change, is good too but I have already more or less learned that lesson in the past.Let me tell you a story. I have new neighbours, well, newish neighbours; they moved in three years ago. Since then they have been renovating, knocking down and rebuilding, their very ancient cottage, parts of it dating back to the 14th century, and I am sure it’s quite beautiful inside. They aren’t very neighbourly in many ways, friendly enough when you meet them but not given to joining village life. That’s entirely up to them, of course.Although our houses are a good distance away from each other we have a common boundary, consisting of partly fencing, hedging, an ancient stone wall and several red brick walls and the back of a falling down barn. “We need to start on the barn now,” said they one afternoon. There they stood in my garden, looking at the back of the barn. I agreed, the barn is in very poor repair. They weren’t actually asking permission, just telling me that they would need access from my side. Well, naturally, I thought, a week or two of disruption, but one has to be agreeable to neighbours in need.A letter from the planning office arrived, as required by law, giving a website with details of my neighbours’ plans. Quite idly, with absolutely no malice intended, I checked the website, and found that they are not only planning to repair the wall but rebuild the barn and create a bijou residence with workshop, storage space and parking area combined. A sizeable undertaking indeed, nothing like the plan they had informed me of.I rang them, she answered the phone and I could tell she was quite taken aback that I had taken the trouble to access the project website and wasn’t altogether pleased with their plans. She instantly shouted down the phone at me.“You must have a very selective memory then,” she said, “ we told you that we wanted to repair the barn.\" Nobody shouts at me without retaliation. I did, however, stay polite.The next day he came over and rang the bell. “I am not going to argue with you”, he said, “we are awaiting planning permission for the project as it is detailed in the application. Oh yes, and our builder says he needs to erect scaffolding on your land.” I was floored. Suddenly, I felt very old and very alone and very helpless. They were going to bully me into giving permission to use my land for their purposes, God knows for how long. I needed to gain time to think. “I need to understand exactly what is involved, bring your builder over to explain it to me,” I said.Several days later the builder arrived; I was a nervous wreck by now, literally feeling ill and dizzy and unable to sleep.A jovial type of chap, the builder was calm and friendly. I am sure he told me more than my neighbour liked. He showed me exactly how much scaffolding there would be, the tarpaulin that would have to cover it, the plants that would have to ‘be bent over’ or removed and how long he foresaw the work would last. “Three months minimum”, he said, “depending on what we find when we get started.” Have you ever known any builder who kept to his timeline? I haven’t.I was almost shaking with nerves but said nothing more while I watched them move off. Having finally rediscovered the pleasure gardening gives me, after many years of neglect, my heart was sore at the thought of losing yet another year. When I mentioned it to him, all he could say was :” with all due respect, if you like gardening so much, haven’t you got all this other space to do it?”, waving his arm in the general direction of the back of the house. I hate it when somebody says “with all due respect”, it implies no respect at all; it’s what politicians say in interviews just before they become really rude. I was furious but still couldn’t find the courage to send neighbour packing.For weeks I felt worse and worse, my blood pressure shot up, the dizzy spells accelerated, I dreamt horrible dreams every night, woke often, ever more tense. I am not exaggerating, I felt so awful I rang the surgery. And then, one weekend, I had enough. After agonising for weeks I finally recovered my backbone. I wrote a letter, telling them that there will be no scaffolding erected on my land, that I will give permission for any work needed to be done to the backwall, and only the backwall, from my side, that I am willing to put up with a builder or two and their ladders for as long as this work takes, but, and it’s a big but, that the rest of their renovation and rebuilding project is absolutely not my concern. Several times during our negotiations neighbour and builder assured me that the wall would be repaired from inside the barn; from which I understand that surely it is the main body of work which requires scaffolding, not the backwall. I haven’t heard a word since then. I am determined to stick to my guns. ‘With all due respect’ indeed.Going back to decision making and how it’s good for you: from the moment I dropped that letter through their letterbox I’ve gradually felt better, my blood pressure is now back to normal, I sleep again, and the tense muscles in my back are relaxing."},
{"title": "Cheerfulness is Breaking Out ?", "date": "Thursday 14 January 2021", "text": "There are one or two reasons to be cheerful after all,  this winter flowering viburnum is one of them, even if the picture is, once again, of very poor quality. I have no idea how I can make photos clearer, as clear and focused as they were with the old Blogger. I am using the same camera and doing nothing different, that could account for it.Life is more and more circumscribed in the UK, we are in the third lockdown and there’s little hope that we will climb out of the pit any time soon, vaccinations notwithstanding. I am still waiting for mine, but the advice is, that even after having received the vaccine, we are to remain vigilant and as close to home as possible. Staying out of circulation makes for a dull life and there’s little of any interest to blog about. Zoom meetings are a poor substitute for meeting in the flesh.W.W. (wiry and willing) called today. He promised that we will soon be out in the garden again. There are jobs he can do now, like laying a crazy paving kind of path; all stones have come from the walls of the old castle which have got buried in the garden over the centuries since the castle was razed, and have since been dug up by me and Beloved and old gardener and kept aside for just such a purpose as the one I have in mind. I also want to lower all the hedges which have grown taller than necessary and take far too much light from beds. A job for W.W.’s chainsaw. Snowdrops are out in several places and aconites are just beginning to show their golden heads above last autumn’s leaf fall. More reasons to be cheerful! I really must go out more, while we had snow and ice I was worried about slipping and breaking something. Hospitals bursting at the seams with Covid patients are not an attractive destination at present. Amazing, how fear concentrates the mind. I am very fortunate that my son has stepped up to the mark, he rings me once a week, usually on Sundays, for a long chat. I had no idea that he has a well developed interest in politics, we only ever used to ‘just chat’, but now he is my weekly ticket to staying sane and letting off steam about the dire state of the world, in general as well as specifically. While casual meetings with like-minded friends are verboten, I miss a good old session of getting hot under collar. To the rescue comes son; we have an hour or more of serious raving and ranting and, boy, do we have something to rave and rant about! There is no need to go into details, there cannot be a single person anywhere who is not aware of the near tragedy, all of us, in our respective countries, might be facing. Still, as George Orwell said: “A people that elect corrupt politicians, imposters, thieves and traitors are not victims... but accomplices”.And finally (there has to be an ‘And finally’, as they have on the news, something silly and light, to make you go off with a smile on your face) : very occasionally I have contact with my ex-son-in-law, we might send Christmas emails or birthday wishes, we have remained on good terms through the years. Well, we had a light hearted correspondence during the festivities, nothing much about nothing much. But he ended his message with:Onwards and upwards, and don’t give up on the blog… much of Shakespeare’s best output was penned during plague!giving me an unexpected chuckle. Friko and Shakespeare, eh? I didn’t even know that he followed my blog."},

I am sorry that I simply couldn’t rouse myself to reply and reassure you that, yes, I am alive, but, sadly, it felt more like existing in a lonely vacuum.Is 2021 going to be any better for all of us? I don’t know. Soon we may have the vaccine on tap to make at least one problem bearable; what is going to happen politically is still uncertain. In Julius Caesar, Shakespeare put into the mouth of Mark Antony: “The evil that men do lives after them, the good is often interred with their bones.”I know I can do nothing to change the world on a grand scale; perhaps you think, as do many others, that I shouldn’t ‘let it get to me’ to the extent it did, but it did. Solitude and fear of falling ill with the virus didn’t help. I knew that the black dog would catch up with me as soon as going outdoors and working in the garden became only very occasional pleasures. All I can try to change is my attitude to the world as it is and maybe do some good in my own, tiny, sphere.I sincerely wish all of you a Happy New Year."},

I can’t say that I was surprised when the long-expected news broke. Contrary to the reaction from some (only some) parts of the international media I am also not going into hypocritical overdrive. Does anyone think he is going to learn from this? Probably not. Our pound shop version said at first that he now knew the score, but it looks like he has long forgotten it again.So, it’s autumn now. At first I didn’t want to believe it, I carried on digging and forking and pulling up, but then it started to rain. And rain. The days drew in markedly and there’s a definite chill in the air. In spite of the rotten quality of the photos (oh, damn Google, will they ever get it right?) you can see the difference in colouring.I am staying in bed much longer in the mornings and going to bed ever later in the evenings. Some days I will have a nap in the afternoon. The weekend was dismal, I didn’t see a soul. Whatever am I going to do with myself for a whole dark winter? The PM  has warned us all that it will probably go on until Christmas and beyond. After feeling no serious ill effects during spring and summer I believe winter will be a whole different kettle-of-fish. Enough already! While the weather is awful I read, and read, and read. A book a day is nothing, sometimes I finish one and start another within hours.I feel like constantly moaning and complaining, except that fulminating without letup is so tiring! Do you know what I mean when I say I mutter curses under my breath, slam around in the house, find fault with everything and everyone? The other day I got cross when collecting medication from the surgery. They’d left out my lifesaver COPD inhaler and I had to go back to claim it. “We had to wait for it to be delivered”, said the woman at the window. Not a bit of it, I don’t believe it; at other times somebody would have made a note on the packet telling me so.There’s something else which annoys me every time I open a new packet of pills: they stick sticky tape over the ends now. Both ends.You fumble and fumble to get this tiny bit of tape off, if you succeed the bit of tape then sticks to your fingers and you stand over the open kitchen bin trying to get it off and deposit it inside. Of course, it won’t come off, it’s too small and too sticky. You have to go and find a piece of dry kitchen roll and transfer the remaining fraction of tape from your finger to the paper. You could, of course, just cut through the tape while it’s still attached to the pill packet but what do you do with that? Plastic sticky tape is not meant to be recycled. Oh, dear saints in heaven, life is getting ever more complicated. And Google definitely isn’t helping. Getting these two mean and fuzzy photos on took ages. Grrrr!"},
{"title": "Who said gardening is a doddle?", "date": "Sunday 20 September 2020", "text": "No wonder the stump was swaying in the recent high winds; I watched from the window in the roof and saw that not only the huge nest of dead ivy but the body of the stump was rocking. Time to call HandsomeHunk and get him to get the ivy off before it fell on the drive or maybe on my head when I was walking past under it.HH duly came and inspected the job. \"Won’t take long”, he said confidently. \"I've brought my extension saw and  a long pole. I’ll be able to shift it.” I usually go out and work with the helpers, perhaps a bit of supervision is included too, as I haven’t known either HH or WW (Wiry and Willing if you forgot) for long. HH comes uncomfortably early and I was still organising myself indoors. Very soon the doorbell rang although I’d told HH that I would come out as soon as I was in a fit state. I saw that he had left off the hard hat and was pushing at the ivy rather than sawing it off. “I think you'd better come and look for yourself” HH said. I saw that he had a tall ladder leaning against the stump. “I can’t climb that ladder”, I said. It really was much too long for me and I wasn’t sure I had the  necessary courage or agility. “You won’t have to climb up”, he said, “ you can see the problem from down here. The tree is completely hollow”. So it was. HH had taken off the ivy nest and the innards of the rotten stump were visible. He pushed at it  and large bits dropped off. He poked some more and sawdust came dribbling out.After much careful prodding the ivy crown and top of the stump were off completely. But then disaster struck. The stump had been host to a large climbing rose (yes, another one of the monsters which can grow to 20 m or more, with vicious tendrils armed with even more vicious thorns) and quite unexpectedly, the bark incl. chicken wire and rose came off and thudded into the large philadelphus shrub next to it.The bark would have made a wonderful cave for several children, except that the chicken wire which had held up the lower strands of the rose was firmly embedded in it and would have cut any child to shreds.However, all came right in the end, after much toil and trouble. HH finally managed to salvage the foot of the tree which we saw is home to dozens of bumble bees who have burrowed into the soft timber, dislocating little heaps of natural sawdust. I will be delighted if the stump can remain as rent free accommodation for the entire insect population of the garden.Unfortunately, I am now left with piles and piles of debris. As WW is cutting the hedge at the same time I have a problem. How to get rid? I’d love to have a bonfire but I’ve already smoked out the village once, they won’t be very happy if I do it again before they’ve had a chance to forget it and forgive me.PS: it’s taken me hours to write this  really rather insignificant post. I am quite exhausted from swearing at Google for messing me about and changing things and making things so difficult. The uploaded photos are of poor quality, apologies. And there’s no ‘reverting to the original Blogger’ anymore either. But at least Google have found my yyys and xxxs again and several other letters they mislaid.Blast you, Google. I think. posts appear without ysome necessary- (see!) letters and I don't know what to do.Ditto, posting photos is now a problem. See -you once I've worked the thing out.If -you have any- (!!) suggestions, I'd be grateful."},
{"title": "Are you sure you are living the life you always wanted to live?", "date": "Monday 7 September 2020", "text": "If you found out, right now, that these are the last few days of your life, could you say, tonight, that today you did exactly what you wanted to do?For the moment, forget about pestilence, politics, war, famine; forget about smouldering fights with family and friends; forget about anything you have no control over, focus on yourself and what you can control, here and now, in your own life. Has today been deeply satisfying? Have you sailed through? Did you take the time to smell the flowers, savour a fragrant cup of coffee, do a kindness, to yourself or someone else? Yesterday was Sunday, was it the same day as every other or did it hold a special moment? Are you at peace with yourself?I don’t know where any of this has come from. Like for so many of us older folk, the pestilence has brought me a lot of thinking time and observing time. The nights are drawing in, they are also getting cooler; I noticed that some leaves on my ornamental Japanese cherry tree are turning red, always the first sign of autumn in my garden. For several weeks I have been thinking how come I cope with solitude as well as I do, why am I not missing daily contact with people. And then I remember that daily contact with people has never been a priority for me and that some contact has actually been against my better judgement.Vaguely I have been wondering why I continue to feel that I must make an effort when I don’t miss some people or activities at all. Indeed, why have I never realised that there are positively toxic people and toxic activities I’d do well to shed. Does it matter that some people’s feelings might be hurt if I don’t jump when they whistle?My needs are modest, I aim for modest pleasures in life. There isn’t a great deal of time left, I must make sure that how ever many last days there are, I enjoy them at my own pace."},
{"title": "Of Matters Temporal and Temporary", "date": "Sunday 30 August 2020", "text": "It looks like I am not going to take sensible advice anytime soon.“I think this could be a lot of work to keep it all going. Are you sure you want to carry on? Do you think you can?”I had my son and his wife for a visit and a lovely time of almost endless talking it was. My voice was quite hoarse when they left. However, to qualify, we chatted for hours, with the exception of the time they spent clearing up more of those heaps of prunings, choppings down, clearings out and repair man’s leavings that I seem to collect nowadays. Only about six weeks after the previous five trips to the dump another three followed this time.My daughter-in-law admired what she saw but there was a definite look of concern on her face. She hadn’t been to visit for a year at least and, not only did I become older by a year, but my house and garden haven’t shrunk in that time. Even worse, my gardening obsession has returned and, my knees having become stiffer, my energy levels lessened and my old codgerdom having increased, she had every right to express doubt in my general ability to continue my slightly head-in-the-sand attitude. For the knees I have bought a kneeler: it is not too difficult for me to get down on my knees, it’s the getting up again that’s the problem. The kneeler has two upright handles which allow me to heave myself up quite easily. I combat the energy loss by working for short, hour-long, bursts and taking a rest in between. As for the old codgerdom I try to make a virtue out of it; I quite enjoy looking helpless and asking all those nice men who come to do jobs, and even neighbours, for assistance.I believe that my d-i-l’s concern is genuine, not the ”let’s-put-mum-out-of-her-misery-and-put-her-in-a-nice-home-for-the-elderly\" syndrome. Not at all. She did, however, while we were sitting idly not watching a TV show neither of us was interested in, look around and remark on the ’stuff’ I have. The full book shelves, china and glass cupboards, pictures, rugs, ornaments, CDs, vinyl, DVDs, etc; all the stuff one has around and hardly uses. And that was just one room. I could see she was really bothered, which in itself was unusual for me; nobody has been concerned for me in any way for years, maybe even decades. My own son has only recently started to ask “Are you alright, Mum?\"“What do you want done with it all?” she asked.I was puzzled. “Done with it?”“Yes, all this stuff that you value and enjoy and then somebody comes and takes it away, and your whole life just disappears.\"I think she was thinking of so-called house-clearers who bring a van, tell you they’ll take it all away if you just pay them a few hundred pounds and skedaddle.It appears she was worried about the two of them, after my demise (which she hoped wasn’t for a long long time yet), having to descend instantly, sort out and dispose of, and vacate the house almost the day after the funeral. Come to think of it, the funeral too was a problem, had I made any arrangements?Poor d-i-l, she was thinking of her own parents after their death, when she and her sisters laughed and cried and reminisced while clearing out the former home. There are three of them to support each other. I think she was comparing their situation with mine, as she imagines it, solitary, unregarded and neglected and unloved by the very few family left. She only relaxed when I told her about the facts and procedures of probate (which I also hope won’t be necessary for a long, long time yet) and that there will be no need to vacate the house until after that complicated process has been finalised.Her visit has made me think. She is quite right, I must go back over arrangements made years ago; I have actually been meaning to make changes to my will for some time now. Then there are unofficial bequests of bits of furniture, jewellery, books, etc. Charitable donations need decisions. And maybe I should appoint a second executor, the one named now is getting a bit old himself. And as I am going to live for a long long time yet, he might be senile by the time I pop my clogs.However, regarding what started this all off, my daughter-in-law’s musings about house and garden and all things temporal and temporary, I say this: good advice is always welcome, but what you do with it is up to you. You only ever ask for advice when you already know the answer, having already made up your own mind anyway and all you are really asking the other person is to confirm your own decisions.Having ordered a load of large plants like two Italian cypresses, a couple of bamboos, a mahonia, and a hydrangea, from a wholesale supplier on the internet, would confirm my decision: I am not giving up gardening and garden designing anytime soon."},
{"title": "Doing Well", "date": "Sunday 16 August 2020", "text": "Sitting in the comfortable chair in my study, feet up on the footstool, book open on my lap. I am calm and quiet, reflecting on life as is and life as was. With the single exception of missing Beloved, then as now, I am content. There is no help for it, as Carson McCullers put it so movingly:“the way I need you is a loneliness I can’t bear and there is nobody who can fill that loneliness except for the one who is no longer here”,but bear it I must. Being alive brings the obligation to embrace unpleasant things as well as the pleasant ones. Even the most determined 'look on the bright side’, and all the insistence on 'positive thinking’ doesn't provide us with a constant diet of flowers, sunsets and cute kittens. Accepting that ‘life is hard and then you die’ is a clarion call to living life, warts and all.So, I am content. The patter of soft rain on the window tells me that doing outdoor work is not advisable for now, whereas a spot of meditation is. Yesterday, I spent many hours outside gardening, doing hard and dirty work, like mulching, potting up, cutting ivy, carrying heavy loads until I could barely drag myself to the bench in my ‘woodland garden’ (a small patch of beeches and hollies and yews. I sat there, not moving, doing nothing much at all except taking in the sounds of nature, birdsong, the murmur of unseen small creatures, the soft rustling of beech leaves in the gentle breeze.Autumn cyclamen are appearing in all parts of the garden, a welcome sight particularly in areas which are otherwise just green, like the view from the compost heap towards the leaf mould enclosure. Everybody who comes to help in the garden admires my compost. “Did you make this all yourself ?” , asked WW (Wiry and Willing - who is fast becoming a worthy successor to \"Old Gardener”);  he sunk his hands deep into the heap, rubbed the compost between them and smelled it. “It doesn’t stink at all”, he said. “Lovely”. If I am remembered for nothing else but my compost when my end comes I am satisfied. Others leave great deeds behind, works of art, pearls of wisdom, empires and the destruction of empires. Leaf mould and compost are like me: practical and useful and given to long periods of rest and just being.For me gardening is therapy, it fulfils my need for outdoor creativity, the result is pleasant to the eye and beneficial for health and wellbeing. I am currently reading a book by Sue Stuart-Smith “The Well Gardened Mind” sub-titled 'Rediscovering Nature in the Modern World’;  she says:“Like a suspension in time, the protected space of a garden allows our inner world and the outer world to co exist free from the pressures of everyday life........there can be no garden without a gardener. a garden is always the expression of someone’s mind and the outcome of someone’s care.”For now the world within my hedges and walls is my castaway haven and this morning, looking out of the kitchen window while putting on the kettle for my morning brew I saw movement round the foot of the bird table. My blackbird fledglings are back, dad had brought two of them and they were all three picking busily at the ground. I call them ‘my’ fledglings although they may be another family entirely, but it feels good to believe that I have done my modest little best to help them survive during their most vulnerable time. I sincerely hope mum and dad call an end to breeding now, this must have been their second clutch for this year’s summer; in a good long summer garden birds with a ready supply of food and clement weather can have three sets of young.The rain has stopped, should I cook my dinner or go outside ? Yesterday evening I was so tired I couldn’t bear the thought of cooking,  so all I had was a bowl of rice crispies. Perhaps I had better prepare a meal before I go out."},
{"title": "Blackbirds, Rosie and Books", "date": "Sunday 9 August 2020", "text": "Whatever am I going to do about my resident fledgling blackbird? Or maybe blackbirds plural?About 8 to 10 days ago I first noticed that there was a very young blackbird hopping around close to the back of the house on the terrace. There is a bowl of fresh water standing there as well as access to various kinds of bird foods, both on the ground and in the air. I know that blackbird fledglings are fed by the parents after they’ve left the nest and, also, that they don’t learn to fly until then. (Google is wonderful - I didn’t know any of that) Their food is grubs, worms, insects, not so much grain or fat balls. Above is the first photo I took, seeing its properly formed tail I thought the youngster would soon be off.A few days later I took this photo of another young bird. At the time I thought it was the same bird as the first. This one too kept hopping about close to the house and the patch of ground just in front of the back terrace where I have some shrubs and a few herbaceous flowers.Yet a few days later, maybe 2 or 3, I saw this little chap (or girl - I can’t tell at this age) which seemed to be a bit younger than the other (?) birds, fluffier, downier. All had exactly the same behaviour pattern, they all skulked around in the same very small area, frequently nodding their  head up and down, up and down, appearing to find breathing difficult. After minutes of nodding, they all sneezed and coughed, ending with a soft little chirp.This morning this little chap turned up, again nodding and sneezing and picking at the crumbs I’ve spread on the terrace. Are they all the same bird? Do all blackbird fledglings constantly nod, opening and shutting their beak, and shake their heads and sneeze?I am obsessed with my lodgers, checking on them first thing in the morning, keeping them close to the house because of marauding cats. Shouldn’t it be flying by now if it’s the same bird? I’ve seen them drink from the water bowl and pick at the crumbs I’ve provided. They hop about quite actively although there are always long breaks in the hopping while they are sitting still, in full view of me and possible predators. The problem is that I haven’t seen the parent birds feed them. That’s not unusual but what with me spending hours watching the fledglings ( from a suitable distance) I’d have thought I’d have caught them at it. Grown up blackbirds are quite tame in my garden, they stay close to my feet and spade, waiting for me to produce worms, when I’m digging the earth. Oh dear, I am so worried, I want them to fly off and lead happy blackbird lives and sing beautiful songs for me.o-o-o-o This is the new wall, trellis and door frame, seen from inside and out. A new door has also been installed. Rosie’s trunk is visible again and shows promising new shoots. I shall have to weed round her feet, provide her with a good mulch of compost, some rose feed and a few drinks. Next year she’ll be as good as new, ready to snag and scratch anyone’s hands who tends her without taking the greatest care.o-o-o-oIn just two sittings I read a most extraordinary book about a woman who escaped her successful London life by moving to the wilds of an island in the Scottish Hebrides. to run a derelict croft. She describes her existence there which, initially an idyll, soon turns into a fierce struggle for survival. She lives the rawest, most pared back life, poverty stricken, ill and lonely, and always facing the hostility of the islanders who resent all incomers. But this is not a misery memoir, it is a triumphant tale of rebirth and renewal, with nature being the driving force.It is hard to believe that this story is entirely factual, once or twice I said “No” in shocked accents and, of course, ofnecessity, it is a wholly one-sided account. But, even if only the half is true, it really is breathtaking. The language too is beautiful, the most lyrical description of nature I have read in a long while."},
{"title": "Good Intentions", "date": "Friday 31 July 2020", "text": "Under the huge weight of the pink rambling rose stretched along the middle halfway up the picture are a brick wall, a wooden trellis and a garden door. The trellis is broken, the wall is cracked and the gate is held shut with string. HH (handsome hunk, how could you forget) will come and mend, as soon as the rose has finished flowering. The rose will be chopped and chopped and chopped, until there is little more than it’s thick trunk. That beauty is more than twenty five years old  and still going strong.I feel like time is standing still. Time was when things just happened, then they were over. Time just passed. We always come to the end of things, it’s a kind of relief to know that. Is that true still?Urspo, in a slightly pensive post, reminded me of Beckett's ‘Waiting For Godot’, a play exclusively about waiting, waiting for an event that never happens. Is that what happens to us? Will there ever be a vaccine and a solution for Covid19?  Or will we sit, like Vladimir and Estragon, in this desert of humanity’s own making for evermore? Will it help if I turn a blind eye and do what Voltaire suggests in Candide :”Il faut cultiver notre jardin.” I want to take this line literally, without looking for Voltaire’s social criticism. Candide exposes the failings of his society but at the end of the novel, Candide and his companions find happiness in raising vegetables in their garden.  The garden represents the cultivation and propagation of life, which, despite all their misery, the characters choose to embrace.A lesson to be learned, all the way from the 18th Century. Tending one’s garden (whichever way you read that) is the only way to live.I have said before that in these uncertain times I turn to either non fiction or novelists who amuse me. Nora Ephron is one such, she can cheer me up during the darkest days. In Heartburn she has a paragraph which seems to be written for 2020:What I love about cooking is that after a hard day, there is something comforting about the fact that if you melt butter and add flour and then hot stock, it will get thick! It’s a sure thing! It’s a sure thing in a world where nothing is sure; it has a mathematical certainty in a world where those of us who long for some kind of certainty are forced to settle for crossword puzzles.Tired of Covid, tired of this Vale of Tears we find ourselves in, I will turn my attention to happier thoughts. Will you?"},
{"title": "Losing (Trivia) in Lockdown", "date": "Tuesday 28 July 2020", "text": "Lots of important things have been lost, of course, but here I am talking of the much less important ones. Perhaps I shouldn’t use this heading; those of you who have lost loved ones, jobs, livelihoods, have my heartfelt sympathy and I hope that time will heal the pain and anguish you feel.In my own case, losses I can immediately put my finger on are trivial indeed. It starts with holes, the holes in my earlobes. I have not worn much else than leggings, baggy t-shirts and loose trousers, bare feet or socks for close on four months. Ear rings are not part of such outfits. I love ear rings and often wear them in ordinary times, but not now. I don’t really know why not. I went through the common or garden jewellery box the other day, again, don’t know why, and the jumble of stuff inside made me lift up some very simple danglers and try to put them in. Not a chance, poking them into my ear lobes really hurt. My holes have disappeared.There isn’t really much point in trying to wear outdoor clothes with waist bands. I have most definitely lost my waist. When I complained, Wendy said :” that’s age dear, waists disappear as you get older”. If you say so, Wendy, but in my case the expanding waist measurement may be due to age but ageing is ably assisted by chocolate. Being lactose-intolerant I shouldn’t eat chocolate other than the non-fattening 80% sort but I do like a truffle or two, even if it gives me diarrhoea and stomach cramps. Who coined the phrase \"being one's own worst enemy”? I wonder if they had idiots like me in mind?Next I tried the car. I haven't driven anywhere ever since the beginning of lockdown and what with things easing I thought I might get to the optician and also go for a haircut. Really, I am quite glad that my current glasses don’t allow me to see myself clearly, I look like a witch! Not the one with the black cape and pointy hat but the ‘old witch’ with grey hair sticking off her head. Anyway, the car was a non-starter, literally. No sign of life when I clicked the key at it, not even the doors moved. Battery dead as a doornail. My helpful mechanic came, did some magic and towed her away to charge up the battery overnight. She is now back in the garage, still not being driven although I am determined that I will use her soon, before I need another expensive charge-up.Something of much greater importance to me, and not nearly as trivial as the above, is that I seem to have lost my confidence. When my son was here he took me to a couple of supermarkets in local market towns. I had a short list but lists have never before stopped me from dawdling in the aisles, letting myself be persuaded by clever marketeers to try this or sample that product,  and load my trolley with on the spur-of-the moment items. Not this time, I felt totally unsure of how to negotiate the aisles, the direction in which I was supposed to travel, how to stay away from other customers, not to linger and take my time over the item to choose, how to approach the cashier and how to pay for my small haul of groceries. My hands were literally shaking, I fumbled with bags and didn’t dare to get closer than two metres to the next person in the queue. I have to say that everybody was very kind, the cashier must have seen how nervous I was and he called me and my hand basket to the front of the queue because everybody else had full trolleys. Both my son and I wore masks throughout while only maybe half the other shoppers did. The store was by no means full. I was seriously glad to get out again and all the way home I felt trembly and fearful inside. What has often been a pleasure has become something to be afraid of.How will I cope when life demands that I set foot outside my comfort zone?"},
{"title": "Living through the Pandemic", "date": "Saturday 18 July 2020", "text": "Everything arrives at my front door, heavies like sacks of bird feed, garden supplies like grit, potting compost, horticultural sand, fertilisers; not so heavies like groceries for me and friends who cannot get their own delivery service going, small parcels, large parcels, desperately needed parcels as well as a few - a very few - treats. None of the delivery men/women ring the door bell, apart from the groceries everything is left either on the doorstep or on the bench in the ever open shed door.No problem, as the front door is totally secure; the only time I get cross is when there are parcels of plants left withering in the sun. They are usually baby seedlings, hardly able to survive without instant attention.Deliveries have taken off in a huge way, this business is one of the few profitable ones. I always say a heartfelt thank you when I catch the drivers, for making my life easier. All those essential services I didn’t even think about before the pandemic, suddenly assume giant proportions.In spite of existing restrictions I am still relatively contented. I am not even keen on going back to the local café; a friend rang to invite me to meet there but I turned her down. The German Conversation group has invited itself to a meeting at my house; I have insisted that we can only meet in the garden, not indoors. If it rains, well, then I hope they bring brollies! Or have the sense not to turn up. The more I read about the long term after-effects of Covid-19, not to mention the severity of the illness for oldies with pre-existing health issues, the less I feel tempted to socialise on any but the smallest scale. Just think how much wiping and disinfecting I’d have to do before and after the event!Having said that, I do go and see, or welcome, a friend or two at a time. Yesterday we had coffee in Wendy’s garden, three of us sitting and nattering for two hours solid. Politics, gardening, music, the meagre repeat fare available on TV, gossip about all the silly people who ignore Covid19 rules - we had a lovely time, hardly wanting to stop.I am more careful about restrictions than is laid down at the moment. We are governed by such an incompetent bunch of liars and morons it is as well to make up one's own mind about staying safe. The science says that a second wave of infections is more than likely during the coming winter, at the same time as the flu season arrives.My son came for two days earlier in the week, “for a working visit”. And work he did. I was amazed at how he got through the tasks, never imagining that he would indeed see off such jobs as taking eight huge builders’ bags of green waste, several heavy windows, half the junk in the garage, a broken down bird table on legs and a dozen or more large plastic bags of weeds, collected over the whole of the spring, to the dump. It took six separate trips! I had spent weeks worrying how I was going to get rid of the stuff. A very useful chap to have around, I am glad to say.Gardening is still my main occupation, WW and HH have both come up trumps and, although they certainly don’t give their services for free, they are getting through all those long neglected jobs, allowing me to realise that I am catching up with myself. I have almost reached the stage where I can finally relax and think about replanting.More of that anon. Paul has done me a favour by dumping me."},

I can stay abreast of developments in technology, politics, current affairs, fashions and whatever else the modern world throws at me;...... if only my mental faculties stay sharp(ish) as at present;...... if only I can stay on top of all physical work required to make life acceptable to me and pleasant;...... if only my finances last, what with the global economic downturn,well, then I will never have to grow old and retire from active life.If only.Fat Chance.This bunny has still not been very happy; in fact, I’ve been feeling a bit lost and lonely. At first I welcomed the rain, both the garden and I gave a sigh of relief that the heat relented and gave me a breather and the garden a good drink; after more than a week of on-and-off thunderstorms and showers I am ready to say ‘thanks' but 'no more, thanks’. I should be patient, the rain is still needed, but lack of opportunity to get myself good and dirty and exhausted doesn’t do my mental health any favours.Hence the opening lines; my recent birthday has given me much to think about. I’m doing a bit better today, having spent the morning carting around watering cans, feeding hydrangeas, clematises, a little olive tree and a couple of lemon trees, the latter three in pots. Indoor ferns have had a good trim and been allowed to come out. Ditto the winter flowerers. They all enjoy a few months out of doors. With me all the while dodging heavy showers, of course. At least the rain is warm.Paul has forsaken me. He was ailing for about three weeks and the last time I enquired after his progress he emailed to say he was lots better but not coming again. \"For personal reasons\". No notice or further explanation. Just bang, like that. Fair enough, I have not been very happy with his efforts, but he was a nice chap, nice enough for me to think of keeping him on for the jobs he could do and pairing him with somebody better able to cope with longer hours and heavier work.However, he has taken the decision for me. Good luck to him.Since then I have been asking around for recommendations; several friends have mentioned several gardeners, mostly garden labourers without great knowledge but plenty of brawn; I have chosen to interview one chap not so much brawny but wiry and willing and one muscled handsome hunk. If either or both stay the course, one will become WW and the other HH. They will do different jobs. Both are more expensive than old gardener of blessed memory and recent Paul; but I am becoming reconciled to the idea of spending money on the garden, if I want to stay here. Besides, I am planning to reorganise the beds and do away with at least one, maybe two, of the more labour intensive areas. One is to become an area for conifers and junipers instead of herbaceous perennials.Here’s hoping.Writing this I have become aware that I am behaving like someone who has endless years of gardening ahead of her. Of course, I don’t. If I had any sense I’d pack up and sell up and go into retirement and withdraw from active life, exactly the opposite to what I am hoping to do above. But while the bullet points above hold true I might as well ignore old age and incipient decrepitude and enjoy what’s left. Like I told my Mum, when she dithered about buying herself a new dress she liked because “I don’t have enough time left to enjoy it”, : \"even if it’s a day and no more the new dress gives you pleasure, it’s worth it.”"},
{"title": "Not a Happy Bunny", "date": "Saturday 13 June 2020", "text": "It had to happen eventually, working like a madwoman in the garden had to lead to some injury or other. It did. Excessive sawing and secateuring at an ancient rosemary bush’s thick and convoluted stems did for my right hand. The bush grows in a raised bed along the wall with my neighbours, all the while I was sawing away I was cursing and telling the bush to \"come on”, “give already”; two thirds of the way through I yelped in pain, either my tools were too blunt or my hand just doesn’t have the strength it once did, suddenly my wrist and thumb were on fire and I had to give up. I heard my neighbour potter in her own grounds, but she forbore to get involved, for which I was immensely grateful.I am really hard at it, at least, I was; luckily we are having a few rain showers and I can’t do much outside anyway today, something else for which I am immensely grateful. There is something obsessive about my need to work outside. Paul has another ailment which stops him working and I’m doing it all myself, turning heavy compost, mulching, pruning, weeding, lugging heavy bags and mountains of brush to be taken to the dump eventually, if I’m lucky and get help; otherwise I’ll have to hire a skip, which is expensive. The thing is that without help I simply cannot cope any more; I have a big birthday coming up which means that I am going to be less and less able physically. Already I am surprised at how tired I often feel. I was thinking of telling my doctor about that but then I know what she would say: “you are not in the first flush of youth, what do you expect?” It’s true, I am stupidly unwilling to let age stop me and sit back on my haunches and retire to the old ladies’ corner gracefully.The fact remains, if I can’t find regular and capable help, I must give up the house and garden and move to somewhere more suitable. The idea appals me, I love my house sitting in what used to be the centre of a beautiful garden in a magnificent location. I have been just so fortunate. No doubt I’d have no trouble selling up but where could I go? Nearer to my son? That would be sensible but it also means giving up. I could try and hire a company to make my garden less labour intensive, swapping large flower beds for hard landscaping. Whatever I decide to do needs careful deliberation. The one thing I feel unable to do is letting it all go to rack and ruin, closing my eyes to it.I really feel like moaning today. I can just about type with the index finger of my right hand so I’ll continue. This damned virus doesn’t seem to realise that it’s not wanted and the numbers in the UK are still frighteningly high. I think I am actually now afraid of getting back into the world; I have the most troublesome dreams when I manage to sleep at all, often to do with overcoming huge barriers to getting home. Last night I lost track of my friend who was dependant on me to get her to the station; I kept ending up on the wrong platform and in the wrong station myself and never connected with her at all.Depression is setting in, life is far too complicated. Although I have happily withdrawn from the burden of normal demands for the past twelve weeks, the thought of remaining entirely on my own for months yet is traumatic. No wonder my nights are disturbed. I dreamt of my daughter the other night, begging for help with something. In my dream she laughed and vanished.The only good thing is that it’s summer, the days are long and bright and I welcome the odd rainy day. The earth was so dry that I could hardly get a fork in and the birds found it difficult to peck for worms and seeds. Nature helps too, apparently the air in cities has cleared, pollution is diminished and wildlife is taking over the spaces vacated by man. If only we could learn from this and allow nature its rightful place again. What will we take away from this catastrophe? Will we allow our Earth to recover or simply carry on where we left off when it’s all over?One last thought, a good one: I have prepared a Mediterranean vegetable mess with garlic and chalots and a slice of my delicious meat loaf to go with Singaporean noodles for my dinner tonight. If nothing else brings pleasure, perhaps a pleasant meal makes for a welcome change. Cheers!"},

We’ve had glorious weather and I’ve been working like a madwoman in the garden, physically exhausting myself in the process. The more I work the less there is to see, the more dry brown earth emerges. The more I dig the bigger the piles of plastic sacks filled with weeds grow, ditto the piles of brush, shrub prunings and whole uprooted shrubs lying in corners which should, by now, be attractive and tidy areas for sitting and watching the garden grow. I shall be ever so cross if I die before I can replant everything next autumn or spring; all that work for nothing.There is a good thing about being physically active outdoors: it makes for a cheerful and happy state of mind, so maybe it’s not all for nothing. Paul still comes once a week, but now only for two hours, his energy doesn’t last for longer. I almost exclusively reserve the jobs which are too hard for me to do, nothing routine like weeding, he still has strength, even if his stamina leaves much to be desired. Agewise, I could be his mother yet I work harder than he does. I am glad that he officially stops work after two hours and doesn’t drag out his time with me to three hours, as previously, with a rather long tea break in between. There’s no tea break now and I only pay him for two hours. I like Paul very much, he is a nice chap and knowledgeable about plants and I certainly hope he continues to come.There’s a chill wind today, I’ve allowed myself a day off. Once or twice, during the hot and sunny days, friends have come to call, by invitation, one or two at a time, and we’ve sat in the garden in late afternoon, at a distance of no less than 2 m and enjoyed a glass of wine over a natter. We are all very sensible and do not meet in each other’s houses yet, as per government directive. The incidence of Covid 19 in Valley’s End is minimal, less than a handful of cases and no deaths. Many of us are of retirement age and therefore vulnerable. There is one dog walking acquaintance who turns up once a week or so, who explains her uninvited presence by saying that her dog has wriggled through the bars of one of my gates and insists on raiding my garden. So, naturally, she has to follow him, scoop him up, apologise for her invasion by blaming the dog and look longingly at the chairs on the terrace. I must ask her to come on a specific day, she is obviously lonely.Which brings me to a question I’ve been puzzling over. Ever since I’ve understood the meaning of the terms introvert and extrovert years ago I’ve thought of myself as an extrovert. I am not shy in company, I face meeting new people with equanimity, I am lively and chatty at parties, I talk to people before they talk to me. At the same time I can take or leave people and find solitude nothing to be afraid of. Sometimes, I am lonely because I lost my soulmate but, otherwise, my own company is sufficient for my needs most of the time. I even talk to myself.But that is surely not how an extrovert reacts to the present lockdown? I am always reading about people who are terribly unhappy and longing for hugs and face to face conversations, whose loneliness cries out for human contact and who are in danger of becoming mentally ill. These people have all my sympathy, so many are old and alone, feel abandoned and shut out, but I simply do not feel that way myself. What is wrong with me?  When I read these sad stories I question my capacity to empathise, I have no idea what it feels like to be in their shoes. Solitude to me is something good, something to be welcomed. Does that mean I am an introvert after all? Or even more fortunate, I am an introvert/extrovert whenever either state suits me?Considering that I’ve had nothing to post about I have used an awful lot of words to post it. That’s what Covid does, it makes wafflers of all of us."},

I went to bed at the usual time, read a bit, switched off the light and waited to disappear into the arms of Morpheus. Morpheus wasn’t interested. Wasn’t having it. Any of it. In spite of a generous helping of sleeping pills. Nothing doing. On these occasions it’s almost as if I really don’t want to sleep, like a horse refusing a jump. What I did, however, was gardening, in my head, all the jobs waiting to be done, in detail; had it been light I might actually have got up and done them. Or that’s what I told myself.Instead I got up, fetched a packet of crackers and a glass of sweet sherry and read a magazine for an hour. It was about 4.30 am when I went back to bed. The birds were up and singing.This morning all those gardening jobs were still there, waiting to be done. Of course, I was too tired, after my mostly sleepless night, to tackle any of them. I am a daemon for sorting things out at night, come daylight, not so much.February was the last time we went to see a performance by The Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-on-Avon.

{"title": "Afternoon all,", "date": "Wednesday 29 April 2020", "text": "how are you doing? Getting a bit fed up? A bit bored with your own company? I am. Not madly depressed or sad, just a bit bored. Mind you, would I be any better off if I had a family now, maybe a few brothers and sisters, an aunt or uncle tucked away somewhere? Kids closer by, kids that actually liked me enough to want to live close by? Who knows. But then I was the one who moved far away from everybody.A time like this concentrates the mind, come the rainy day and there’s not much else but dandelions around - it’s dandelion time in the garden and the hedgerows and verges - and all the family you’ve ever had is either dead or they’ve forgotten about you and live a life that's neither more nor less happy and contented than the life you yourself live. Once I had a lovely aunt, she’s the one I remember with affection; she was poor, with a husband who cut hair for a living in a tiny rural hamlet. Not much money to be made there. Auntie loved life, laughed a lot, celebrated every birthday, every occasion that lent itself to celebration and some that didn’t, and always had a plate of Dutch cheese open sandwiches ready to share. Auntie is long gone, I wonder what she would have made of it all now? Laughed, raised her shoulders 'what do I know’, and said, \"it is what it is”. I know what Mum’s sister, my other auntie, would have done. She was the one much given to bursting into tears at the least opportunity, everything that ever happened was chosen by ill fate and aimed directly at her. Both of them are dead now but I know which one I’d rather sit with round the kitchen table.They are all gone now, Mum and Dad, the aunties and uncles, even some of the cousins, not that I ever had many. Two kids max. per household was the going rate in the family, at least the side of the family I knew. And some only had the one, like my Mum and Dad. All of that generation had a hard time of it, two world wars, hungry childhoods and not much prosperity until much later when things generally got better. But they never experienced a pandemic, Spanish flu, avian, swine, HIV/aids, sars, mers, all scourges of the last 100 years, passed them by. Would they have borne them as stoically as they lived through their own times?I miss them and, most of all, I miss Beloved. Not that I would want him as he was at the end, but the way he was when we sat opposite each other in the kitchen, when one of us would ask a question and so a conversation would start about a wide range of subjects, subjects which would need exploring in detail, whether we knew the answer or not.I miss the old people and I miss Beloved. Often now my thoughts turn to the past and I want to ask what they think about this and that, do they have any advice to give or do they know as little as I do. The latter probably, but it would be good to find out."},
{"title": "Just Saying . . . .", "date": "Friday 24 April 2020", "text": "I made a disappointing discovery: one of my friends, someone I was not only fond of but admired greatly, has turned out to have feet of Covid19 clay. Supposedly, we are all in this together, but some of us are further out on the periphery than others, able to dip in and out at leisure. Looking around me I have judged that this one or that one would maybe not stay the course, crack under the strain of isolation, break the rules and get out from under without considering the consequences. In some cases I was right. But this particular friend I judged to have excellent self control, determination and staying power, yet this is the one to break the rules in the most spectacular fashion. We are all only human, we all make mistakes, we are all getting fed up and nobody wants the situation to go on for longer than it needs to. But to flout the rules deliberately and claim special status for reasons of personal convenience is just despicable and highly irresponsible.Maybe that friendship has run its course.We have to pretend, said Old, we have to pretend about so much these days. We have to pretend to like things we don’t like. We have to try so very hard to be non-judgemental.The Dept. of Sensitive Crimes by Alexander McCall SmithInstead of sitting in judgement and feeling disappointed I should just continue to do what I’m doing, get into the garden more or less every day for at least two hours. The longer and harder I work the less attractive the beds are. More and more naked earth appears. I used to accuse Beloved of pursuing a ‘bare earth policy’,  he was keen to strip the beds back to basics and proclaim lots of my favoured plants to be weeds that needed clearing when we first came here. Now it’s me who does that. I have ordered a few pots of herbaceous perennials and some colourful annuals to close the biggest gaps once I get to replanting.  Luckily, the garden has a respectable 'bone structure' in the form of shrubs and trees. Spring flowering clematis like the one in the picture help too. Paul is coming tomorrow, I hope that together we will knock a few more weedy problems on the head.Last night the outer scab came off my lip, quite naturally. The inner scab came off a few days earlier, the inner scar healed very quickly, I am glad to say. No infection anywhere. There is a small visible scar and a small patch of scab left, but nothing to spoil my beauty. I’m relieved."},
{"title": "Glück im Unglück  (A Blessing in Disguise)", "date": "Sunday 19 April 2020", "text": "Oops, there she goes, falling like a sack of potatoes, spilling herself all over the stairs.After a day spent largely in the garden, evening came with its normal quota of tiredness. Happy and contented tiredness. Eleven at night and time for bed. Had I shut the shed and garage? Better check. Yes, all safe and sound, no need to worry. Locking the inner door to the shed was the last thing to do before climbing the stairs. I hadn’t bothered to take off my thick-soled, non-slip trainers; that was my downfall. Literally. Turning on my toes my right foot refused to move, my left foot was in too much of a hurry, stumbled over the right and there you have it, I shot forward, unable to brake and came to rest on the stairs, my chin hitting the step with an enormous crack. Instantly blood came gushing out, with me in serious pain.Eleven o’clock at night, on your own, is not a good time for an accident of that nature. In the mirror I saw that my own teeth had cut my lower lip from inside to out. I googled “how to stop bleeding of the face and mouth”. Ice packs should do it in twenty minutes, Google said. Three ice packs later I was still bleeding. It was two am by now. I decided to ring 111 for advice, the service for non-emergency help. Initially I spoke to someone non medical, after a whole raft of questions they referred me to a nurse, who actually rang back a little later. Another raft of questions which I answered honestly, without making too much of a meal of it. All I wanted was advice on how to stop the bleeding. Halfway through the call the nurse said  ”the ambulance is on its way, you shouldn’t have to wait too long.” What? Hospital During The Time of Covid 19? Not bloody likely! I’d rather bleed to death in the comfort of my own home!Anyway, the ambulance did indeed turn up fairly soon. The paramedics weren’t even inside the house yet when I informed them that they had had a wasted journey, the bleeding was lessening and under no circumstances was I going to hospital with them. “There there,” they said, \"first let’s have a look at you.” They did what they called ‘obs’, (my blood pressure was off my personal scale) wrote it all down, both of them sitting on the floor, operating their various machinery, attempting to calm me down. We actually had quite a pleasant chat.By about three am the bleeding had most certainly lessened. Finally, the paramedics agreed that there was no immediate need for me to go into any hospital; instead they advised me to visit the local minor injuries unit the next day. I didn’t even do that. I’d rather spend the rest of my life with a deep scar on my lip than contract the virus and have no life left.Before they left they admitted that I was doing the right thing. “To be honest”, the female paramedic said, “before now, we have taken people to hospital for different reasons, without a fever, and the same people have come out with a high temperature.”Today, two evenings on, I have recovered somewhat from both the accident and the shock. Yesterday I spent the whole day dozing, taking painkillers, not even getting dressed. Today, I am feeling much better, I did a bit of gardening with Paul, and tried to eat on one side of my mouth. But the fat blue lip has already gone down, there is a bloody scab closing the wound, and I am hoping that there will be no inflammation. I might ring my surgery doctor for some advice on how best to avoid that.Wish me luck."},

Many times I have told myself ‘it doesn’t matter, nothing matters very much except to stay safe, stay well, stay in touch, stay hopeful.Soon we’ll all know the natural colour of our hair, mousy for the younger ones, grey for the older. I can lick the long hairs in the corners of my mouth,  time to get the magnifying mirror out and pluck.There’s nothing any of us can do to fix this. We worry about ourselves, our family, friends and neighbours. We are anxious and stressed, sleep is disrupted, we dream fearsome dreams. What we can do is start to control how we act. I cannot stop the worldwide spread of Covid-19 but I can control how I react to it in my own small world, in my mind. There is freedom in that. I can choose to eat healthily, take my allowed exercise, stay away from the relentless news bulletins, particularly before bed.I can decide to concentrate on the lighter side: I choose books, movies, documentaries which make me laugh or entertain me. I choose to listen to music whenever I feel like it. I enjoy a glass of wine, but not to excess. I don’t overeat.  I choose to resurrect my diary, write down my thoughts, focusing on the upside of my current routine, what I can do rather than what I can’t.I keep in touch with people, my son and I have a phone conversation once a week now, before lockdown we spoke maybe once a month. I’ve tried to renew contact with my daughter by sending her an email inviting her to forget and forgive, on both sides. She didn’t react. I can control my action towards her, I cannot control her reaction; what I cannot change I must accept. And move on. Lots of friends call, even those I hardly ever meet. I am happy to contact them in return.I try to keep active. For nearly five years I have felt bored with gardening. Looking after Beloved, then mourning him, took all my attention. Now my interest is back, gardening has become a pleasure again, I go out whenever the weather is nice enough and I get dirty, arse over elbow, digging and dividing, weeding and pruning. All the nurseries are closed, plants cannot be had easily; instead of replanting and restocking I am busy trying to eradicate pernicious, perennial weeds, like ground elder and celandines, which have colonised whole beds during the years of neglect.. Large empty patches don’t matter, nobody is going to see them and when the nurseries reopen I may have cleaned up the beds enough to replant.Above all, I try to keep positive, a wholly new departure for me. I allow myself to do only what gives pleasure, everything else I ignore. The day will come - I hope - when the luxury of feeling guilty returns, it doesn’t matter now. For now, nothing matters."},

I hope.Creativity is in short supply in my household, all I can think of doing is unravel the rugs and knit face masks with the proceeds. That is if I knew how to knit. Years ago I gave away all jigsaw puzzles, half finished embroidery tablecloths went down the charity route and painting by numbers has never appealed. Reading is a habit I won’t tire of anytime soon, unfortunately the last book I picked from the long list of “waiting to be read” is Isabell Allende’s “In the Midst of Winter”, too good to be put aside but also too deeply harrowing to be read without frequent recourse to a sip of wine and a piece of chocolate. I really need to forget about the improving kind of reading material and go back to the shelves of old favourites for a laugh. For a little light relief I watched the first two episodes of the new Sunday night costume saga “Belgravia”, Downton Abbey in the time of Waterloo; Mr. Fellowes, do you really need more dosh that badly?However, to culture, the high brow variety.Have you ever sat among an audience, clinging to the armrests of your seat, trying to prevent yourself shouting at the players? That’s what happened to me during “The Whip”, a brand new play about the abolition of slavery in 1834. On the surface, the achievement appears to be a heroic victory for human decency, in truth, slavery was followed by the appalling 'apprenticeship scheme', slavery by another name, with worse punishment. Slave owners were compensated for the loss of their ‘property’ with a multi-million pound Sterling windfall; in 2015 the money borrowed for this ‘bailout' was finally paid off by the British taxpayer. What made me want to shout and climb the stage was the naked greed, the inhumanity, corruption, mendacity, portrayed by the actors. I believed it all, and it reminded me forcibly of our own times.How different was the National Theatre’s “Cyrano De Bergerac”. Until quite late into the first scene I was still waiting for the play to begin, confused by a lineup of actors rapping at a fast and furious pace. This is a radical reboot of Rostand’s 1897 ‘wooing-by-proxy’ romantic classic and, once I understood what was going on, I loved it. James McAvoy was a fierce, proud, word-intoxicated Cyrano, never stumbling, never missing a beat. Yes, I loved it.And that will be that for the time being. All theatres are closed, as are all cinemas. No more live shows, no more streaming. Tickets already bought and paid for are invalid; I have no idea if the Royal Shakespeare Company will make refunds. The probable loss of money is not my first concern, I am more saddened by the loss of one of my favourite pastimes. My friends and I have tickets for performances at Stratford for two consecutive days in May, with an overnight stay at a fancy hotel.Ah well."},

I hardly even see or hear any dog walkers in the castle grounds. I went to the surgery yesterday morning for a blood test and a consultation with the practice nurse. I saw one cyclist and one car, no other pedestrians, for the 20 minutes it took me to get there. All doors to the surgery were closed, I had to ring a brand new bell to be allowed in. A receptionist came to the door, told me to use the hand gel and wait in the empty waiting room. I was assured that there would be nobody else waiting at the same time. The nurse soon called me in, she stayed at the farther end of the consulting room and I stopped by the door while we talked. She had to come close to take my blood but we instantly moved apart again when she had finished.It seems I have both COPD and asthma. Both recently diagnosed and only now confirmed. What a time to choose to develop lung disease! New medication works, I can breathe without wheezing.I had a few general questions for Nurse Marian about Marzena, my cleaner, and Paul, the gardener. Would I be allowed to have them still? Both need the income. Provided we all keep a 2 m distance,  wash our hands, or even better, for me to stay in a different room from Marzena and away from Paul in the garden, there should be no problem. Both are sensible people and want to risk neither their own health nor mine.I also had a more serious question for Marian. If I caught the virus, what were my chances? Would I die? She looked me in the eye and said, instantly, without hesitation and a dead straight face: “Yes”.That’s telling me in no uncertain terms!I suppose I am one of the lucky ones; I may be alone without family near, able or willing to help, but I have friends with whom I am in touch. We all keep an eye on each other. I am also resourceful; I live in a house with a good private outdoor space rather than an apartment block. I am quite able to look after myself and never need anyone to entertain me. The only family member moved to ring me without prompting was my former son-in-law, even my own son needed a reminder. He apologised for the lapse. Another bit of luck is that I am apparently on my supermarket’s list of vulnerable customers. How I got there is anybody’s guess. However, that means that they offer me a regular weekly delivery slot. There’s no guarantee that I get everything I order online, but they usually find an acceptable alternative. I even have a sufficient supply of toilet paper! Not having to stand in a queue is a huge weight off my shoulders.There’s much worse to come, this whole misery is to last for a long time yet. we are told that the peak of the epidemic in the UK will not be reached for another two to three weeks. Even that is no more than a guesstimate, of course. How anybody can think - and say - that things will be back to normal by Easter (Hey there, Mr Trump) in a country which has barely begun it’s COVID 19 journey buggers belief.I repeat my mantra from the previous post: Take care, look after yourselves and your loved ones and Good Luck to all of us."},

And as we are no longer free to meet up in person, whether family, friends or neighbours, digital contacts are becoming more and more important? In good times we consider each other friends here in blogland, how much more need do we have of a friendly comment in fearful times. That’s what I think, anyway, and if you are still around, maybe you do too.Although Valley’s End has no cases of coronavirus yet it is coming closer and closer and, no doubt, our tiny backwater will sooner or later fall prey. The village is preparing itself, the Good Neighbours group is recruiting under 70s to help with shopping, picking up prescriptions and keeping an eye on the vulnerable by phone. Over 70s are urged to avoid all social contact, stay at home except for walks in our beautiful countryside and, if meeting other walkers, to stand well away during chats. Naturally, stop and chat we will, a friendly place like ours prides itself on its networks of social interactions. Sadly, only at a distance now. Friends and acquaintances ring each other up - I’ve never had so many phone calls! - which helps a lot. Nobody must feel lost and forgotten and lacking assistance.Personally I have been in isolation for a couple of weeks already, only Paul and the cleaner come. I still go to the village corner shop while we are free of the disease. The supermarket delivers to my door, as does the butcher. I read, garden a bit (it’s still rather chilly for longer hours outside), watch TV and DVDs,  go for solitary walks and speak to people on the phone. I have started to cook proper meals again too. Yesterday, for the first time in ages, I cooked meat and potatoes and vegetables. I even had gravy! I ate it at the kitchen table, poured myself a glass of wine to go with it and enjoyed the food like I haven’t ever enjoyed my quickly thrown together, cooked from frozen, dishes. My regime is not really all that different from ordinary days and still quite bearable. I have relaxed my routine, get up later and go to bed later, often reading into the night. I find that exercise is very important, sometimes, on a really lazy day, when I’ve not been outside at all, by bedtime my bottom and back hurt from all the sitting and I stagger up the stairs like a very old woman.Now that we have passed the vernal equinox the days are longer than the nights and we welcome the warmer months. It should help with staying positive.What really makes me very angry are people who say : “Well, if I get it, I get it.” People who take no notice of others’ vulnerability, who continue to go out and about without having a valid reason, who congregate in large groups. People who party regardless. I want to say to them : “It’s not about you, I don’t care if you get it, I don’t care how ill you get, I care about the people you infect, who might be somebody’s loved one, the valuable hospital space you take up, the health workers you might infect. Stopping the spread of the disease, that’s what's important, not your personal convenience.So, dear friends, take care of yourselves and your loved ones and good luck to all of us. Back soon."},

I have no problem with people who travel, use distance public transport and have a hectic social life at any other time, but not now. Over 70s are encouraged to remain relatively stationary and as most of us don’t go out to work, a few weeks of fixed aboding shouldn’t be too onerous. I have some extra provisions in, plenty of books, a garden for pottering, birds to watch, music to listen to, fellow bloggers to interact with, and locals whom I can see when the need moves me. I am on steroids for asthma and therefore have a weakened immune system. Deliberately exposing myself to catching the virus would be silly. It’ll be unlucky enough to catch it involuntarily.So this is me for a bit.I went for a haircut the other day, a regular 5-weekly event which takes a fairly small outlay and a car journey of no more than 30 minutes total there and back. It was one of the cold and wet specials England goes in for with abundant gusto and I was looking forward to getting back beside the Aga. It’s a very narrow, winding country road which makes it difficult to go fast and I was taking my time, a typically rolling English road made by the rolling English drunkard. Almost back in Valley’s End the disaster happened. I hit a deep pothole, filled with water and therefore invisible, and first the front tyre, then the back tyre, burst. It was an explosive sound and I was momentarily thrown and quite scared. Once I collected my wits I knew I couldn’t stay where I was, anyone coming round the bend would have hit me, so I limped the car a few hundred meters, very slowly, leaning on its right side, until I could safely pull it off the lane. It’s never a bad idea to be close to your particular mechanic, ever since we moved here we’ve used the same chap and it only took him 10 minutes to come and rescue me. He drove me home, then picked up the car. He was back before evening, all four tyres present and correct.Insurance companies don’t cover pothole damage. This is deemed to be an ‘at-fault’ claim. So, as well as paying an excess, you could lose some of your no-claims bonus, and risk higher premiums in future.I was interested in the etymology of ‘pothole’  : a depression or hollow in a road surface caused by wear or subsidence. From dialectal pot (“pit, hollow, cavity”) +‎ hole in Middle English.Some say potholes are so called because of the potters who dug up chunks of clay from the Roman Empire's smooth roadways, more than 3,000 years ago. That explanation is more romantic but possibly less likely than the ordinary etymological one."},
{"title": "By no Means a Surfeit of Culture  (part 1)", "date": "Friday 6 March 2020", "text": "Surfeit: (noun) an excessive amount of somethingor , acc. to Duke Orsino in Twelfth Night Act 1, scene 1\"If music be the food of love, play on,Give me excess of it; that surfeiting,The appetite may sicken, and so die.Well, for me it wasn’t an excess of anything, just enough, more like, and there’s more to follow yet, and certainly not enough to sicken the appetite; rather, let me call it a sufficiency.The Sleeping Beauty is a grand, formal and very human ballet. It's packed full of radiant dancing and touches of observation, often both at once; it is danced with great depth, contrast and warmth. Magnificent scenery, exquisite costumes,Tchaikovsky’s exuberant score, and a huge cast, what’s not to like? And, of course, it all ends happily-ever-after, Princess Aurora is awakened by Prince Florimund and wicked Carabosse disappears, never to be seen again.Nobody speaks, is betrayed, dies or goes mad in Jerome Robbins’s ballet “Dances at a Gathering,” but this hourlong, pure-dance work, set to an anthology of Chopin piano pieces, is nonetheless a multilayered masterpiece of theatre.\"Within months of its 1969 premiere (with New York City Ballet, which revives it this week), there was so much talk about its characters and narratives that Robbins (the choreographer)sent a letter to the quarterly Ballet Review written like a telegram: “THERE ARE NO STORIES TO ANY OF THE DANCES IN DANCES AT A GATHERING. THERE ARE NO PLOTS AND NO ROLES. THE DANCERS ARE THEMSELVES DANCING WITH EACH OTHER TO THAT MUSIC IN THAT PLACE.”You make of it what you will. You could, like I did, simply watch and follow breathlessly, as Chopin’s various pieces unfold, with music and dance merging into one brilliant experience.As good as Sleeping Beauty and Dances at a Gathering were they came nowhere near the brand new ballet 'The Cellist', the story of the life of Jacqueline du Pre, who died, at 42, 30years ago. The story is told through the instrument, which is danced by Marcelino Sambe, and goes from her childhood and first lessons through her years as a player of extraordinary talent to her illness and death, the cello falling silent at last.It was a breathtaking performance, inspirational, powerfully affecting, utterly moving. I rarely go overboard for a ballet, but see this if you can.So what a huge difference the film of ‘Downton Abbey’ was compared to anything else I’ve seen during the first two months of the year. Firstly, the theatre was crammed full of old people, many on sticks, in wheelchairs, pushing walking aids, accompanied by carers. Chatty and lively, excited to be 'out on licence’, humming like bees in a beehive, they were shepherded to their seats, where they stayed, relatively quietly, waiting for their favourite show to unfold and Maggie Smith’s acerbic comments to tickle their funnybone. There was much laughter at the appropriate moments and quite a few satisfied sighs when Downton’s ‘belowstairs’ got one over on the Royal entourage.Personally, I thought the film was harmless fun, nothing to get excited over, rather painting-by-numbers and predictable; I watched the TV series and this was in much the same vein. I expect you’ve all long seen it and enjoyed it. I did too, finally."},
{"title": "Allegiances", "date": "Tuesday 25 February 2020", "text": "It is time for all the heroes to go homeif they have any; time for all of us common onesto locate ourselves by the real thingswe live by.William StaffordIt’s quite unbelievable, we have had the fourth flood! Five, if you count separate floods on two consecutive days. And it’s not over yet, there is more heavy rain to come by the end of the week and showers in between. Shrewsbury town centre is still under water. I was supposed to go to a funeral in the town yesterday. I’m afraid I chickened out, together with three friends who were going in the same car. We went to the local pub instead and drank a toast to the deceased. We weren’t exactly proud of ourselves but we felt safer and quite relieved once we had come to a decision. It doesn’t do for the old and infirm (one of us was in a wheelchair - one in her early nineties -  one disabled and only me reasonably mobile) to be foolhardy.My image as a high-flying, brainy, intellectual and altogether smartypanty, (yea, sure) if foreign, pillar of our particular society is taking a thorough beating. There I was, at a party for people on the losing side of the Remain/Leave partition, every member an academic, artist, engineer and professional, all vocal and committed to our joint cause. All talking absolute sense (that is, if you are on our side of the argument), with the debate hotting up a bit as the evening progressed. This was the first party I had been invited to since I’ve been on my own, all previous invitations have been to small groups, lunches and dinner parties. Whenever I find myself in such company I instantly feel like an impostor, a fraud, somebody who shouldn’t really be there. My reaction to such discomfort? I talk, I argue, I debate, tell stories, until many eyes are on me. Afterwards, at home, I feel utterly embarrassed.This time there was an additional embarrassment: my frequent attendance at the 'Ladies who Lunch’ was brought up by a gossipy guest and it seems that it is by no means a secret that I have truck with Leavers and right-wingers. There were nods all round when I asked if everyone in Valley’s End knew. Luckily, this was cause for good-natured hilarity and I was teased mercilessly, rather than shunned and berated. Having felt uncomfortable about the Ladies’ conversation a few times now, I will try and see less of them, although I have no wish to offend them. Yes, their opinions can drive me mad, but they are kind and welcoming every time.Like I said, this was the very first larger party I attended on my own. I knew a few of the guests and the hostess is a fellow foreigner and we therefore can get together and vent about ‘the English and their quaint customs’ and find we have a lot in common.We’ve both been here for decades. But, I did miss Beloved, all the others were coupled and went home  two-by-two. No matter how welcoming and friendly people are, it takes quite an effort to find your personal shaped niche to settle into by yourself.I am off to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford with two friends tomorrow - both eminently able-bodied. That means I won’t have to look after anyone but myself if we get stuck in a flood somewhere. The play, “The Whip\" is brand new, not sure that I will enjoy it. “Electrifying, compelling”, says the blurb."},
{"title": "On the Home Front", "date": "Monday 17 February 2020", "text": "Valley’s End is flooded for the third time in just a few weeks; storm Dennis was worse than last weekend’s Ciara. In my twenty years here I have not seen the bottom field, where I regularly walked my dogs,  as deep under water as this morning. The rain has been incessant and there’s more to come  next week. I am so sorry for my neighbours who live along the river bank and whose cottages and houses are inundated with muddy brown river water from further up the valley in the Welsh hills.I have stopped slavishly following the news, I just can’t bear it anymore. There is never anything good on offer, just the same endlessly miserable, spiteful, nasty, mean reports and opinion pieces, full of doom and gloom. It is all too depressing. Instead I watch the birds busily devouring everything I put out for them from my kitchen window. I have been wondering: all those tiny creatures like siskins, blue tits, gold finches, nuthatches, what happens to them during storms?Are they blown off course? Or do they shelter in the hedges duringthe worst of the weather? I have whole families of gold finches(middle picture) landing on my feeders, would they be the samebirds as the ones before the storms? They love sunflower hearts, perhaps they fight for the right to return? As soon as I fill the container the gold finches are back. The others are all happy with peanuts, fat balls and mixed seeds. As their name implies, nuthatches love peanuts best. (the bird with the go-faster eye stripe)The previous week we had one good day and Paul and I worked in the garden, the first time this year. It was still very cold and the wind had already started, but there was a bit of sunshine and we managed a decent three hours.I’ve told you about Paul before, he isn’t a patch on old gardener, but I’ve got used to him. He actually volunteered a comment or two while we were having our tea break. Last autumn he was still deep in the clutches of depression, barely able to function. Sometimes he seemed to be falling asleep on his feet. I can’t just turn him off while he is so poorly, I’d feel mean and unkind; I think he is glad that I am still employing him and perhaps that’s why he seemed brighter this year. It is also possible that he has recovered a bit, he has treatments and sees somebody regularly. This person, who is a kind of health visitor, also helps him in practical ways. Paul has no other income than the money he makes from gardeningand a few artistic things like designing andcreating greetings cards, bird boxes, trugs,and other woodworkings, large and small.He is a creative soul and when he feels wellenough he spends time in his workshop.He lives on an amount that wouldn’t cover my utilities bills, much less food and drink and treats. For years I and another employer have tried to push him into applying for benefit payments but he always insisted that he didn’t want to do this. This health visitor has persuaded him and helped with filling in the relevant forms and I am very hopeful that he will at least receive some financial assistance. I know people who are so good at milking the system that they are doing very nicely, and have done for years, yet someone like Paul, who certainly deserves help, goes without.As you can see from the picture snowdrops will soon be over but the hellebores are only just coming into their own. Roll on spring."},
{"title": "Compliments and what they lead to.", "date": "Sunday 9 February 2020", "text": "\"You are looking really well. Have you got over . . . ?” That’s where she stopped, a little unsure of whether she had paid me a compliment or been tactless. But she did sound surprised and as if she meant it. Christina is not one of my close friends; we just happened to have been invited to the same Remainers’ Party.She was by no means the first person to tell me that I am looking well, several others have said so recently, close friends as well as casual acquaintances. Looking in the mirror I noticed pink cheeks but no great changes otherwise. Apart from a slightly shorter haircut. Jay, who is a friend, had complimented me only a few days earlier, also with a surprise in her voice. So I decided to find out what they thought the difference was.“Tell me then, if you find me looking surprisingly well, how did I look before?” Both Christina and Jay were taken aback; apparently it is not polite to put people on the spot, we are meant to say ’thank you’ and move on. Both eventually gave in. “Well\", said Christina, “you look less oppressed, freer, brighter.” And Jay said “a cloud seems to have lifted from over you.” Nothing to do with health, nothing to do with make-up or dress; nothing but a change in attitude. And because my general attitude has changed I sleep better, I appreciate small things in life, look forward more than backward.  There are days when I feel strangely elated for hours on end, burrowing into a a deep sense of well-being, as into a safe and cosy nest.It’s taken three years since Beloved died to find myself again. I expect there will be sad and dismal days, but the worst is over. One never gets over the loss of a special person but it gets easier to cope.I believe that Christina Koch had it right when she said : \"Do what scares you. everyone should think about what intrigues them and what draws them in. Those things can be scary, but they usually mean you are interested.”Ms Koch is the female astronaut who has just returned to earth after the longest continuous spaceflight a woman has ever undertaken. 328 days in space, just think of it, nearly a whole year.Should we all challenge ourselves, no matter how old or infirm? Taking complete control of my life, dealing with authority, workmen, the day to day running of my household, having sole responsibility for finances and making them tally, overcoming such challenges as facing the taxman, lawyers and officialdom; rain coming through the roof and windows leaking; yes, I have had quite a time of it and, yes, it was scary most of the time. I have not been on a spaceflight like Ms Koch but I might as well have been for all the lessons I have learned.As, for example, on just one tiny occasion I was dithering if I should accept the new toilet bowl the plumber had brought. I hated it, it left a large piece of flooring uncovered after he had installed it. I knew I would hate it forever and feel newly annoyed every time I went into the bathroom; the old me had Beloved to back her up, the single me was worried that the plumber might simply refuse to change the bowl for one with a bigger pedestal. Still, I stood my ground, quaking inside, and he agreed to dismantle the new installation. He charged me, of course, and next time I will know better and check before any job is completed. But, and this is the important bit, I felt enormously proud of myself!No wonder I am looking better. It’s true, a cloud has lifted, I am coping.So, what do you think? Is it good for us to come out of our comfort zone and face new challenges with courage and determination? Or should we look for anything for a quiet and undemanding life? There are times when the latter is not possible, of course. Many of my still coupled friends say they don’t have the first idea of how to cope without their husbands. I hope they won’t have to, but, if they do, I can tell them that anything is possible."},

{"title": "The Taxman, Viruses, Kindness and Otherwise", "date": "Friday 31 January 2020", "text": "There is just about still time to wish you all a happy and peaceful new year. Had I waited until tomorrow, being February, it might have been both embarrassing and possibly even offensive. If only we could all assume that 2020 will be less harrowing than 2019 was, what with the horror news from so many parts of the world. Although the WHO’s warning of a global epidemic caused by an unknown strain of coronavirus doesn’t give cause for much optimism for the next few weeks.Talking of the virus, one of the Ladies Who Lunch brought it up as a subject and the oldest member of the group, at 92 at least a decade ahead of the next oldest member, instantly remarked :”Well, I hope it doesn’t come here.” And, I am certain, she was definitely not thinking of anyone’s wellbeing but her own. It surprised me, I would think that at 92 continued life is precarious anyway. There was no empathy for anyone suffering the effects of the virus, which one would consider to be the automatic response to start with, just “not me please,” Does one get more selfish the older one gets? Of course, nobody, me included, welcomes any kind of illness, world-wide or localised, but a little of the milk of human kindness towards others goes a long way to make life pleasant. Or am I wrong? Too much rose-tint?After two months of silence from me there may not be anyone interested in my thoughts. I developed a positive aversion to using my computer. I spent hours on the iPad and my phone, checking up on news and opinion pieces, but couldn’t bring myself to open the Mac. The reason is positively weird: I had the greatest trouble accessing the taxman’s site. Since October I have struggled to convince HMRC (Her Maj’s Revenue and Customs for those of you lucky not to have dealings with them) that I exist, that I have lived and worked and paid taxes here for decades, and that all I wanted was to be allowed to continue with the latter part in retirement. Do you think they believed me? Endless repeats of trying to gain access, endless rebuffs; each time I was told : you have tried to prove your identity too many times, come back in two days’ time. I sent emails, requests for assistance, even a long and heartfelt letter, all without success. So, since I use my Mac for official communications, (as well as blogging), it became my enemy, because HMRC remained closed to me. In the end I rang them. In an hour long call the first person I was referred to couldn’t help; the next person, a superior tax adviser person, scratched her head and was willing to cut me off when she was equally as flummoxed as the first.I have to say that I am very good at begging and pleading and announcing my great age, and therefore great need, to all and sundry in the cause of soliciting assistance. Quite shameless, that’s me. So, once I had a real life person on the line rather than an uncaring computer, I begged and pleaded for all I was worth, even explaining that I was quite likely to be deported if I couldn’t prove my willingness to pay the correct taxes. I forgot to say that one of the questions the soulless computer threw at me many times, was, “do you have a valid British passport?” I don’t, but what has that to do with the price of fish, i.e. tax payments?The superior tax adviser person softened and, during a further hour long phone conversation, dreamt up a whole new persona for me, going back to my tax records of years back. In the process she and I discovered that I have two “Unique (yes, unique) Tax References, two addresses, and two names. I think I am going to start next year’s tax returns right at the start, i.e. next April. And perhaps I’ll use a paper return. Last year I paid my accountant £600 to fill in my tax return, I am not willing to be fleeced again for work I have already mostly done myself, so now that this year’s return is done I am hoping that next year’s will proceed more smoothly.I should mention that Christmas was fun. Ten days beforehand my son came; he put up the tree, with me giving instructions. We had  Christmas music, a festive dinner, some convivial family chat and rekindled old memories. This visit, on his own, is becoming a tradition I love. He also took me to the county town for a shopping trip; he carried my purchases between shops and car, which makes it all so much easier for me. I quite dread having to stumble my way through crowds, burdened with bags.My friends were the real stars of my Christmas. Sue said I might as well come for Christmas Eve dinner as well as Christmas Day itself, which was really kind of her. She had some houseguests too and we all got on very well - no Brexit fallings out - and after a lengthy and leisurely dinner we read ’The Importance of Being Earnest’ with me taking over the role of Lady Bracknell. Halfway through the read-through my voice started to go which made it all the more grittily posh, just what is needed for the part. It was great fun and so much more so than slumping in a chair, replete with overindulgence and half drunk as well.My voice going was a harbinger of the chest infection to come, which started more or less on Boxing Day and only stopped when the practice nurse forced me to take a course of steroids after New Year. I was really quite poorly with a cough to rattle every tooth in my head. The infection was doubly disturbing because I have recently been diagnosed with a recurrence of my childhood asthma. Apparently that is not uncommon, childhood asthma will frequently show itself in old age, when we become more susceptible to allergies. Strange that, you’d think we’d have become inured to many infections because we’ve had and survived so many of them through life. Not so, it seems.I have mentioned Brexit but once today; in common with many friends I am sick and tired of the whole business, depressed too. In an hour’s time I am off to a Brexit wake party for remainers only.I’ll be back here soon, unless we all throw ourselves off the castle battlements."},
{"title": "Happiness Factor? It’s a joke, right?", "date": "Wednesday 4 December 2019", "text": "So there I was, aiming for human interaction resulting in happiness, or at least a semblance of contentment.Fat chance.Not that it was all bad. A friend and I went off to see a modern re-imagining of John Gay’s 1728 work \"The Beggar's Opera\" by Mid Wales Opera Company, a production for small spaces and therefore very intimate. Renamed “Mrs. Peachum’s Guide to Love And Marriage” it is a splendidly bawdy, ballsy take on relationships and the relative virtues of virginity. We enjoyed it and, what’s more, my friend and I didn’t fall out in spite of getting into politics.Another event was a Spanish Evening set up by a local group. There was tapas, Spanish wine, some haphazard music and three short, separate, talks about the painter Joaquin Sorolla, Spanish food and how the speaker liked to cook it and wine talk. The wine talk was the only professional talk, which means that the whole hall could hear that speaker. The other two never remembered to speak into the microphone, in spite of an audience member begging them to do so. What made it worse for me was that I had chosen to sit at a table towards the back of the hall (ready to scarper?) just in front of the wine table where the volunteer wine server chose to use the time of the talks to rearrange his crates of bottles, picking up each bottle, checking it for dregs and plonking it back into its hole in the crate. He took absolutely no notice of my anguished looks in his direction and clinked on busily. Not the most enjoyable evening all told.You can simply not rely on people to do as they say. I took a very wheezy chest to my doctor; yes, he examined me, asked a few questions and came up with the idea that my childhood asthma might have returned. And yes, he was going to investigate and consult another doctor. \"So, should I make another appointment,” I asked. “O no, I’ll ring you later this afternoon.” That was two weeks ago. Not a peep out of the surgery since then.Gadgets aren’t a whole lot more reliable, either. The whole area had a power cut. When the power came back on after several hours I mentally congratulated the electricity firm and settled down for a cosy evening. By and by the room cooled down, quite considerably by the time I bestirred myself to check on the boiler. One very dead boiler. This was Friday evening of the coldest weekend this year with frost and freezing fog forecast. I fiddled around and tried to relight it but it just grumbled and coughed at me. I spent some time online trying to find the nearest engineer but gave up and rang the manufacturer's company itself - Worcester-Bosch - who are many miles away but have always seen me right in the past. Many miles away also means an expensive call-out, of course. “Yes, we’ll come, On Monday.” Between Friday evening and Monday morning I wore thermal layers, several pairs of thick socks, my pyjamas under trousers and jumpers - who is going to undress completely in a freezing cold bathroom? - , carried around two small fires, and forgot about personal cleanliness entirely. What on Earth do people do who do not have immediate access to the wherewithal necessary to pay for an emergency like this? I had ice flowers on the windows, for heaven’s sake. The female engineer discovered that the power cut had blown the circuit board. She replaced it, serviced the boiler and made sure that all was back in order before she left.Next stop a major building job. I had my windows on the South side of the house replaced, all eight of them. I was pleasantly surprised by the result. Beloved would have been livid, several years before we debated if we should swap wooden windows for plastic. “Absolutely not,” was his conclusion. \"Wooden widows are so much more attractive.” No they’re not, says I. They require constant repainting, repairing and splicing, none of it cheap. So now I have perfectly fitting, draught excluding, plastic windows on the weather side. I was also pleasantly surprised by the workmen doing the job. They were relatively quiet, cleaned up after themselves and caused minor disruption, allowing me to escape to a different room with each window. Even so, there was a moment when the boss man and I almost fell out. Over Brexit, what else. He was a fervent Leaver who trotted out all the long-discredited lies we were told three years ago. There is no getting through to some. I wished him Good Luck and left the room quickly.  I had learned my lesson from a previous experience, much more painful and embarrassing, which I’ll come to next.You see, there was this dinner party at a very good friend’s house, the guests being a couple from London, a couple from Valley’s End and me. We have met at this house in previous years, always get on well and usually have a splendid evening, with lots of wine, food, good conversation and a general feeling of goodwill to all assembled. Except this time I related my experiences and feelings about the need to apply for Settled Status after 50 years of living the UK, once Brexit has become reality. O dear. It appeared that the couple from London and the host, with whom they were staying for the weekend, had already had a falling-out the previous evening. So my remark simply stirred the flames all over again. It was most unpleasant for a while, a lot of wine had been consumed and tempers flared, in a quietly genteel way, neither bad language nor insults were employed, but tempers flared. I know that families have fallen out, co-workers have fallen out, friends have fallen out over this wretched business but I never imagined that a genial host and his guests would suddenly, in the middle of a most enjoyable dinner party, stage a mini-war. At the moment the UK is not a friendly place.So, human interaction is all very well, but it does not necessarily lead to happiness."},
{"title": "The Happiness Factor - Can I get hold of it?  Part I", "date": "Friday 8 November 2019", "text": "`’Do you live here all by yourself?”Micky was new to the German Conversation group. She hadn’t been to my house before and during her visit she went and stood at every window downstairs looking out on to the garden covered in gold, red and orange beech leaves, the dark shapes of the yews and hollies punctuating the afternoon gloom and the vistas of the hills beyond my hedges. “Beautiful”, she said, “it must be a lot of work.”It’s only when somebody else remarks on it that you realise that, yes, you are all alone in too much space, that the space calls for more work than you could cope with if you had to do it yourself and that, really, could you be considered selfish? Apart from having it brought home to me in no uncertain terms that I am indeed completely alone now I pushed the thought away. Environmental footprints, paying others to do my unpleasant work, using up more resources than one person should are all genuine and valid concerns, but I don’t want to complicate my life more than it is. For now.There has recently been yet another study into the happiness factor. Truly happy people are ‘people who need people’, who have strong bonds with friends and family and regular contact. As you all know I have no strong bonds with anyone, I don’t feel I need people, but there are periods when I feel lonely, dejected, depressed. So I am giving the happiness factor a chance to invade my world by accepting every invitation, grab every opportunity for social interaction, take up any cultural entertainment on offer, talk to people in the street and in shops and butt in to casual conversations of a general nature.The cultural entertainment part has been a great success: Donizetti’s Don Pasquale with Bryn Terfel as the elderly bachelor conned into thinking he is marrying a supposedly demure convent girl, only to find her a domineering, even tyrannical wife the moment the ring is on her finger, was fun. Terfel was made for the role.Then there was an excellent production ofA Midsummer Nights Dream with Titania being played by Gwendoline Christie. The theatre becomes the forest – a dream world of flying fairies, contagious fogs and moonlight revels.Hammed Animashaun was a very funny Bottom.I’ve seen ’The Dream’ a number of times, this production will stick in the mind and not only because of well known stars of small and large screens.Lastly a new play ‘Hansard’ about the private life of a Conservative MP under Margaret Thatcher who comes back to his house in the Cotswolds after a week of controversial debate in London. There are only two actors on stage, the MP and his wife, who start out sparring in a sort of routine way but as the day draws on the familiar rhythms of marital scrapping quickly turn to blood-sport.Lindsay Duncan and Alex Jennings were excellent. Towards the end it became so harrowing I held my breath.So, the cultural element of my past few weeks was a success, enough to let a chink of happiness through my anti-social armour. Now for human interactions."},
{"title": "Looking back , looking forward", "date": "Friday 18 October 2019", "text": "My darling Millie has died. In her last days she could barely make it to the lawn and often poo'd on the flags of the terrace. She deteriorated quite quickly and I finally had to make the decision to call the vet to the house. Lovely Marzena, my Polish cleaner, was here. She too loves dogs and she sat with Millie, cuddling her and scratching her neck while we were waiting for the vet to arrive. I gave her her afternoon feed hours early, which she ate with visible enjoyment in spite of her wobbly legs. Without Marzena I could not have done it; as it was, I cried and cried and was ready to change my mind again.  The vet knows me for the wimp I am and she and her nurse came within the hour. So that’s that.I’ve not been terribly happy since then, in fact, I’ve not been at ease with myself ever since Beloved died. Millie was the last living link with him, she was my companion, a creature I talked to and petted, who followed me around and gave me a reason to get up in the morning, to go out in all weathers, to feed and water, to keep as happy as she was making me. With all of them gone, Beloved and Millie, before them my parents, the goodwill of one child gone for good and only a loose connection with the other, I am truly alone in any meaningful sense. The house is empty and quiet. I have no family here or in Germany.So now it’s time to come to terms with the remainder of my life. A peaceful existence is what I am aiming for. This should be my time for being, not doing. No more struggle, no more achievement, no more passion. All passion spent. A time for being only myself, in kindness and forbearance rather than trying to make changes, in my life or  that of anyone else.Old age brings calm, if we are lucky. With so much experience, a lifetime of ups-and-downs, of miserable times as well as deliriously happy times, of ill-health and good health, much like any other human being, why do I still feel that I must be doing, actively go forward, get involved, be part of movements, experience new horizons?Tuesday evening I went to a restaurant with a friend who is madly active, who has just spent a week in London as a First-Aider during the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations. Once again I felt ashamed that I seem to have lost all fight, all passion. That I feel disinclined to climb on barricades, take up new studies, a new cause, an all consuming hobby. Soon people are going to suggest that I must be bored at home, that I must lack much needed stimulation, that I ought to go on exciting holidays. Etc.Basically, if I am truthful, I must say that I am rather lazy now. There is a battle going on inside me, a battle between letting go on the one hand and feeling that I must not be seen to have stepped off the treadmill on the other; that my own little bubble, now much shrunk, is where I would like to live without shame or guilt. Being lazy makes me want for the desire for disappearing into my bubble to win. There are so many things right here at home which please me, books, talking to friends, my garden, modest social occasions, tv and visits to see plays or listen to concerts. Instead I seem to be recycling the same thoughts, the same questions, the same uncertainties, over and over again, without ever coming to a decision. I would be happy and contented if I could come to no more than simply a workable resolution that doesn’t particularly lead anywhere except to an acceptance of the status quo.My friend Jay called this afternoon to help me with my Application for Settled Status in the UK post Brexit. About time too that I got down to that. Having prevaricated for ages is just another sign of my current state of mind. The Home Office still can’t cope with iPhones; my friend uses Android so she very kindly made the application for me on that. Afterwards we came to chat and I told her about my current lack of motivation. I speculated if I should go and see a therapist to rid me of the feelings of guilt and shame at my idleness. I have an inkling where these feelings come from: years and years of being responsible for the smooth running of my life and that of first, my parents, and then my children. My friend said, fine, now we know why you are feeling useless, but, and this is the big but: whose rules are these? Who says you must be doing, achieving? You are no longer responsible for anyone but yourself. Jay became quite heated. “If you want to sit all day picking your nose, you can.” She is right, of course, but how do you change the conditioning of a lifetime overnight?This is getting to be a long post, I’d better stop now. No doubt I will be pondering these existential questions for some time yet, like many others have done before me. And many who come after me will do. And also no doubt, I will be rehashing them here. For now writing this down is helping."},
{"title": "Sheer Escapism", "date": "Monday 9 September 2019", "text": "Fully autumn soon, the nights are drawing in, there’s a chill in the air and the leaves of the Japanese ornamental cherry show just the faintest tinge of burgundy. Millie is still with me, she seems to be having a reprieve in her general health - not the arthritis, alas - and I have decided to shut the back door at night. It keeps the warmth in and she has a more comfortable time of it in the scullery. If I have to clean up after her, so be it. It won’t be forever. And it doesn’t happen every night either.The hedge cutters are here, another sign of autumn. Raindrops are dripping on them but they are hardy young men; “it’s only water”  said the one I took round the perimeter of the garden to give instructions on what needed trimming. True, but I myself still sheltered under a big umbrella. And I needed his arm to help me over a very steep slippery grassy bit without falling over. He promptly fell over himself, should have asked me for my arm in return.There is so little that is pleasant in this world at the moment that I am seriously keen not to add to the misery for myself. Yes, I am still obsessed with current affairs, yes, I still shout curses at politicians whenever they appear on TV spouting barefaced lies, yes, I still dread what is happening to our climate and the environment. What to do? Withdraw from the whole unholy mess of it? Could be. Escape at least occasionally. Evenings start earlier, earlier evenings require indoor activities rather than balmy nights spent outdoors. Reading, TV and maybe closer attention to this blog of mine again, after several years of neglect. Which brings me to another question: are you old enough to indulge in bad taste books, films, TV shows without embarrassment? To my surprise quite a few of the ‘ladies who lunch’ admit to doing so. Well, in that case, so do I. Not exclusively, of course. I couldn’t possibly live on a diet of sweets and chocolates, burgers and ready meals, neither can I feed my brain exclusively on pap. However, a Georgette Heyer Regency romance, a cosy mystery from the 'Golden Era', a Mary Stewart adventure, a Robin Hobb fantasy, even a Scandi noir thriller insinuate themselves on to my Kindle now and then. (I am too embarrassed to put hard copies on bookshelves). All of the foregoing have one thing in common, they all end happily-ever-after. As for TV, well, the ladies admit to switching on certain channels which run endless repeats of British and American sitcoms, British country village thrillers and long running soaps. I have to be very tired before I give ‘Midsomer Murders' another go - it’s too much like painting-by-numbers - but it’s been known to fill the odd otherwise sadly depressing space. Morse, Endeavour and Shetland are more to my taste. I can take Agatha Christie's Miss Marple or Poirot as well, if needed. I am not so good on films, but a romcom would hit the spot nicely too.So, there you have it, Friko’s image as culturally high-brow is shattered. I always knew it and now that escapism has become ever more urgent I am old enough to blow a raspberry at anyone who feels judgement coming on. Not you, obviously.For those who like natural history and the science of it here’s a recommendation which is neither pap nor instant escapism: Peter Wohlleben’s ’The Hidden Life of Trees’, an informative study and fascinating look into the enchantment of trees that can talk and sometimes walk - no it’s not a fairy tale. You’ll gain a whole new perspective on the amazing processes of life, death and regeneration of woodlands. The better sort of escapism."},
{"title": "Trials and Tribulations", "date": "Wednesday 28 August 2019", "text": "After three hot days the rain is back. From my window it looks like the whole world is weeping. Summer? What summer? I have that English disease of always complaining about the weather, whether it’s godawful or, as it occasionally is, only mildly godawful.Things started out ok, I had a medical - which my surgery forces on people over 70 with underlying conditions like dodgy hearts or kidneys or whatever - and the results came back fine. I’ll live to complain another day.Then I called the vet to the house to check Millie over. He came prepared to do the foul deed but she was having a good day, gave him a little wag and went to her treats corner all hopeful. Apparently, she is on her last legs, riddled with arthritis, has a heart murmur and water on the lungs, both of which make her pant, wheeze and cough intermittently. Her organs are weakening and her toilet habits leave much to be desired. The vet gently pointed out that things aren’t really fair on me now, what with her special needs, but damn that dog, she looks at me still bright-eyed, follows me around, even climbing the stairs, and eats like a pig. (How do pigs eat? Are they much slandered?) I just couldn’t do it. The vet says she may deteriorate next week or next month, that it won’t be long now and every day I dread the evening when I have to shut the kitchen door on her and leave her in the fast cooling scullery with the back door open. Last night I shut the back door. I had taken her out down the drive for a few yards about midnight and she actually did a big poo, to my relief.  Surely she wouldn’t do another one during the night? She did; I know she cannot help herself but cleaning up after her is far from undiluted joy.On top of it all Beloved is getting in on the act. I woke up with a start at seven on the dot this morning because he called to me. “Are you awake?” I swear it was his voice. My dad once spoke to me clearly like that too. A long time ago. I hate being woken up abruptly and called out “I am now, leave me alone.” If only. It took a couple of seconds to remind myself that he has been gone for more than two years. Is his spirit fluttering around somewhere in the cosmos making sure I treat our dog properly ? If so, he should have woken me up an hour earlier, I could have let her out sooner and might have gone back to bed after feeding her.Things get worse, if you are at all squeamish stop reading now. The night before last I committed murder, involuntary frog slaughter. It caused me a lot of stress and I can’t see why those of you still reading shouldn’t get stressed too. Once again the back door was involved. It’s wide open all summer long, not just for Millie’s sake. Normally, I lean it against a chair at night, stopping it from flying open under a sudden gust of wind. And also so I can hear the noise of it being pushed open by a burglar, which would cause me to jump out of bed, grab the truncheon I inherited from my dad, fly down the stairs with a blood curdling yell and lay about me, scaring any intruder into fleeing for his life. That’s the plan, anyway.So, night before last, I was ready to shove the door against the chair, or vice versa if you like, and it wouldn’t shut. I tried again, pushing a bit harder. Still no luck. I looked down into the corner of the frame and the body of the door where the obstacle appeared to be and found a frog, very dead by now, bleeding over the doorstep, having been squeezed out of his life.  The silly creature had come in out of the cold several nights earlier and I had forgotten about his habit of seeking shelter just inside the frame. I hardly slept all night, envisaging his final horrible minute. I kept telling myself his death throes can’t have lasted very long, him getting squeezed would compare to one of us being pushed against a wall by a juggernaut, which would see the end of us in no time flat. But still, harming any creature, (apart from one of the current crop of politicians, of course), is wholly against my nature.The pictures are of Millie and the frog in happier days."},
{"title": "Room to Think", "date": "Friday 16 August 2019", "text": "Rain, rain, nothing but rain.Yesterday, when I saw the weather forecast, I was pleased. A whole day to myself with nobody to disturb my peace. It’s been a busy  couple of weeks, with gardening, a shopping trip, a family visit, a couple of luncheon engagements with friends, nothing arduous or stressful, but enough to make me look forward to solitude.  It was the American poet Marianne Moore who said \"the cure for loneliness is solitude” and I must admit that seeing too much of people often leaves me feeling lonely.Today, I feel differently. This rain is too depressing and I’d love a bit of company. So, in the absence of ‘live’ companions, I am turning to you.One of solitude’s gifts is room to think. Not that thinking leads to much in my case on a day like today, but when I sit doing nothing else thinking stray thoughts is a natural consequence. Normally I’d sit and read but, unlike my natural hedonistic attitude to life, I felt a bit guilty for doing nothing all day. So I sat and thought. Mainly about people and my perception of them as relating to me. And that is, of course, where things get complicated. I do tend to overanalyse.I may have mentioned it before: do you enjoy a good argument or do you go with ‘anything for a quiet life’? When meeting groups of acquaintances and friends do you prefer like-minded people or are you happy to leave your comfort zone and listen to opinions you don’t share? Do you bite your tongue when someone expresses themselves in a forceful manner on subjects which you find yourself diametrically opposed to? Do you allow them to have and hold opinions in the spirit of free speech or do you fight your corner, always realising that that might lead to a fight? Or do you say ’there is no arguing with some people’ and leave it at that? Some of the ladies I meet read newspapers I wouldn’t keep for toilet paper and they do insist on repeating the viewpoint, angle and stance such papers espouse. Sometimes it’s just gossip, for instance the permanent negative bias towards Meghan Markle or ridicule of the environmentalist teenager Greta Thunberg, at other times it's the vicious anti immigrant, anti gay, racist mindset. Bearing in mind that these subjects do not come up every time you meet and that these ladies are actually friendly and helpful in many other respects do you continue to meet with them? Or is meeting with them just not worth the hassle?Tell me what you think."},
{"title": "All Is Only Transitory", "date": "Tuesday 30 July 2019", "text": "I was looking for a quote to express what I want to say today; there are many, of many words, whole passages, to say just this one thing: nothing lasts for ever. So I gave Goethe pride of place, for he expressed my thoughts in just these four words.For days on end I have been out in the garden, morning and late afternoon, whenever the temperature allowed. In the middle afternoon I had siesta, sitting reading or snoozing indoors. So gardening is much on my mind. Particularly one aspect of it made me turn philosophical. I don’t know what made me think that gardening is a pursuit which follows the same lines forever, you’d think I should know by now, after close on thirty years of it. Having more or less ignored my garden for the past three years I was greatly surprised when I noticed that many of my special shrubs and whole hosts of perennials look much the worse for wear this year. A bit worn, a bit elderly, a bit tired. Indeed, some look like they need urgent resuscitation.Of course they do. Highly bred creatures never last as long as your ordinary mongrel, in plant language: your weeds and common versions. Species remain true to themselves, anything bred from them, sub-species and fancy varieties, give up after a few years. So my surprise is rather surprising.What I need to do now is ruthlessly expel all shrubs past their best, perennials ditto, particularly the kind that flop all over the place and need careful (and boring) staking or those that have turned into congested clumps which barely flower now. A bit of redesigning is in order.That might be fun. Costly fun even. It would need purchasing new plants and shrubs and involve quite a bit of digging and rearranging.Which brings me to Paul. We seem to have settled into a relaxed working relationship. When he came yesterday I asked after his well-being, as I always do. He asks after mine too, by the way.“Not so good today”, he said, “I’m a bit unwell”. He rubbed his chest although I don’t think that was where the source of his discomfort lay.I made suitable noises and suggested he might want to leave after two hours’ work, before it got hot. “We’ll see”, he said. “I didn’t want to let you down, so I thought I’d better come”.Two hours in and I asked him if he wanted to continue. “Oh yes”, he said, “work takes your mind off things”.Later we sat on the bench in Beloved’s memorial patch and had tea, it’s the only really shady spot in the garden any time of day. (How cross Beloved would be, he loved the sun above everything and sat in it for hours, whereas I avoid it when I can. So I win.)Paul and I got to talking about work. “I don’t really have a choice,” he said, \"I need to keep my income up which is stretched perilously thin anyway”. He told me he has only four regulars and a few now and then-ners but he couldn’t really do much more because of his health problems. At the moment he gives me a regular slot on Mondays and an additional slot on another day if he has a gap.\"Thank you”, I said, “but then I’m not such a bad employer?” He turned his head as if I had surprised him and looked me full in the face, not something he does often. “Oh I think we rub along tolerably well.” he said.For now it’s all good but I’d better not count my chickens just yet.I added the picture of the phormium in bloom because I still can’t quite believe that is has flowered. Positively pre-historic!"},
{"title": "This Gardening Life", "date": "Tuesday 16 July 2019", "text": "This time of year there should be little of the hard-work-kind-of-gardening. Some cutting back, some pruning of shrubs that have finished flowering, keeping the lawn cut, watering in dry spells, dead heading roses and such like being all that is required. Normally. But for me and my garden this is not a normal year. On the face of it it all looks okay-ish; a bit more than lush maybe, but not too overgrown.But look behind and in-between and you’ll soon see what a mess it all is. Three years of neglect don’t  just leave superficial scars. Yesterday I found a 4ft high clutch of thistles, merrily sprinkling white fluffy seedheads for next year's nightmare. Gentle, lady-like weeding is not called for; I trample through great thickets of the nastiest, most pernicious weeds and rip them out by the sackful. Anything that was meant to be there has either been choked to death or is being ripped out with the nasties.You know how I’ve praised Old Gardener in the past and moaned about Paul's lack of effect. I tried a new chap but I didn’t really take to him. Besides, he was far too expensive. I don’t mind paying for good work but he didn’t make much difference during the basic 2 ½ hours he was here. I think he wasn’t impressed with me either, he wasn’t keen on setting another date.  Instead, Paul has been coming a couple of times per week when the weather suited.This is what happened: during a tea break we had a chat. I had worked out in advance what I was going to say and I kept to my script. In effect I asked Paul to become my new Austin. I said I didn’t expect him to work as hard as Old Gardener but I hoped he would show an interest in the state of the garden. Give me feedback, make suggestions, answer questions, trust himself to do a decent job without constantly needing me to instruct him. Come twice a week some weeks, at least until we had created some order out of the chaos. (My pictures really are very selective!)And this is what happened next: Paul started off by saying he could not be someone else, he could only be himself. But we could maybe make a start and see how we got on. He told me about his mental illness, his physical problems, all of which I know about and will respect. I promised that I will never ask him to do more than he can but hoped that he wasn’t just the chap who came and did what he was told, collected his wages and left, without having shown commitment or responsibility.So far it’s worked. I hate having to get used to new people all the time and I’d rather put up with a bit of inconvenience than training yet another helper. Besides, Paul knows his way around a garden, making him use his knowledge can only be of benefit to him. Since we worked more closely together I have praised him and I think he was glad to have this confirmation of his worth. He has actually looked at me, responded to initiatives and even cracked a smile and told a joke. He has also told me a tale of his past. Maybe there will be more gardener’s tales? Of a completely different kind than Austin’s of course. Paul is a townie, formerly in advertising, who started to garden for the love of it.Let’s hope this phormium is a sign that things will work out. I have been growing phormiums for at least twenty years and never had one flower. Suddenly, this 10 foot spike rose out of the plant practically overnight, gradually opening weird flowers. I know that for the Kiwis amongst you this is almost a weed growing on your hillsides, for me this is an event to be appreciated. I have been told that the individual section of plant will die next spring but I can divide and separate younger shoots and replant them, also in the spring. Maybe this gardening life will be fun again, it is definitely lifting my own sadness and doing me good."},

Whether it’s God, Fate or more likely, Sod’s Law*, sometimes you just cannot get past the obstacles in your way.It takes me a great effort nowadays to motivate myself to drive to Ludlow, my county town, for a bit of comfort shopping and running a few errands. I was going to pop into a supermarket on the way for an urgently needed large bag of oats for my homemade muesli and a few self-indulgent goodies at the Ludlow Farmshop like posh pies and pickled herring. In Ludlow itself the Chocolate Gourmet was beckoning, as well as more mundane shops. So, there I was, having tricked Millie into submission (i.e. not queuing at the front door to be taken along) by generously sliding a few biscuits towards her in the kitchen and set off. I got as far as the cattle grid to the road when the knocking started, a hard knocking sound, getting louder and more insistent as I accelerated. Knowing nothing at all about the innards of cars I tend to get scared quickly. By the time I reached the outskirts of Valley’s End, less than a mile from home, the knocking was freaking me out and, after having stopped at the surgery to drop off a prescription for my next batch of medication, I turned tail and car and made for home again. I rang the mechanic. No reply. No call back. I imagine he’s on holiday. The car has sat in front of the house ever since Monday morning a week ago. I will try to get hold of him tomorrow.The weather had been rather good the latter part of last week. Saturday, I decided to do a couple of weeks’ wash, there just isn’t enough to do a full load of anything per week now. Three loads I collected, bedding, towels, smalls, etc., dark and lights, which I wash separately. I don’t own a dryer, I prefer an outside line. I had just put the first two loads out on the whirlywizzer (rotary washing line) when clouds came up. By the time the third load was rinsing the rain started in earnest; I rushed to take everything down again and loaded several freestanding indoor dryers which I set up in the conservatory. Botheration! Had I known the outcome I’d never have attempted three loads.You know that Millie is very old and now she has become incontinent. Up to very recently she has slept in my bedroom at night; again, until recently, she managed to wake me in time to rush downstairs and let her out. Several times lately she has not managed to get out in time and presented me with the signs of her incontinence. Dog poo, in other words. Dog poo on the carpet, a heck of a job to remove and clean. It got so bad that I kept waking up in fear of her needing to get out and me not realising in time, hardly sleeping at all. So then I decided that she had better stay downstairs at night, shut in kitchen and scullery, two fair-sized rooms with hard floors, quite sufficient for a sleeping dog. She had her bed. She didn’t seem to mind. Or maybe she is just too confused. All was fine for a few days and then, bingo, lots of presents in both rooms, from tiny little spatters to solid matter. (Too much information?) So now I spend the first half hour of every day picking up, disinfecting and washing the floors. It’s not as if she didn’t have the opportunity to go out in the evening, the back door is wide open until I go to bed at 11 or later. She’s fine and continent during the day, why not at night? I think I may have to leave the door open all night during the warm weather. Poor sweet Millie, she is still such a darling, she can’t help it. I cannot bring myself to do anything drastic just yet but my ideas on how to deal with this problem have dried up. If only she would dry up too.*Sod’s Law is the axiom that “if something can go wrong, it will\", with the further addendum, in British culture, borrowed from Finagle's law, that it will happen at \"the worst possible time\". This may simply be construed, again in British culture, as \"hope for the best, expect the worst\""},
{"title": "Old Gardener", "date": "Saturday 6 July 2019", "text": "Old Gardener has died. In the end it was all over within a few short weeks, the cancers took him quickly, I am glad to say. So there will be no more gardener’s tales over a cup of tea in the sun, no more crafty fags, no more tuneless whistle of a short sequence of notes, which never were nor ever could become a tune. Gardener, who was extremely hard-working, not always reliable, who often took umbrage when his feelings were hurt. Who fell out with his missus and son and made up again. Occasionally he fell out with me but I learned to grovel and he’d appear again as if nothing had happened.At the beginning, many years ago, he came all day and worked all day. At lunchtime he ate his sandwiches sitting in the car, listening to the radio for half an hour; we had a mid morning cup of tea and another one in the afternoon, when Beloved joined us. After work he’d stop and sit on the terrace and talk. And talk. And talk. Usually I was ready to call it a day by then, ready to have a wash and collapse and often wished him gone. But old gardener could not be hurried when he didn’t feel like it. It was always just another cigarette. A dreadful Woodbine, one of the worst for nicotine content.Later on, after he had a heart attack, he came for a morning once a week, maybe four hours. But even in those four hours he did the work of two men.  During the last year, until last winter, when he stopped coming altogether, he did less, sat down on a bench and rested now and then for a few minutes. His work got less careful, some jobs he simply didn’t undertake. I always forgave him, I had plenty of other problems to worry me what with Beloved falling ill and later on being poorly myself. We did what we could between us although he most certainly did the lion’s share.Throughout his decline he continued to smoke. He said he had taken advice and now smoked filter-tipped cigarettes. He was quite pleased with  himself. When I pointed out to him that he smoked his cigarettes right down to the filter, getting the full blast of nicotine, he waved my comment away. When I told him to only half load the wheelbarrow, to lift smaller weights of bags, to turn the compost heaps over two work sessions rather than the one, he waved those concerns away too. Instead he deliberately lifted an even heavier weight with a face that said :’that’ll show her with her interfering ways’.Gardener was 73 when he died. In this valley the ‘leaving’ age is mid eighties, there are plenty of 90 year olds. Gardener had a hard life, leaving school at 14 and going straight into farm labour where he stayed until the landowner sold his herd and gardener, who was  the cattle man, became unemployed. In late middle age he took up gardening for people. He knew nothing about it but was willing to learn, which he did, and although I had to watch him when he got too near ripping up one of my prize specimen in his eagerness for a scorched earth policy, he also learned to ask, most of the time, at least. Occasionally he dug up first and asked later but those occasions got fewer and farther between.I am sure it was hard work and smoking which did for him. Last autumn we sat side by side on a bench in Beloved's memorial garden and talked. He told me that he had savings, of wich he was very proud, and he was looking forward to doing less and less and maybe treating himself. To what, I don’t know. Gardener knew little beyond work, his interests were few and Jane, his wife, had made him get rid of his beloved homing pigeons. “Filthy vermin” she said. Instead they adopted a little dog, a small terrier like creature, an awful yapper. He loved that little dog and could talk about her antics for hours. Jane too loved the dog, he said, but neither of them ever thought to give it a name.While we were sitting talking and he was telling me about his savings he said “if I don’t make it at least Jane will have something to keep her going.” I was surprised that this wiry, stringy, tough old, 'horny handed son of the soil’ had a soft side and that he was willing to share it with me.I miss you, old friend, and not only because I miss your work. There’ll never be another Austin."},
{"title": "Paula", "date": "Sunday 23 June 2019", "text": "Roughly once a month Paula and I meet for supper and a glass of wine in the White Horse. We book a small table in the pub window which seats two comfortably and four at a squeeze and spend several hours chatting nonstop until we’ve set the world and our small corner of it to rights. Paula has been widowed for several years more than me, she is also a good number of years older and wiser. In spite of her great age she has a permanent twinkle in her eye, she enjoys her life and has no intention of giving in to old age. In our rural world clothes are of little importance really, but Paula always makes an effort, uses make up and has beautifully kept nails. Compared to her I am scruffy.Provision for old age is high on the agenda in our talk. Both of us own our homes and both receive an old age state pension. We also have additional occupational pensions; maybe Paula’s is worth more than mine as she has been a teacher for many decades and teachers’ pensions in the old days were generous. What I am actually saying is that, things staying as they are, neither of us needs worry about putting food on the table. And yet, we worry.The funny thing is that Paula worries about the distant future. Her usually so jolly face turns serious. “But what if house prices fall when things get bad with Brexit?\" she asks. It seems she has worked out how many years the value of her house would safely see her through the cost of residential care. “So, if in a few years’ time I have to go into a home and my house is worth less than now I could only  afford to have care for five or six years.” Paula sees nothing but penury ahead. Although she spends money on holidays she certainly doesn’t spend freely. Apparently her accountant has asked when she intends to spend a bit more, reminding her that she can’t take it with her. And yet, Paula worries. Paula is in her early 90s and fit mentally and physically so there’s no immediate prospect of her having to go into a care home. (If I could be like her I’d happily live into my early 90s too.) The average lifespan in a care home in the UK is between 1 and 3 years. Therefore, ‘in a few years’ time’ plus several years in residential / nursing care would bring her close to the end 90s. True, none of us knows what lies ahead but I think that her house, pensions and savings will probably see her to her end comfortably. When I tease her and ask how long she plans to go on for she laughs ruefully and admits that she’s both over-ambitious and over-careful.Here’s a question which exercises me too:do you splurge or do you hoard ?do you live every day as if it is your last or do you save your money on the chance you’ll live twenty more years ?PS: yes, I know this is strictly a first world problem and a very nice one to have. So please don’t remind me of the millions of people who have a hard time putting regular meals on the table and would only be too glad to worry about an old age they may never see. That’s a problem I cannot solve."},

On top of it there are the crowds, I’d probably faint if I were forced to move slowly through them. TV is fine for me, you get a much better idea of the show gardens and the presenters explain and showcase the most interesting aspects, and the most spectacular plants. Of course, the gardens are indeed ’show’ gardens, there’s little that’s transferable to your ordinary plot; bridges, buildings, verandahs, walls of water, broad steps, massive trees, tender and/or oriental and African plants aren’t usually to be found in your average back garden.Chelsea gives a gardener endless ideas and much inspiration and I’ve been sitting, fingers twitching, brain itching and the gardening nerve twanging incessantly, almost too restless to stay and watch rather  than go outside and get weeding. What with Austin gone and Paul being slow and lifeless, I must do much of the work myself. I’ve been given the names of two gardeners who might be interested, one actually telephoned and left a message. You may ask ‘so why haven’t you interviewed them’? B-e-c-a-u-s-e  that means sacking Paul. He is so depressed and silent and, yes, lifeless, that I feel sorry for him. He is also extremely hard up and needs every penny he can earn, although I don’t actually see that he earns what I pay him. Both new chaps are probably more expensive, but I’d make them work for their wage or sack them; I don’t know them, so sacking them isn’t as unpleasant a task as sacking Paul, whom I know well.Acc. to the presenters the fashion in Chelsea this year has been for naturalistic planting, lots of various shades of greens, relaxed, not the usual clumps of three, five or seven of this, then another parcel of three, etc. of that throughout beds. This year the same number of plants has been used but dotted around, mixed with each other. One thing which impressed me no end is that flowering weeds have been allowed in too, in certain ‘wild’ gardens, or at least the sort of plants that a fastidious gardener would so designate. Old Gardener began to ail last year, took frequent breaks and forgot to weed in the more hidden areas. I myself couldn’t do it because of last year’s back problems, so things got overlooked and the results are only too obvious this year. Large patches of perennial weeds have taken over and smothered the few wanted plants left from previous years. I have had a go myself this spring but there’s no way I can get on top of it all without help. So, round and round I go: dismiss Paul and employ one of the new chaps? Maybe I should chicken out altogether and move to a smaller house and garden.? How sad that would be but my decision making motor needs serious oiling before it can run smoothly. So, round and round for the moment . . . . . .This is a miniature clematis which all by itself has no impact, but planted under, andletting it thrust its way up and through, a recumbent juniper looks rather spectacular.I had it in a pot before, with a small trellis, but it was hardly visible."},
{"title": "Gentle Everyday Life", "date": "Saturday 18 May 2019", "text": "Amelanchier in blossomThe high thin whistle of returning swallows and martins swooping joyously in the sky is everywhere, it is definitely spring. Finally. It’s still none too warm and I haven’t taken tender plants, the lemon and olive trees and ferns out of the conservatory yet but no night frosts have been forecast for the next week and I might risk having Paul carry them outside when he comes on Monday. I usually do this in the middle of May although there is always a warning not to do anything rash before the end of this month. In these ‘Franklin’s Days’ beware late and destructive frosts, thunder and unreliable weather.According to a Devon legend, the sharp frosts which sometimes occur at about this time are the revenge of one Franklin, a beer-brewer put out of business by competition from cider. He therefore vowed his soul to the devil in return for frosts on each of the three Franklin’s Days around May 21st hoping that these would kill the apple-blossom and ruin the cider crop.It will also be time to strim swathes of spent daffodils before the beginning of June. So many plants die untidily, leaving a horrible mess for several weeks but as they need the dying foliage to replenish their stores of energy to produce next year’s flowers we must put up with the yellowing flattened carpets. Having lost old gardener I am in a bit of a pickle. There is no way I can do all of it myself, certainly not the really hard jobs like dealing with compost, with digging, pruning trees and shrubs. I have an area of nasty plum tree suckers. Old gardener cut down the tree last autumn but the suckers have spread and infested a large patch. I have no idea how to get rid of them. It’s a problem. If I can find someone to dig them up and maybe poison the remains I could level the area off, put in what is known hereabouts as a “water feature” (very fashionable, a kind of fountain with a built in pump which allows for the water to rise and fall and produces a pleasant sound) and use bark chip or gravel to cover the earth. There is a very beautiful acer in the same bed which I want to keep. A water feature would be just the thing to set it off.I am gently forcing myself to meet people, for lunches at a cafe, supper at the pub, a movie being shown at the village hall, a coffee here and there, a friend popping in for an hour, a poetry reading evening, and so on. Very mild, non-threatening and non-tiring entertainment. I think it must be doing me good. Once Millie is gone I won’t have the automatic daily conversations with other dog walkers.Talking of dog walkers: I was in the High Street the other day on my way to the surgery when I passed a man and a woman standing by a gate, gossiping. I said “good morning” as I was passing them. The man turned, said good morning back and then: “Ursula? It is Ursula, isn’t it? I didn’t recognise you without your dog.” I expect I shall have to get used to people do a double take. Having said that, a long time village acquaintance came down towards me as I was going up a steep lane the other day. Again I said good morning; she stopped, looked at me closely and said “I didn’t recognise you with your head down.” Hm, have I become a changeling? It is said that mortal children are often substituted for a changeling during May, perhaps that goes for some adults too?"},
{"title": "Love, Affection, Feeling Fond", "date": "Wednesday 8 May 2019", "text": "Here’s a question: Do we only truly love those by whom we feel loved or can we love without expecting a return? (Forget about unrequited young love from afar, I don’t believe there’s much substance to that, but you may, of course, think differently, particularly if you follow some of the greatest poets both in antiquity such as Ovid and Dante and more recently, Goethe, not to mention modern popular music.I was thinking of love because of Millie, of all things. Remembering Beloved, with whom I was both in love as well as loving him deeply, unquestioningly I thought at the time of our lives together,  I now think that the fact that he loved me as deeply did no harm to our close and harmonious relationship. Many of you use blogposts to describe how warmly you are enmeshed with your families, children and grandchildren. Long may it continue and may you never be disappointed. That kind of relationship needs work, tolerance and understanding each other’s needs and preferences. My own family is not as successful at this as yours.But back to Millie, she had a serious stroke the other evening. She has recovered now, at the time I thought the end had come. While I sat comforting and nursing her for the many hours it took for her to return to a more stable condition I realised, by and by, that with her death the last common link with Beloved would disappear too and that there would be nobody left by whom I would be loved unconditionally. I am not comparing the love of an animal to the love of a human being but, in my opinion, it comes at least halfway up the scale. I have more affection for animals than some humans.Quite definitely we feel affection for good friends. But here too the fondness must be returned. For how long can you be friends with someone who ignores you, behaves in an off-hand manner or treats you badly when it suits them. Some people are natural door mats but I’d hope you are not among their number. If your friend refuses to accept your friendship in the spirit in which it is offered, change your friend.We can, of course, grow fond of those whom we employ. Old gardener has worked for me for many years, we toiled together, sat and chatted (me listening to him more than the other way round since he became deaf), we got tired together, drank tea, admired the results of our labours, gossiped, sniped at others; in other words, we were on very friendly terms and I was very fond of him. And now my dear Austin, Old Gardener, will  garden no more. He is very ill, his strength gone, his good humour vanished. He is in the clutches of a pair of nasty cancers,  neither treatable; I shall miss him and his penchant for indiscreet gossip as well as his pleasure in telling long stories about life in the bad old rural days. I am not sure that Austin was as fond of me as I was of him but that doesn’t seem to matter in this case. It matters very much more in the case of Paul, whom I have also mentioned here several times in the past. Paul is back with me for the time being. I doubt that Paul is fond of anyone, maybe his mother, but no one else. He is a serious depressive and that depression allows him no room for anyone else but himself. I am sorry for Paul but I am not fond of him. I need a return which he is at the moment unable to give."},
{"title": "Disposal, Acquisition, the Kindness of Family and Humbuggery", "date": "Tuesday 30 April 2019", "text": "My son’s 4monthly visit was due after Easter and being the dutiful man he is he came, staying for one full day and two halves either side, an improvement on his plan of driving up one day and leaving the next. I wonder if he and his wife remind each other that it's  'that time of year' again , time to go and see the old dear, see how she’s doing and if she needs any kind of assistance. I persuaded him that two half days just didn’t get anything done, particularly as I wanted to spend the middle day in the nearby county town for some much needed shopping and a number of errands which had been queuing up for a good six months.Once upon a time I’d have been looking forward to an exciting family visit, with meals in restaurants and all sorts of walks and outings. Last week we did what we always now do on these occasions, we filled a carboot with bags of junk and garden waste for the municipal dump.  Nowadays excitement comes from chucking large and small items into huge containers and mountains of general waste through a giant window. There was a time when pleasure came not from disposing of things but acquiring them; how times change.Still, on the in-between-day I did some acquiring too, mainly smalls. (Underwear for those of you who don’t know the term) Once a year I go to a particular, well-respected and straight-laced old ladies’ store to replace knickers, camisoles, pyjamas, socks, etc., everybody goes there for their underwear, even young ladies. In days gone by replacing ordinary smalls was a boring chore, now it’s the highlight of a shopping trip. I was in need of a fairly extensive order, there hadn’t been a chance to go to Shrewsbury for a good year, so I filled a few bags. A strong man to accompany me was a really good investment, he carried all the bags and trooped from shop to shop with me like the patient and kind soul he is. By the end of the day my back was pretty sore and I was leaning forward quite painfully. My son also drove me, another wonderful circumstance, I was in pain and so tired at the end of the outing that I was enormously glad not to have to concentrate on driving for an hour. When I am well I can manage to drive myself to Shrewsbury for a shopping trip with no problem but not when I am as crook as I’ve been for a good year now.I have seen a physiotherapist who has given me a list of exercises to do. She examined my back and exclaimed :”nothing moves at all, everything is locked in.” The exercises are fairly light for now, mustn’t cause a new spasm in the lower back, and I sincerely hope they’ll help loosen me up and get me fully upright again. Apparently these things take time, older people do not recover as easily as young ones. I think there is a small improvement already after a week. I also went back to the gym for the first time in weeks today.I experienced a couple of cons recently, one of them during the shopping trip. Sometimes I wear Beloved’s watch, which needed a new battery. A smooth, be-suited, highly groomed and politely spoken salesman said :”Yes, Madam, we can do that. What we do is charge you £20 for which you get a ten year guarantee, for ten years we replace the battery free of charge.” On the face of it a reasonable deal, you might say. But it’s an average watch, nothing fancy, will it last another 10 years? Will the shop still be there - so many shops disappear from High Streets all over the country almost overnight. And will I remember about the guarantee from year to year? Up to now a battery replacement cost no more than £10 and less in some jewellers. But I was tired and although I recognised the con and even said “I might not live for another ten years”, I went along with it. I sincerely hope that for them it turns out to be a bad deal and that I will indeed go back once a year or so to have them replace the battery.The other con was really much worse because it was almost fraudulent. Drivers need to renew their licences on reaching 70 years of age. I had a letter from the relevant government department telling me to do so and emphasising that it could be done quickly and easily via the internet. “Just fill in the questionnaire and we’ll send your new licence.” said the government website. Keen to save time and effort - letters need to be carried to the post office - I had duly filled in the questionnaire when I came to an abrupt stop. In enhanced capital letters across the middle of the page it read “PAY NOW” £70.”Underneath this demand there was a very small paragraph saying that the government department has nothing whatsoever to do with the people making the demand, but that these people check over the answers and expedite the application process. UTTER RUBBISH. Applying for a new licence is free, the applicant will receive it within 2 weeks and, in any case, can continue to drive until then. A prime example of outsourcing that beats all. And it’s not even necessary! I wonder how many people fall for it, after all, it is a government department which deals with driving licences  and one should trust them, shouldn’t one?"},
{"title": "Pursuing Happiness,", "date": "Monday 22 April 2019", "text": "we have all decided, is silly. I am glad you agree with me that happiness comes from within, is fleeting and cannot be pursued and caught. Happiness is temporary, comes in flashes and is mostly so quiet that we hardly notice it’s there. Contentment is a word much favoured.Realise that true happiness lies within you. ( - Lucian)But there is a kind of happiness which more resembles a thunderbolt hurled by Zeus, which hits you squarely in the solar plexus; it takes your breath away, and is also known as ‘falling in love’. It is the all consuming kind of happiness that makes you move on air. You are walking down the road, on the way to the supermarket to do some completely unexciting grocery shopping, pulling your shopper trolley behind you, and you are wondering why people are being particularly friendly today and everyone seems to smile at you and then you realise that that is because you are smiling at them and they see the great joy on your face and they cannot help themselves but respond to it on this most beautiful of all mornings ever. Falling in love is perhaps nature’s greatest high. Just seeing your beloved can make your heart race, your legs weak and your face flushed. ( - A.Pawlowski)Much though we might want it to last that passionate kind of love has an expiration date for everyone, I’m told. That doesn’t mean that happiness cannot last, it just turns into the calm, peacefully happy state of being which is so important for a contented life. If you’re lucky.A good friend gave me dinner the other evening, just him and me, a bottle or two and some delicious home cooking. Andrew has been extremely good to me since Beloved died and he still lets me ramble on patiently. Talking to him I repeated, for the umpteenth time, how wonderful our life together had been. Even mentioning it made me smile happily. In his own life, Andrew prefers solitude to twosomeness and I’ve been asking him for tips on how to make a solitary life a contented life. In spite of being unable to envisage it for himself, Andrew said :\"what you had is not given to many.”I wouldn’t say that I am blissfully happy now but there are periods of quiet contentment, which last longer as time moves on. The thought of those wonderful years together comforts me and yes, of course, I miss Beloved, but thinking of him, and us, is gradually turning the pain into acceptance.Easter has been wonderfully warm and sunny and I have rediscovered how much I enjoy gardening. My hands are stiff, my back is sore, my nails are short and broken and black with dirt and I am very tired. Happily tired, with a full load of natural endorphins, which is much more satisfying than taking happiness chemicals.Marcel Proust had something to say on the subject:\"But I must not forget that happiness springs eternal and that digging in the dirt and planting flowers are a wonderful source of delight. . . . . . .Let me wish each of you a wonderful day and week ahead, and that you will find happiness.“Let us be grateful to the people who make us happy; they are the charming gardeners who make our souls blossom.”Let me wish all of you, dear readers, a wonderful day and week ahead and a happily contended spring, whatever you do to make it so."},
{"title": "The Pursuit of Happiness", "date": "Tuesday 16 April 2019", "text": "Lately I haven been thinking about happiness. Not only asking what it is but is there anyone who is likely to have more than a few months of positive happiness during a lifetime? Let’s assume that most of you are familiar with the full quote in the-declaration-of-independence, that is not what I am concerned with here. For the first time this year I heard of the annual International Day of Happiness on March 20th; this year’s theme is Happier Together, focusing on what we have in common, rather than what divides us. So this is what set me thinking of the rather strange phrase The Pursuit of Happiness, which first of all, brought me to the lines in Philip Larkin’s poem for Sally Amis, 'Born Yesterday'In fact, may you be dull —If that is what a skilled,Vigilant, flexible,Unemphasised, enthralledCatching of happiness is called.Nothing Earth shattering, gut busting, deliriously heart palpitating here, nothing pursued at full tilt, nothing desperately grabbed and held and jealously guarded here.How can you pursue happiness? Isn’t it rather something that falls to your lot unexpectedly, that catches you unawares; if I were to set out to be truly happy deliberately, I wouldn’t have the first idea how to go about it. I am more likely to follow Emily Dickinson's’ Little Stone, of which she asks:How happy is the little StoneThat rambles in the Road alone,And doesn’t care about CareersAnd Exigencies never fears —Whose Coat of elemental BrownA passing Universe put on,And independent as the SunAssociates or glows alone,Fulfilling absolute DecreeIn casual simplicity —Independence, without a care in the world, not seriously striving but rambling happily, are what set the little stone - and therefore us - on the path to happiness.Even simpler - and more fun is AA Milne’s John who          hadGreat BigWaterproofBoots on;John had aGreat BigWaterproofHat;John had aGreat BigWaterproofMackintosh --And that(Said John)IsThat.Yes, John and that great big puddle is waiting for you and what greater happiness can there be than jumping right in with both feet?But Judith Viorst, the American writer, newspaper journalist, and psychoanalysis researcher - someone I had not come across before I ruminated about happiness - and what a happy find she turned out to be - sums it up for me perfectly:Happiness (Reconsidered)Is a clean bill of health from the doctor,And the kids shouldn't move back home formore than a year,And not being audited, overdrawn, in Wilkes-Barre,in a lawsuit or in traction.HappinessIs falling asleep without Valium,And having two breasts to put in my brassiere,And not (yet) needing to get my blood pressure lowered,my eyelids raised or a second opinion.And on Saturday nightsWhen my husband and I have rentedSomething with Fred Astaire for the VCR,And we're sitting around in our robes discussing,The state of the world, back exercises, our Keoghs,And whether to fix the transmission or buy a new car,And we're eating a pint of rum-raisin ice creamon the grounds thatTomorrow we're starting a diet of fish, fruit and grain,And my dad's in Miami dating a very nice widow,And no one we love is in serious trouble or pain,And our bringing-up-baby days are far behind us,But our senior-citizen days have not begun,It's not what I called happinessWhen I was twenty-one,But it's turning out to beWhat happiness is.None of the poets and writers here has mentioned the one cause of happiness that started me off on my small quest: other people. I may leave that for the next post."},

I have now retrieved many of them and hope they have settled into their allotted slots under the relevant posts.

{"title": ". . . . and what’s more, be kind to me.", "date": "Saturday 6 April 2019", "text": "guarding Mum’s sandalsDid you know that dogs can have dementia? It came as a huge surprise to me the last time I took Millie to the Vet. She has been behaving very strangely recently; although she is as sweet-natured as ever, she has developed unusual quirks and at times she is hard to live with.I think I’ve mentioned before that she has been suffering TIAs, in full: \" transient ischaemic attacks”, or mini strokes. She usually recovers completely within a couple of hours. I first notice that something is wrong because she starts scrabbling about without being able to move from the spot where she’s lying. She becomes agitated, her head turns first this way then the other over her shoulder, left and right , left and right. She tries her legs, wanting to get up, maybe to escape? Her hind legs simply won’t work, they tremble and twitch and after a while she gives up. By then I am usually on the floor beside her, stroking her, calming her, reassuring her. Acc. to the Vet there’s nothing else I can do, just wait for the attack to abate and see what happens afterwards. Twice I’ve called a fireman out to carry her downstairs when the attacks happened upstairs.Being Millie, a greedy labrador, she usually wants food and drink within a few hours, and she also totters outside for a pee, still none too certain of her legs. These attacks happen maybe every two to three weeks.As in humans, TIAs eventually bring on dementia. Millie is 14 years old now, a very good age indeed and I must prepare myself for a serious decline fairly soon. In the meantime there are these strange behaviour patterns. Again, as in humans, the dog with dementia is often confused, not entirely certain of her surroundings. The other day, while we were out for a very truncated walk, she greeted complete strangers like long-lost friends and followed them into a house. I can call her until I am hoarse, being as deaf as a post, she does not react at all and I’ve got to run to catch her by the collar. Going to the village shop yesterday she suddenly decided in the middle of the busy road that she wasn’t going to cross over and just stopped dead. As we had just reached the part where the road abruptly changes direction we were not visible from either side and in genuine danger of being run over by anyone coming round the sharp bend. I asked a lady passing by for help, by pretending to hold a treat out to Millie and walking backwards towards the pavement, while I shoved from behind. Millie was utterly put out when she realised we had played a trick on her and refused to let me tie her to the post outside the shop for ages. I had to drag on her lead until she almost choked. It is really quite distressing. I shan’t take her into the village again, she has the castle grounds right outside several of our garden gates; there she can dawdle and sniff and pester visitors to her heart’s content. Most of them stroke and cuddle her. “Aw Bless”, they say, and “how old is she?” and “isn’t she friendly?\"Changing circadian rhythms is another symptom of dementia. A dog may have been the most peaceful and amenable creature up to the onset of dementia - again exactly the same as in human sufferers - they will now decide that nighttime is for exercise, not sleep. At least once in the night, sometimes twice, Millie will wake me and ask to be let out. I have to get up and open the back door because I don’t want to risk “accidents”, which have actually happened several times. Luckily (eh?) she decides to use the kitchen and scullery for her nighttime toilet habits, here I can pick up after her easily (you know the thing where you stick your hand in a poo bag and grab) and washing and disinfecting the floor is no big deal. Sometimes I think she is deliberately being obstreperous, she may have been for her last outing at midnight - I go to bed late - having had every opportunity to empty herself then, but, no, she waits until I am fast asleep. And yet. She is as affectionate and sweet as ever, she loves her food, her little walks, meeting her special friends (she can smell treats in another dog walker’s pocket from a long way away) and is usually calm and peaceful. I cannot possibly have her “put to sleep” while she appears to be happy and contented. It’ll happen soon enough."},
{"title": "Be Kind to Carers of Dementia Sufferers", "date": "Sunday 17 March 2019", "text": "A friend of mine felt so upset at a thoughtless remark by an acquaintance recently that she found herself moved to publish a short letter in the village Chronicle. Since then she has had a lot of positive feedback from other dementia carers as well as people looking after sick and disabled people. None of us can be certain that the task of carer will not be our fate too, so it well behoves us to be kind and understanding.When a diagnosis of dementia is made, the sufferer looks the same as before and in many ways the changes in their mental capacity are not obvious. Careless people think nothing is wrong and query why a family carer has put their loved one into a home.What the public does not see is the constant drain on the carer’s strength; the accidents that ruin a carpet; the ’nappy’ changing and vast quantities of pads etc. that are required, the persuasion to get dressed and undressed.... When you see the person with dementia out for a walk looking perfectly well and smart, you are seeing the results of exhausting and time consuming care. You do not see the angry outbursts, the constant repetitions or the interruptions.A carer gives 110% of their life and energy to keeping their loved ones well fed, clean and entertained, while getting very little back. A good day is a reward, when there is a response, but this becomes less and less.So - when you see a dementia sufferer, the carer with them is suffering too. Please do not make thoughtless comments. You do not understand that the carer’s limits have been breached. It is to save our loved ones that they go into a home because, if they don’t, we may well cause them harm.Another friend of mine has very recently realised, after years of devoted and dedicated care for her husband who is suffering the ever increasing physical and mental effects of Parkinson’s disease, that she can no longer cope without seriously endangering her own health. What is she to do? What else is there but find professional help in residential care?The carer suffers all the guilt and torment that ‘failing’ at continuing personal care causes without some thoughtless remark by a chance acquaintance to add to the pain and anguish. So remember, if you feel inclined to sit in judgement, it might be you one day."},
{"title": "\"Have A Nice Day Out”,", "date": "Friday 8 March 2019", "text": "my friend said. \"Enjoy yourself, stop worrying, I’ll look after Millie for the day.\" The man who arranges such things in Valley’s End had promised a rip-roaring time at the Malvern Theatre for Tom Stoppard’s ‘Rough Crossing’, a play to make us laugh until we peed ourselves.I took him at his word, booked the trip, paid an exorbitant amount of money up front for coach and ticket and looked forward to the entertainment. Except the nice day out turned into an (almost) unmitigated disaster.It started as I left in the morning on the way to the bus stop, about 15 minutes walk away from the house. It was blowing a gale, with driving rain. All the way there my umbrella turned itself inside out, every few steps I had to stop and right it. No matter how I held it, into the wind, against the wind, sideways on, the damn thing flapped and creaked and dripped. By the time I got to the bus stop I was drenched, trouser legs sodden from the back of my knees to the hems. Did I say it was also bitterly cold? A little chap walking by on the other side of the road as I was struggling laughed happily. “A bit wet today, isn’t it?” Hahaha. Sadist.Some of my fellow theatregoers assembled at the bus stop shivered but others were made of sterner stuff. The shelter would normally accommodate six or seven people but a man in a motorised buggy, who had been the sort who feels “entitled” long before he became slightly disabled, assumed that everyone else would gladly leave the shelter to him and stay exposed to the elements. I didn’t, I had been the first to arrive, and I stayed perched on my little seat. Make of that what you will.The bus arrived and we climbed on board. Luckily, the heating was on and gradually, during the two hour journey, my clothes dried on me. When we got to Malvern the rain had stopped. The mass exodus from the bus duly effected, a large knot of people formed on the pavement, everybody was making arrangements for the hour before lunch and where to have it. Didn’t they have time during the two hour journey to do that? I needed the loo and made for the theatre, shouting to a couple of friends that I would meet them at ‘The Italian’ in an hour’s time, wanting to visit a posh supermarket first to buy some of their famous ‘cook’s ingredients’ to take home to my back-of-beyond-village where such things are only dreamt of, never available.Of course, I bought too much, now being burdened with an extra load of groceries, my large handbag (purse), my wet umbrella. True, I can’t blame anyone else for this oversight. I am still not a good walker, still limping when I’m tired or when the effort of walking straight and upright gets too much. I no longer use a cane, though. Malvern is a hilly town, I frequently had to stop on the way to the restaurant to catch my breath and straighten up. Gosh, I am an old crock!The next two hours were a pleasure, I enjoyed my Tagliatelle Bolognese and we all had a couple of glasses of wine, not something we usually do at lunchtime. Everybody got merry, greatly helped by the waiters who flung their ‘per favores’, their ‘pregos’ and ‘grazies’, their ‘signoras’ and signores’ around with wild abandon, who burst into song while sinuously weaving  and undulating between the tables and made much of their giant pepper mills. I bet they were from Roumania really.Finally it was time to go to the theatre and take our seats, having left coat and groceries at the cloakroom. Stoppard can be a bit of an acquired taste but he has written some really good stuff. Sadly, ‘Rough Crossing’ is far from good, it has the thinnest of plots:Two famous playwrights, one jealous composer, an unorthodox waiter, and a mistimed lifeboat drill… let the sharp Atlantic winds turn to gales of hysterical laughter as our colourful characters become tantalisingly tangled in a Stoppardian string of absurd events…If only. The Art Deco set looked splendid and promised much. The moment the actors appeared the promise evaporated and within the first ten minutes several of our coach party were sound asleep. The sound was bad, the dialogue barely distinguishable, the action messy and incomprehensible. The cast (all fairly recognisable TV actors)was lacklustre and seemed tired and bored. We were all disappointed and two of my friends decided they’d had enough and left at the interval, as did several of the others. I had nowhere to go and, in any case, couldn’t face lugging my groceries around, so I stayed to the bitter end. The action perked up for the last ten minutes but by then I’d given up on the play and was simply waiting to be released from captivity. All I wanted was to get on the bus and go home.But my trials for the day weren’t over. I couldn’t swear to it but I may have, in fact, actually peed myself, even if for quite another reason as the one promised. When I came out of the loo right at the end, before climbing back aboard the coach, I felt a dampish kind of warmth spread over my belly. Yes, the front of my trousers was wet. I had been hovering over the toilet bowl, being loath to sit on the seat which appeared a touch insalubrious. But I had also been sprayed with warm water as I washed my hands afterwards. Enough to cause a damp patch in my trousers? We will never know. Suffice to say that I kept my coat on the whole journey back to Valley’s End and the first thing I did back home was to take a quick shower."},
{"title": "Lost In Space", "date": "Tuesday 5 March 2019", "text": "Have you ever felt that you’ve lost your way, that life isn’t what it was, that you’d dearly like to become positive, active and energetic? That you’ve lost that magical special power, drive and energy which allows you to become effective and successful in your daily life, perhaps only in a modest way, but detectable, all the same. In other words, life is flat and purposeless. You’ve lost your mojo.In other words, depression sets in.Dear friends of mine invited me to share Sunday lunch. While tucking into a 'roast and three' I realised that I hadn’t had that for weeks, not just the pleasant food and drink, but more importantly, an easy, animated, flowing, intelligent conversation. Words came easily, I could hardly drag myself away and probably outstayed a normal lunch invitation. I came home alive and happy to be so.And then the darkness descended. I came home to an empty house (Millie came with me), to silence. That in itself was fine, I had had my fill of interaction for the day, possibly for several days. I know that quite often interaction with other, less interesting people, leaves me bored, impatient, and that I often prefer my own company to company for the sake of it. Occasionally, I seek the company of people whose conversation is homespun, gossipy, unchallenging. It may be comforting at the time, not a bad thing. Like those ladies’ luncheons I mentioned recently. They get me out of the house, we commiserate with each other all being newly single and we share a giggle and relate tales of solitary adventures. Two of the ladies are relentlessly positive, admirably active and keen to hold forth. Not me, but who am I to mind. I should try and follow their example.My problem is that I literally have no purpose. No engrossing hobbies other than the solitary one of reading. No involvement in charitable organisations, no interest in sport other than the gym, which is another solitary activity. I am not artistic, I don’t do crafty things, I like writing but have more or less given up on that sine Beloved died. Lectures happen far away, and the local talks take place mainly during cold and wet winter nights. I find it really hard to motivate myself to get off my behind and leave my warm and comfortable nest to shiver in a village hall, no matter how interesting the talk.I am not about to fling myself into Scientology or any other religious sect, won’t be taking up the Kaballah, do flower arranging, write bad poetry, see myself as a benefactress, take up long distance running, discover the only true health giving diet. None of the above and a whole host of other obsessions. But surely I ought to do something?  Learn another language? Properly learn to take pictures? Travel is not possible while Millie is alive, although that appears an attractive thought now. I expect I won’t be able to drag myself away come the opportunity.That’s me all over, negative, always finding reasons for NOT doing something. True, I’ve done things to the house, soon the garden will need attention, I’ve taken up the gym again, reluctantly and much against my inclination and I’ve booked a ticket to go on a coach trip to Malvern to see a play, which only mildly interests me. And I’ve come back to blogging. It’s been a pleasure to see your comments and I am trying my damnedest to stick with it. Thank you for your patience.If only I could stop being a contrary, dissatisfied crosspatch. Any advice ?"},

The last few days have been sunny and much milder than normal. Is climate change showing its claws?;  maybe we are going to pay for the sudden display of nature’s kinder side in March. It was pleasant enough this morning for me to grab the secateurs and chop back some spent perennials. I must ring old gardener and ask him to come and restart our gardening year. Something to look forward to. The sun has brought out my own sunnier side; a frequent first thought on waking is : why get up, there’s no one to care and nothing to do : but then Millie starts scrabbling on the carpetless floors, I shout at her furiously - she can’t hear me, being completely deaf now - and the day has begun in earnest.0-0-0-0-0I believe I have grown up; many years ago I bought Diana Athill’s “Instead of a Letter” in hardback, it may even have been a first edition. She died not long ago, at age 101. The blurb on the original flyleaf said that Athill had “written this autobiography in order to discover the truth about herself and about what her life has been for. Her book is uncompromisingly honest. Yet although she discusses with unusual frankness matters not usually discussed by conventionally reared daughters of British colonels, she is never embarrassing because nothing embarrasses her.” Why I did not appreciate this frank and honest account of her privileged childhood,  falling deeply in love at an early age, before being jilted by her lover, mystifies me. I still remember exactly the space on my bookshelves where her memoir sat, yet I must have given it away decades ago. The other day I searched for it in vain, having read several others of her memoirs since and loved all of them. So I ordered “Instead of a Letter” from Blackwell’s in Oxford and instantly fell in love with this classic of modern memoir finally, and for the first time. 0-0-0-0-0My study is all finished now, the computer is downstairs, books and music and TV have been installed. Instead of climbing upstairs  I can now get to my computer more easily and it’s more fun to sit and type, for short periods of time, unplanned and unhurried. My painter, who is also a friend, was looking over my shoulder during a break and asked what I was doing. “Tinkering with my blog”, I said. “Blog? What’s a blog”. I explained and he came up with this remark: “So, this how it is, a man in a shed, a lady at a keyboard.” I couldn’t have said it better myself. The problem is that he is now one of the few people in Valley’s End who know, but I shan’t let it cramp my style.0-0-0-0-0A bit of housekeeping to finish, Google no longer lets me comment on Google+ blogs.

{"title": "When did I become this irritating old person?", "date": "Sunday 17 February 2019", "text": "There is nothing easier than becoming a recluse, by accident or deliberately, they say. It doesn’t require action, no effort at all, in fact, it just happens and before you know it, you live in a world of one-and-a-half, the half being an elderly dog suffering from dementia. The dog doesn’t know that she is lacking in mental agility; so what if her circadian rhythms have changed, she is fed on demand and let out on demand.But nobody feeds me and nobody lets me out when I scratch at the door and howl in frustration.Back to me, the recluse-in-waiting. Loneliness can kill you apparently. It can cause heart disease and depression. Lonely people are more likely to develop Alzheimers. The UK now has a Minister for Loneliness although there is no pill yet. Just give it time.So, reading about the dangers lurking in solitude I reluctantly made my way out of the house. It’s been cold and windy, not conducive to being out of doors. Besides, I like my own company. I accepted an invitation to join a ladies’ luncheon club, went to a supper for two at the pub, a birthday luncheon at a very nice cafe which was new to me, renewed visits to the gym, ad hoc chats with neighbours and dog walkers. Fine, all fine. By the end of this mad whirl I was searching the diary for an ‘empty’ day, a pottering day I call them. I am truly my Dad’s daughter, he too found the delights of company palatable only ever in small doses. Still, mindful of the dire warnings, I persevered. The ladies’ luncheon has become a fixture. One has to eat, after all, and not cooking my own dinner one day a week will be a welcome change.Except, there’s a snag. There I was, having enjoyed eating what the waiter called “Spanish pork casserole” - rather tasty, the Spanish part being black olives in the sauce - I made my way to the cashier. A cane, a bag, my gloves, my purse, all in my hands, dressed in a bulky winter coat, I navigated through a narrow aisle and came to a full stop at the till. Well, maybe not a full stop. Momentum took me a step further than the counter and I tottered uncertainly. This caused me to a) drop the cane, b) my gloves. The cashier came out and picked them up for me. I then opened my purse and took some notes out. English notes are now made of plastic, very slippery. Obviously, I dropped the notes next. There was a fire close by and one of the tenners floated gracefully towards it. I snatched it up just before it hit the flames, again dropping my cane. I had stuffed the gloves into my coat pocket. The cashier didn’t bother to come out to pick it up this time, I imagine he was leaving that until right to the end of my transactions. My bill came to a tenner plus coins. I did that thing that old people in queues always do, I rummaged around in a separate little coin purse to find just the right change, promptly dropping several coppers. Picking them up - with difficulty - and handing them to the cashier he said “sorry, we don’t take coppers, there’s just not enough room in the till for them.” I resumed rummaging for silver, and found exactly the right amount. The problem of disposal of the coppers remained. I suggested he should put them into one of the charity boxes. Unfortunately, they were located behind me, in the narrow aisle, not easy to get at. By now there was a queue, naturally. I am not sure but I may have heard the faintest sigh from the person behind me, who took the coppers, turned and deposited them in the tin, all in one fluid movement. I really need to practice that.If I had to accompany me out somewhere, I wouldn’t."},
{"title": "(My 1000th post) - A new Beginning", "date": "Tuesday 5 February 2019", "text": "maybe?I’d like to make it so, but who knows? I have tried so many times since Beloved died but have, so far, not kept my word, either to myself or to others.I had hoped that the new year would bring renewed physical and mental application, stamina, enthusiasm, reliability, confidence as well as physical well-being. No such luck. No sooner had the back healed when I caught a nasty cold turning into a chest infection and unpleasant cough. I am only just getting over the side effects.However, there are signs that all may not be lost: I went back to the gym today for the first time for  many months; I am having to relearn to walk upright rather than a) as at first, like a penguin, and b) following on from that, like a very old person bent forward, leaning on a stick. Under strict supervision I am crawling through exercises, the very first, very mild stand biking, tread milling, getting up from a chair without leaning on aids, step ups, and just plain walking along a straight line, head up, chest out, eyes forward. \"Do that twice a week for an hour or so to start with\", says Dan, my fitness instructor, \"and we’ll have you back where you were by summer.\" He’s a nice boy, very fit, enthusiastic and encouraging. “You’re doing really well”, he says, looking at me out of his earnest dark eyes. Maybe. When I came home afterwards Marzenna was there, my new Polish cleaner, a lovely young woman, very friendly, very clean and tidy. “You’ve been to the gym?” she marvelled. “So you keep active before?” She’s only known the penguin me. “That’s good, it’s better to move.” Her English is a bit lacking. “Now things will change. You be positive and things will change.” Blimey, I must have been a right old grump if the mere mention of the gym can make her see me in a new light.The back episode frightened me so much that I decided there and then that I’d need a new shower room rather than a bathroom, as well as a downstairs study rather than a dining room to seat twelve. It is most unlikely that I’ll ever have twelve people sitting down to dinner again. The shower room has been installed and the dining table has been placed at one end of my sitting room. Sooner or later it will probably disappear altogether. I’ve moved a large sofa which is now in the sun room. The former dining room has become my study, it is a bright room with two windows, both of which look out on to the garden. I’ve lost the upstairs book walls, but there are enough shelves in the new study to satisfy this reader. I have also bought myself a music centre, the modern but old looking kind, which plays vinyl LPs, cassettes (remember them?) of which I have many still, and CDs. My computer is there too, my TV with many European channels will follow shortly and a large chair stands by the window, ready to receive me and my book. My cave awaits. If and when the time comes that I can’t manage stairs there is enough space for a bed, provided I scrunch up some of the other furniture.Other than that I have been dealing with Beloved’s writings, old diaries (goodness, I am not sure that I would have been as fond of the young man as I was of the middle-aged one), and now, his books. What a bright spark he was, there are books on the sciences, geology, geography, history, politics, all many years old and, probably, long overtaken by modern day research. There are his shelves of novels, some of which I will keep, classical literature, art and photography. And poetry books by the metre, most of which I will have to sift through and either dispose of or keep. Being wrapped up in memories of Beloved and our time together has made me miss him all over again, in a deep and sad way now rather than the earlier, raw and painful heartache. The loneliness doesn’t fade away.But spring will come and the garden will beckon. Maybe Marzenna is right, “you be positive and things will change.”"},

I am in a hurry … to live with intensity,that only maturity can bring.I intend not to waste any part of the goodiesI have left …I'm sure they will be more exquisite,than most of which so far I've eaten.My goal is to arrive to the end satisfied and in peacewith my loved ones and my conscience.I hope that your goal is the same,because either way you will get there too .. “Mario de AndradeBrazilian poet, novelist, musicologist, art historian and critic, lived1893-1945Although I would like to be firmly convinced, that all the wants, intentions, resentments, deliberations, judgments and realisations go for me too, I ask myself, where do we find the paragons of virtue we yearn to pass our time with towards the end of our life.. Shouldn’t we start with ourselves? It’s all very well to set up no-go-zones for others, exclude people who don’t come up to our exacting standards and consider others boring, mediocre, either overconfident or faintly dishonest. Of course, it would be nice if we could measure ourselves by these wonderful maxims, personally, I can’t quite see it happen. We could strive for perfection, reaching it is another matter. I only know that I have a very long way to go.Someone brought this poem to my German Conversation group for distribution. At first I thought it worth sharing, then I felt slightly uncomfortable. It makes me feel that the poet has a very high opinion of himself which puts him firmly in the category of self-importance. Still, it is perfectly true that age brings indifference to how others see us and a certain urgency takes over where patience with the foibles of others once resided.What do you think, am I too harsh?"},
{"title": "Mood Swings", "date": "Saturday 17 November 2018", "text": "From hopeful to hopeless, from dark to light, from cheerful to miserable. Sometimes all of these emotions overcome me in one day. Whatever is the matter with me!The first few days of solitude, when the last of the carers said “Well, I suppose I’m redundant now” because I had had the temerity to take a shower without supervision, and she left, possibly in a huff because I had made a decision for myself, I felt free. And hopeful. I was still very slow - as I am now to a lesser extent - but I knew that, with care, things would improve from that day onwards, and the time would come when I could return all aids and equipment. So it was, two walkers, one crutch and one commode were duly collected last week; I have kept hold of a set of crutches which I have had for years, ever since I broke a leg a long time ago. I am still using at least one crutch for rough patches outside and when I am in a hurry to get somewhere inside the house. I have gradually added a detour here and there to lengthen my walkabouts. I may soon be able to get to the village shop, although walking with an aid, having a dog pull on a lead and carrying a shopping bag doesn't seem a sensible way of perambulating. We’ll see.So, really, I should be happy, shouldn’t I. I can feed myself and Millie again, do small jobs around the house; with the help of a driver friend I've been to have my hair cut, taken Millie to the vet, seen the podiatrist for a treatment, and yesterday this friend took me to a supermarket  to buy some early Christmas treats. German specialities disappear quickly from the shelves although the feeble pound makes them very expensive for the average shopper. I’ve been to a couple of concerts and a live streaming of a National Theatre play, again with the help of friends. I am making progress, albeit my walk resembles that of a penguin.Is it that the dark days of winter are with us? Is it that I am beginning to think of the holidays on my own? Who knows? I was out in the field with Millie just now for a final walk before the light goes and I was thinking how nice it will be to get back inside, lock all the doors, turn on the lamps, pour a glass of wine and get comfortable. What’s not to like?In 1634 Henry Peacham wrote in 'The Compleat Gentleman': “Keep up your spirits with healthy exercise. Leaping being an exercise very commendable and healthful to the body, especially if you use it in the morning. But upon a full stomach and bedward it is very dangerous, and in no wise to be used”. Best not start leaping then."},
{"title": "Thoughts on Recovery", "date": "Sunday 4 November 2018", "text": "For the whole of this summer and early autumn I have been out of action, literally so, laid up, in pain and immobile for a long period. And most probably caused by my own stupidity and carelessness.After the serious fall in early summer, which left me bruised, swollen and hurting all down one side, limping painfully, September came and, I believed, with me ready to pick up where I left off. If only I had asked advice of someone who knows about these things! Like a physiotherapist or, at the very least, my fitness instructor at the gym. Typically bone-headed I threw myself into training, thinking I could catch up on the lack of exercise during the previous six weeks by working a bit harder.Big mistake. I have since been informed that you have to start more or less at the beginning and work up to your pre-accident fitness state for at least as long as you were laid off. Which means I will be lucky to see the inside of the gym before the end of the year.What happened this time? I have no idea. Nobody has. The fact of the matter is that somehow I damaged my sacrum, resulting in indescribable pain, two bedridden weeks and a slow return to mobility over the following two weeks, mobility involving crutches, two walkers (upstairs and downstairs, although I couldn't manage the stairs at all), a trolley for transporting items safely from one place to another while holding me upright at the same time. There was a period when just turning over in bed was agony.I had carers come in to look after me (‘looking after = euphemism for ‘personal care’ =  euphemism for ‘keeping me clean’,  which is euphemism for ‘dealing with bodily functions’), a nurse, a physiotherapist, two physiotherapist technicians, even a useless social worker. Reams of paperwork were filled in. One question was “what is your favourite TV programme”. What? I got cross and said ‘Dr.Who’ which caused much hilarity subsequently. Another one was “what is your favourite kind of day”. “A painfree one without social workers asking me stupid questions”, I snapped back at the unfortunate questioner (after all, she was just doing her job - I don’t think she recorded my answer) Part of the questionnaire was concerned with my mental state, i.e. was I fully compos mentis. “What do you think?” was my reply to that one.The whole episode was excruciatingly painful, utterly embarrassing and seriously demeaning. And that is what a lot of old people experience not for four weeks but week in, week out. A frightening prospect. But, and this is the big but, what would I have done without professional carers? Put myself into a care home temporarily? Hospitals don’t take you in, spine injuries will heal eventually, without a doctor’s intervention.It was the devotion of friends which saved my sanity. With family unable and presumably unwilling to assist (actually, I only told one of the children) I can never make it up to them. Plates of hot food arrived several days a week,  piles of sandwiches ditto, soup, grapes, savouries and puddings were lavished on the invalid who was actually not even really hungry; painkillers take away the appetite. Lying in bed, unable to turn over without crying out, exhausted from a slow and laborious shuffle to the loo during the day, bent over a walker, take away the survival instinct itself.  Believe me, there were moments when I could have chucked it all in, down the stairs, for instance. Strong opioid painkillers leave you hallucinating, my long gone Mum and Dad appeared at my bedside, as did Beloved.One of the strongest feelings I had during the worst time was a feeling of utter helplessness and abandonment, I felt so terribly lonely, in spite of my dear friends. It would have been wonderful if somebody had been there during the small hours or sat and talked after the painkillers kicked in. Being alone and helpless with the front door open day and night is not a good feeling. I might even have welcomed a burglar!"},
{"title": "Did You Know . . . .", "date": "Friday 7 September 2018", "text": "that ‘The functions of the Mistress of the House resemble those of the general of an army or the manager of a great business concern.’I have been dipping into 'The Housekeeping Book' of olden days and all sorts of wonderful information, instructions, prohibitions, advice to young women and new wives can be found within.I particularly like the capitals for the Mistress of the House and the lower case used for a general and a manager, be they ever so lofty. Mind you, the Vicar of Wakefield had it that : ‘The modest virgin, the prudent wife, and the careful matron are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers, blustering heroines, or virago queans’. (I looked up ‘queans’ - it means an impudent or badly behaved girl or woman, or a prostitute.) Serviceable to whom, one wonders. Independent minded women have always got short shrift from the mainstream of domestic theorists, so many of them men.Having had little interest in new clothes for the past two years this interest was rekindled when I had a very close look inside our closets and wardrobes and chests of drawers; Beloved’s stuff has all gone now, apart from his dressing gown, a summer anorak and a couple of his favourite shirts, all items I now wear. Ditto some of his thickest and warmest socks, which will come in very usefully during the winter. However, my own clothes are sadly lacking in shine and rather shabby after years of wear and needed replacing. I get fashion catalogues and emails sent from fashion houses and department stores, all unsolicited (I may possibly have bought items in the past), so I consulted these. I hadn’t purchased new clothes for so long that I was horrified to see the prices. Nevertheless, a few tops, shirts, trousers and leggings (for the gym) arrived in due course and I admit it feels good to be wearing something that isn’t falling to pieces with age. I like the look of myself again, too.Be that as it may, the activity of purchasing does not please one lady author, who had this to say: ‘This ranging from shop to shop has given origin to a fashionable method of killing time, which is well-known by the term “Shopping” and is literally a mean and unwarrantable amusement. I wonder if she would absolve me from blame, as I did my “Shopping” on the internet. I wish I could amble from shop to shop, all along the High Street, and take my time, browse around a bookshop, have a meal somewhere, linger over a cup of coffee and watch the world go by. I may be fancy-free and independent, but I am still accountable to Millie. Poor dear Millie, she is quite decrepit now, although her steroid medication has given her a renewed lease of a semblance of a doggie life. Her hearing is gone which makes her difficult to organise; I also think she has dementia, she does not want to let me out of her sight. Leaving her alone is a problem, there are just two houses where she knows her way around and feels safe, my friend Jay's, who is dog mad and Millie’s best friend and my other friend Ralph’s, who bosses her around in a nice way. I am having the suspicion of dementia being present because all her routines have changed, whereas before she had regular favourite bedtimes, doggie beds and toilet habits she is now all over the place. And yet, she still has a reasonable quality of life and eats well and happily, is fully continent, and appears to be happy provided I’m close. If I have to leave her alone it’s usually for no more than a couple of hours.My leg is getting better. The swelling is now confined to the ankle and heel and even there disappearing noticeably, almost by the day. I have had all these weeks of mostly sitting and reading with the odd little Millie walk and a potter in the garden. When the summer was at its hottest I reclined gracefully and read novels, taking sips from cooling drinks. I am glad, that by living long after The Housekeeping Books’s strictures, I escaped its censure of indulging in the much decried pastime of reading novels. Apparently, young ladies were wont to indulge and could therefore not hope to achieve the heights of the housekeeping skills necessary to make a good match and thus become serviceable in life."},
{"title": "Onward and Upward", "date": "Wednesday 15 August 2018", "text": "but not looking solely towards the future rather than being in the here and now. Continual learning is an essential part of life. (I looked up the difference between continual and continuous and have plumped for the former, continuous learning might be too headache-inducing).Anyway, I had one of those lightbulb moments the other day. I took courage and invited three friends to supper, two came and one cried off; the three of us had a lovely evening. These ladies are easy to get along with, chatty, we had a conversation consisting of personal details, a bit of gossip, a few remarks about the state of the world; a friendly conversation in spite of quite marked differences in opinion. There was the first lesson: you can be on good terms even if you are not in agreement about quite serious matters. I had decided to go easy on the work involved, no hours of preparation, slaving over a hot stove; this was the menu:cold smoked wafer-thin meats olives and feta cheesecrusty French breadice cold Zinfandel to drinkmarinated lemon and herb chicken breast filetsroasted mediterranean vegetablesbaby potatoesMerlotchocolate fudge brownie and creamcoffeeLooked at quickly it seems quite impressive but none of it was work. Shoving a dish of chicken filets and a dish of vegetables in the oven is no work at all. I burnt the fudge round the edges but as we were only three and not four as planned the middle of the dish was sufficient for our appetites. Second lesson: even when half the food served is bought at the deli the meal can still be interesting and good to eat. Something to remember for my next supper, I might even invite a chap or two, although I may have to put more effort into ‘sparkling’ conversation.At the moment I am rather obsessed with the near future. I made two appointments with my favourite doctor, just to ask him for his educated guess as to my longevity or otherwise. I cancelled both appointments. You can’t just walk into the surgery and demand “how long have I got”; “what plans should I make” ; what hassle can I spare myself?” Solicitors and legal matters, house renovations, finance plans, even holidays. Round and round in my head they go. No longer having the person with whom you used to make decisions near leaves you a bit breathless. I don’t have family to consult - well, I have my son, of course, but I don’t think that I’d find his advice totally acceptable. He is a lovely man but we differ in basic ways of looking at the world.  Apart from the damaged leg I am actually quite well at the moment, there is no reason to think that I might not survive for a good few years yet. Which is more or less what one of my friends said. She sounded quite nonplussed at my dithering about what needs doing. “But you’ve decided to stay in the house,” she said, implying that \" there are maintenance jobs pending, there are legal matters after your husband’s death to settle, there are financial provisions to sort out\". How right she is.There is no need for advice on the necessity of doing these jobs, just maybe on how to do them. (Just to clarify: this lady is ninety and has been a very active widow since her husband died some years ago.)So, lesson three: don’t go round and round in circles, look at the actual, current, situation and start at the beginning, in the here and now, not in a nebulous and possibly frightening future. So today I have booked a plumber to change some taps and sort out my aged radiator thermostat systems."},
{"title": "Backsliding", "date": "Sunday 5 August 2018", "text": "is my default position, it seems.Not so long ago I promised myself that I would accept every invitation - well, ok, not the ones that primarily benefit others and cause me a lot of effort and mental and physical expenditure for little return - but my good intentions have already fallen by the wayside.  And for nearly three weeks now I’ve paid the price - that is if you believe in ‘just deserts’. Which I don’t. If there were such a thing as just deserts in this world a lot of people would not lead the happy and prosperous and untroubled lives they live.Back to me and invitations. A big 70s birthday bash came first. The hosts had hired a hall, caterers, musicians, drink, and everything that makes such things successful. The celebrations were to embrace a ceilidh, my first, and a slight source of nervousness. Country dancing and singing? In public? Without being drunk? Maybe not.Then came an invitation to an 80th birthday bash, again with food and drink, music and lots of people. Again I found a reason why I shouldn’t go.The last major invitation was to the wedding of a young friend of mine. It was to be a huge do, with a big marquee in her dad’s field, sit down dinner and a dance at night. The event of the year, with ladies in hats and gentlemen in formal suits for the church service. I saw no way out, had had to accept when the invitation first came, several months ago. I no longer have formal dresses and ordinary day clothes would not have been suitable, so I searched the internet for something neither too expensive nor too formal, coming up with exactly nothing. Smart trousers, jacket and a silk shirt would have to do. I was less and less enthusiastic about the whole thing; you know what it’s like when you feel you must make the effort but really and truly would prefer not to? The idea of sitting in a marquee in 30C, dressed up and unable to put your feet up, surrounded by people you don’t know except for the immediate family of the bride who would, naturally, be too busy to attend to you personally, did not appeal.And then it happened. An actual bona fide excuse for not going to the wedding of the year (locally) fell into my lap. Or rather, I fell into the excuse. Gardener and I were out, I was about to show him a bit that needed his attention, marched there ahead of him under full sail, saw a dog poo in my path, swerved, and landed in the dip between a flower bed and the lawn in my heeled mules and promptly fell flat on my face, luckily avoiding the dog poo. I scrambled up, gardener laughing his head off, my dignity badly dented but otherwise apparently unharmed if somewhat sore. I thought little more of it and continued gardening.Two days later the first big bruises appeared. Then my leg swelled up, more bruises appeared, the colours deepening into midnight blue. Now, nearly three weeks later, I still suffer. The doctor says I must have ruptured a blood vessel and bled internally. “It will get better eventually”, he said, “your foot will be the last part affected. Don’t worry if it swells up.” Thanks for reassuring me, doctor, I’m awaiting results.  “In the end the blood will be reabsorbed and the discolouration will probably disappear too”.For a good two weeks I have spent the days sitting in an easy chair with my very painful leg on a footstool covered with cushions, read and watched (whisper it), daytime TV. And been bored out of my skull.What do you think, is this ‘just and fair punishment' for inventing excuses (well, actually, lying) to my friends in return for their kind invitations?"},
{"title": "Can’t stay away", "date": "Sunday 22 July 2018", "text": "in spite of feeling that I have nothing to say. I am feeling a little sheepish about having been away for so long.It’s been up and down, mostly up, the past two months. In fact, most of the time it feels like I’ve turned the corner; you may not understand when I say that I am coming back into myself, that I am not on the outside looking at the strange ‘me’ I was for more than a year, but that that ‘me’  and the ‘I--myself’ I have always been are closing in on each other. Of course I am often sad but being solitary is not in itself a dreadful thing. Having decided to stay not only in Valley’s End but in my house until such time as I either must, or wish to move, has taken one major decision out of the equation. Sure, there are several other decisions to be made but they are not as life changing as a move. Which means that I can take my time over anything else. And if I don’t want to do anything, well, I won’t. In any case, perhaps the decision will be made for me when the idiots who call themselves ‘our government’ back themselves into such a corner that they take revenge on EU citizens living here without British passports and expel the lot of us.I still follow the news obsessively and what sad reading it makes. Is humankind really turning into a nasty, mean, hateful, selfish, greedy, unkind mass? Sometimes I’m glad my years are numbered except that I feel guilty for leaving a huge mess behind for the next generation to clean up. Does every generation feel like that? Statistically things are getting better, poverty, disease and wars are decreasing, it just doesn’t feel like that. Perhaps the current older generation is the first without first hand experience of war, wide spread hunger and lack of basic necessities. We have food, clean water, shelter; we brought up our children to expect the same for themselves and their children, we live in peace and security. And still the world feels like a hostile place and far too many are viciously opposed to grant these blessings to those human beings who lack them.What do I do? Stop reading and watching the media or get involved? My quiet little backwater allows me little personal involvement other than perhaps make donations to organisations that try to make a difference.Organisations that deal with the continued existence of our planet are close to my heart and hand. When I look at my garden I could weep. This being  the first year that gardening has featured on my pleasure list for several years, when old gardener and I have worked hard on at least two days a week, it’s been all for nothing. Or nearly nothing. Clumps of herbaceous perennials have dried up, shrubs are drooping and even trees are shedding leaves from the stress of coping with temperatures way beyond our experience. From Algeria in the west, to the Arctic Circle in the north and the Baltic States in the east a huge swathe of land is sweltering in unnatural temperatures. Similar conditions are devastating Japan, Africa, Canada, North America, Australia. Sweden, country of snow and ice for months on end has asked for help with huge forest fires. The global forecast is for more rainstorms in winter and heatwaves in summer. Here in the UK the effects are relatively mild, although we have hardly any rain this summer and scorching temperatures, the heath fires have been put out and we have so far only reached the lower 30sC. Too hot for me, at any rate. I hardly move between midday and 5 o’clock. I have read an awful lot and also watched quite a bit of afternoon TV. Of course, I am lucky, there’s no need for me to move if I don’t want to. I go to the air conditioned gym to cool off.For the first time in a thirty year marriage I am marrying our books. We always had his and her shelves before, now I am sorting through both, discarding some and reorganising the rest. Boxes and boxes go to charity shops, some antiquarian books I hope to sell, novels are shelved in alphabetical order, others arranged according to subject matter. Any of the novels I will never want to read again go into the give-away piles. I seem to have chosen to read  many more non-fiction books than fiction recently, have also started to buy new ones which is possibly rather stupid of me. Out with the old - in with the new.For everything there is a season and not just a season but a whole new chapter of life. This is my fifth chapter: childhood and youth, a first very miserable marriage, a period of hard work and child rearing, and a second very happy marriage. I am settling into this latest, and probably last chapter of my life with renewed hope and the realisation that even now, and on my own, there are joys to be had."},
{"title": "More This and That ", "date": "Saturday 26 May 2018", "text": "'There is no more ridiculous custom than the one that makes you express sympathy once and for all on a given day to a person whose sorrow will endure as long as his life. Such grief, felt in such a way is always present, it is never too late to talk about it, never repetitious to mention it again'.Marcel ProustMy friend Sue sent me this quote. She also said it might make her want to read A la Recherche du Temps Perdu. The quote I appreciate very much, it’s utterly simple and deeply true. But read Remembrance of Things Past? Seven volumes of a total of 3,031 pages, containing more than 1,267,069 words, and more than 2,000 characters — it's a daunting read; not surprisingly, it is one of the longest novels of all time. Proust is also one of the greatest novelists of all time and this novel is his magnum opus, but starting to read it now? ‘Had we but world enough and time’ (Andrew Marvell’s ‘To his coy Mistress’) comes to mind. So Proust will remain unread by me. I had an idea after reading the quote : why not call the novels ‘Nostalgia’ for short? I thought that was rather clever of me but I don’t suppose many others do. Perhaps it’s someone else’s idea and  I just read it somewhere and I’m not really clever?I helped bury a good friend of ours last Monday by attending his funeral, a man who’s son said of him in his eulogy :”my dad was an intellectual, to the point of possibly being a snob about it.” I like that. I like unashamed elitism, provided you keep it in the family, as it were.Millie is becoming an ever greater worry. She tumbled down part of the stairs again. The vet said to make her stay downstairs, but how? My friend said to put a suitcase on the bottom step. Millie follows me around wherever I go in the house. She is on steroids now but really, she suffers from old age for which there is no cure. She has gone deaf too. When a vet says ‘it’s a question of quality of life now’ you know what o’clock it is. The other day we went on to the castle bailey where a lot of tourists were admiring the ruins. As she is wont to do, she went to every group for a bit of attention and to say hello and most people cuddled and stroked her. She obviously got confused by the assorted legs and hands, so she just lay down for a bit. I was down the hill by the five bar gate back into the field by now, waiting for her. I called and whistled and created quite a kerfuffle myself but she couldn’t hear me and, in the end, several people led her down the hill towards me. Clambering back up to meet them halfway I hurt my sore knee all over again; I am still limping.Going to the gym with my sore knee is a bit of a problem too. I can’t put weight on it which means the treadmill and similar machines are out. But the rower and standbikes are fine. As are machines which I hope will reduce my flabby batwing upper arms a bit. I hate showing bare arms, I suppose anybody over fifty does. On the whole, I have quite taken to gym workouts, and Dan, my Fitness Instructor, who has measured my progress, is pleased with me. I have the suspicion that FIs are conditioned to praise all of their guinea pigs, how else are you going to go on jumping through the hoops? We all need to be praised. I genuinely like the gym because the exercise makes me feel good but I still have to force myself to go sometimes. Contrary creatures, we humans.Old gardener comes two mornings a week at the moment. Because of the long winter and late start of the gardening year everything was delayed; with warmer days having arrived there was a sudden explosion of growth and, almost overnight, bare branches, dead plant stems and bare patches turned green, with weeds mostly. Gardener rests more often than he used to do but he still works very hard for a man of his age. I don’t mind a bit, it gives me a chance to chat. He and his missus seem to be happy in the new house, she even buys plants for the small garden, which is unheard of. They’ll have been married for fifty years in July. Gardener is already grumbling that they’ll be spending money on a tea party for the family and that he will be spending yet more when he takes her out for a celebratory meal. Like many of his background he grumbles about spending money on non-essentials when secretly he is proud that he has it to spend. Or so I read him, anyway."},
{"title": "I tried and", "date": "Saturday 12 May 2018", "text": "yes, it has helped.It may have something to do with the weather or it may have something to do with a change in attitude, there is most certainly an occasional feeling of positivity. Strange how being told to “get your hair cut” and doing exactly that, can kickstart a new beginning.Romeo and Juliet, a 'pair of star-crossed lovers’ who marry in secret and ultimately die because of their feuding families, at the RSC Stratford, was part of it. It’s not my favourite Shakespeare play but it certainly has some wonderful lines.'Parting is such sweet sorrow.'Are there lines more apt than these to describe the sadness at the loss of a loved one?When we go to Stratford we often stop at a brand new upmarket supermarket for some choice foodie items on the way home. As we did this time.In supermarkets many of the pre-packed things come in twos, two of fish filet, vegetables for two, puddings and pies for two, etc. I buy these double portions and put one in the freezer, but they just don’t taste as good as fresh. So, this time I decided not to freeze but share the largesse with a friend, from starters to main course to pudding, thereby renewing my pleasure in entertaining; (and not doing much of the cooking myself). Having just one chosen friend to a meal or a glass of something cool and delicious has boosted my confidence after two years of no invitations to the house at all. Sitting outside on a hot day, nibbling delicacies, drinking sparkling wine and gently discussing minor matters of the day, lifts the spirits of the gloomiest person.Having single friends (not all widows) to a meal is not all I did, I also made dates with friends for meals at pubs and restaurants, common or garden ones in Valley’s End as well as some rather good ones further afield. And enjoyed them all. It still feels strange to do these things without Beloved and I still have the urge to tell him about them when I get home. It also still takes some time to realise that I can’t and never will again. Perhaps that will wear off in time?There was a day out in Ludlow with a friend which was rather a success. Do you know these outings when everything falls into place? For months I had been saving up small jobs that needed a visit to a town of a size greater than the nearest one down the road. Really small things like a new watch battery, also a tiny battery for my kitchen timer which hadn’t worked for a good six months, a couple of visits to a bank and a building society, a particular kind of bath sponge only found at one particular chemist, a new pair of trainers, a drop off of a box of books at a charity shop, taking a poster to be framed, etc. I finally treated myself to some orange peel sticks coated in dark chocolate at the Chocolate Gourmet and came away happy that everything had been achieved. To top it off my friend took me to a pub for lunch. It doesn’t take much to rediscover that pleasure can be had for very little effort. If food is involved, it seems, my pleasure is almost guaranteed. I do rather mention food a lot.Something else has taken up my time, requiring greater effort but easily achieved: the garden is once more on my agenda. Old gardener is back with me whenever the weather allows and the two of us garden companionably. We have our break, just as before, and gardener tells me about his adventures in his new home. His ‘missus’ seems to favour frequent house moves and he quietly - grumbling under his breath - falls in with her wishes. I think he is a bit scared of her. A couple of widows live near him and both have twigged that he does gardening. “I don’t want it known”, he said to me, “I wonder how they found out.” One of them he rather likes the look of. “She’s right tidy looking,” he said, meaning she’s attractive. An Italian lady, he thinks, with a name he can’t pronounce. He has now given up his bigger jobs like the one at the ‘Manor’ and only looks after me and another German lady. I can see him acquiring the Italian lady too. Possibly as an antidote to his grumpy wife. At seventy I feel he is entitled to a little light relief."},
{"title": "Change", "date": "Friday 27 April 2018", "text": "One minute I am sitting staring into the void, the next I get up and the perspective on life changes.The winds of change blow indiscriminately, sending you hither and thither without conscious volition. It might be a good thing for those like me who find it difficult to move into one direction or another deliberately. Times change and we change with them.Or, as Dr Samuel Johnson had it (in his Drury-lane Prologue Spoken by Mr. Garrick at the Opening of the Theatre in Drury-Lane, 1747)When Learning’s triumph o’er her barb’rous foes First rear’d the stage, immortal Shakespear rose; Each change of many-colour’d life he drew, Exhausted worlds, and then imagin’d new: I love the phrase “each change of many-coloured life he drew”. I should hold on to that thought, accept that change is inevitable and maybe even welcome it. Taking baby-steps. Life is for living and 'for the living’ and living it means being part of it in all its many-coloured facets. Death and grief are part of life.The Syrian satirist and philosopher Lucian, whose works (written in ancient Greek) were wildly popular in antiquity has several very suitable quotations:The world is fleeting; all things pass away;Or is it we that pass and they that stay?***Realise that true happiness lies within you.***Not every story has a happy ending, but that doesn’t mean it’s not worth telling.Beloved’s son and daughter in law came for a flying visit all the way from the US; as you know I live way off the beaten track, far from motorways and airports, and I would have understood if they had chosen to save themselves the extra two days’ travel to spend time with a relative-by-marriage only. But they came and I am both grateful and very appreciative; I had a great time with them, we talked about everything under the sun: politics, literature, music, travel, family news and, of course, Beloved. I handed over old photographs, family documents, music Beloved had written during the course of his life, even his school reports and records of prizes he’d won during his studies. I still have a large box of poems and diaries and other writings; in due course, after reading everything myself first, I will pass them over too. Beloved’s son is very like his father, in looks, bearing and intelligence; having him was almost like having Beloved again. It was a good visit.My step-daughter-in-law was most encouraging, she told me that I must get a decent hair cut, find a colouring product that doesn’t provoke an allergic reaction, look after myself and get out from under the cloud of sadness. She also told me the story of an old aunt of her’s, who lost her husband in her early seventies and lived for another 20 years, apparently enjoying every minute of it, going travelling, making new friends and indulging her every whim. Very well, I will try."},
{"title": "Decisions . . . . .", "date": "Wednesday 11 April 2018", "text": "and how to make them?I don’t know how you would feel, but I find it very hard to make any at all since Beloved died. Being the only one to decide on major life changes is complicated; when there are two of you - preferably not more than two, otherwise there will be three or more different opinions - you can talk, sometimes for days, weeks, months, but eventually you will sort out problems and find solutions that suit both of you. With luck and goodwill.I’ve had an unpleasant head cold since Friday afternoon, which fast turned into a chesty one. The kind of cold that you catch as if it were “thrown at you” as my mum used to say, without warning. All the cold remedies on the medicine shelves are long out of date, I haven’t had a proper cold for two years, but I am using some of the ones whose sell by date was sometime last year rather than two years ago. After all, can aspirin/paracetamol - the main ingredient - or sickly sweet cough syrups ever lose all their potency?For two days I stayed indoors, barely washed and never got out of my pyjamas. A friend kindly bought my Saturday paper when he went for his own, waddled Millie along the drive - that’s Millie waddling, not my friend -,  and on Sunday a neighbour offered to take her for a quick walk. I was grateful but I should have turned her offer down, because this lady walks at a fair lick and Millie does fifty meters at fifteen minutes. And even then she has to have a little sit down on the way. She came home limping badly.So Sunday night we were both feeling very poorly indeed. Millie woke me from a light, snuffly, snoring doze when she collapsed against the bedroom door as she tried to turn over. Obviously, I got up and calmed her, both of us lying on the floor. Whereupon, and not for the first time, it hit me. “What if something really serious happened?” You know what I mean, something serious enough to cause an injury which leaves you unable to get to a phone. And even if you get to the phone, whom can you ring for help in the middle of the night?My mind flips from one side to the other. Do I sell, do I stay, do I find somewhere smaller, less isolated? Nearer a bus service, a train station, the shops, a cinema, a theatre? No point moving closer to my son’s town, he’ll be moving home himself again soon. I’ve even looked at residential retirement facilities, small one or two bedroom apartments, but there I’d probably live in close proximity with people a lot less mentally and physically active than I am.I simply cannot come to any decision; could that mean that decision making is not a good thing at the moment? I’ve been feeling better again yesterday and today, have chatted with people, been to the gym, done some gardening - that always makes me want to stay put. Nowhere else would I get a location like the one I have now, no other home could be as comfortable as mine, the home I’m used to. So why move? Because of the comparative isolation and the larger than necessary house and garden, of course.So, round and round in circles I go.If I stay, I must do some decorating. If I leave, decorating will be a waste of time and money, not to mention the upheaval, the mess, the inconvenience. But moving house makes for upheaval, mess and inconvenience. And huge expenditure.Perhaps it’s time to stop fretting and continue as I am, for now. Or, perhaps it’s time to make lists of pros and cons, weigh up things, get in touch with the professionals for estimates, house valuations, find help like the old-fashioned companions rich old ladies employed. Sadly, I am not a rich old lady. Besides, I am far too young for a companion.Perhaps the solution is indeed to get organised, collect information, then evaluate and make those lists of pros and cons. How pathetic it all is. Help! I'm beginning to bore not just you but me too."},
{"title": "One year on . . . . ", "date": "Tuesday 3 April 2018", "text": ". . . . and last month I hit rock bottom. Just as that heart specialist (how apt, ‘heart 'specialist) told me a year ago, that the end of the first year would be hardest to cope with. I’ve barely been able to rouse myself to do anything at all, off my own bat, that is. When other people have encouraged me to do things I’ve given in and done them. But as soon as I’ve been out from under their well-meaning efforts I crawled back into my cave. The weather was awful too, cold and damp and wet, with snow and ice for a week twice, which meant that I couldn’t even get out of the garage and drive to a supermarket. Did I feel sorry for myself? Not really, it was more a dull ache, a feeling of loneliness and abandonment. TV, books, chocolates and wine were my constant companions, but even they didn’t do much to lighten the mood. I wonder what I’d’ve been like without those crutches.What I need is a passion. I have friends who sing in choirs, work in spite of being in their late sixties and seventies, endlessly help with grandchildren, work on village committees and church affairs, run all sorts of do-gooding charities. None of these activities tempt me. Not for the moment, anyway. I’ve said it before, I am not a joiner. My voice is a croak, proper work has long left me behind, my grandchildren are grown up. I’ve been on committees in the past and hated it. Quiet, behind the scenes charity is more my bag than noisy, front of house, ‘look how hard I work and how marvellously I run the show’ charity. I have to admit, if anything were down to me it would probably not get done. Or get done without fanfare.So, how do I get a passion? Gardening was once one, I’d love to start again when the weather improves. In fact, last week I already did a full morning’s work and several short spurts and paid for it. No matter, easy does it. I have gone back to the gym after a break of a couple of weeks, worked out and paid for that too. Aches and pains are the natural outcome for sudden onset of physical jerks by the elderly.I kid myself that going back to college would do the trick, retrieving my failing memory of Medieval European history, for instance, but blame living in the sticks for non-availability of any academic, interesting courses. Perfectly true. Online courses don’t quite answer the need for human interaction.It’s only been a year, perhaps it’s still early days and I should not feel guilty for my lack of enthusiasm and my inability to ‘look on the bright side’. Positivity, Arghh.There is the theatre, of course. I had a couple of injections of stage dust. First, \"Imperium, The Cicero Plays,\" a seven-hour, two part version of Robert Harris’ trilogy about the rise and fall of Cicero, the Roman lawyer and politician. (Robert Harris described it as ‘like the West Wing in togas’). We stayed overnight at a delightful boutique hotel dead opposite the theatre, which allowed us to do some shopping in Stratford, an interesting town quite apart from the Shakespeare connection.Then came ‘Macbeth’. Shakespeare’s bloody tragedy of greed, ambition and lust for power is everywhere at the moment. We saw the RSC version with Christopher Eccleston (ex Dr. Who) and Niamh Cusack.Both plays are gripping, of course, but hardly a bundle of laughs. What is it they use in theatres for blood? There is such a lot of it in Macbeth. Barely anyone left standing at the end of the evening. Sitting in the front row I got sprayed with what I assumed was meant to be snowflakes during the final fight between Macbeth and Macduff; the stuff stuck to my black cashmere jumper and wouldn’t come off. It has now, without any brushing. Clever people, back stage personnel.We also went to the opera: the Mid Wales production of ‘ Eugene Onegin’. The opera combines Pushkin’s compelling and heart-breaking story with Tchaikovsky’s sweeping lyricism in a stunning exploration of love, death, (more death) life and convention. Filled with breath-taking arias including Tatyana’s great letter scene and one of my personal favourites, Prince Gremin’s aria, the tale contrasts the simplicity of country life with the sophisticated excesses of Russia’s pre-revolutionary court and tells of the fated love between the innocent Tatyana and the world-weary cynic Onegin. In spite of Mid Wales Opera being very much a provincial company and the orchestra being reduced to one representative of each instrument for lack of space in the pit, the evening was a success, as we told a lady with a pad and pencil taking notes of what we said. Is that how reviews are written? Get hold of audience members standing around after the performance and take down their freshly received impressions? We didn’t realise we had attended the first night.Although the opera made for a pleasant evening, much more memorable was the meal beforehand in a pub/hotel in the centre of this small Welsh town just over the border from England. The place was heaving, very noisy, with beefy young men milling about everywhere. One giant TV screen wasshowing an important rugby match between Scotland and England, (The Six Nations Championship is an annual international rugby union competition between the teams of England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The current champions are Ireland, having won the 2018 tournament.)These for the most part young Welshmen bellowed their approval every time Scotland had an advantage,  (I don’t know the rules of rugby) and their dislike of and disdain for the English team couldn’t have been expressed more clearly. We were just barely half an hour away from the English border; amazing how much animosity there exists between some Welsh and the English. I had a taste of that myself once when an elderly Welsh lady pushed me and Beloved off a bench on the promenade at Aberystwyth by shuffling closer and closer, first to the middle, and then to our side of the bench. We gave in gracefully."},
{"title": "Trying to Stay Cheerful . . . .", "date": "Saturday 3 March 2018", "text": "but it's not easy in the depths of winter, at this late stage in the season. I had a post planned about the turf wars breaking out among the more aggressively territorial birds, like blackbirds, thrushes, robins et al. Every morning before break of day a thrush sat in the very top of the tall conifer in the garden and shouted out her war cry to all and sundry :”this is occupied land, enter my territory if you dare.” The thrush has been absent for days now, not a peep out of her. The icy Siberian winds, bringing heavy snow and the nastiest weather for years, frightened even the hardiest bird species. Instead of heralding spring they have been squabbling on and around and under the feeding stations. Twice every day I went out to feed them and clear some patches of snow for the ground feeders. It’s been a losing battle. Warmer temperatures are on their way. Hallelujah!This is a country full of weather watchers, The leading news stories have all concerned themselves with travel conditions, weather reports, endless pictures of people stuck on the roads in cars and lorries, on trains halted midway through journeys, unable to move. Surely, if you don’t use winter tyres or chains, you stay at home when snow is falling in such quantities as we had this past week? And if you have to make your journey, surely you take shovels and blankets and hot drinks and other life saving equipment? As well as said winter tyres and chains? Nah, let’s all complain about the authorities not doing enough to stop the snow.Anyway, I feel better now. Besides, I think I air this rant every winter.So, staying cheerful. The more I am cooped up at home the less active I become. I’ve been binge watching ancient episodes of The Big Bang Theory, until I want to chuck something at the screen when Sheldon is at his most opprobrious and the others just humour him and fall in with his wishes. Even Penny just sighs and rolls her eyes.I have also been binge eating chocolate. It feels like my waistband is shrinking. It can’t be my waist expanding, can it? TBBT, chocolate and frequent warming, calorific snacks, hours reclining in a large, comfy chair, occasionally nodding off for forty winks, none of these promote healthy and active cheerfulness. Ah yes, the gym was meant to provide for that. But guess what, I haven’t been to the gym for a good two weeks, partly due to other engagements and partly due to my car being stranded in the garage.I had started to enjoy the gym, there is something addictive about regular exercise; the thing is if you, for whatever reason, stop going, the addiction wears off and lethargy sets in and you have to fire yourself up all over again. Tuesday and Friday morning old biddies and old chaps go and use the treadmills and stand bikes, medicine balls, weight training machines and lots of other apparatus whose names escape me. There we all are, turned inwards, counting squats, stretches, pulls and pushes, knee bends, etc.; the fitness instructors give you exercises and homework to do, so many of everything, and we perform, silently, lips moving with the effort of counting, breath getting shorter and muscles beginning to ache.  A friend and I were sitting on two adjacent bikes, both pedalling madly, like a couple in a two seater pedalo on a boating lake. Except that we were going nowhere.Reading has helped to pass the time; there is a pile of unread books awaiting my attention but, instead, I searched for something utterly enchanting on my shelves. Quite unexpectedly, I lit upon the small row of Michael Innes’ crime fiction; I think nowadays these stories would be called 'cosy mysteries’. Innes’ real name was J.I.M. Stewart, he was an academic and serious writer of literary criticism, but his crime fiction is a delightful mixture of crime, erudition, adventure and a charming picture of an imaginary England which, if it was ever real, disappeared between the wars. I chose ‘Christmas at Candleshoe’, an amusing tale, beautifully told, of some eccentric country folk, and a gang of boys prepared to defend the dilapidated manor and its nonagenarian owner against all comers, particularly a group of shadowy thieves bent on removing long buried treasure. The book reads as if it had been a pleasure to write, with Innes indulging himself gleefully. I shall reread the others I have by and by. I am looking forward to reacquainting myself with Sir John Appleby next."},
{"title": "This and That  ", "date": "Monday 19 February 2018", "text": "ThisAs I’ve said before, I now accept more or less every invitation extended, in fact I appreciate it when people include me. We always went to every social occasion as a couple, so being invited on my own is flattering and heart warming. I assumed that Beloved was the attraction, and that I simply came as the lesser part of the package.Not so? Maybe.However, I tend to gravitate towards widows more than couples in my own invitations. In the olden days I never saw widows as ‘widows’, just as women on their own. There is always a slight feeling of unease when it comes to couples; even the most friendly ones. Is it perhaps that the new widow reminds them that it could happen to them too and they’d rather not face up to the possibility? Is it that we’d rather push the thought away as far as possible? After all, as my son said “it really doesn’t bear thinking about.” Beloved and I thought about it a lot during the last couple of years but it still didn’t feel ‘real’; not until it happened.Being with other widows is easy. Of course, we talk mainly about the person we lost, and how we lost them. Perhaps we repeat ourselves at each meeting, that doesn’t seem to matter. We go into detail about the final illness, what the doctors said, what the children did or said, how shattered we felt, how grief is all pervading and how hard it is to pick up the threads of life afterwards. We all share that knowledge and understand. Spending time with other widows is easy and healing.ThatThe other day I came home after a lovely long and chatty lunch with one of these widows. I was feeling relaxed and, after chewing the fat for several hours, I was ready to sit quietly and put my feet up back home. Before I reached the front door I was stopped in my tracks by a tremendous din outside the gate into the castle grounds. Those of you who pay attention to such matters know that my hedged boundary marches with an open expanse of greensward which is used by dog walkers and tourists visiting the castle. I rushed to the gate, the row really was fearful, with screaming and shouting and high pitched dog yelping. Lorna’s greyhound was attacking a smaller dog as well as Robert, its owner, both of them howling in pain and anger. Lorna was some distance away, but a friend walking with her was nearer my gate; looking down on the fracas I saw the greyhound turn away from Robert and his dog and run back to Lorna. Everybody was shouting by now, me included. As the greyhound reached Lorna she began to beat him with the doubled lead, viciously, with all her strength. Now the greyhound howled too. Seeing the carnage I screeched for Lorna to stop, which was the signal for her friend to screech at me. I couldn’t make out much of what she said but “you don’t know what happened, mind your own business” came across loud and clear. Lorna was still beating her greyhound and I was frantic to make her stop but Lorna’s friend screeched all the louder the more I tried to bring Lorna to her senses. Nobody paid any attention to anybody, all was uproar and noise. Perhaps it’s a good thing that there’s a steep bank between my gate and the path below where all this was happening otherwise I’d have rushed down and beaten Lorna with her own dog lead. And might have been had up for assault and battery myself.By now Robert had picked himself up, gathered his badly bleeding dog, examined his own thigh which showed a deep bite and, cursing Lorna and swearing to involve the police he went off.  Apparently, this was the second time the greyhound had attacked Robert’s dog. This story was quickly all over Valley’s End, with everybody taking Robert’s side.Lorna is a mad woman, everybody says so. In the evening she came ringing my doorbell, ostensibly “to apologise for her friend screeching obscenities at me” but really to convince me that she ‘has never beaten a dog before’  - not true acc. to consensus around the village - and that Robert only got bitten because he came between his dog and the greyhound. Some excuse! The greyhound is out of order and needs muzzling and training, not beating. According to Lorna he ‘fully understands that he has done wrong and equally understands that’s why I beat him” .  Did I say she is generally considered to be mad? When I remonstrated with her, pointing out that animals do not reason, she calmly said 'we must agree to disagree’.The greyhound is still roaming unmuzzled, Robert’s and his dog’s wounds are healing, incurring hefty vet’s bills and some painful treatment for Robert, and the police have indeed been involved. Robert is grateful ‘for all the support he has received in Valley’s End’ and Lorna is licking her wounds, still promising to all who want to listen that she will do everything to keep her dog under control. So far nothing has happened. The next fracas is only just around the corner with everybody saying “what if it's a child being attacked next time?”."},
{"title": "It’s Official, I’m Old ", "date": "Thursday 8 February 2018", "text": "Opening the five-bar gate from the field into the castle ground to take Millie for a much truncated walk on one of these very cold afternoons we’ve been having recently I heard what sounded like a whole school class of small children, all chattering at the tops of their voices. I was wondering what the teacher could be thinking of to bring them out into the bitter wind of the shelterless castle grounds on such a day. Small children without diligent supervision are notorious for leaving their coats unbuttoned and losing gloves and hats.I slid the gate catch back into its groove, turned round and started the climb up the hill, Millie preceding me at her very sedate pace. At the same time the ‘school class’ appeared on the path at right angles above me, i.e., one mum holding the hand of a very small child, one small and very lively spaniel, and a curly-haired, blond cherub bombing along ahead, perhaps between three and four years old. It was he who was making the racket. His treble pierced my eardrums. He saw Millie and a high-pitched squeal greeted her dignified presence.“O look Mum, another dog. It must be really old. And there’s a lady with him. She's really old too.” That was me assessed, judged and dismissed, all in the space of seconds. The castle called. But did he have to be quite as sharp-eyed as he was? After all, I was wrapped in a Michelin man coat and furred hood and almost invisible.Mum turned and giggled with embarrassment.Out of the mouths of babes comes wisdom and truth."},
{"title": "Books", "date": "Thursday 1 February 2018", "text": "How do you read? Not so much which kind of books - although that comes into it - but how deeply and with how much concentration do you read? At a recent supper party there were nine of us (me making the odd number) and the talk turned to books when I casually mentioned, that when I passed his house, I frequently saw one of the guests sitting in his window seat reading, usually in the morning. I was absolutely not making a value judgement, the man is retired and he can please himself what he does and when he does it. So books it was. The fellow guest, call him Roger for now, said that he enjoyed leisurely mornings after walking his dogs and reading was his preferred occupation. As it is mine.“What is it you read”, someone asked. \"Any favourite authors? What are you currently reading?”The sort of questions anyone asks when it comes to discussing books.“I hardly know,” Roger said. \"I just read and read, very fast, one book down and another started. I really am a very fast reader. Ask me what I’ve read and I find it hard to tell you.” I know from discussing books with Roger’s wife that both of them tend to go for thrillers, fantasy and blockbusters. Roger is an intelligent man, has successfully held down an important and well-paid job in business, and is an active member of the Valley’s End community. Everyone at the table tried to keep a straight face as Roger was digging himself deeper and deeper into his reading matter hole. I saw an embarrassed smirk appear on the face of his table neighbour who is a writer herself. His wife, sitting opposite me, was trying to shush him, obviously feeling that he was showing a side of himself that didn’t reflect well on them. Roger plowed merrily on, oblivious of the reaction around the table.When Roger stopped to draw breath, the host’s son, who had cooked us an excellent meal providing equally good and plentiful wine, (possibly partly the reason for Roger’s lack of inhibition and poor self-awareness) intervened by saying “I am a very slow reader, very slow indeed. I even leave gaps between books. Mind you, I usually remember what I’ve read; titles, authors, content, message, if there is one, and the impression the book has left on me. But, as I said, I am very slow about it.\"Lucky you, I thought. Although by no means a Roger type of reader, I frequently forget the names of authors, titles of books, although I can usually put a story to the memory of a book. Since Beloved’s death I have been an avid reader, even more so than previously, going for slighter and lighter stories rather than sad and tragic ones, and yes, I have, at times, been reading the comfortable kind of thriller which demands little attention. The only thing I insist on is that the writing is good and the editing has been done carefully. And I can foresee a time when more nourishing fare will be on the reading menu again. In fact, my diet is already becoming more substantial.What’s the point of reading like Roger? Surely even a rubbishy novel has to offer more than instant gratification, a mere way of passing the time? Too many writers produce the same story over and over again, no wonder the people who read them can’t keep track. I went into a bookshop the other day, the first time since I have had the cataracts removed from both eyes, just “to have a look”. I was planning to get rid of some books, not buy more, but, alas, that’s easier said than done; I bought a small pile, not a blockbuster among them. The gift of renewed eyesight is just too precious to waste it.By the way, I was also going to express my appreciation of my hosts at this dinner: they asked me on my own and did not feel it necessary to provide me with a table partner. Thanks very much!"},
{"title": "Yet More Rumaninations", "date": "Sunday 21 January 2018", "text": "An old acquaintance's funeral was held today and although I promised the person who told me of the death that I would present myself punctually at 2pm at St George’s I failed miserably to keep my promise. At 96 the friend was old indeed, his wife died several years ago and he had been in a nursing home for some time. I have yet to formulate a reasonably valid excuse; suffice it to say that it’s been a cold and miserably wet day, with snow and rain, the church itself is bitterly cold, there are always people in the congregation who are nursing winter chills and flu, apt to pass them on, funerals rarely do the deceased justice, and they are no longer on my list of must-attend occasions, particularly the formulaic Church dos, except in the case of people who matter to me. Call me what you like, weak-kneed, lazy, mean, selfish, all of those could apply.Nowadays I find it hard to force myself to do things I don’t want to do. Perhaps I don’t try very hard? And I really, truly, definitely, do not mind if nobody comes to my funeral, which is going to be a very basic, simple and quiet affair.In Victorian times things were very different; they shrouded grief in elaborate and complex rituals.“The depth of the band on a man’s hat and  the width of a black border on a piece of writing paper indicated to the world the precise stage that mourning had reached. Whether this made sorrow any easier to bear is debatable. Perhaps all that can be said of these fashions in mourning is that their intricacy kept people occupied when they most needed to be and provided an elaborate facade behind which to conceal their sorrow.” (Debrett’s Etiquette)Lately I have started to think of the future. It’s still very hazy and rather than making plans for what I might want to do, I have clearer ideas on what I certainly don’t want to happen: having lost the most important person in my life I do not want to replace him; there will never be an unconditionally welcoming space within friendly arms again, all I can hope for is a companionable hug from a male or female friend to say ‘hello’ or ‘goodbye’. There are advantages to living on one’s own, i.e. without a co-habitee, house sharer or lodger. We cannot know what the future holds but I prefer not to have my space invaded, I prefer to be without a dependent being, or someone who tries to look into my mind and soul. I do not want to be disturbed or disarranged, and I do not want to be a caregiver again. I have brought up two children, taken care of my parents in their final years in different ways and looked after and cared for Beloved’s every need in his last year. I tell myself that I would love to be able to take care of him still, but I am not sure how keen I would be as his illness and confusion progressed into total disability. As it would have done had he lived. I miss him dreadfully, but maybe ten months later I see him more as the man he was before he fell ill.Today I can make up my mind about what I want to do and when and how and why I want to do it. I don’t need to make compromises, I can arrange every day as I want it. Not an unalloyed pleasure, of course, it is a privilege which could easily bring loneliness and boredom and a descent into self-absorption. One can have too much of a good thing, as they say. I expect with time will come a way of finding activities that will fill the empty space.I am not done with mourning. Strangely, grieving for Beloved has stirred up the pain of old losses. I find myself missing my parents all over again, thinking of them and their way of departing this world; I am even mourning the loss of my home country, something I have only ever done in the shape of temporary Heimweh. (Home sickness is not entirely the same) I also mourn the loss of my daughter who is alive and well, but lost to me all the same. I mourn my callow youth, the loss of friends here and in the old country and I mourn opportunities I missed and roads I have not taken.Perhaps, with grief not as deadening and all-encompassing as it was, with finally accepting Beloved’s death and learning to come to terms with it, a period of calm reflection will bring relief and renewed hope for a bearable future. Darkest winter must turn to spring eventually."},
{"title": "More Ruminations", "date": "Wednesday 17 January 2018", "text": "Goodness gracious, how lovely to see so many of you return to this tardy blog; it made me feel all warm and wanted. Thank you so much. I shall pick myself up and start visiting and commenting too; what a community we are!One thing I’m glad about is that I stayed in our house, now just mine. At first I felt that I should move as soon as possible, telling myself that the house is too big, the garden is too big, it’s too empty, too lonely, too isolated. When your partner or anyone else you love dearly falls terminally ill and dies you feel helpless, hopeless. There is nothing you can do to regain control. So you grab at anything that makes you feel in control; moving home being one such undertaking. Rearrange the externals and you’re back in charge. Except you’re not. Less than ever, because now you have upped anchor and lost everything that gives you a grounding, the comfort of the familiar. In my case common sense prevailed, or perhaps it was just lethargy, cowardice, fear of the unknown. Anyway, I am still here and likely to stay here, who knows for how long. Somehow, Beloved is all around me, literally so, of course. I have made a small memorial garden for him with a bench, where I can sit and talk to him. It’s snowdrop time, his long drawn out dying time, has been since Christmas, when the first little bells poked their heads out of the muddy, at times snowy, then again frozen, ground. Once they have faded I shall dig up a clump and plant them in ‘his’ patch, awaiting all future anniversaries of his death.The problem is that there is work to be done to the house, nothing major, just some painting and maybe rearranging rooms, deciding whether to live downstairs and upstairs or just downstairs, changing a downstairs room into a bedroom. This makes it sound rather grand but it isn’t, it’s just that the original owner of this house, who built it to suit her needs, more or less built two bungalows on top of each other, making it easy to divide the house.So, what to do? When I asked a friend, idly speculating that perhaps I am too old to go in for great redecorating schemes - the usual thing: is it worth it? will I have the time to enjoy it? how long will I be able to stay? - he recalled an anecdote. ‘Two clergymen met. One of them was wearing a suit which had clearly seen better days, looking rather frayed round the edges. “Thing is, do I bother to buy a new one at my age,” the wearer asked his friend. “Buy a new suit?” his friend replied. “I don’t even buy green bananas.”The story cheered me up no end. I used to tell Mum to go ahead and treat herself to anything she fancied, no matter how short the time to enjoy it. Now I myself am the kind of ditherer who can’t make up her mind because it might not be ‘cost-effective’. (Sorry about the word, I don’t really speak in such terms, just couldn’t think of anything more apt for our mercenary times.)Talking of cheering myself up: I have seen a bereavement counsellor who let me talk for an hour, singing Beloved’s praises and going back over the wonderful thirty years we had together. Although close to tears at times it made me realise how very fortunate we were and what wonderful memories I  have. A whole treasure chest of them. I will see her again. Talking really is the best cure for me. My step-daughter recommended that I write to Beloved, a kind of daily diary, I may yet do that too, although I prefer to talk to him.Another coping mechanism is increasing physical activity, releasing endorphins, happy hormones. \"any of a group of hormones secreted within the brain and nervous system and having a number of physiological functions. They are peptides which activate the body's opiate receptors, causing an analgesic effect.” My doctor came up with that one when I consulted her about depression. So now I go to the gym and enjoy it greatly. I do exercises, pound (or rather went from shamble via amble to walk) the treadmill, cycle on a beautiful stand bike  and will be doing weights and other infernal machines by and by, as soon as my personal instructor gives the green light. I have to be careful because of the heart condition which is otherwise fully under control.Eating chocolate and/or falling in love also produce endorphins; I’ve tried the chocolate cure with great enthusiasm but that had rather sad side effects for my hips. And unless you can show me a sweet kitten or puppy I shall probably never fall in love again."},
{"title": "Ruminations", "date": "Monday 15 January 2018", "text": "15th November to 15th January - a long break from blogging. Only five followers have decided that this blog isn’t worth following now, so thanks to all of you who have stayed. This whole following stuff is a bit silly, I suppose, but there you go, silly is as silly does. Or is that silly too?The year wasn’t even 12 hours old before I had the first accident: I broke a glass and caused a long, thin cut in my hand which bled a bit but has healed nicely. At least it wasn’t a mirror; anticipating seven years bad luck on top of the disastrous 2017 might have caused me to swoon and thus made burying the shards underground, by moonlight, hard to do.I don’t do resolutions, but I did, sort of, this year. I was planning to stop being obsessed with the news, to leave Brexit and Trump to get on with things and concentrate on more pleasant aspects. There aren’t any. Brexit is a catastrophe, getting more so by the week, because our government hasn’t the faintest idea how to go about saving our cake, never mind eating it too. And Trump? I thought if I can stop myself reading about him and he presses the nuclear button, at least I won’t know in advance that I am going to be annihilated. So far I haven’t had much luck, the stupidity and hatefulness of those lording it over us remains fascinating.What a world we live in. Interesting times indeed.How was your Christmas and New Year? Good? Glad to hear it. Contrary to expectations mine wasn’t too bad either. Friends rallied round and gave me meals, drinks and a cosy place by their fire. There were a few modest parties, some good conversations, good food, plenty of books, schlock TVand candlelight. Christmas day was a delight. Dinner, decent wine, poetry and Paddington Bear, the same kind of Christmas Beloved and I used to have.There was something else which was good. My son came some ten days before Christmas, just for an over-nighter with a sufficiency of hours on each of the two days either side for us to have a comfortable and unrushed visit. He comes to ‘do jobs’. This time I didn’t have much in the way of ‘jobs’, he fixed a sticking music cabinet drawer and maybe something else minor which I have forgotten. There was, however, a pile of Christmas cards ready for distribution and we walked around Valley’s End, my son holding Millie’s lead and me popping up lanes and into courtyards to push them into letterboxes, introducing him to villagers out on similar errands every few yards. The great thing about the visit was that we reconnected; I had ordered a Nordmann fir, the first Christmas tree for several years, which was still sitting outside, undressed and unloved. Together we brought it in and dressed it with all the old family baubles, some of them dating back to my childhood, with coloured lights and all the usual kind of kitsch decorations. We had a wonderful time, listening to ancient carols and plainchant, eating Stollen and spiced biscuits and having a turkey dinner by candlelight and incense sticks perfuming the air. We talked comfortably. I haven’t felt as close to him for many years.Both of us felt good, both of us hoped that this might become our own, private, tradition. We might even use the same tree. I am going to ask gardener to pot it on into a bigger container in the spring and then it can come back in next year, a foot or so taller.My darling Millie is getting old, thirteen next month, according to her inoculation record card. I had thought she was ‘only’ twelve. She is doddery on her hind legs and she had a cancer operation just before Christmas. The wound has healed well and the current cancer has been removed completely. Unfortunately it is one of those that recur. Dogs are wonderful, she never turned a hair. Surely it must’ve hurt? Just a bit? She went in in the morning and the vet said to come back for her before nightfall. At three they rang: could I come and collect her, she had woken from the anaesthetic and wanted to get out of her cage. “She would be better off recovering at home and not to worry if she didn’t want to eat.” The first thing she did when she came into the house was to stagger to her empty dish and beseech me with big brown eyes: “where’s my dinner, I haven’t had a single crumb since yesterday evening!” She is still happy and keen on her food, so maybe she has a while yet. It will be hard when I lose her too.More ruminations to follow, so don’t bother commenting just yet. That is if there’s still somebody reading."},
{"title": "Our History In Photographs", "date": "Wednesday 15 November 2017", "text": "“The single most important component of a camera is the twelve inches behind it.” – said Ansel Adams.That’s were Beloved took up position.He was an excellent photographer. He had kept photograph albums of his own work from the time before we were together, a round dozen of them, which I inherited. He took many more photographs in our thirty years together, those I am keeping for now. But the early ones I filleted, sorted the pictures according to subject and, where I recognised the person, passed them on. I have only two small piles of pictures left, mostly of former colleagues, musicians all, which I am going to send to the Royal Opera House for distribution. A rather larger pile is of landscapes, cityscapes, mountains, rivers, the ancient bricks and mortar of European towns, churches, cathedrals, castles, market squares, secret passages in backwater villages, balconies overflowing with geraniums in French and Italian cobbled streets. What to do with these? I have many more in the albums I am going to keep; while I am alive they shall help to remind me of holidays we took in our time together. But what about the others? What to do with them?I am not as good a photographer as Beloved was, I shan’t feel obliged to keep my own photos when his are so much better. But I have ancient photographs from a time before I was born, pictures of figures in formal dress, people I can no longer place, if I ever could. From my parents I inherited a boxful of loose pictures as well as three albums, the last one of which is a chaos of unrelated images which, as a child, I glued in without order, with the subjects unnamed and long forgotten. There is no one left who could help me identify them. I’d love to know who the smartly dressed lady is, elegantly  and elaborately coiffeured, in a long, flowing skirt, a white frilled high necked blouse with sleeves puffed to the elbow and from there to the wrists tightly buttoned. She is standing upright next to a chair on which, standing stiffly to attention, is a small child in a dark dress with a white pinafore, white stockings and black, shiny shoes. A boy? A girl? I vaguely remember Mum saying : this is aunt somebody, but whose aunt, hers or her mother’s?We take hundreds of photographs which we post on social media (or not) where they will be preserved for eternity. Or at least for as long as our current form of social media exists. Since I have uploaded my pictures on to a screen I no longer stick them into albums. I had a look the other day, it says there are 6.000 of them; I sincerely hope that most of them are doubles and trebles; I surely have not taken 6.000 images? What on earth for?Since Beloved died I have hardly taken any, fewer than I can count on the fingers of one hand: one of the German Bundesadler (Federal Eagle) in the Consulate where I applied for my new passport, one of the instructions on the inside of the Aga door how to operate the cooker, (which didn’t come out readable), a couple of spring flower beds. No more.Some time in 2016 I treated myself to a new camera, idiot-proof the salesman said; I must have given the impression of an accomplished photographer. I still haven’t learned how to use it to its full capacity, little effort on my part leading to little progress. There must be someone who will teach me. The University of the Third Age does a photography class but I think you need to know how to handle the mechanics at the very least.Old photographs have something so sad about them, the subjects no longer exist, they have become mere ghosts of the past, our own past, or our families' past. Gathering dust at worst, stuck in forgotten old-fashioned albums at best, they slowly fade and with them fade our memories. Here are a few lines taken from Philip Larkin’s “Lines on a Young Lady’s Photograph Album”.But o, photography! as no art is,Faithful and disappointing! that recordsDull days as dull, and hold-it smiles as frauds,. . . .How overwhelmingly persuadesThat this is a real girl in a real place,In every sense empirically true!. . . .Or is it just the past? Those flowers, that gate,These misty parks and motors, lacerateSimply by being you; youContract my heart by looking out of date."},
{"title": "Picking Up and Moving On . . .", "date": "Saturday 28 October 2017", "text": ". . . starting with a visit to the Royal Shakespeare Company’s production of Marlowe’s play 'Dido Queen of Carthage’ which is based on Virgil’s Aeneid. It is a play of intense human passions.SYNOPSISFleeing a war-torn Troy, Aeneas is a refugee seeking new roots and a new identity in Europe. Queen Dido is ready to help him when meddling Gods intervene and turn help into an all-consuming love.The goddess Venus complains that Jupiter has been neglecting her son Aeneas, who has been lost in a storm on his way to found a new Troy in Italy. Jupiter calms the storm, allowing Aeneas to land safely on the North African coast.Aeneas meets with other surviving Trojans who have been receiving hospitality from Dido, Queen of Carthage. When Aeneas meets Dido, she agrees to supply his ships and he tells her about the fall of Troy.In order to keep Aeneas safe Venus sends Cupid to make Dido fall in love with Aeneas to stop him resuming the dangerous mission to Italy. Venus and Juno come together to create a storm, forcing Dido and Aeneas into a cave together. There, they declare their feelings for each other and consummate their love.Meanwhile, preparations are made for the Trojans to depart for Italy. Dido removes the sails from the ships so that they cannot go, although Aeneas denies intending to leave. Dido announces that he will be king of Carthage and they decide to found the new Troy there instead.Hermes informs Aeneas that he has no choice but to leave as his destiny is in Italy. Aeneas reluctantly agrees and goes to tell Dido. She is horrified and burns everything that reminds her of him. Heartbroken, Dido takes fate into her own hands and kills herself while Aeneas’ s fleet, with him on board, sails for Italy.I enjoyed the outing very much. No matter how convenient and stress-free live streaming to local cinemas is, a live performance, on stage, in Stratford-upon-Avon, is always a special occasion. There’s nothing like the buzz you get from the collective anticipation of a theatre filled to capacity.My friends and I have already booked tickets for a series of plays starting from January. Additional excitement will be added to the trips by spotting that we were passing a branch of my favourite supermarket in a town on the way. We stopped on the way home and I indulged in some unnecessary and excessive food shopping, mostly treats and luxuries. OK, so I added a few vegetables to my cart for virtue.There you are, something to look forward to.Social life is picking up. I wonder if people round here are psychic? Or perhaps I am giving off more receptive vibes? For the past few weeks I have been very aware of the fact that my loneliness is always more intense at weekends. Beloved and I made something of them and sitting at the table in solitary state, no matter how tempting the food or palatable the wine, there’s none of the warmth of two people in perfect harmony sharing a meal. So I am glad to report that I have a Sunday luncheon invitation for tomorrow! I had an invitation to supper last night and last Sunday I had two invitations: one to drinks before lunch and one to lunch, at  two different houses. I will accept every invitation coming my way even those I might have turned down previously. On two occasions recently I met with people whom I liked very much, one of them a brand new acquaintance. Perhaps I’ll write about them presently.It looks like life might be returning. In one of my prolonged bouts of sitting on the second from bottom step of the stairs in the hall after returning home from a walk with Millie I’ve been asking myself where I think my life might be going. Who am I, now that I am alone? I never did identify myself by my relationship with other people, i.e. wife/mother/grandmother. With Beloved gone there is now nobody who depends on me and, for the time being, I do not depend on anyone either. The latter will eventually change, of course, if I am unlucky. Decrepitude comes to us all in the end. Sans Eyes, sans Teeth, sans Taste, sans Everything, as Shakespeare has it. But not yet.Finally, the relationship with my daughter has broken down again, for good I think. She won’t say why. Marlowe has a wonderful line spoken by Aeneas to his friend and fellow Trojan about his disappearing mother, Venus:Stay gentle Venus fly not from thy sontoo cruel! why wilt thou forsake me thus?or in these shades deceiv’st mine eyes so oft?why talk we not together hand in hand,and tell our griefs in more familiar terms?But thou art gone and leav’st me here alone,to dull the air with my discursive moan.Strikes me it works the other way round too. Or for anyone left by someone they love. Whichever way, in life or in death.If I come up with an answer as to how I see my remaining years go I’ll let you know. Does anyone out there ask themselves a similar question?"},
{"title": "Back to . . . . ", "date": "Monday 16 October 2017", "text": ". . . . . . a bit of this and a bit of that.Still spending hours reading rather than writing or doing anything else creative. Still obsessed with the news, both here and across the world. How very foolish of me to search for items on Brexit, the humanitarian catastrophes currently unfolding in the Yemen and Somalia and Myanmar’s Buddhists' genocide of the Rohingya people in Asia. Who knew Buddhists are no less cruel than adherents of any other faiths can be, given half a chance and a great enough measure of hatred of ‘the other’? And then there’s the good old USofA and that magnificent example of how a democracy works.So why do I feel this obsession? You tell me, I have no idea. As if life weren’t miserable enough already.Book reading is different though, I am sticking with delightfully lightweight fare. I have just finished a tale by Amor Towles, a writer new to the bookshelves. 'A Gentleman in Moscow’ covers 32 years in the life of a Russian aristocrat who has been sentenced to house arrest in a small attic in a luxury hotel in Moscow. Should he risk leaving the hotel he’d be shot. In spite of these 32 years coinciding with the most harrowing period in Russia’s recent history the story is uplifting: how to make the most of a bum deal. I enjoyed it greatly. Grand literature in the Russian classic tradition it is not but tragedy is not what I’m after.For much of the week I am ok but weekends are hard. There’s the poetry group, the German Conversation group, there’s a bit of shopping, a chat with a friendly soul while out with Millie, tradespeople and repairmen, hedge cutters, old gardener and Kelly the cleaner, the pleasure of a meal at the pub when family old and new come for a visit, or with other pensioners for the ‘seniors’ deal’. Only Kelly and old gardener come regularly once a week and I now spend quite a bit of time chatting with them rather than letting them get on with their jobs.I remember the time after my Dad’s death when my own Mum must have been very lonely.  She used to ring me at least once a week, usually on Sunday morning. I remember feeling impatient with her, she’d ramble on and on about nothing much. Often she’d say “If only you had stayed in Germany”. Poor Mum. Even though I flew across and stayed with her every few months, particularly during her last couple of years - leaving Beloved, my relatively new husband,  alone - she had few friends and was unable to adjust to life on her own. Poor Mum indeed. I hope I will do better.For quite some time I have been fretting over renewing my passport. I am still a German national and will forever be one. Now, after Brexit, I am even less inclined to apply for British citizenship. On the whole, people reassure me that after all these years living here, working here, paying my taxes and having British husbands throughout (one at a time) I will not be summarily deported. But if I were I’d simply sell up and move back to Germany, although I’d prefer not to. My life has been here for so long now I’d probably find settling in Germany difficult. So, I needed to renew my passport which cannot be done by post. After Beloved’s death and completion of the necessary paperwork following on, I finally had the space and time to go to Cardiff (or Liverpool) and apply with the Honorary German Consul in either of these cities. A train journey would get me there. That is until my leg and hip turned on me. I was in perfect agony for more than two weeks and the thought of travelling by train became a nightmare. In stepped my son. “Mum, I have a few days off in October, would you like me to come over and do whatever needs doing?”  Would I? Would I? He took me to Cardiff by car and we even had enough time to spend hours in my favourite department store where we had lunch, afternoon tea and a leisurely stroll around the ladies’ clothing floor. I came away with a very smart and rather expensive jumper. It’s so long since I bought myself anything at all in the clothing line that buying this jumper (sweater?) felt like a real treat. I  really am most grateful for my son’s kind deed. And what’s more, I should have a passport within six weeks, one of those European Union passports with fingerprints and eye recognition. As soon as I have sorted myself out I shall probably do some travelling again.I have had no further news from my daughter other than a pleasant note in reply to my email, but I am still hopeful; she’s been on holiday and may be short of time. It would be nice to be on good terms with both my children. However, as I said in the previous post, I will expect nothing and appreciate everything.As I sit here writing, Ophelia is roaring around the house. It’s a storm now, not a hurricane, but it is quite frightening enough. My main concern is about the beech tree holding on to it’s roots. Millie and I ventured out this afternoon but not for long and no further than the field. And keeping well away from trees. The forecast is for gusts of 80 - 90 mph to continue into the night. As I am (I didn’t say WE, there’s progress!) quite a way inland from the West Wales coast perhaps the strength of the wind will be less by and by. Should I go to bed or stay up? What do people in the hurricane prone regions do? I still have electricity.I have enjoyed writing this post; I know it’s pretty anodyne and waffly, but yes, I enjoyed it. Perhaps blogging will become a pleasure again."},
{"title": "Afterwards  -  4th and final part", "date": "Sunday 24 September 2017", "text": "I am settling into my new life, strange though that is. I rarely cry. I am often very sad, lonely and still lost, but the raw emotion is lessening. I don’t suppose I will ever stop missing Beloved. I still speak to him, still ask what he was thinking of when he decided to leave.  Old and lonely people supposedly speak to themselves; yes, I can confirm that. I pretend it’s Millie I’m talking to but really it’s me. My conversations with myself are by no means interesting, for the most part they are questions like ‘now where did I put that key,’ or 'what did I come in here for’. So far I haven’t fallen prey to doing that in public, like a mad old woman mumbling to herself, the kind that carries a huge, shabby bag around with her. Today there was a charity concert in the Church towards the installation of loos in the annexe which included the sale of raffle tickets as well as the modest entrance fee. I paid for entrance, bought my raffle ticket and promptly forgot where I’d put it. When the raffle was held at the 'tea and cakes included’  bit in the Church hall afterwards I frantically rummaged through every single pocket asking out loud where the ticket could have disappeared to in the space of a mere hour.  My table neighbours, being understanding and forgiving, simply found that funny.I noticed that it was dark outside at 8 pm. I dread the coming winter evenings. I’ve never felt happy during the dark months, I fear that I shall feel even more unhappy on my own this winter. Books and TV are a great help but I must try and connect more with other people. If only I were a joiner. Valley’s End has endless societies, clubs and organisations, very few of them appeal to me. I suppose I could join the more interesting ones, the wildlife and local history groups? Rejoin the gardening club? And write about them and their members? If I could get back into my slightly acid mode of writing? Would that help?It’s very difficult to change direction midstream. It is also very difficult to change attitude. One evening not long ago I had a special supper, opened a bottle of wine, and put my feet up in front of the TV. There was a programme on I had been looking forward to all day. I sat in Beloved’s very comfortable chair, leaned back and felt strangely happy. Here was an evening which was all mine, to do with as I pleased. All evenings have been free like that for months now, why should I feel particularly happy on this particular evening? Then it came to me. I was unencumbered, not answerable to anyone, with the house exactly as I wanted it.On two separate occasions recently I had had family staying. My son had come to help out, drive me places, assist with various tasks around the house, none very arduous but necessary. He had brought his wife along. Those two tend to spread themselves and their belongings, leaving things out overnight and carrying on the next day where they left off the evening before. Their conversation is very limited. They are Seventh-day Adventists whose world revolves around their Church, almost to the exclusion of all else.None of that is blame-worthy. True, I don’t share their beliefs, but we all have our own way of getting through life.I have mentioned here before that my daughter and I have been estranged for many years. We exchange birthday and Christmas cards which has been the sum total of our contact. I felt I needed to send her an email asking whether she wanted to be involved in what is called my ‘end of life’ arrangements. I also wanted to ask her the Big Question, would she be willing to help me to achieve a dignified end if the need arose. One can ask these questions and make these arrangements when there is no immediate need, when one is fit mentally and physically. I am now on my own, without any close confidante or family, no friends I would wish to burden with undue responsibilities.I had assumed that my daughter would reply yes or no, and that further contact would continue by email. But no, she wrote to say that she would come and we could discuss things in person. I was very pleased if a little apprehensive.In the event the visit went reasonably well;  my daughter spent a lot of time recalling the many hurts she had received during her childhood as well as her marriage to her previous husband. I hope it helped, it is always good to clear the air and dispose of burdens and grievances one has carried around for years. I hope that future contact will gradually improve; we have actually exchanged very friendly and chatty emails.But, and here I get back to my strangely happy evening: neither visit had been emotionally uplifting for me. There had been some stress involved, even if only because of my slight OCD tendency on the one hand and apprehension about possible points of friction on the other. Perhaps I was asking too much, perhaps I was wishing for genuine warmth, less of the dutiful attitude, more of the “you’re not such a bad old stick, we like doing things for you now that we’re the do-ers and you’re the being done-to”.Howsoever that may be, I realise that my attitude all-round will have to change, from grumpiness at not getting what I had hoped for to expecting nothing, accepting gracefully what is given and otherwise enjoying my freedom, my independence and the years ahead.Wise words, here’s hoping I will turn them into deeds. And that there will be more of those strangely happy evenings."},
{"title": "Afterwards   Part 3", "date": "Monday 4 September 2017", "text": "\"Looking at it logically, there’s no doubt that I’ll go before you,\" he said whenever the conversation turned to old age and shuffling off the mortal coil. “All things being equal, of course.”Not the kind of equality I was looking forward to. You look at these things from a distance using the same comfortable specs that will eventually take you through every difficult patch, when you can see an end to whatever problem happens to bar the road. Intellectually you know it has to happen sooner or later, but ‘nah, not to us’, ostrich-like. (I do believe that’s a myth, ostriches do not stick their heads into the sand).I am still counting the weeks since it happened. Still thinking ‘I wonder if there was anything we/I didn’t do / could have done that would have put off the evil day?' The simple fact is that it was his time.His time, not mine. Not mine, so now I feel guilty for having outlasted Beloved. I feel guilty for surviving, for surviving and not crashing, for surviving and not lying shattered in a heap, wailing and broken; surviving and functioning, quite well, on the face of it. How shallow does that make me? Why am I not destroyed? I have no idea if guilt is part of the grieving process, like anger and denial,  - I won’t be going back to the websites that would enlighten me. But guilt is a frequent yet vague visitor, unacknowledged, not dragged into the light of day to look at dispassionately. It’s almost as if I need to feel this guilt.Could that be the reason why I now have habits that were Beloved’s habits, never mine? We have a small paring knife. It was his favourite and an absolute no-no for me. \"The handle too small, the blade too short, I simply cannot get on with it”. Now it’s my favourite kitchen knife, I rummage in the drawer for it. Beloved and I both had muesli for breakfast, he with banana pennies, me without. He invariably offered me half his banana, I invariably turned it down. “You know I don’t like bananas”, I’d say, irritably. Guess what’s on my bowl of muesli now? Every morning? And who gets a large chunk of the banana? Beloved’s favourite chair was one of those large semi recliners. I always complained that it was bad for his posture, that he should at least keep it upright. Now this large, rather comfortable, dark green leather chair embraces me for TV watching and reading. Yes, I do make it lean back and often fall asleep in it for a spell. Oh yes, I also wear his summer anorak, although it’s rather baggy on me. And, no doubt, some of his better shirts left in the wardrobe will come in handy for me.It’s a way of keeping him alive."},
{"title": "Afterwards   Part 2", "date": "Sunday 27 August 2017", "text": "You walk into the sitting room and your husband is lying on the floor. He is conscious but unable to get himself up; the first thing you do is fetch a pillow to place under his head and a blanket to cover him, then you call an ambulance. The paramedics arrive, switch on their monitors, get him upright, check him over. “We have to take him in”, they say. The last you see of him is the scared and confused look on his face as the gurney is wheeled out of your sitting room. It’s an image which is as clear today as it was then.It is also the last time he is in his own home. The last day of normal life. For both of you.That evil day now lies eight months in the past. Afterwards is truly here.In her book “The Year of Magical Thinking” (one of the best non-fiction books ever written) Joan Didion says ‘Until now I had been able only to grieve, not mourn’. I hadn’t thought of it before, but it’s perfectly true and eminently logical: the two processes are entirely different. Grief happens to you, mourning is something you do. ‘Mourning, the act of dealing with grief, requires attention.’I have been doing my very best to avoid ‘giving attention’ to grief, and thus mourn, by reading obsessively, often rubbish and light weight stuff, watching hours of meaningless TV, staring into space without focus, sleeping and/or dozing, with or without artificial aids, buying and drinking wine - the latter in moderation, it doesn’t take a lot before I feel sick - and eating chocolate.Reading still figures high on my to-do list - that is if I had a to-do list - but I have turned to more satisfactory nourishment. (see my new ‘books I have read and enjoyed’ in the right hand margin). I am more selective in my TV watching too, choosing movies over sitcoms. At present I am working my way through the Tolkien range; enjoying the splendid special effects, magnificent landscapes and epic battles. Sometimes I find myself grinning at the plot, what little there is of it, and the grandiose dialogue. I also search out romcoms, a genre Beloved  and I simply never considered before.I have been told to pursue anything that gives me pleasure by a professional who deals with people in distress. Now I ask myself how long can I go on doing this before the whole edifice of avoidance crashes down on me? Can one avoid mourning altogether? Will it catch up with me sooner or later?I went to see my heart specialist for my annual check-up; he found me in perfect good heart health - amazingly - so we spent my allotted time comparing notes. He is a Dutchman, working in the NHS temporarily and we wondered how long before the dread hand of the Brexiteers comes knocking on our doors, showing us the way out. In his opinion mourning intensifies with time; by the end of the first year it is at its most acute. In particular the first anniversaries of any special days, like birthdays and Christmas. Wouldn’t these days have to have been special throughout your time together? We were always very restrained when it comes to special celebrations.There is, however, something to celebrate: I have finally had the cataract in my seeing eye removed. For the last two years of Beloved’s life, while my time was taken up with increasingly needing to be his carer, my eyesight gradually deteriorated until the ophthalmologist pointed out that my driving days were over. In fact, had I been caught during my daily visits to the Nursing Home, the DVLA (Driver and Licensing Vehicle Agency) would have taken my licence away and I might have faced prosecution. The eye is healing nicely, my sight is restored and I am looking forward to going under the knife with the other, little-or-non-seeing-eye. A bit more light could make a difference there too, I am told. The operation was the most expensive half hour of my life but, had I chosen NHS treatment, I would have had to wait for up to nine months. Living where I do, being unable to drive is just not an option.Every time I go out to the shops I practice reading number plates from a distance of 20.5 m. When out walking Millie I put down my cane at a spot I imagine to be 20.5 m away from a stationary vehicle and pace towards it. I am always highly delighted when I find that I’ve covered more than the requisite distance. A great improvement !Guess what was the first thing I did when I realised that my ability to read had improved also? I ordered three books, real paper, printed, hold in your hand and turn pages books! For more than two years I could only read digitally! I still need reading glasses, but so what? Kindles will still be part of my life, but so will books again from now on."},
{"title": "Afterwards  -   Part 1", "date": "Monday 21 August 2017", "text": "After Beloved.Everything is afterwards now.There was an old lady's funeral in Valley’s End today; I had planned to go, was determined to go; she had been a friend of sorts and I thought I should pay my respects to her and her husband and family. Also, it would have meant joining a throng of villagers for the funeral tea afterwards, chatting, mingling, getting back into village life, rather than clinging for succour to the few friends I have. So, all things considered, surely a good plan?I didn’t go. Sitting over my solitary lunch - the funeral was at 2.30 in the afternoon - I felt bad. I knew I wasn’t going to go, no matter how urgently I pressed myself to do so. When I finally hit upon the solution I felt great relief. 'I’ll say, I just couldn’t face it’, I told myself, ‘it’s too soon after Beloved’s death’. ‘I shall break down in tears’. That would do for an excuse I thought. ‘Nobody can expect me to attend.’ That’s what I came up with, and all that after I had promised myself that, from now on, I would never feel obliged to lie again for appearances’ sake. Without Beloved’s polite good manners to rein me in I can say what I feel. Not giving offence, hopefully, but not giving much of a damn either. As my good friend Andrew says: ‘It’s brilliant to mature beyond giving a damn’. \"When I am an old woman I shall wear purple with a red hat which doesn’t go . . . .” Jenny Joseph’s ‘Warning' may only seem to concern itself with outward appearance but look a little deeper and she’s telling you to take yourself and your disapproval on a running jump from a short plank.It’s frequently like that: I have every intention of coming out of my cave, blinking in the sudden light of day, joining others, accepting that life goes on. The other day I bought an expensive concert ticket. Some friends were going to take me and it would have been a pleasant evening. I let the ticket go using a dicky tummy for an excuse. True, I had had some rumblings and frequent loo visits during the day but I was feeling much better come evening. “Such a pity you had to miss the concert,” my friends said afterwards, “you missed a real treat.” Of course life goes on, I am here, am I not? At first I didn’t care to survive, alone, friendless, lacking family, lacking purpose. (There’s some self pity in there. ) Now I do. In fact I have made a decision: I want to survive for years yet, becoming a sharp-witted and sharp-tongued old woman. When I told a couple of friends on separate occasions, both said “Well, you shouldn’t find that difficult, you haven’t far to go to reach your goal.” How lucky I am to have friends who feel able to make that sort of comment, don’t you agree?The wretched problem is that the recently bereaved become vulnerable, naked; being visible draws attention to that state of insecurity. It’s almost as if you have to take baby steps before you can walk out into the world again with any kind of self assurance. And the lack of focus on something other than grief, the lack of purpose that can fill the mostly empty days make survival questionable. I can’t even say that Beloved died too soon or unexpectedly, although the end did come rather suddenly. He was old and very ill and his mind had begun to wander. But grief does not depend on justification, it just sits there, like the elephant in the room, taking up all your breathing space.Although Simone de Beauvoir was not speaking about grief when she wrote in her study on the ageing process: \"the paradox of our time is that the aged enjoy better health than they used to and that they remain “young” longer. This makes their idleness all the harder to bear. Those who live on must be given some reason for living: mere survival is worse than death.” The survivor had better rediscover that life is for living."},
{"title": "Try Again - Now What?", "date": "Saturday 17 June 2017", "text": "In spite of good intentions, this blog, although much on my mind, hasn’t seen any activity since the beginning of June. I could say that ‘tempus fugit’ and suchlike - we’re all guilty of using hackneyed phrases occasionally - but the truth is that mundane stuff just doesn’t cut it at the moment. Equally true is that I feel I should come back here, otherwise there’ll be no point. And, like I said in the previous post, getting back into some form of regular activity can only do me good.No two days are the same.  Tomorrow it’ll be twelve weeks since Beloved died and five months since that awful day when he fell and was carted off to hospital, never to return home (until now, more of that later). Actually, here’s that phrase again: I can’t believe it’s been that long, I really can’t.In a way he is still here; we never did live in each other’s pocket and spent much time during the day doing different things in different parts of house and garden. On countless occasions during my solitary days now I have to remind myself that, no, I can’t tell him about this little thing or that one. And, no, he has not just left a room when I enter it. I don’t know if that kind of denial is conscious or sub-conscious, but it is like the clever clogs say, denial is a large part of the grieving process. Anger is one that seems to have passed me by. Although I’ve been very angry with Beloved for leaving me, have cursed him, blamed him, I am not angry at anyone else, don’t blame anyone else. For me it’s been denial followed by depression followed by denial. On some days during Millie's walking me I’ve stood and watched her sniff and snuffle while sniffling and snuffling myself, tears running down my face, using soggy tissues to wipe them away and constantly blowing my nose. It’s OK to do that in Valley’s End, people know the reason why.Depression is the very devil. I sit and stare, have a drink of water, sit and stare some more. Watch rubbish TV, hardly taking it in, sit and stare some more. On a good day I read, voraciously, nothing very demanding, but losing myself in an easily absorbed story; book after book. I eat microwaveable meals or easily prepared fridge/freezer meals with ingredients collected from supermarkets, like burgers, sausages, rice and pasta. Lunch today was pasta with tomato sauce and a small bowl of strawberries for pudding. Not to forget a glass of Chardonnay. It’s rather hot today, not really eating weather.After a particularly prolonged bout of sadness and weepiness a week or two ago I pulled myself up one morning and more or less forced myself to ‘do’ rather than ‘feel'. Inertia is deadly, it turns you into a useless blob and would be self destructive in the long run. Although I do not believe in the value of “looking on the bright side” or “staying positive” - both can make you feel guilty if you fail to follow up - a whole day’s worth of ‘doing’ felt so good that I repeated it the next day. I sat for hours doing paperwork, did laundry, gardened, cooked a proper meal with vegetables and ate it, walked Millie, and watched an intelligent documentary on TV in the evening. The next day I got the car out of the garage and drove to Ludlow for some shopping, the bank, the clothes collection bins and the Oxfam shop to deliver unwanted goods. I came home healthily tired and feeling alive again.Neglecting paperwork during a time when there are heaps of it is not advisable. I found letters from official sources which should have been dealt with weeks ago, all shoved to the back of Beloved’s bureau. It’s actually quite amusing, all the stuff he would have dealt with got bundled into his desk, all the stuff which normally falls to me sat on my desk upstairs. Neither got done until I grabbed hold of myself by the scruff and simply started; no, I didn’t want to do it, no, I wanted to sit and stare, but for once I was determined! And nearly all of it got done.Official letters to the recently bereaved all have the same flavour. They are ever so carefully worded and all start with the same phrase: “we were sorry to hear of - name - ’s death and send you our heartfelt condolences at this very difficult time”.  Then a passage about the matter in hand, giving you to understand that although perhaps you should give it your speedy consideration they understand if it should take you a little longer, although you, the bereaved, may wish to settle it as a matter of slight urgency. Then the final phrase :\"we hope that this has clarified the situation for you but if you have any further questions we will be only too happy to assist you if you ring this number\", which is an actual phone number, not a computer generated question and press button x service. Do you think there are half-day seminars where staff is taught how to conduct themselves vis-a-vis people who might burst into tears if you talk common sense to them?Yesterday, on another visit to Ludlow, again to visit a bank and some shops and a photographer for passport photos, I also finally collected Beloved and brought him home. My stepson in Massachusetts tells me that he has heard of green funerals but that they don’t seem to have reached the US yet. I have Beloved’s Ashes, in a green (i.e. recyclable), tubular, surprisingly heavy container. One of these days I shall sprinkle his Ashes in a favourite outdoor, maybe isolated, place. Or now that I’ve decided to stay here in the house until I really can’t cope anymore, I’ll plant a tree and feed it with his Ashes. Old gardener is willing to help, he’s done it for a previous employer who has become part of a rose border. I think it’s a lovely idea, it’s a way of keeping him around, close to me, until I myself have to leave this soil."},
{"title": "Now What?", "date": "Friday 2 June 2017", "text": "Half past three at night, soon the birds will begin their first drowsy chirping. Two lots of paracetamol, half a sleeping pill and two powerful tranquillisers later I am still wide awake. Peaceful, calm, but awake.It’s been a busy day, even hectic and in parts quite stimulating. Old gardener and Kelly the cleaner came in the morning, and for me there was a visit to the surgery for a routine blood test while t hey were putting house and garden in order, (yes, I am still a lady of leisure - properly now, for the first time in my life am I in sole charge of all assets, such as they are, ) then a quick lunch at home and a very perfunctory Millie walk, then off to an invitation to afternoon tea. The proper sort. It started wth a large glass of bubbly,  followed by plates of dainty sandwiches, scones with butter, cream and jam, fruitcake and a sponge. The tea appeared to be an afterthought. The old fashioned kind of afternoon tea, with proper china and napkins.An ancient couple, fellow guests, made decent inroads into the victuals and did the reminiscing that oldies go in for, often because they can’t remember how many times they have repeated the same story and also, because of poor hearing they tend to not hear the answers and just rabbit on.My host and hostess were not exactly close friends but regular dog walkers  and pleasantly chatty acquaintances. We have been to meals to them before, lunches and dinners, First solo invitation, well meant and very kind.Still, so now what? Wherever I go I go alone.The evening was taken up with a meeting of the poetry group, the first since the 21st March, (Beloved died on the 26th, Mothering Sunday). The next meeting would have been on the evening of the funeral so we gave that a miss.By the way, he had a wonderful send-off, with music, even a recording of Walton’s viola solo played by Beloved, quite beautifully, an excerpt from a full performance, directed by Walton himself. There were poems read by professional actors and various speeches, which all concerned themselves exclusively with Beloved and his many achievements. Even I didn’t know half the famous people with whom and for whom he had played. Ever modest, never putting himself forward, my  beloved.Again, so now what? I am almost through with the paperwork, officialdom has been fed with endless forms and certification and statements and a \"o woe is you if you are telling fibs’ has been understood and taken to heart. (I have to be extra careful, I’ll probably be deported in 2019 when Brexit does its foul deed. The only good thing about it is that the leavers will probably be suffering the most, they being mostly the uneducated and most dependent on State benefits, of which there’ll be a scarcity.How to carry on? On my own? I am capable, practical and resourceful, I have few immediate money worries and am intelligent enough to find my way through official mazes. BUT I am TRULY ALONE. I literally have no help, not from family, not from friends. They say they will help and always there’s the “Tell us what we can do” or “You know where we are\" was a favourite. Would they have had a heart attack if I really had approached them? Just a few people knew what to to do. They asked me to pop in for potluck and let me talk about Beloved and themselves said kind things about him. Which made me feel warm and mushy inside.Would blogging help? Perhaps a diary style blogging, much the same as I did before Beloved’s death? I don’t know, I might try. Not necessarily to garner lots of replies and comments, ( that requires a commitment on my part which I find hard to dredge up right now ) more an outpouring of thoughts and feelings. You all tell me that I write honestly, straight from the heart, without tidying things up and without prettifying things. I couldn’t possibly do less at the moment, I simply don’t have it in me to spout platitudes. So whatever comes up is probably not pretty. You have been warned. Stay away if you need the ‘bright side of life’.Ah yes, the eternal question “How Are You? Lovely to see you, how are you doing?” What should the answer be? The questioners look so earnest, so concerned, but at the same time willing me to tell them that I am fine, which makes it hard to look them in the eye. Don’t ask it, just don’t. How do you imagine I feel? If you’ve experienced the death of someone close to you you know anyway, If you are after a simply and untrue “very well thank you; getting there” get lost, don’t bother.And you, you people crossing the road when you see me coming, don’t be so stupid. If you have nothing to say, a common or garden ‘good morning`’ will do and a sentence about the weather when you really find noting comforting within you. A short hug works wonders too. But don’t ignore me, I don’t carry the bubonic plague and death is not contagious."},

{"title": "Still Hanging On,", "date": "Thursday 23 March 2017", "text": "both of us, Beloved by no more than a laboured breath.End stage kidney failure is closing in towards the end, no doubt about it. All the classic signs are there; the doctors say whatever they do now will make no difference at all. Keeping him distress-free and comfortable, those are the sole objectives now. He will, eventually, just fall asleep and not wake up. That’s my hope, anyway.Yesterday he was sitting in his chair, he’d had some soup at lunch and a few drinks of tea and water; he ate a small slice of chocolate cake in the afternoon and I thought: ‘brilliant, there is enough life left to do that.’ Perhaps, perhaps . . . .Strange, I am still hoping for a miracle, how silly of me. When he wanted to get up to use the bathroom (really, to what end? He produces almost nothing now), I called the carers who promptly turned up with the usual hoist. He was too weak to grip the handles, although the inflatable seat thing was doing most of the work. After much effort and, seemingly, pain, they gave up and brought another hoist, a larger one which scoops him out of his chair.To my shame I admit that I couldn’t bear to stay and watch; it was time for me and Millie to leave anyway, so I took the opportunity between hoisting manoeuvres to kiss him good-bye and leave. By the time the whole operation would be finished he’d be too weak to take much notice of me anyway.His deterioration is rapid. Last weekend he was still very different. Both his children visited, over different days, and they really had the best of him, most likely also the last of the good days. Both came over two days, for hours at a time, and both managed to have a sort of conversation with him, although he didn’t entirely make sense. On both occasions he was wheeled into the garden and on the last day with N., Beloved’s son, we actually sat outdoors in mild spring sunshine.“A lovely family reunion,” Beloved said afterwards, he’d obviously conflated the two visits into one. He also thought his mum had been present; it turned out that I represented the old lady who has been dead for many decades. No matter, he truly loved his children’s visit.On the day N. was here Beloved and I had our 30th wedding anniversary, although he barely understood what that meant and quickly forgot the date. In the evening, N. and I went to the local pub where we had a leisurely meal and did something we have hardly done during all the time his Dad and I have been together: we talked. Really talked. It felt good.In fact, I have become closer to both his son and daughter during the period of Beloved’s illness. Isn’t it sad that it takes a catastrophe for people to learn that they can get on without vague undercurrents of resentment and bias.It’s late and I must end here, but given the chance I will tell a tale or two of a lighter nature, to do with other residents of the care home. The seven weeks up to now have not been unrelieved doom and gloom, there have been brighter moments too and, in spite of the pain and loss I am feeling, the one thing I was truly afraid of will now not happen: his body will not outlive his mind. Look at it whichever way you want, that is surely a blessing."},
{"title": "How Wise You Are,", "date": "Monday 6 March 2017", "text": "you are absolutely right, of course, to advise me to slow down. Why declutter now? What’s the hurry? There is no hurry. I can take my time, forget about everything else and concentrate on the only important aspect of the calamity that has befallen us, namely us, me and Beloved. The two of us. Just as it has always been, from the day we met, and will be until the day one of us dies.Our time together is short; the new GP who looks after Beloved in the Nursing Home is of the same opinion as the previous one. It could be anything from a few weeks to a few months. If the present rate of deterioration continues it will be weeks rather than months. Beloved is no longer able to stand, much less walk. At first, four-five weeks ago, he used a cane (walking stick over here), then the stick became a zimmer frame, getting himself out of his chair was slow but possible. Then he needed a carer to assist him. One carer became two, one on each arm. Now two carers are needed in addition to a contraption which is fastened around his middle and bottom, which hoists him semi upright and from there lowers him into a wheelchair. It is utterly painful to watch.How is it possible that this could have happened in a few short months? Snowdrop time; when he fell ill in the middle of December the earliest snowdrops were flowering, ever larger patches appeared during late December and January and now they’re dying, to make room for crocuses and daffodils. Beloved’s decline will forever more be associated with snowdrops in my mind.No two visits are the same. sometimes he is awake, painfully so, restless and sharp; sometimes he is drowsy and sleepy, sometimes he is relatively clear and at others completely clouded. Often we sit in companionable silence, interspersed with a few short sentences, a few questions from him, mainly along the lines of “do you see much of .......” followed by the names of his children. My questions tend to cover his physical state, “what did you have for dinner”, \"are you comfortable?”, “have you any pain?”. The weather comes into it too and Millie, of course. She is a fountain of joy in the desert. Short term memory is a big problem, the distant past an open book.Visits are difficult but not entirely so. There are always wonderful moments of gladness. Long visits are worth it just for these moments. There is still some poetry, and music, of course. I uploaded Pavarotti arias on to my phone, he was rapt, completely absorbed in what he was hearing. Another time we had Marlene Dietrich singing French, German and English chansons. A smile plays around his lips and he sits quietly listening, occasionally stopping to say “lovely”.And always there comes the moment when I see him sneaking a long look at my face; a cheeky smile appears and he says lovely things, like “you are so beautiful,” or “I am so glad I have you”, or “I like your scarf, you look nice”.  And we never forget to say “I love you so”.I am slowly beginning to do paperwork, letters, bills, official communications arrive and end up on the pile. I am sending emails and letters to colleagues, friends and acquaintances with the news of Beloved’s ill-health. I still don’t like casual phone calls which ask \"how is he?” They may be well meant but are an awful drag on my time and my need for silence. I have dealt with Millie’s arthritis, her medication is working. I did an online grocery order today - how strange to be ordering for one instead of two. And how very strange to do an order at all. Life does seem to go on, I must eat. I have sold some minor items of Beloved’s music paraphernalia; two instruments and two bows remain to find a buyer. I have help with that. It’s time to organise the gardeners, Paul has been in a deep depression but is coming out of it. He came for a long mutual session of commiseration, time to get out and start work. Old gardener is as yet unaware of the great change at Castle Moat garden, I really must ring him.And so it goes. Beloved remains the focus of my attention and my main conversation partners are nurses and carers at the Care Home. But now and then, when I sit in front of some rather boring TV show I feel that it might be an idea to use the time spent away from there a little more productively. I expect it’ll happen anyway. Eventually. No rush.Next week Beloved’s son from America is flying over for a day in Ludlow, all things being equal. It’s the second of his four children finding the way to their Dad. The nurse in charge of the unit asked me, did they know how seriously ill he is? Yes, I told them, made it quite clear. One is estranged from his Dad, has been for years, is unlikely to come. That leaves just one. Beloved asked after her three times last week, not in any desperate way, just casually. But it means he is thinking of her. There’s nothing I can do.If he makes it to warmer days I will take him out into the garden at the Home. On Sunday we had bright spring sunshine, we sat by a large window, the sun streaming in and warming his face. \"Lovely to feel the sun on me”, he said. How modest we become, how modest our pleasures."},
{"title": "In Limbo", "date": "Wednesday 22 February 2017", "text": "I always thought I’d be fine being on my own. After all, I spent many years more or less on my own, with the children, admittedly, but very little adult company, except at work. It’s always been on the cards that Beloved goes before me, that’s how it is when you marry someone much older. It’s not a surprise when it happens. But, by golly, it’s strange. And hard.I find myself sitting around uselessly, staring into space, not doing anything. I start on jobs, like clearing out cupboards, decluttering, by fetching out empty boxes ready for filling, And that’s usually as far as I get; empty boxes are piling up but cupboards and chests of drawers remain full. I have taken a few things to charity shops but I’ve hardly made a dent.It’s hard to know what to dispose off. It feels as if I’m clearing Beloved out of my life and this house before he’s even dead. I find programmes of special occasions at the Opera House and foreign tours. Should I keep programmes of Royal occasions, like Charles and Diana’s wedding? What for?  Piles of sheet music, who wants it? Ancient photographs, loose and in albums, any takers? Notes and written records, in a painstakingly small and neat hand, beyond my eyesight now, what relevance do they have now? A large stack of original vinyl, whole sets of symphonies, operas, ballet music, some of them conducted by the composer. Perhaps there’s money in them. I hear vinyl is fashionable again; internet, have you any ideas? Photographic equipment, bags of pre-digital cameras, lenses, etc.; you can’t even give it away.So there I stand, picking up this and that, flicking through, and back it goes on to the shelves.And then I go to my china and glass cupboards. For years I collected things, we had such fun going to antique markets. I also still have stuff I took away when I cleared out my mum’s flat, some of it going back to her wedding. Here too I sit a box on the floor and stare into the shelves. Is there anything I really still want? Everyday stuff lives in the kitchen, yes there are dinner and tea sets. which I will keep for now, but really fancy glass, silver and my willow pattern collection, presents received over the years, bits and pieces picked up here and there, keepsakes for the future, I thought. The future is here and I can only stare at the stuff, feeling paralysed, unable to even formulate a coherent thought, much less carrying it through. There’s stuff which is actually valuable, so not really meant for charity shops, although the things might well end up there eventually.Some of the boxes will be filled when I can bring myself to do so, there are a few things our assorted children will want, but not many. “We don’t have the space”, they say. What they really mean is  “We don’t have the space for your mouldy old treasures.”I’m in limbo. Utterly unable to rouse myself. People and self-help columns tell me I must socialise, get out and about, meet people, talk. I had some tea in a little coffee shop this morning. I met an acquaintance in the street yesterday who hailed me and wanted to know everything about Beloved and me. As well as tell me about her husband who is in hospital at the moment. “Why don’t we keep each other company and have a drink at The Maltings tomorrow”, she said. I couldn’t think of a good enough excuse to turn her down and agreed. It wasn’t too bad, I talked, she talked, then a chap joined us who talked a lot. Quite a lot of the talk was about mental illness in the elderly. Apparently one in three of us will eventually lose our marbles, if we get old enough. Earlier, I had been for a blood test at the surgery. Very soon the nurse launched into a detailed account of how dementia had changed her mother. There is hardly a person I meet who doesn’t have a tale to tell. Many details are instantly recognisable, the saddest part is when the sufferer no longer recognises you.Beloved is not there yet. Although he is changing day by day, he still knows me. At least I hope it will be so when I next see him. Our country road has been closed for roadworks and going to the Care Home requires a long detour until it is reopened Friday. I confess I haven’t seen him since Sunday. He didn’t wake up at all then and I left again after only 45 minutes, reading my book, sitting next to him.When I rang the Home to tell them I wasn’t coming they said, “about time too” “Take some time off for yourself, if there’s a problem we’ll ring you.” They haven’t, which means all is OK, or as OK as it can be.Visiting him every day at least gave me something to do. It also gave the other patients the opportunity to fuss over Millie. Millie too seems unable to settle to anything. She clings to me and gives me a huge welcome when I return after leaving her for even just a very short while.Having family around would help, but that’s not to be. Beloved’s younger daughter visited him, coming via a long train journey. But no one else has visited. Soon it’ll be too late. My son is coming next month to help me with things around the house, let’s hope I have an idea by then what needs doing. And while he’s here Beloved and I will have our 30th wedding anniversary. I never thought we’d make it that far. I hope we will, it’s a nice round number."},
{"title": "Good Days Bad Days . . . . .", "date": "Friday 10 February 2017", "text": "and so it goes, there is no help, there is no hope.When I visited the care home today Beloved was sitting in an armchair in the TV lounge, fast asleep. It was about three fifteen pm, long enough after lunch for him to have woken again from his regular nap. Or so I thought. He barely managed to open his eyes, and even Millie raised only a very feeble smile. He still knows me, still knows who it is who strokes his hair, holds his hand and speaks close to his ear.The nurses say he is bright and alert in the morning, eats a hearty breakfast, potters about in his room,  with the aid of a Zimmer frame, and listens to the radio until lunch time. I can hardly believe it although they have no reason to fabricate stories. Perhaps I should visit in the mornings rather than late afternoon.Today it looked as if he’s given up, or perhaps the dementia has fully enveloped him. In the very short space of two months he has changed beyond all recognition. He’s always been rather handsome, in a gentle way, now his face is deeply lined and pale. His eyes are rarely other than vacant, except when somebody other than me visits him; there is still that ingrained politeness, the good manners, the obliging personality. The carers and nurses have already grown fond of him. “He’s lovely, no trouble, the perfect gentleman.” The lady in charge calls him “a charming man”.I am getting used to being home alone, with only Millie for company. Tears for what was, and is no longer, still come but not as frequently and overwhelmingly as a few days ago. I come in, take off my coat and pour myself a glass of wine. I have started to cook again, meals with a few vegetables and small quantities of fish or meat or an omelet. Nothing very elaborate, just more than the chocolate and tranquillisers I ate when the whole misery kicked off. I still make for the cupboard that hides the chocolate but my consumption of it is less compulsive.On two days I didn’t visit the care home, once to buy a fridge/freezer - wouldn’t you know it, several household appliances have packed in - and once because I was inundated with jobs left undone. Of course, I felt guilty for not going, but I must admit that those two days were also a much needed break.I am not going to visit Beloved tomorrow either, tomorrow is a grown-up day: friends are taking me to see 'The Rover', a play by the seventeenth century poet, novelist, translator and playwright Aphra Behn. She was one of the first English women to earn her living by her writing, I’ve never seen the play and I'm looking forward to experiencing an early feminist writer’s take on love, infatuation, confusion, anger and revenge at the Royal Shakespeare Company. I believe it all ends well which will help cheer me up.Monday morning a violin dealer is coming to the house to take a look at Beloved’s remaining instruments, a bow and other musician’s paraphernalia. I hope he will relieve me of much of it. No one in the family plays the viola or the violin, they’ve all taken to other instruments, so there cannot be any bad feeling about getting rid of them.Last Wednesday afternoon I came home, plagued by the usual guilt feelings at my ‘cold-hearted disloyalty’ to the one man in my life who has meant more to me than any other. We really were two sides of the same coin, indissoluble, I thought. Friends for life, lovers for ever. I sat over my glass of wine, shocked and in disbelief at the enormity of what I was doing. I thought back over the days since he left hospital and entered the care home, and pictured everything that has happened since: everything he said and did, everything he needed to have done for him, everything doctors and nurses, carers and the memory specialist said. I pictured him being helped in and out of his chair, into the bathroom, into the shower, being dressed and undressed, put to bed. His alarm button and the mat in front of his bed which is sensitive to the pressure of feet - setting off the alarm in the nurses station telling them that he is on the move in the middle of the night - , his long sleeps and confusion on waking, his growing impatience with me for being unable to help him make sense of life generally, his incoherent rambles about a time I know nothing about.Setting it all out before me, in my mind, I suddenly knew, without a shadow of doubt, that I could not look after him at home; I knew that what I had done was the only thing to do, the kind thing, the decent thing, the safe thing. People have been telling me so for three weeks, I suppose I had to realise it for myself. When I saw him today, frail and absent with just the tiniest smile playing round his lips when I called him ‘my darling’ my eyes filled again, but this time there was no guilt, bitter regret, but no guilt."},
{"title": "Good News Sad News . . . . ", "date": "Saturday 4 February 2017", "text": "Beloved was admitted (admitted - doesn’t that sound awful?) to his Nursing and Care Home on Tuesday, straight via paramedic transport from the hospital. I arrived before him and was already sitting in his room when he was wheeled in. His face lit up the moment he saw me.How did you get here? How did you know I was coming here? So lovely to see you. etc.He was very tired and almost at the end of his strength after 2+ weeks in hospital, where any likelihood of recovery from an illness is far from given. He was barely able to get out of the wheelchair and on to his armchair.First impressions of the Care Home were good, the staff was friendly and helpful, the room and bathroom neat and very clean, the food good (they had kept lunch for him); while I was waiting for him one of the nurses showed me around, I found everything satisfactory.The place is like Fort Knox, well run but impossible to break into and out of. Everything on Beloved’s wing is regulated by keypads, access to lifts and stairs requires code numbers. I had a job to get my codes organised, now, several days later, I am still asking staff to help me get in and out. Even if he could walk unaided, Beloved is not going to pick up his trusty stick and make for the exit. He wouldn’t get very far.I had a wonderful example of the craftiness of dementia today. As I was leaving, three elderly ladies stood around by the lift. One had a light coat over her arm and a handbag. All three were in day clothes and chatting amiably. I did my trick with the lift doors and two of them climbed aboard with me, the third just about to step in when the doors began to shut. I somewhat perfunctorily called out “NO, careful now”. All three were rather wraithlike and there was a doubt at the back of my mind about them: were they residents, by any chance?The doors shut and one of them said “now you’ve frightened her”, meaning the one left behind. “But it’s happened and can’t be helped.”  I was getting really worried. “Are you sure, you err . . erm. . . .” If they were bona fide visitors it would be most embarrassing to have doubts about them. “Oh yes, “ said the spokeswoman, \"we are leaving now.” I took a closer look: thinning, slightly straggly white hair, frail and a little unsteady, and with that vacant look of dementia, crafty, but empty-eyed.On the ground floor I put down my bags and made as if to punch in a number on the keypad. “Remind me, ladies, which way round . . . . . .? They had no idea.I was sure now and went for help. A carer was within range and I handed my wraiths over to her. Even then I was told to wait with making my exit until they had been safely shepherded out of the way and into the lounge next door.Hagley Place Care Home is good and a comfortable place to be, a bit like a medium range hotel, except that the staff wipe your bottom, give you a bath, and come running when you ring your bell. I am told that Beloved eats well (he orders the “full English” for his breakfast!) and has so far not tried to escape. I’ve lugged lots of homely things in for him, pictures for the walls, a small wardrobe full of clothes, daffodils and other bulbs in pots about to burst into bloom, as well as edible treats. He is allowed to have anything he wants in his room and I can visit any time of day. The chef will provide a meal for me too, if given prior notice. Today I took him a very small quantity of sherry. And Millie, Millie has already become a favourite, both with staff and residents.In the three and a half days of his stay Beloved has already had his hair cut, seen a doctor and been visited by the memory nurse from the Memory Clinic which first diagnosed him. He’s been drawn into activities, is taken to the dining room to eat his meals and encouraged to walk with a Zimmer frame, which he learned to do instantly. Still very weak but recovering some of the strength he lost in hospital.But, Oh My Goodness Me, picture the residents, the inmates, the poor creatures incarcerated for their own good. I see some of them and I could weep at the ruins once upright and intelligent people have become. I should say that this is a very expensive private home which reflects the class of patient to some extent. One nurse proudly told me of Jack, the former editor of a national paper, Mary, a former painter, Joan, a well known former golfer given to addressing other residents in the dining room in cut-glass accent and phrases, thanking them all for coming and providing excellent rankings in spite of the dreadful weather, for which she actually apologises. Now nurse has Beloved to add to her gallery of notables. \"Fancy that”, she says, “a principal player at the Royal Opera”.But really and truly, it’s all so awful, I can hardly bear it. Yesterday he asked me: “Where did you disappear to last night? We are still married, aren’t we? You haven’t left me?” And “What am I actually doing here?” I still talk about the Convalescent Home and sometimes, when he gives me a little nudge in that direction, about a hotel he’s staying at without me. The hardest thing in the world is to pick up my bags, take Millie’s lead in my hand, gaily call out “See you tomorrow”, and walk out of that door, leaving him behind.I’ve been out three times in the last few days, once to a live streaming of the play “Amadeus”, once to a lecture about a particular aspect of child abuse (now there’s a cheerful subject!),  and today to a lunch in aid of refugees. Everybody else is so busy being chatty and lively and animated and I’m just sitting there thinking “what am I doing here? On my own?” People at the lunch were very nice to me and asked genuine questions. I could only answer with tears in my eyes. People being kind is the very devil, I am always glad when the questioner is no more than an acquaintance and I can answer their How Are You with the bland formula Very Well Thank You."},
{"title": "I Daren’t Crow Just Yet. . . .. . . . ", "date": "Friday 27 January 2017", "text": ". . . . .but Beloved has been accepted for nursing care at an EMI facility and Residential Home in Ludlow, a drive of no more than 40 minutes away. It costs an absolute arm and a leg but we have a magnificently generous member of the next generation in the family who is going to bear the brunt of the costs. I am still hoping that a small contribution will be made by social services and maybe the Musicians’ Benevolent Fund but member-of-next-generation assures me that I needn’t worry about funding.When I got to the ward today I had a shock. Beloved was sitting slumped in his usual chair, ashen faced, chin on chest, oxygen mask attached. Deeply asleep. His pyjamas were stained with food spills, his hair stood off in all directions. Not a picture of health and happiness. In a flash I had a picture of the nurse/assessor walking in on him looking like an immediate candidate for the boneyard and making up her mind there and then to forget about him as a patient at their pristine home. Silly of me, because that’s what their homes are for, to give old people coming to the end of their lives a dignified exit, as pleasant as possible. What's a food stain or two on the front of the pyjamas matter compared to that?I made a bit of a fuss, the harassed nurse in charge of the bay took off the mask and put in a nasal cannula instead, explaining that his blood oxygen levels had come up again to an acceptable level during the morning and that his extreme sleepiness was due to insufficient oxygen uptake. They couldn’t wash him and change his pyjamas because they simply hadn’t been able to wake him sufficiently and for long enough.Nurse/assessor being a member of the profession understood perfectly. I combed his hair, tidied his dressing gown around him and sat him up a bit, with his help. Loads of questions, during which Beloved nodded off again, off and on. But when he woke he was quite lucid.All in all it went ok; it was decided that he should go into their nursing facility to regain some of the strength he had lost in his two weeks in hospital and that he might recover enough to be moved to the residential unit later.He was sweetness and light, smiled, agreed with everything nurse/assessor said, professed himself delighted at being ‘sprung’ to go to a ‘convalescent home’ (my idea to call it that), that Millie would be able to visit, that I could spend as much time with him as I wanted and that he’d finally have some privacy again. Even the chef-prepared food appeared to interest him. In other words, he was the perfect gentleman.Then the nurse/assessor left to speak to the staff on the ward and to look at his notes. Immediately Beloved’s face went dark, a serious frown on his forehead. “Don’t believe a word she said,” he whispered, “I don’t trust her for a minute. Do not go in with her, do not invest in anything she suggests\". I was taken aback. Dementia patients can become very suspicious of others. “Really,” I said, “you think so?” “Absolutely”, he said, no doubt in my mind at all,” “Very well,” I said, “I won’t then.” He was satisfied with that.Nurse/assessor came back to discuss arrangements with me before she left. Once again Beloved was smiling and sunny. By now a friend of ours had appeared at the bedside and for a moment several of us talked at the same time, making a conversation he could not follow. Immediately he went on the offensive. “Tell me what’s going on”, he said, “I can’t understand what you’re all saying and I don’t like it. If you don’t stop it I won’t trust you anymore either.” looking daggers at me. Dementia patients have lost the ability to follow a more than two-way conversation and are quickly beset by fear and anxiety, making them aggressive. They take a lot of understanding, tact and intuition and losing patience or intimating that you think them stupid is the worst anyone can do. Always agree with them or distract them. They are easily distracted and even the offer of a cup of tea or pointing at a cloud will do to lead them into safer waters.A nursing home for dementia patients should be just the perfect environment for Beloved. Make sure you keep your fingers crossed for a few days more, please.When, like now, I am thinking of him and what he’s said or done today, I have the feeling that all I need to do is run down the stairs, find him sitting in his favourite arm chair, and tell him all about it. Alas, he will never come home. When transferring him to a nursing home means that we can have maybe a few more months of quality time rather than me wearing myself out attempting to look after him, then so be it."},
{"title": "More Tears than Laughter...", "date": "Wednesday 25 January 2017", "text": "...since I last posted. Although there is still the involuntary giggle he has made me cry many times in the last few days. I had thought for a long time that my tear ducts must have dried up or got blocked,  in recent  days I learned differently.There is still no definite news on a placement although I have found a Care Home/Nursing Home who have spare capacity. A nurse is visiting the hospital on Friday to ‘assess' him. That’s a euphemism for checking out if he is a suitable resident for their posh - and very expensive - premises. Most homes aren’t registered to take people like Beloved who try to escape every chance they get. He is quiet, still enormously polite and well-spoken, still a true gentleman, but he has this urge to 'go home’.The first thing he said to me when I arrived today - straight after the usual initial remark and question: “how lovely to see you, how did you manage to get here and find me?” - was that he had had words with the staff. \"I told them in no uncertain terms that I could leave any time I chose, that they had no right to keep me here. Of course, they apologised and pleaded that they have to keep me here for safety reasons, that I might cause an accident and endanger others. What nonsense.” He still speaks like a well-educated man and throws long words around which nobody, in their right mind, or with a lesser love of language, would use. He is such a dear.As always, I managed to placate him quite quickly. The staff had been waiting for me, promising him that I would turn up soon and explain. He has an almost childlike belief in my ability to make things better. I promised him that I would ‘spring’ him the first chance I got, but that the staff were quite right to insist on his temporary stay with them, for the sake of his own safety as well as that of others. I reminded him of his fall at home - “I had a fall? I don’t recall at all.” - and that he might fall again if he went off without assistance.“Yes, but if I stay here, where are you going to sleep tonight?” I daren’t use the word HOME, any mention of it immediately makes him question the wisdom of him staying behind while I’m allowed to go home. The answer to his question was “In my old bed, upstairs.” He has no idea where that might be.We had some poetry - I often take some of his favourite poems and read them to him. Today we had Siegfried Sassoon’s “Everyone Sang”Everyone suddenly burst out singing;And I was filled with such delightAs prisoned birds must find in freedom,Winging wildly across the whiteOrchards and dark-green fields; on - on - and out of sight.Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted;And beauty came like the setting sun:My heart was shaken with tears; and horrorDrifted away ... O, but EveryoneWas a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.By the third line I was crying. It’s a poem he knows by heart and he was reciting along with me. “Beautiful”, he said, but I doubt that he made the connection between freedom and beauty and his own sad state of imprisonment, both in body and mind.Hospital food is not very appetising, he says, barely audible, hand hiding the words from view, making sure that nobody can punish him for criticising the service. I have tried all sorts of treats, special sandwiches, puddings, sweets, fruits; what he likes best is his own rhubarb from the freezer - grown and cooked by him - with a layer of custard on top. I spoonfeed him, because rhubarb is apt to dribble and soil his pyjamas. He opens his mouth wide “like a sparrow baby when mum comes with a juicy worm”. He laughed at my remark, not at all put out.I’ve also smuggled in cider and beer. I have no idea if alcohol is allowed or not, but he always had at least one drink every day at home. Even his taste buds have gone. He drank the first (toddler)cup of cider with great pleasure but didn’t like the beer very much. The next time the drink of cider wasn’t a success, he said: “hm, apple juice, but rather different from the real stuff.” I expect he will be allowed a drink in the Nursing Home, where I can join him for a sip or two. He is too ill for anything much to make any difference now. Like the doctor said “quality rather than quantity.”One day this week I arrived to find him sitting outside the front door of the main hospital building, in a wheelchair, wrapped up in blankets, with an auxiliary in attendance. He looked so frail and grey, so lost and hopeless, my heart just broke. The auxiliary said that he had badly wanted  to go out - go home - and the ward staff had decided to allow him a trip in a wheelchair. By the time we reached his floor I was crying so hard, the auxiliary hugged me and handed me over to the nurse in charge; someone else made me a hot drink and several people spoke to me with great kindness. The problem is that I see the man Beloved has become and a huge wave of guilt hits me for leaving him there, in the hospital, all alone. Realistically I know I can’t look after him at home, but sometimes the pain and heartache overwhelm me.I still have a friend who looks after Millie every day; she herself has a dog and Millie and Tessie get on well. I finally took Millie to the Vet yesterday, she has bad arthritis in her front elbow and will have to have pain killers. Poor Millie, she hardly gets any attention from me and she misses Beloved terribly, he used to give her a thorough cuddle every evening and, of course, she slept at the foot of his bed. Now she has to make do with me.I have also done a lot of driving during the last days, it’s getting to me; luckily, we have a good Neighbours Scheme in Valley’s End whose drivers will take people on hospital trips; I shall make use of them more now. Friends are willing but don’t always have the time and when something like this drags on it can become a bit of a chore for everyone.Keep your fingers crossed that the Nursing Home will accept Beloved."},
{"title": "Saturday, And it’s a Week Since. . . .", "date": "Saturday 21 January 2017", "text": ". . . . . . Beloved fell and was taken to hospital. The patching up has been done, bruises and scabs are still visible, but he could, by medical standards, be discharged. In fact, a consultant who took me aside during an early visit actually asked :”what is he still here for?” I was gobsmacked. She was a lady doctor, swathed in colourful head scarves and shawls, and I am afraid I need to be somewhat racist now. She looked like the kind of classy Asian or Arab who is used to a large extended family and an army of servants - yes, no doubt, I am being racist and bigoted and prejudiced here - she certainly didn’t look like a woman who struggles to hold it together. She saw the horrified look on my face and back-tracked. Of course it wasn’t personal, she is just being pressured herself to free beds as soon as a patient can be shuffled off. Beloved has become that nasty creature, a bed blocker. Lady consultant was quite blunt: “there is so much wrong with him, we can do nothing for him,” reciting a list of problems.I made it clear to her that the NHS is obliged to find an alternative placement for him, what with his night time shenanigans; he needs 24 hour care, not something I alone can provide. All the same, I remained rather panicked for the rest of the day and night, I had visions of an ambulance calling at my door and offloading Beloved back ‘into the community’, a euphemism coined by Margaret Thatcher for dumping people and getting them off the back of social services.During this week I found out that I am not quite as alone and isolated as I thought. Friends have rallied round and provided lifts for me and shelter for Millie during my daily trips to the hospital. On the whole, people have left me alone, none of those concerned but time consuming phone calls “how are you”, “how is he”, when I’ve come home shattered from another afternoon spent with Beloved. Many polite reminders that they are thinking of us and wishing us well, but no requests for detailed information.It’s been hard going. Yes, there have been funny moments, like that time he said : \"if you are going to see the director of this institution you may tell him about the nightly revels\". He looked at me sideways, with a crafty expression in his eyes: “I know what goes on here; you should hear the noise, they’re having orgies!” Another time he thought the man in the next bed, who was hidden behind a curtain and therefore invisible to Beloved, was the cabaret; he did make incessant rhythmic noises which sounded a bit like percussion instruments. Beloved frequently thought he was actually in a theatre and the floor show of patients, nurses, doctors and other staff was laid on for him to watch. “Weird lot of performers,” he said. And when he’d had enough he wanted to get up and leave. “Have you any money on you?\" he asked. “Why?” “Well, we should leave and pay up, and certainly leave an appropriate tip for the waiters.” “Oh, my dear, it’s all free here,” I said. “Well, fancy that,” he said.And always: “Let’s just go, shall we? What’s the point of staying here. I really want to go home.”At first he was at Accident and Emergency, then they took him to the Acute Emergency Unit, now he is on the fairly quiet Nephrology Ward. The whole NHS system is creaking at the seams, staff shortages, huge patient loads and a demoralised workforce are on the way to turning our once great NHS into a dysfunctional rabble, the sort of thing we imagine we find in a third world country.If only I could take him home.It’s time to go again, he is still so happy when he sees me that I couldn’t possibly not go.PS: At the moment I couldn’t care less about Trump and his inauguration, although I joined my lift provider the day before yesterday in some filthy language aimed at him and his supporters."},
{"title": "Day by Day Things Are Getting Worse,", "date": "Tuesday 17 January 2017", "text": "there’s no let up.Beloved is in hospital now. He has fallen once too often.The last few nights while he was still at home were horrendous. On the first of them I went into his bedroom downstairs, carrying his morning tea, as always. No Beloved to be seen. I had locked all the doors so he couldn’t have got out. So where was he? He couldn’t really manage stairs anymore, but still, I tried upstairs. He was lying curled up in a foetal position on the bare mattress on his previous bed, half undressed and covered only by the mattress protector gauze sheet. It was a bitterly cold night and the heating in the unused bedroom was off. I coaxed him downstairs, avoiding walking close in front of him in case he toppled over and took me with him. The Aga in the kitchen is always on, after half an hour he began to warm up and stopped shivering. I had no idea how long he had been up there, but at some time during the night Millie came into my room, sighing and thumping, until she settled down.The next such morning I found him standing in the kitchen, in his pyjamas, going through the motions of putting a kettle on. Great relief on my part; he was ok, hadn’t done anything silly during the night and I could take over and make breakfast. I thought I’d better fetch his dressing gown from his bedroom first though, it wasn’t really warm enough to stand around in pyjamas. I walked in and instantly saw that he had trashed his bedroom. Lamps were thrown all over the place, chairs toppled over, slippers and his (luckily empty) urinal bottle on the bed, duvets and blankets knotted and bunched up, papers from his desk strewn about, electric plugs pulled from their sockets, and a rather heavy bedside table pushed to a new position in the room. Where did the strength and fury come from in such a weak and feeble man? Again, Millie had come in search of me some time during the night, but, again, I paid her no attention.Then, on Saturday morning, Millie came up to me for the third time and I finally understood that she was telling me something was amiss. I ran downstairs and there he was, on the floor in the living room, again half undressed, on his side, neck bent and head leaning against the very cold conservatory sliding doors. He was moaning and breathing laboriously, fluttering hands scrambling for a hold on any surface he could find. He was about to pull down the curtains and topple an expensive lamp when I caught his arms. I rushed to get a blanket to cover him and a pillow for his head and phoned for an ambulance. I didn’t even try to raise him. The ambulance crew came within five minutes. They were the same two paramedics who had picked him up just before Christmas. They took one look, felt for broken bones, couldn’t find any, and gently hauled him up. One of them fetched a stretcher while the other wrapped him in blankets. “This is not the same man we picked up a couple of weeks ago”, they said.  \"He cannot stay home this time, he has to come in and be checked out.”As he lay upon the stretcher and they were wheeling him out he gave me such an imploring look of confused agony and helpless entreaty I couldn’t hold back the tears. There was nothing, absolutely nothing, I could do for him except trust the professionals, who were taking him out of my life, to look after him.One of the rough, tough and burly chaps looked back at me. “We’ll take good care of him,” he said.He’s now been in hospital for three days; in spite of what should be a less fraught situation the nightmare continues."},
{"title": "Having to Watch the Daily Deterioration", "date": "Friday 13 January 2017", "text": "is worse than anything else. I can no longer bear it. A man whose fingers plucked and stroked and coaxed his instrument to make heavenly music now takes hours over doing up a button in a cardigan or push a piece of paper into a non-existent pocket.  A man who rushed about London’s streets to the manner born - literally - now doesn’t recognise his own home. “You can drive, can’t you?” he asks, “can we go home now?”During the prolonged festive season there were no surgeries open and I couldn’t ask for help. It wouldn’t have been much use, because there is no help. But we always think there must be something we can do, don’t we.On the first working day after the holidays his GP rang. “How is J, how do you find him in himself?” Stupid question, I thought,  but just answered wth “Hmm?” And then she said “And how are you?” Ditto, stupid question. Again I answered “Hmm?” Only then did she come to the point. “I am looking at J’s blood test findings, they're actually not good. Not that we can necessarily do anything about any of it.” “Yes,” I said, “we’ve realised that.” “Particularly the kidney function. That’s gone right down form 20% to 16% now. And it won’t get any better.\"She was very nice about it, voice oozing bedside manner - in a good way - sympathy and compassion clearly audible. I felt I had to reassure her. “Tell me,” I said, “I won’t collapse on your shoulder.” I only collapse in private. Or maybe here, where nobody knows me.“It’s now a question of quality over quantity”, she finally admitted. \"Looking at his medication, there are a few things we can cut; just leave the ones which will ease him. None of those blood tests, like INR or routine annuals now. It’s important that he enjoys what he can and forgets about everything else.”So, it’s official, but then we knew that. Since just before Christmas the dementia has enveloped all of him; almost nothing makes sense. For whole evenings he is obsessed with one subject, we’ve had hospitals, elections to become Archbishop of Canterbury (him!), chairs and whether to take them home with us, car races and crashes (mine), sanitary ware china, and over and over again urgent request to take him to work, because he’s on for Wagner or a ballet, or a concert at the Albert Hall. “Where are my shoes, I need to go.”His kidneys are slowly poisoning what little understanding of reality he still has. A younger man would receive dialysis, an old man couldn’t survive the treatment.I can no longer bear it. It breaks my heart. Yet, at the same time, I can understand that there are people who lose their patience and shout, Or worse. I admit to having stamped my foot and screamed at him when I tried for the umpteenth time to make him understand that he needed me to take him to the bathroom to avoid accidents.The assessment social worker has been. One day when Beloved was particularly agitated, furious that I stopped him going to work and ready to swear at me, and I could barely keep him in his chair, I rang the doctor, demanding to know which of the many bodies in existence could help me, there and then.Some hope.Emergency admittance to a care home is never a good idea, these decisions need cool heads and careful consideration. So I gave in. Beloved had fallen asleep by then and given up going to work. But Doctor Wendy got off her comfortable chair and raised Cain. Cain came, closely followed by more social workers, district nurses, a dementia nurse and a dementia specialist doctor. The assessment social worker instantly granted me extra carers during the week and all of them promised to help me find a solution, i.e, a care home for Beloved, either on a respite basis or permanently. The dementia doctor doubted that I’d ever be able to cope with him again and for the sake of my own health and sanity recommended that I make enquiries immediately.And then the old bugger goes to bed like a lamb and smiles at me and says: “Can I have a kiss?\""},

When my father lay dying I rushed over to Germany to take turns to do the  night watch in the hospital while mother did the day shift. We were together and she held on to me.

There has been a catastrophic change in him since  just before Christmas and the deterioration progresses at an alarming rate. It’s terrifying. Almost nothing makes sense to him and he makes no sense to me. He was obsessing about being in a hospital for most of the evening. Is he trying to tell me something?Tomorrow some kind of assessment will be done in our house.

{"title": "Living with Dementia / 2", "date": "Monday 9 January 2017", "text": "I sincerely hope that I will have other subjects to write about again but since that dreadful day in the middle of December I have barely had time to think, much less do, other than slog away. He’s got worse at a tremendous rate since then and hates to lose sight of me. Which means that I have to sit and watch idiot TV programmes with him. I have noticed though that TV has little interest for him now, he often falls asleep in the middle of his previously favourite shows, like Endeavour and Sherlock. Documentaries which fascinated him before are a waste of time now. There is a hole where his interests were.The paramedics recommended that I arrange for a bed downstairs for him, so now he sleeps in the dining room, with the dining room table and chairs piled up in the conservatory. It’s winter and we don’t use the conservatory much anyway. We are lucky that the dining room connects to a downstairs bathroom which means no stair climbing any more. Scratching my head how to get a spare single bed from upstairs down the stairs and put into the dining room which is right at the end of the house, leading from the hall through the sitting room, I came up with an ingenious answer: call the fire brigade in the shape of the husband of one of my carers and a mate of his, who happens to live right opposite our drive. What else was I supposed to do? It was two days before Christmas and everybody was busy. So, one major problem solved. I have seen a lot of kindness in the past three weeks, kindness I never expected.At least he’d be safe downstairs, I thought. He was very unsteady on his pins and needed my arm as well as his stick to move at all. Even with assistance he tottered and stumbled and more than once I grabbed him just in time before falling. Still, twice more he fell. Once he slipped on a rug (which has since been removed) slid down the wall behind his chair and grazed his arm, his back and bottom severely. On that occasion I called my good friends and neighbours, Sue and Ralph, for help. Luckily, their son in law Owen had arrived for the holiday and Owen and Ralph got Beloved back up and into his seat. Shaken and less mobile than ever. Those of you who know these things realise that the patient has to be accompanied and assisted at all times, in the bath, loo, at table, - oh my God, table manners are a thing of the past! - into and out of chairs, etc. Whatever you can think of, the dementia patient needs help with it.So there we were, having overcome the first hurdles. We were also waiting for the doctor to visit with test results. Beloved was a little calmer, not wanting to get up every three quarter hour to visit the loo. I had started a groceries order which needed completing in time for a delivery the next day; he was asleep in his chair and I grabbed the chance to rush upstairs and add the last few items. Ten minutes later I heard the loo flush. Oh bother, I thought, he’s gone by himself. Well, if he’s dribbled into his pants, he’s dribbled and it’s too late anyway; I must get this order finalised. One learns to put up with a whole lot of things which one would never have countenanced before.When I got down about fifteen minutes later he was nowhere to be found. Hello? HELLO? No Millie either. I went to the front door, he might have gone down the drive, although that seemed most unlikely, seeing that he could barely walk unaided. I saw a little red car had drawn up, doors open, motor running. Sometimes tourists mistakenly use our drive as an entrance to the castle and I was going out to tell them to drive out again and use the next track instead. No tourists stood there but Karen, one of Beloved’s carers got out, closely followed by Beloved and Millie. She had driven over the bridge and found the pair of them struggling up the other side, just starting on the steep hill to the top.\"I found them the other side of the bridge\", Karen said. She’d recognised Millie and took a closer look at the man she was following, without a lead, walking freely along a busyish road. It was one of those icy days we had recently, bitterly cold. Beloved was dressed in sandals and a cardigan over a shirt, another ten minutes’ uphill struggle might have ended his adventure there and then.He thawed out in our warm kitchen, Millie faithfully lying at his feet. “They’ve made a lot of changes over there,” Beloved said, “a lot of new buildings have gone up. I hardly recognised the town.”No buildings have gone up in that part of Valley’s End recently, it’s been as it is for four hundred years, bridge and all, barring a few minor alterations. He’s lost the geography of his home village as well as that of his house.When I berated him for endangering Millie, taking her out into the village without a lead, he said “She’s so good, I just told her to stay with me. And she did. She knew where she was, as well.” Meaning that he didn’t quite.The amazing thing is how he got out and up there so quickly. For a man who can barely move he made extremely good time. It’s not an easy walk either. If he left by the back door there is a slope to negotiate and a very narrow, muddy track which I tend to avoid in icy or wet conditions because it can be quite treacherous. I asked how he’d got to the lane and he said he held on to the hedge and then the ivy growing at the entrance to it. When I told the District Nurse who had come to patch up his bruises and grazes she said “well, we all know how quickly toddlers can be.”That’s what he is now, a toddler."},
{"title": "LIVING WITH DEMENTIA", "date": "Saturday 7 January 2017", "text": "I would have loved to end the old year on a more cheerful note than the ‘Christmas Hates’ post and, even more so, to have been able to start the new year with renewed hope and energy.Not so.I’ve been wondering if I should continue with this blog in its current incarnation, under the same heading, or if I should close it and start a new one under the same title as this post. Or maybe give up posting altogether, seeing how little time I have at my disposal.My decision is to continue this blog as it is, except that it will deal primarily with what it is like to live with, and be the carer of, a loved one who now recognisably suffers from dementia. Friko’s World is the title of this blog, and Friko’s World it is, before and after the axe fell.Not many of you will find it interesting and I won’t be upset if you stop reading. There is a lot of involuntary laughter but there is a lot of pain and heartache too. I will remain true to myself and honest with you who read. Some of you might be upset, some disgusted and some uplifted. It has absolutely amazed me finding out how many people suffer from some kind of mental illness in old age. Nearly everybody knows somebody who is a carer or has a dementia patient in their family and circle of friends.The first major indications that something more than lapses of memory and the mislaying of days and times of day was wrong came a couple of weeks before Christmas. Beloved became quite agitated about our preparations for the festive season, pushing to go shopping for more and more groceries and drinks. As there were only the two of us, no family or friends expected, this was slightly odd. His daughter rang and I told her that her dad was uncharacteristically restless. We suspected an infection which needed treatment. When mild dementia sets in, an infection will send the patient completely confused, apt to go ‘doolally’ as an acquaintance, whose husband has Alzheimers, calls it.A few days later I went up to Beloved’s bedroom to wake him for his morning bath, as his carer was on her way. He was not in his bed. In the gloom I peered into the room and saw a white form on the floor, partially naked, with a blanket pulled up over the legs. He had obviously, at some time during the night, got up, started to undress and fallen. I tried to get him to his legs. No luck. The carer came and tried too. Still no luck. I had, however, already called an ambulance; we are advised to do so if a patient has fallen and can neither be moved by others nor lift himself up. After making sure that nothing was broken or otherwise damaged two burly paramedics soon manipulated him upright again and began a series of tests. Beloved was shaking with cold. The first thing was to warm him up. Through chattering teeth he repeated several times to all assembled, i.e. me, the carer and the paramedics, that he’d been trapped under the wardrobe and had been unable to extricate himself. As warmth returned he wondered what kind of house he could possibly have landed in where wardrobes trapped people and carpets were laid on walls as well as floor.The tests showed no abnormalities and it was decided that he should stay at home, where he would be able to recover in a calm and comfortable environment, rather than be shunted off to hospital where he’d probably have to wait in a draughty corridor for hours before any medic could deal with him.So that’s what happened. We were just a few days away from Christmas."},

{"title": "Too Poor Even For Scrooge", "date": "Monday 12 December 2016", "text": "We’ve been food and drink shopping as if the festive season would never end. Cupboards, larder and freezers are groaning under the impact. I am really quite ashamed of myself. There are still subliminal remnants of the bad old days buried in both of us, the days when food was rationed and coupons were carefully saved for weeks before the great event. Rationing in Germany ended several years before the end of shortages in Britain, which means that Beloved’s childhood in a grocers’ shop in London was deeply influenced by people coming in to buy tiny amounts of foodstuffs like fat, cheese, sugar, bacon.But today's poverty is worse, to my mind. At a time of plenty, wth shops filled with foods from around the globe, fruit and vegetables available all year round, when many are suffering the modern scourge of obesity, there are people for whom gifts of real food, fresh food, to be prepared and eaten at home, are quite useless. I had absolutely no idea that such abject poverty exists in one of the largest economies in the world.During one of our shopping trips to a supermarket last week we spent enough to receive the offer of a free turkey. At first I wanted to turn it down. We had just ordered our Christmas meat at the butchers' and had no need of a whole, frozen, turkey. Then a vision of 'A Christmas Carol' came into my head and I thought that there must be many people who, like Bob Cratchit and his tribe, would be only too glad of it. I took the turkey home and rang the person in Valley’s End who organises the Food Bank. Joan said immediately :”No, I don’t want your turkey. Can’t use it.”I was amazed. Food Banks who don’t want food? “No,” Joan said, “ our clients wouldn’t know what to do with it. On top of that, they have no means of cooking it. You can’t do much cooking on one (gas or electric) ring.” Joan’s and the Food Bank’s clients have either only recently come off living rough, are too poor to pay rent, have had their benefits stopped, have been put into one room, often barely furnished, in some council administered hovel. Joan continued :”Even those who have an oven probably don’t know how to defrost a bird, or how to cook it. They’ve been brought up in equally deprived households themselves, have been neglected, abused, lived in care homes, and never learned basic housekeeping skills. Tinned food is what they know and want and even the tinned soup or baked beans or mince has to have a name they recognise. And don’t come with lentils or anything else nourishing. ‘What’s lentils' they ask\". Joan told me of a client who has nothing but a kettle. So the only hot food he eats is the one you pour hot water on.She painted a horrifying picture of the deprivation and destitution that exists among the poorest in urban and rural areas, who are heartlessly termed the underbelly of society. None of that cosy, candle lit, jolly face we see in depictions of Victorian England, the Dickensian cheerfulness that warms the hearth of Bob Cratchit and Tiny Tim, in spite of the hardship they endure. Bob Cratchit’s wife has an oven and she knows how to cook the turkey Scrooge gives her, once his cold, hard heart has been dragged away from his moneybags and the ghosts have put the fear of eternal damnation into him. I know that this cheerful picture was a myth as much as the idea that there are no truly poor in our own affluent society.My turkey has found a temporary home in the freezer of friends; Joan has promised to think up a way in which it can be made into a fundraiser for good causes."},
{"title": "The Significance of Giving", "date": "Tuesday 6 December 2016", "text": "Did you leave your boots out last night for Sankt Nikolaus to fill with presents from the sack he carried over his shoulders as he roamed the lands in search of good children?  If you have been good since he last came this night a year ago I am sure he didn’t forget you.Over the blog years I have mentioned the myth and mystery of the legend of Bishop Nicholas The Miracle Worker several times, this link will take you to a story of what happened one Sankt Nikolaus eve in our family.Today, Nicholas, in the guise of Santa Claus, is the Bringer of Presents rather than the Miracle Worker. Christmas is just around the corner and the orgy of shopping and giving continues. We give throughout the year, of course, always have done, since time immemorial. I bet the first caveman worked a tiger’s tooth to present his inamorata with a trinket to adorn herself.  Giving has been an important part of mankind’s history, an opportunity to show our love, respect and affection for those we hold dear. Psychologically, it appears that the giver often benefits more from the act of giving than the recipient.\"Have you done your Christmas shopping? I’m all finished already, I usually start in October and by the beginning of December I only have a few trifles left to get.”  This statement is not at all an unusual one, it’s a sort of rite of passage to differentiate between the efficient, grown up ones, and those who leave everything until the last minute. Which hat fits you?More and more I come across a small, but growing, minority of people who feel uncomfortable about our habit of splurging and dishing out often thoughtless, meaningless, unwanted tat. These people make donations to charity, both in their own name as well as the recipient's name. I can’t see a child being terrifically happy when told: \"the money for your present went towards a bed for a homeless child,  a donkey sanctuary in Transylvania, to feed a family of four over Christmas. Maybe the child would feel a warm glow momentarily, but the lack of a present would be felt much more keenly.There are people who make a present of their time at Christmas, working in homeless shelters which take in rough sleepers over the holidays. I have the greatest respect for them and their selflessness. They are not always people who themselves are on their own, I have been told that whole families derive great pleasure from such an act of kindness.And giving for the sake of receiving is always wrong. We have a saying on the Lower Rhine which goes: “if you throw a sausage to gain a side of bacon you may be a good reckoner but you have no idea what giving means.Giving presents can be a vexed business. My Dad used to say, year after year, “just a small token of appreciation will do, nothing fancy, nothing ostentatious, nothing grand or expensive.” Poor man, that is exactly what he got, a pouch of tobacco, some cigars, socks, a bottle of Schnapps. I believe he was happy. Besides, in the early postwar years we had no money to buy anything that wasn’t absolutely useful and none the worse for that.Ephraim Kishon tells the tragicomic story of a spoilt young couple who swore to each other that they would not, would NOT, give each other Christmas presents. Come Christmas Eve they both unpacked   great piles of the most glitteringly expensive gifts. Both had deeply expected the other to break their promise, neither had been able to bear the tension of not-giving - giving in a purely material sense.I am not Scrooge, I am pro-giving, in a small way. Giving is symbolic. It stands for thoughtfulness, solidarity, affection, closeness, friendship, love. Even a friendly smile, a kind word, an offer of help, a listening ear are gifts worth giving. If anybody wants to add a book and a box of chocolates I will happily accept them."},
{"title": "Nemesis Day", "date": "Monday 28 November 2016", "text": "How utterly exhausting it is to get tangled up in politics for weeks on end; it’s draining, physically and mentally. True, we need to get angry when we, our lives and our Earth are threatened; we should act on that anger if there is the smallest chance that our action matters, but for far too many of us there is little we can do to change things in the short term; we might as well continue with our day to day life and make what we can of it. Dreary, dark November is a joyless month anyway, looking for added misery only exacerbates the gloom.I would love to believe in the truth of this quote by Lord (George Gordon) Byron 1788-1824, that most notorious and flamboyant Anglo-Scottish poet. :“Time and Nemesis will do that which I would not, were it in my power remote or immediate. You will smile at this piece of prophecy - do so, but recollect it: it is justified by all human experience. No one was ever even the involuntary cause of great evils to others, without a requital: I have paid and am paying for mine - so will you.”Were he living now he might vulgarly call it Payback Time.In ancient Greek religion, Nemesis was the goddess who enacted retribution against those who succumb to hubris (arrogance before the gods). Another name was Adrasteia, meaning \"the inescapable”. The Romans knew her as Invidia.Alfred Rethel “Nemesis\"The ancient Greeks knew a thing or two about retribution, in the shape of the Goddess Nemesis it was a recurrent theme of many Greek tragedies. Nemesis was to be feared and a sure and inevitable reward for arrogance and conceit, self-importance and egotism.I came across Nemesis in a very much more modern setting, in one of the short stories by Saki (HH Munro). Clovis complains that there are remembrance days throughout the year which persistently harp on one aspect of human nature and entirely ignore the other: we have Christmas and New Year, Easter, Birthdays and Anniversaries, when we are encouraged by convention to send gushing messages to all and sundry; to pretend optimistic goodwill and servile affection to people whom we can scarcely abide in reality.Clovis continues:” There is no outlet for demonstrating your feelings towards people whom you simply loathe.”Does he perhaps have a point?Would a recognised Nemesis Day be such a terrible idea? Would we all wait for it impatiently and look forward to taking much pleasure in the settling of old scores and grudges being “gracefully vindictive to a carefully treasured list of people who must not be let off” ?Or do we turn the other cheek by responding to injury without taking revenge?Questions questions, problems, problems. I am not one for turning the other cheek, but neither am I a great one for openly seeking revenge, openly being the operative word. Besides, nurturing grudges is such a waste of precious time. I only learned that lesson in the second half of my life and have thereby saved myself a lot of heartache.There may be a third way of coping with a world we find hard to understand and that is to take to heart the words of Wendell Berry, a poet whom I love and admire more and more:When despair grows in meand I wake in the night at the least soundin fear of what my life and my children's lives may be,I go and lie down where the wood drakerests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.I come into the peace of wild thingswho do not tax their lives with forethoughtof grief. I come into the presence of still water.And I feel above me the day-blind starswaiting for their light. For a timeI rest in the grace of the world, and am free."},
{"title": "Liar Liar Pants On Fire", "date": "Saturday 19 November 2016", "text": "In the era of Donald Trump and Brexit, Oxford Dictionaries has declared “post-truth” to be its international word of the year 2016.US election and EU referendum drive popularity of adjective............defined by the dictionary as  “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”, editors said that use of the term “post-truth” had increased by around 2,000% in 2016 compared to last year. The spike in usage, it said, is “in the context of the EU referendum in the United Kingdom and the presidential election in the United States”.  Well, there we are then, it’s official. Telling lies is the new normal,  accepted if not acceptable. Morally defensible? Maybe even that. The end justifies the means. And so on.What will we tell children?  Tell the truth or each lie will make your nose grow longer? If you tell lies nobody will believe you when you tell the truth?  Even if you shout ‘fire’ and there really is one and you are in danger of burning to death? (It’s called ‘putting the fear of God into children - I hope we don’t really do that to them anymore.)When I was in junior school our teacher encouraged us to put on a play about Saint Nicholas, the one who brings good children presents while bad children are threatened with the cane wielded by Ruprecht, Nicholas’ servant. I was a bit of an uppity know-all, not only did I make up the play, I also appropriated to myself the role of Nicholas, dishing out praise and admonishments as I saw fit in my misplaced enthusiasm and infantile eagerness. Most of my fellow class mates received mild praise, a few I told off for minor (imaginary) misdeeds but for just one girl, chosen at utter random, St Nicholas, i.e. me, had a serious face, a slow and ponderous voice and the ultimate accusation: “you tell lies”.The girl instantly dissolved into floods of tears, sobbing that she never lied, that lying was bad and a sin and that she would never do that. Teacher cradled her in his arms, trying to calm her down, saying how the whole thing was made up and not true and nobody believed that she lied. He threw me a very filthy look, told me to say sorry, to go away and be ashamed of myself for being so unkind. I was crushed, indeed feeling ashamed and guilty and very disappointed that my grand play had come to such an ignominious end. I got carried away, as they say, didn’t know when to stop.I had accused a class mate of lying; not in a playground rough and tumble way, but seriously, on an important occasion, with teacher and the whole class being present. The poor child’s pitiful sobs took a long time to subside. The fact that I remember it so well all these many years later shows how deeply memorable the incident was, probably not just for me.Today we know that the Brexiteers led by Johnson and Farage in the UK and election campaign Trumpism in the US have made lying into an art form; the more they lied the more people applauded them. One day after Brexit Farage was asked about that repeatedly promised extra 350 m  for the NHS. His answer? Oh well . . . . .And  \"post-truth\" nobody holds them and their cronies accountable. The sensation is not the demise of truth but the fact that we already have a word for it. Oh Brave New World."},
{"title": "A Canadian Visitor", "date": "Tuesday 15 November 2016", "text": "There are some bloggers whose blogs you like so much that you think you'd love to meet them in real life. If you’re lucky they like yours too and soon you find yourselves looking for any new posting, commenting, emailing and sharing snippets that have no place in a blogpost, stuff you don’t want to tell the whole world about, but you trust this blog friend enough to open up, in the comfortable knowledge that you won’t ever meet them, so intimate information isn’t going to come and bite you on the bum. Even skyping is safe. You have enough good sense, you hope, not to lay yourself open to ridicule, you only choose to respond to the kind of close questioning you can live with; - actually, somebody who asks too many close questions isn’t going to remain my friend for long. It’s all lovely, there are oceans between you and your friendship is never going to be tested in the cold light of day.So you think.And then you find you’re wrong. Canadians and Americans think nothing of emailing: I’m going to be in your neighbourhood next week/month, can we meet?” It’s happened three times in the past and last month it happened again.  Three times in the past I agreed to meet individual bloggers, Pondside from Canada and City Views Country Dreams and Prufrock’s Dilemma from the US. All three ladies were delightful, as delightful as their blogs and very quickly initial slight wariness became genuine warmth.Last month it was the turn of onegoodsentence, another Canadian who spends half the year in Canada and the other half in the South of France. It’s a tough life for some. Hiding behind onegoodsentence, a blog which has seen no input for exactly a year, is Deborah, an excellent writer who doesn’t write but has promised to apply herself again when the muse moves her.Emails went to and fro. \"Pierre and I are going to a pickleball tournament in Stratford in October. It doesn’t look all that far from Ludlow on the map, so let’s meet, shall we?\" There was a time when we emailed and skyped regularly, but lately our contact had come to an end. I was a little surprised.Questions:                  Why had we stopped our conversation?                  How much had I told her about myself?                  Did I want to start all over again?                  What on earth is pickleball?Answers:   Don’t know.                  Can’t remember.                  Hm, not sure.                  No idea.There is such a thing as over-thinking. After a few false starts regarding meeting-places we decided upon a restaurant close to Deborah and Pierre’s hotel and not too far from Valley’s End, The Clive, named after Clive of India, and part of the Earl of Plymouth’s estate.Deborah and Pierre were seriously impressed with several items on the menu, which had been sourced from the Earl of Plymouth’s piggery and Lady Windsor’s garden. Deborah took menus home with her, with permission, naturally.So there. Deal with it, Colonials. No aristos for you. Serve you right for breaking the sacred bond with the Mother Country. Mind you, you probably wouldn’t want to put up with very friendly, but also very slow service. We were there for hours, which suited us.But, to start at the beginning:We drove up on a rather chilly, slightly misty October evening. While shutting the car doors I looked over towards the hotel entrance and saw another couple just stepping towards it. Have you ever felt this bolt of instant recognition? It was dark enough not to be able to distinguish much but I knew that the tall woman about to enter the hotel was Deborah. She must have felt exactly as I did, because she stopped dead, peered at us in the gloom, marched over and said my name, adding a question mark to it. Feeling a little insecure I made a joke and asked: “Do I know you?” We grinned at each other and Deborah instantly folded me into a bear hug, real Canadian stuff, strong enough to crack my ribs.I knew then that everything would be all right.We were shown to our table and from the moment we sat down to the moment we got back into our cars four and a half hours later we never stopped talking. We ate and talked, ate and talked, doing full justice to the menu and each other. None of this: \"Well, if it doesn’t work, if we don’t like each other or our husbands, we can always cut the evening short and make our excuses\". I believe we were the first people to arrive and the last to leave the restaurant, asking the sweet young waiter to take our photos. Deborah, tall, slim, elegant Deborah was a wonderful dinner companion, as was her husband Pierre, Deb’s FB in blog parlance, her favourite Belgian. I hope and trust that the two of them liked us too, surely they would otherwise have said: “early start tomorrow, sorry, must be off.” We found that we had so much in common that we could have spent another four hours talking, except eventually, from sheer excitement and the rush to get everything in, fatigue sets in and you have to give up and hope that you will have the great good fortune to meet again.Deborah and Pierre were off on a whistle-stop tour of several other touristy areas in England in the morning, I would have loved to enjoy their company in Valley's End the following day, seeing that we were both now certain that it was safe and there was absolutely no need to find excuses for a quick getaway. I also found out what pickleball is: an indoor racquet sport, a thing between table tennis, tennis and badminton. I think."},
{"title": "Keep Breathing", "date": "Wednesday 9 November 2016", "text": "on this grey and dismal day. That’s about all we can do.“Alice laughed. 'There's no use trying,' she said. 'One can't believe impossible things.'I daresay you haven't had much practice,' said the Queen. 'When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. *We had Brexit not so long ago, Although, in the scheme of things, Brexit isn’t on a par with what happened yesterday, the immediate impact on this side of the Atlantic was tremendous. Even for the winners. Impossible things seem to happen more and more and leave more and more people shell-shocked.‘What I tell you three times is true.’ **The morons are on the march everywhere.Which reminds me of a story my foot health practitioner told me. She also works as a telephone operator for the WM Police - privatised, of course - and takes calls from sometimes desperate, sometimes urgent but mostly daft callers; some get passed on, for others there’s advice, yet others make no sense and are beyond help. This story is actually quite sad, as well as hard to believe, but true.“Hallo, my car seems to have disappeared from where I left it.”“Oh dear, I am sorry, may I take some particulars?”Particulars, like name, address, car registration etc, duly taken, the operator continues.“You are certain the car was parked in front of your house?” The caller is a lady in her 80s, the assumption that she might have been mistaken is not completely unlikely.“Yes, I always leave it there. I had come in from shopping. A friend called and we chatted and when she left I saw the car was gone.” It was in the evening - grocery  shops are open late in the UK.The operator remains calm and friendly. “I take it you heard nothing. Presumably the car was locked? The thief had to break in?”“Oh no,” the old lady said, “I always leave it open. That’s what I do. It sits just in front of my house, you see.”“Ah, you might have a problem with your Insurance then. Where was the key, did you take it in?”“Oh no, I always leave it in the ignition, that’s what I do, you see.”There is no way the operator could say 'you silly old bat’; she has to remain calm and concerned and keep breathing. And probing.“What else was in the car, anything else that could identify it as your property? I will be putting a general call out right away and the more details we have the better.”“Well, there was my shopping, I hadn’t had a chance to bring it in. And, of course, my handbag, on the seat in front. Where I left it when I came into the house with my friend. I’ve done that before and nothing happened.\"The operator remained totally professional. “And what was in the handbag, your purse maybe . . . . ““Oh yes, my purse with some cash, my cards and bits and pieces like that.” The old lady paused and repeated what she had said several times before. “It’s what I do, you see. It’s what I do.”*Alice in Wonderland** The Hunting of the Snarkby Lewis Carroll"},
{"title": "Instead of an Excuse", "date": "Sunday 6 November 2016", "text": "So many posts unposted, so many blogs unread, so many comments ignored or not left, so many emails not replied to, so much writing left unwritten.I don’t really know what happened, why I have barely glanced at my computer for the past two plus weeks (really? yes,  I just counted 17 days). I have been feeling rather tired, am I simply under the weather? A bit depressed?There have been days full of sunshine,gloomy, foggy days,working days,snapping sparrows bathing in the dog bowlduring idly looking out of the window days,and days full of magnificent autumn colour.In other words, nothing out of the ordinary. Now that it’s November, most of the leaves have gone and the nights have turned mildly frosty. There’s a bitter North-Easterly blowing and Millie’s walks are ever shrinking in length. She’s not too unhappy about it, she has started to limp after strenuous exercise; I am not going to ask more of her than she can do.The sad thing is, I miss writing, blogging and visiting blog friends. I feel guilty for not replying to emails, which is a bit silly. I throw half an eye at the blank, dark computer screen, sigh, then sit down with a trashy thriller for an hour.My attention to detail appears to have gone into hiding too. I ordered a new printer+ on the internet and when the thing turned up it was massive, far bigger than the space allocated for it. It was an office printer, wide format, with  facility for legal papers, large and small sizes, envelopes etc., as well as a fax machine. I have no fax number and no need of a fax. When ordering I forgot to look at the specifications and, most importantly, the size of the gadget. Printers have gone down in price since I bought the previous one and as I couldn’t be bothered to pack the thing up again and return it, it now sits in a different room, staring at me, balefully, every time I pass it, accusing me of sloppiness.Sleep is hit and miss too. No wonder I am often tired. I love to go to bed late, get a book ready, wriggle into a cosy position, and feel grateful for having a warm, peaceful and comfortable space to put my head at the end of the day. Sometimes, just when I am at my most snuggled in, my mind suddenly insists that sleep is a waste of time, and how I could much better spend my time thinking, dreaming, reading, going over the past day and organising the next one. Fatal! I might have allocated anything from five minutes to an hour for this state of being between waking and sleeping but, once I am embarked on this route, sleep flees. Two, three, four times I rise again, for a drink of water, a visit to the loo, a sleeping pill, another sleeping pill. I do eventually fall asleep to wake to another complicated day and, given half a chance, I grab a nap after lunch. But then again, I could be reading instead of napping?"},
{"title": "All Or Nothing", "date": "Thursday 20 October 2016", "text": "Clematis Tangutica in OctoberThe phone rang: “Sorry, Mrs. Friko, I have rammed a chisel into my hand. It doesn’t look good, I’d better go to A + E.” So said Paul, aka New Gardener, five weeks ago. He required surgery and a long process of healing.The phone rang: “Sorry, Mrs. Friko., I can’t come on Thursday, I’ve hurt my back. I’ve an appointment with the Physio.” So said Old Gardener three weeks ago. He was unable to move without pain for two weeks and unable to bend for another week.“The mind of the gardener is, in a way, the mind of the chess player.He makes a move after having thought out what the ultimate effectof that move may be. He visualises the end of the game.” *Late September, early October, after the long hiatus of high summer, when gardeners take a well deserved break and spend a little time glorying in the fruit of their labours and admire the ravishing colours of their borders, it is time to pick up the pieces and continue the game. It’s actually a busy time in the calendar, pruning, tidying, clearing paths, transplanting and planting, clipping rose bushes, dividing overgrown clumps of herbaceous perennials, generally planning the coming spring's changes. No help for it, I had to knuckle down myself. Except, I seem to have become strangely feeble, lacking not just energy but also strength enough to dig holes, transplant small shrubs, do serious weeding. It’s hard to get down on my knees and even harder to get up again. As for pruning fruit trees, forget it. How did I ever do all these things myself? What happened to me? Sitting down, going for gentle walks, snipping here and setting in the earth there, I forget how old I have become. The disparity between spirit and flesh springs to mind. When I can’t fall asleep I now-a-nights spend a lot of time gardening in my mind. Having Austin and Paul has made a huge difference and I’ve rediscovered my pleasure in creating an outdoor space that’s worth looking at.Then, last week, the phone rang: Hi Mum, I’ve got a bit of time to spare. Would you like me to come for a couple of days and catch up on jobs round the house? How about from Monday to Wednesday?\"“Yes, please.”Then Paul rang.: \"My hand is much better, would you like me to come back next week? I can make Tuesday.\"“Yes, please.”Then Old Gardener rang: “The Physio has helped, I could come over on Tuesday and give you the morning.”Goodness me, no. Absolutely not. How would I cope with supervising and ordering about three of them? “No, please. But if you can make it Thursday, that’d be great.”Which means that between Monday and Thursday my garden has been in intensive care, with operations being carried out at a tremendous pace. Old Gardener left just before lunch today. He’s coming back on Monday, Paul is coming back on Tuesday. At this rate I shall run out of jobs by the end of this month. They know of each other, could they be making themselves indispensable, each in his own way? My son won’t be back for three months, he’s out of the running. It was lovely to have him, even better to have got through a list of tasks which needed urgent attention, but having busy people around makes me want to get out of their way and take a nap. As that was out of the question, it being politic to show willing to chip in occasionally, I feel as tired as if I had done the work myself.The unmistakable smell of autumn is the smell of decay, shot through with the bitter fumes of smoke. With the help of my son Old  Gardener was deprived of one of his favourite activities, namely lighting bonfires. He is a bit of a pyromaniac, bringing with him a supply of spent oil just on the off- chance. I believe it might even be illegal to use spent oil.  Watching a large pile of prunings, both of trees and shrubs, growing to unmanageable proportions fills me with dread. The last time Austin took it upon himself to set light to such a pile, immediately upon arrival and before I could give explicit permission for the deed, there was a massive fire going in a wooded part of the garden. He badly scorched a branch of the beech tree which is clinging on for dear life anyway, a yew hedge and  one side of a yew pillar. I wasn’t keen on a repetition. When I remonstrated he said: \" they’ll grow again, they’ll be back next year.”Solon, my son, took it upon himself to break up, cut and even saw through each bit of pruning, stuffed what could be stuffed into the green council bin for collection and otherwise filled two huge builders’ bags (the sort they deliver sand and grit in) and took them to the tip. It was a boring and repetitive job, but the stuff is all gone. And I am inordinately pleased. Austin was quite downcast this morning when he saw the empty space where the raw ingredients for a fire had been. “I see you’ve got rid of my bonfire,” he said.*Richard Wright:  The Practical Book of Outdoor Flowers 1924"},
{"title": "Some Cultural Pursuits", "date": "Monday 10 October 2016", "text": "Did you know that? Do any of you live in or near one of the Stratfords mentioned here?Do these Stratfords have theatres similar to the Royal Shakespeare Company in the original Stratford-upon-Avon in the UK?I had no idea of any of it until we went to see King Lear the other day. Isn’t that a splendid Bottom?Titania isn’t half as grand.Every time I see King Lear I hope that this time he isn’t going to fall for his conniving, dishonest, fawning daughters’ flattery and that he sees them for the grasping, treacherous witches they are. No, Lear remains blind to reality and favours appearances over truth. Cordelia is silent and he throws her out. Goneril and Regan are free to pursue their evil machinations. Lear goes mad, Gloucester has his eyes gouged out and lots of people die.  That’s the trouble with Shakespeare tragedies, once they’re written they stay written, no matter how many centuries pass.Tristan and Isolde with the Potion (1916) by John William Waterhouse, oil on canvasAs for Wagner’s Tristan und Isolde, the whole disaster hinges on a love potion. If Isolde’s handmaid Brangane hadn’t swapped a poisonous tincture for a love potion the whole five hour music drama would have been over in less than one. As it was (again, once written, a thing stays written), misunderstandings, secret trysts, honour and skullduggery abound and are thoroughly demonstrated by thunderous music and dramatic voices. Practically everybody dies here too. If Brangane had at least come clean a bit sooner rather than at the end when death was but a foregone conclusion, Tristan und Isolde might have lived happily every after.Okay folks, seriously. Both King Lear with Antony Sher in the title role, one of the greatest parts written by Shakespeare, at the RSC in Stratford, and the transmission of Tristan und Isolde from the Met in NYC were experiences I wouldn’t have wanted to miss. Beloved didn’t come to Stratford, he’s seen King Lear many times; he finds the journey tiring now and will only undertake it “if it’s worth it” for him. Although it was sad that he stayed at home it was also a bit of a relief for me. For once I could enjoy a theatre visit without having to have half an eye on his wellbeing.Wagner was a different matter. The transmission came to the screen at a small local theatre, which takes less than twenty minutes’ drive. He sat through the five hours’ performance without a murmur.  Actually, that’s not quite true, he once snorted a loud ‘Nonsense’ and another time he complained that the interviewer made it look as if the English horn solo in Act III was to be played by a cor anglais. But he had nothing to complain of in the orchestra or even the singers. Not many can do these roles justice but the Met ensemble did their very best. Although he detected a slight wobble in Isolde’s voice he praised her accuracy. That’s the trouble with musicians who have spent their life playing at the big houses, for world famous conductors and have had the privilege to hear the greatest voices for over forty years. They do tend to have an opinion!Luckily the audience was small, seating was ‘cabaret style’, that is small tables for individual parties, wine, cake and hot drinks were served during the two intervals and, in spite of some minor niggles, the music was simply overwhelming. We are lucky, almost the entire Met season is to be transmitted; Wagner was only the season’s opening."},
{"title": "The Joys of Autumn", "date": "Sunday 2 October 2016", "text": "October, and uneven patches of the ornamental Japanese cherry tree are turning red, while other parts of it hold on to green leaves. The nights are turning cool and soon  the first drifts of leaves will cover beds and lawns. It was already dark when I looked out of he kitchen window at half past seven this evening  and there are still three weeks to go before we change the clocks. By eight the central heating had switched itself on.Just when I was about to give a deep sigh and moan 'where has summer gone', I remembered that I like autumn, and even winter is not so bad when you think about all the advantages the cold season brings. For a start there is the drama of it, a foreboding of endings; of death, essentially. Spring and summer are much less sexy,  simply too hot and sweaty, doing any kind of work is an effort and only evenings bring relief. Travelling to work on the Underground, the air thick with vaporised commuter sweat mornings and evenings, heatstroke, hay fever, discomfort, irritation and short-tempered exchanges with fellow commuters, co-workers, and other shoppers in the supermarket, that’s summer.Give me the crisp months of respite. Winter clothing, doesn’t that sound cosy?  Snuggling up in several warm layers, wearing  big, baggy jumpers and coats which hide wobbly bellies and long sleeves to make flabby upper arms disappear. Bliss. And the food! Carbs are allowed again, stews and casseroles and soups! Forget about the lettuce leaf, the raw food salads, barbecues and picnics under vicious attack from wasps and other pests. The only meats are cold meats, semi raw chicken, charred sausages and mozzarella which has curled at the edges. No, civilisation reigns again,  bringing hibernation food; there’s meat and gravy and potatoes, great piles of roasted vegetables, all eaten indoors, at the table or from a tray in front of the telly. and red wine tastes ever so much better in front of the fire than on a muggy night in the garden.And what about the telly! In the UK all channels suddenly rediscover what they’re for: namely entertainment, and possibly education (good old Beeb, keep your hands off, Tories and Murdoch!), not endless repeats of programmes which weren’t interesting the first time round. We are spoilt for choice all of a sudden, from mid-September onwards. New series start, thrillers and costume dramas and must-see one-offs jostle for viewers. True, it’ll all be over when the Christmas Specials arrive, the crowd pleasers, game shows, unfunny comedians and sitcoms, but until then there’s a glut of entertainment to keep us quiet during the long evenings.Bedtime isn’t bad either. In summer, after a day of the sun sitting on our South facing windows, the bedrooms are far too hot to allow for comfortable nights. Few private houses in the UK have air-conditioning and even wide open windows hardly lower the temperature. I like the feel of a covering but there are nights when even a cotton sheet is more than I can bear. Now, with temperatures back down to the low teens and under, the feel of a cosy duvet is perfect.Thick socks, hot cocoa, guilt-free reading and TV sessions, baked apples with cinnamon and toasted almond flakes, box sets, walks in the woods while leaves are drifting, game stews and afternoon tea in front of a fire, hats and scarves and gloves, and the mists rising from the valley floor, these are my favourite seasonal things.Soon it'll be time to dread Christmas but then, as many of us remind each other at the beginning of October: “In three months’ time it’ll all be over and we can look forward to a new beginning.But for now and first of all, here’s to a happy autumn!"},

True, with the sun’s rage mellowing, summer has vanished, afternoon shadows grow long and there is a definite nip in the air when day lowers itself into the horizon. Autumn birdsong is less noisy, sweeter, more leisurely than the sounds of Spring, when the season's work must still be done. It’s the brief moment before trees wear the red, gold and amber uniform of Autumn and, finally, small beacons of light, the autumn bulbs, corms and tubers beloved of gardeners everywhere, come into their own.For me the arrival of cyclamen is a pleasure every year at this time. I almost forget them, until I see the ivy-like leaves appear and wait for the curled stems to deliver on their promise, and produce dainty, delicately leafed flower heads.The sight of a mass of cyclamen in full flower is enough to take your breath away. As if by magic, the carpet of white, pink and purple blooms of cyclamen hederifolium reappears year after year, the individual tubers becoming as large as plates eventually. I didn’t plant  many originally, in fact, only a very few of them; I must have been assisted generously by ants, birds and self-seeding, because new flowers, at first just one or two blooms, grow in all sorts of rocky cracks and shady nooks where none were before. There are varieties that flower in Spring but I love my autumnal show. September, October and sometimes into November is the time for cyclamen, when many other plants have lost interest and withdraw into themselves, prepare for the first cold winds of winter and huddle together in brown clusters.For those of you who might like to try and grow cyclamen, here are a few facts from the website of the Royal Horticultural Society:A delightful tuberous perennial providing colour often when little else is flowering, particularly in late winter or early spring. Hardy cyclamen species and cultivars are ideal for naturalising under trees, on banks or in a shady border and planted in association with other early-flowering woodland plants such as snowdrops, winter aconites and primrosesCommon name Sow breadBotanical name CyclamenGroup Tuberous perennialFlowering time Mostly autumn and winter Planting time Autumn, winter (when ground is not frozen) and early springHeight and spread 5-13cm (2-5in) by 8-15cm (3-6in)Aspect Partial shadeHardiness Fully to frost hardyDifficulty ModeratePS: After reading the first comments, I think I need to add a PS. Indoor and outdoor cyclamen are slightly different varieties. The plants you buy in pots for the house need cool rooms, warm central heating will kill them, so keep them in a coolish corner.  The indoor varieties will not survive outdoors. The outdoor varieties are fully hardy, down to frost and snow, they won’t like being brought indoors."},

It’s not as if we were on a beaten track, living where we do, miles from any fast road, with no airports or big cities within easy reach; it therefore behoves us to appreciate these visits even more. First came Philip, John, and Marilyn, the latter with their unruly dog, who raced about the house, under tables, on beds and sofas, on the lookout for food to steal. Millie was quite put out. Beloved had a lovely time with them, rehashing ancient histories about concerts, conductors and colleagues. We hadn’t seen Philip for a few years, he spends much time abroad, getting himself known as a composer. (I looked him up online, his works are performed by more orchestras in the US than in the UK).Another musician, Judy, and her architect husband Peter (hurrah, someone for me to talk to - not a musician) came next. The doorbell went and there she stood. “I hope we find a welcome? Please?” That’s Australians for you. She said so herself. \"On the way from somewhere to somewhere\". We hadn’t seen Judy for years and Beloved was thrilled to chew the fat with her. Musicians are a gossipy lot. 0-0-0-0Family came too. More signs of autumn, the personal kind. They visited after giving due notice, as our family does. Nick and his wife Ali, who live in Massachusetts, decided that if they had to come to see Beloved before his personal winter sets in, they might as well make a proper trip of it, travelling to Holland, France and Italy, both to see family and the sights. They were with us for just an afternoon and evening; the visit went off well, during those few hours we found plenty to discuss. Some of it catching up, some of it current affairs and politics. Our conversations usually have some depth, even if we don’t always all agree with each other.Sally, one of Beloved’s daughters, stayed slightly longer; Beloved and she looked at old family photos and told stories of past generations. Sally is an archaeologist and history, both personal and the academic kind, are her great interest. She has written a number of books about the area of Southern England where she lives.0-0-0-0I wonder if any of you have similar experiences to mine. Beloved and I have been married for thirty years and in all that time his children and I - apart from one daughter - were never on really cordial terms. We never fell out and the relationships have got better over the years, but real warmth was always lacking. Until now. I am not looking to blame anyone, there are always two sides to every story, but a more relaxed attitude would have made our lives more pleasant. Always having to be careful, always afraid of slights, always preparing oneself for a visit by donning some kind of armour, make for uneasy situations. As I said, meetings during the past few years have been less of an ordeal (oh dear, that does make it sound difficult!) and these visits in recent weeks have been a genuine pleasure. In fact, I liked both of them so much that I gave them keepsakes: Beloved’s Breitling watch for Nick and two pairs of earrings of mine for Sally. (Does that count as the sort of kindness I mentioned in my previous post?) We parted on the very best of terms, with close hugs; Sally almost shed a tear while she whispered “thank you” in my ear, and Ali, Beloved’s daughter in law, who has been the most difficult of them all, made a special effort to praise me for taking such good care of her father in law. She thanked Beloved for being the kind of man he is and for having raised his son to become a wonderful partner for her and a devoted father to their children.I was touched. Why do people soften so when it’s almost too late? I know that we may not see them again, this was a kind of leave-taking. Father, son and daughter were all very aware of this fact, but nobody put it into words. The feeling was there and there were both sadness and gratitude in the air, unspoken."},
{"title": "The Selfish Gene", "date": "Monday 5 September 2016", "text": "This may not be exactly what Richard Dawkins’ The Selfish Gene is all about but there’s certainly a connection between ‘Doing Good Makes One Feel Good’ and the survival instinct of genes, that is the survival of the most selfish and therefore fittest genes.I’ve been in one of these spells of ‘why blog - who could possibly be interested in my throw-away drivel’,  followed, a bit later, by ‘if it gives me pleasure to blog, who cares if anyone else wants to read said drivel’.That’s me being pensive - via a selfie. (selfish selfie?)Anyway, to repeat, why blog. Do you blog because it gives you pleasure, whatever it is you write about, even it it’s purely self-centred? Can the general kind of blogging, the kind I indulge in and most of you, whose blogs I read, be anything else but self-centred?Is there a kind of blogging which benefits others?Perhaps blogging is a pure form of selfish altruism, after all, it benefits ourselves most of all.Very well then, I’ll do some ‘blowing my own trumpet’ blogging,  having decided once again to take up recording my drivel.I have been kind on several occasions recently. Only once entirely without an ulterior motive. I had no choice, really. Unlinking a shopping trolley at Aldi’s I noticed a woman rushing past me. She’d obviously just returned her own trolley and was on the way back to her car. I noticed her for two reasons, one she was wearing a bright orangey skirt and two, she was swinging her hips rhythmically at speed, clearly in a great hurry. Having stared at her for a moment I turned my attention back to the row of trolleys; on one of them sat a tan leather handbag (purse to you over the pond), well scuffed and filled to bursting. I grabbed the bag and asked various ladies occupied with their own trolleys if they were the owner of the bag. All of them shook their heads. I kept hold of the bag, I wasn’t going to make the same mistake I had made several years ago in the London Underground, when I found a well-stuffed wallet on the floor, asked the young man in the seat opposite if he had lost it, was told ‘no’ but instantly informed that he was getting off at the next stop and would hand the wallet in for me. Like a fool I handed it over. As he ran out I realised that  no way would he hand in that wallet to Lost Property or a station guard. I just hope he stole no more than the cash and returned the rest. Probably not.No, I wasn’t going to make that mistake again, I would hand in the purse myself, to a supervisor in the store. I went up the aisle and saw the woman in the orangey skirt harangue a uniformed member of Aldi’s staff. As I came nearer I heard “but it must have been found in the shop, I haven’t been anywhere else. Are you sure it wasn’t handed in?”Orangey skirt lady had a high, angry, scared colour. She saw me loitering, and glared at me, ready to accuse me and anyone else within reach of theft. The member of staff was upset too. “No, I’m afraid no bag has been handed in; I can make enquiries, of course. Have the shop searched.”Aha, orangey skirt lady was bag lady!I went closer and brought forth the bag with a dramatic flourish from behind my back. No fanfare, just an accusatory “there’s my bag, where did you find it?” Member of staff joined  in the chorus. “Yes, where did you find that?” And, turning to bag lady in orangey skirt “Do you want to check it?”What? I am handing in a lost bag and my credentials need checking?Both of them saw my thunderous look and both withdrew. Orangey skirt bag lady finally calmed herself, hands still shaking, and after giving further action due consideration - you could see her weighing up the pros and cons of checking me out v. thanking me, she decided to trust me and fell upon my neck in a short but powerful hug. Finally, I got my “Thank You”.Isn’t it strange that the two women's first reaction was to suspect me of evil-doing?This post is now long enough, recording the next act of kindness will have to be postponed. Until next time."},
{"title": "It’s Pouring . . . . . . .", "date": "Friday 26 August 2016", "text": "Both Beloved and I belong to the generation which has life-long ‘Saving’  with a capital ’S’ as part of their genetic makeup. We, that is me in particular,  have in recent years been a little less dogmatic about the rainy day vision and the need for having a large umbrella to catch the inevitable downpour, and I have persuaded us to allow ourselves the really rather modest luxuries we indulge in; in other words, becoming skiers, spending the kids inheritance. All the same, just as well that the Boomer years have meant well for such as us, because the rains have started to fall in earnest.On top of the newly necessary sums of money we need to spend on carers, assistance in house and garden, etc. the property itself is falling down around us. In the case of trees literally so.We had very high winds during the weekend and when Millie and I went for our morning walk on Monday we found a huge chunk had fallen out of the beech tree. As we are on the edge of the castle grounds this was cause for concern. Had somebody been walking in the moat at that precise moment they’d never walk again, they’d be dead. As it was the second time within a week that a branch had come adrift I thought I’d better call Jonathan, a proper, bona fide, letters-after-his-name arborist. First of all to remove the part-corpse from the path, secondly to cut it up and chip the unwanted bits, and thirdly to give me an idea of the state of the patient’s health or otherwise.Jonathan hedged his bets. “Well, hm, I can see none of the funguses (fungi? or is that only for mushrooms?) associated with large trees. “  ( The beech is at least 70 feet tall - it’s massive).  “On the other hand, there is some die-back which might indicate that the tree is stressed.” The tree is stressed? What about me? I am stressed just thinking about his hourly rate! “On the whole the limb sections look normal, it could just have been the high winds. Or mechanical weakness”. Deep breath out . “On the other hand. . . . .” Renewed intake of breath on my part. The noughts are simply tumbling into place following the initial figure, in itself a fearful thought!We’ve left it that I keep a very  close eye on developments and call him the minute I see anything untoward, like a white blob or a tarmac-like black blob on the stem near the ground. Mind you, Jonathan says,  sometimes these blobs come out and immediately withdraw into the tree again, like they are some delicate violet shrinking away from the light of day.A definite help, that.This is the third and last of our large trees threatening imminent departure. We’ve lost the sycamore and the horse chestnut to a deadly fungal disease, I really don’t want the beech to go as well. It’s also the last of the beeches, there were three originally, two before our time; we have merely the stumps left, one of which has thrown up  a large new limb which might not be viable for long, coming from a diseased parent plant. We still have more normal sized trees, like maples, a few ash trees,  ancient hawthorns and a thirty year old walnut, mere Johnny-come-latelies compared to the big boys who may have seen a few hundred years of tourist activity around the castle since the Normans first threw it up to ward off those Welsh barbarians, thinly disguised as tourists but really after Norman damsels. And loot, of course. As well as the land the Normans stole from them. Seriously, my garden is not some suburban plot with a few newly planted decorative specimens. even the plum and apple trees are groaning under the weight of considerable agedness; they really are in need of chopping down!  Everything in Valley’s End is old, including the human inhabitants, so we should all be left in peace and allowed to disintegrate  into the ground gracefully, as nature intends for all of us.To quote Jonathan once more :  “if the beech were in a field or a wood somewhere it could just shed limbs as it went along. It might take another hundred years over it. As the saying goes:  A hundred to grow, a hundred to stay and a hundred to die.”   Lovely."},
{"title": "The Remorseful Day", "date": "Friday 19 August 2016", "text": "When I heard young Morse (in a repeat of Endeavour)  recite the last two stanzas of A.E. Houseman’s  “How Clear, How Lovely Bright\"  I realised that my attitude has lately changed to a calmer, lighter mood. Not that there have been any great differences in our circumstances, it’s simply that I am perhaps coming to terms with what cannot be altered. At least, I hope so. What lies beyond our control must be endured. Sitting, like Mimir the Dwarf in the hole at the foot of the dead sycamore tree, plotting, worrying and endlessly turning the same problem over in my mind won’t bring relief.I’ve also found my material feet, which helps. All the legal formalities have been dealt with - and paid for. ouch! - . I have a brand-new, fat file full of solicitors’ letters, legal documents and official declarations. Neither one of us likes it but, there you are. It was necessary.Most of the long neglected jobs around house and garden have been tackled; I have assumed responsibility for them and, being a rather methodical and tidy person, they have been initiated, if not completed. Beloved is more the type who puts jobs on lists, where they are allowed to grow whiskers. In his opinion, collecting items on a list means that the job is half done. Not so, as far as I’m concerned. Now there’s only the large-ish stain on the sitting room ceiling to be dealt with; the bath in the room above overflowed and the stain is most unsightly. I dread the thought of emptying the sitting room of furniture; let’s see, perhaps I can organise a couple of hefty chaps to do it. Painters are notoriously slow in coming, so maybe I shall have to live with the stain for a while yet.Another thing which has helped enormously is that I have taken to gardening again. I know I’ve rather been going on about gardening recently, but the mouth speaks what the heart is full of. The same applies to keyboard and fingers, in this instance.  The place already shows signs of improvement, which spurs me on to get out there and labour.There’s one other thing which has gone by the board, i.e. unresolved issues with people, family and acquaintances both. Up to a few months ago these issues would pop into my mind at the most unsuitable moments, I’d fret and worry at them and allow them to depress me. No more. When you are faced with a situation which goes right to the heart of existence itself, anything else becomes mere ballast, an irritation to be shed until such time as you actually have the strength - and time - to bring it up again from the depths. I am, of course, hoping that these issues will  have disappeared into outer space by then anyway. Never to resurface. Going back to the first paragraph: it’s best not to burden yourself with things you cannot change.So, dear old A.E. Housman, who wrote the haunting poem \"A Shropshire Lad\" and whose ashes are buried just outside St. Lawrence’s Church in my county town of Ludlow, sent me a timely reminder on how to avoid The Remorseful Day. I cannot promise that every day I shall see the bright new morning, or that I shall be strong every day granted us, me and Beloved, but I shall endeavour.How clear, how lovely brightHow beautiful to sight    Those beams of morning play;How heaven laughs out with gleeWhere, like a bird set free,Up from the eastern sea    Soars the delightful day.To-day I shall be strong,No more shall yield to wrong,    Shall squander life no more;Days lost, I know not how,I shall retrieve them now;Now I shall keep the vow    I never kept before.Ensanguining the skiesHow heavily it dies    Into the west away;Past touch and sight and soundNot further to be found,How hopeless under ground    Falls the remorseful day."},
{"title": "Conversation", "date": "Friday 12 August 2016", "text": "Tea break and Paul, Beloved and I are sitting in the conservatory over a cuppa. It’s eleven a.m. We’ve been depressing ourselves thoroughly, talking about politics and the mess current and future politicians are creating. We’ve roamed from national crises to the apparent willingness of a particular prospective politician to drop nuclear bombs as a means of emphasising a point.Paul laughs, “this is depressing, have we had enough?”I have been meaning to talk to him about a particular matter, which you already know but he doesn’t.“I want to change the subject” I say, \" it’s confession time”.Paul sits up. “Oh dear?\"“Yes, my confession time.You must have seen that various jobs have been done in the garden, but not by you?”“Yes, I have,” Paul is all ear and I can tell he is getting nervous.It comes out in a bit of a rush. “I have been very unhappy with the state of the garden for some time, as you know. It looks like we’re never going to get on top of it. I can’t do as much as I once did and your three or four hours a week, with interruptions because of weather, illness, other obligations, don’t cover the work there is.”I carry on talking, noticing a bit of a pink glow on Paul’s face. But I need to say it all, I can’t allow misunderstandings.“So what I did was ring Austin, my previous gardener and ask him for help. I asked him to chip in with two or three sessions a month, mornings only and he agreed to come. Do you mind awfully?Paul swallows hard, I think he thought I was going to dismiss him.“Not at all,” he said quickly. “Not a bit. I do as much as I can but I never thought I could do the garden all by myself during the hours I have available and I can’t give you more time.” He repeated himself. “I do as much as I can but I always said that if you need someone else that’s alright with me.” I’m not sure that he said that about someone else in so many words before, but I’ll take it as fact.We’re both relieved. Wisely, Beloved has kept out of it. Paul does his whole speech again,  and I redo mine about being unable to do as much as I’d like to do, about being sad and having lost interest because of the uphill struggle, about even Paul's and Austin's combined mornings not covering as much ground as a fit and healthy Austin and me used to cover over a monthly average.We’ve finished our tea, Paul and I get up and say “Best crack on.” We drop the subject and instead talk about the newly pruned hedges. The hedge cutters came yesterday and there’s a bit of their mess left behind, although they cleaned up after themselves as well as they could. Paul’s going home time is one p.m. He collects his bags and I stand at the backdoor with his pay and some magazines I keep for him during the week. As he turns to go he says  “Thank you for being open with me, I noticed that you had had work done but I thought you weren’t going to mention it.” He gets a bit pink again and I go a bit mushy myself.“Of course I needed to tell you”, I say. We’re both a bit touched at how well we understand each other. “See you next week,” we call out in parting.After Paul has left I tell Beloved about his comment. “Well, you did that rather nicely,” he says. “You spared Paul’s feelings and still got what you wanted.”"},
{"title": "Carnival", "date": "Tuesday 9 August 2016", "text": "held on the meadowbetween he castleon the hilland the shady riverlined with stately water balsamis an annual village event.For some the highlight is the Show,where villagers vie with each otherfor first prize for best blooms, produce, jam and cakes,artistic efforts like painting and photography and WI best decorated shoe boxes or some such,all exhibited on long trestle tables covered in white paper clothsin the huge Show Marquee.The Show tent gets very hot on a summer’s day,so tea tent, open BBQ and beer tent,the amenity which attracts the greatest custom among young farmers,are close by.And right next to the beer tent is the First Ad station.Could there be a connection?These racing bicycles haven’t been used for a long time,neither has there been a village cobbler making shoes for many years,but the chainsaw wood carver has only just packed up the tools of his trade,leaving behind a pile of offcuts which disappeared quickly.Firewood, anyone?The general consensus was that Carnival was very lucky with the weather this year.It was a day of glorious sunshine, people came out in great crowds.Efforts by organisers and an army of volunteer helpers paid offand healthy profits were made not only by theCarnival Committee (of course there’s a committee - this is England)but also local charities.It’s all tidied away now until next year."},
{"title": "Lonely ?", "date": "Friday 5 August 2016", "text": "In need of company? Desperate for a chat?Get a dog, or, even better, get a dog and come and live in Valley’s End.This morning I hadn’t even set foot in the road beyond the field and cattle grid when two gentlemen walking along stopped and hailed me. I was pushing a wheelbarrow full of stuff for the rubbish bin down the drive and one of the chaps came and pushed it the last five meters to the gate for me. One of them had been away on holiday, so we hugged a ‘hallo,-lovely-to-see-you-back” hug.  All three of us stopped for a chat and the holiday maker said he had something for us and would come round later.They went off and I saw Dave leading Badger and Murphy, his two collies, on the other side of the road. I still hadn’t left my own drive. I hailed Dave and he came over. Millie greeted Badger and Murphy and I enquired why I hadn’t seen Dave for three weeks or more. Was he well? Had they been away? Yes, all was fine but “you know how it is. Sometimes we change routines.” Dave is normally someone I meet up with, via dog-walking, twice a week at least. He’s a kind chap, does neighbourly deeds for people in need without making a fuss. He’s helped Kevin in the past, or, as he likes to be called, Kev, the chap for whom the glass is always half empty. The ex-alcoholic who makes sure everybody knows that he is not long for this world. Kevin the wood carver.Kev is a sad chap, even more so now that he’s lost Sam, his one and only true friend. Sam was very old and has been deteriorating for a while. All praise to Kev for having kept him alive for as long as he did. But now Sam’s gone. I knocked on Kev’s door to tell him how sorry I was and asked what had happened with Sam. “Thank you for calling, but I don’t want to talk about it.” Kev’s eyes are always a bit rheumy, this time they were more watery than ever, but he didn’t actually cry. Kev often used to call on us with Sam; Sam always got a treat. Now I won’t be seeing Kev out again. Some people say that there are plenty of dogs in need of a loving home, perhaps Kev will take on another reject, but maybe not just yet.Sue and Joe, the retired vicar, weren’t sure they'd have another dog after Jake died, very recently. He was a beauty, a long haired golden retriever with a mind of his own. Jake insisted that he would go for at least one paddle a day, come rain or shine, hell or high water. The latter literally. He plunged in even when the river was running in spate and the water icy cold. Millie and Jake got on very well, both being old and a bit disdainful of these young whippersnappers racing round the field over and over again, yipping madly; then taking a break and pestering the older, more dignified generation, shoving their noses up under their tails and sniffing their bottoms. Most intrusive, no wonder Millie and Jake growled occasionally.Now, less than two months later, I see Sue with a new golden retriever, Alfie, who’d lost his previous home. Sue and Joe felt their very small house wasn’t complete without a large dog cluttering up the bit of free space they own, and went looking for a living rug to shed his long fur over every surface. Sue and Alfie are a well matched pair already, she smiles all over her benevolent, round, face every time we meet and tells me how well and thoroughly Alfie has already settled into their routine. Alfie already has her sussed. “Every time he sees me handle the roll of blue poo bags he makes for the door. He knows a blue bag means walkies.” Of course he does, dogs aren’t stupid, no matter what cat lovers say. No doubt Alfie will accept Joe as his owner soon enough and Joe too will join the dog walking fraternity again.Then there’s Robin, the part-time-post-retirement-brewer who works at the local pub but still has time to come out with mad Horace,  the speediest whippet-cum-lurcher-cum-unknown-hairy-creature who can cover the hundred meter field in two-and-a-bit seconds. Robin throws a ball for him with one of those long-handled contraptions, giving him and me plenty of time to chat, while Horace with the black eye patch flies off, stretching out horizontally, feet never touching the ground. There’s Jim-the-tooth with his whippet-lurcher combo, who isn’t quite as fast as Horace but still likes to run for Horace’s ball and nick it if he gets half a chance.Or there’s the lady with the wild blond hair and her greyhound Archie; she also brings her husband who has suffered a stroke and lost the power of speech. Perhaps that’s why she always talks and talks and talks; I  rarely understand what she’s saying because she mumbles rather, flicks her hair out of her eyes and adjusts the tweed capes she wears, summer and winter, while talking. She’s rather sweet, her husband lumbers awkwardly across the field, grunting at her, encouraging her to help him to the bridge and back to the car long before she’s ready. She and I commiserate with each other about the boring and unpleasant side of being full time carers.Jane, a large, sightly mannish lady brings Buster, an equally large chocolate labrador. Jane is unmarried and childless, an ex-teacher, who talks to her dogs like she must have talked to her pupils once upon a time, kindly but firm, pretending to be the boss, while all the time they run rings around her.These are just a few of the regular dog walkers I run across, there are many others and all of them will stop to chat. And I haven’t even mentioned trips to the shop yet. Often Millie gets tied to the railings at the entrance, where she collects a circle of admirers in no time, all of whom first talk to her, then me, until a small knot of people, arriving and leaving, blocks the entrance and makes the traffic slow down where the road meets the narrow pavement.Valley’s End is a very friendly place. From what I’ve written here it may look as if only dog walkers take the time to exchange pleasantries with each other. That’s far from the case. Even the surgery is a busy hub of social intercourse. But dog walkers are a special breed, and if they have nothing else in common they share the bond of love for man’s best friend."},
{"title": "Look who’s back!", "date": "Monday 1 August 2016", "text": "Yes, it’s old gardener!Making sense of what has turned into an overgrown jungle.Paul, new gardener, has been busy doing his own thing.What with arts and crafts, the odd bit of malaise of one sort or another,his proclivity for doing himself accidental injury,and summer visitors, he’s cried off many a Tuesday morning, his day for labouring in my garden.So I took my courage in both hands,and rang old gardener’s number.Sure enough, the dreaded dragon, old gardener’s wife answered.Being a dyed in the wool coward and ever so careful,I didn’t give her my name, just asked if I could speak to her husband.(She’d been the main reason for him dumping me.)He was in, came to the phone and greeted me like a long lost friend.(Oh dear, watch it, the missus might not like it!)It’s not that she doesn’t like me personally - at least. I don’t think she does -but she wanted him to cut back on work. As I had stupidly told her how much we like and appreciate him, I was the obvious candidate for discarding.I had the impression at the time that she’s not overly keen on him enjoying what he does.\"Please, could you come and do the edges\", I wheedled.“Nobody does them like you.”And“the garden’s totally overgrown, I need you.Maybe two or three mornings a months, \"Please?”\"The other chap can do all the hard work, like composting, and digging, and such.If you’d come and do the weeding and cut the edges, I’d be ever so grateful.\"He chuckled. He likes flattery.I carried on telling him all the jobs he’d not need to do, like cutting hedges,replanting shrubs, clearing paths, lugging stones and pots, climbing up ladders.“Just maybe two or maybe three mornings?”“Alright”, he said, “I can do Thursdays”we’ll see how it goes.”What? After I’d had to screw up my courage and tell myself not to be a pathetic wuss,and what could she say other than “on your bike, dear”!It was as easy as that.I know that he’s secretly nervous about her moods and her sharp tongue.He’s also bored by inactivity and despite his 71 years he’s an active man, who likes to work and takes pride in what he does. So, we’re off. He’s already given me two mornings, making a great difference;also, I’ve enjoyed being out with him.We’ve got a very easy working relationship and we joke and tease and cursethose damned weeds and getting stung by nettles and entangled with long rose tendrils,and ripped to shreds by vicious thorns.It’s all in a morning’s work, and the best thing is that we have tea breaks!Tea breaks, when, with a little gentle encouragement, I can guide him towards those gardener’s tales again.I shall keep Paul on too. Between the two of them, I hope to get as much work done in a week as old gardener did by himself, when he still came for eight hours and worked like two men.  It’ll cost more, but “there are no pockets in shrouds”, and it makes me happy to restore my garden to its former glory. I had lost interest, because I simply can ’t work as hard as I once did and seeingEnchanter’s Nightshade (in spite of it’s divine name it’s an evil weed with an insidious,delicate white root system) colonise my precious flower beds makes me helplessly cross.“Well, it’s not too bad”, says old gardener.“I thought it’d be worse; sure, you’ve got weeds growingeverywhere, but it’s not too untidy at all.\"Happy Days."},
{"title": ". . . . a little western flower . . . . .", "date": "Saturday 23 July 2016", "text": "After all the raving and ranting I’ve done recently, not forgetting moaning and whining, perhaps it’s time I turned my attention to gentler topics. How about the humble pansy? Anyone interested? Thought not. See what I can do.Let’s start with the common European wild pansy, viola tricolour, also known as Johnny-Jump-Up, heart's ease, heart's delight, tickle-my-fancy, Jack-jump-up-and-kiss-me, come-and-cuddle-me, three faces in a hood, or love-in-idleness. And that’s just a few of them in English. wild pansyIn German the wild pansy is called, inter alia, Ackerveilchen (viola of the field), Muttergottesschuh (Mother of God’s shoe), Maedchenaugen (maiden's eyes), Schöngesicht (beauteous face) or Liebesgesichtli (Lover’s face).The English illustrator, Cicely Mary Barker (28 June 1895 – 16 February 1973) was best known for a series of fantasy illustrations depicting fairies and flowers. The wild pansy is one of the flowers used by her in her rather whimsical drawings.Shakespeare mentions the wild pansy in two of his plays:   In Hamlet, Ophelia, who is mad with grief at the death of her father, rambles on about strewing herbs:  “And there is pansies, that’s for thoughts…” (Act IV, Scene 5.)And in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Oberon commands Puck to bring him “…a little western flower / Before milk-white, now purple with love’s wound / And maidens call it love-in-idleness.” (Act II, Scene 1.)   It is the effect of this natural aphrodisiac that causes the mayhem and entertainment of the entire play!  You could say that A Midsummer Night’s Dream is woven around the magical properties of heartsease.Georgia O’Keefe produced a very beautiful painting of a black pansy and followed it up with a depiction of a white one.Wild pansies were used as herbals, to cure venereal disease for instance, acc. to Culpepper; ditto headaches and dizzy spells. The ancient Greeks used it as a love potion and a symbol of fertility.The violet has ever been the emblem of constancy. There is a French proverb which goes something like this: “Violet is for faithfulness, which shall in me abide, hoping that in your heart too, it shall not hide”.The German name for the garden pansy is 'little stepmother’ Stiefmutterchen. There is a very sad tale attached to it:Stepmother, symbolised by the large lower leaf, only allows her own childrento adorn themselves in colourful array.Her stepchildren, the upper two leaves of the flower, have to remain in the background, clad in modest colours, or plain white.Sorrow at the poor treatment his own children receive has turned the pistil, representing the father’s hair, white.Lastly an explanation for the name in English, which is, as so often, a mispronunciation of a foreign name.A small bouquet of pansies, given by a lover to his love, was called a pensée, - hence pansy - a thought, symbolising devotion and faithfulness, remembrance, honour, even humility.But mainly it means: \"I am always thinking of you\".In other words, the pansy is an all-round excellent fellow; humble though it is. we should plant many more of them, in spite of their dowdy image with some gardeners. The pansy will brighten any spot and is at home equally in the ground as in any kind of container.Still reading? Well done. I’ll stop now."},
{"title": "Seriously, Dear World,", "date": "Monday 18 July 2016", "text": "what is wrong with you? Have you gone stark staring mad?After last year’s horrors, I was counting on the silly season being exactly that: the lazy, hazy days of summer, when the living is easy and the news is frivolous, with maybe a 'crime passionnel’ amongst the more hot-blooded classes to exercise the mind.Instead we have more of the same, possibly even worse. Dear World, why are you turning at an ever faster pace, the news being outdated even before it’s been digested and events overtaking each other at breakneck speed? How did we allow this to happen? Sitting, as I do, in front of screens and pouring over newspapers doesn’t help. Neither does it help to mouth pious speeches: “Our thoughts and prayers are with you” being one of them, favoured by politicians and the general run of commentators at the scene and in memorial gatherings alike.Battles in Syria, Iraq, the Ukraine, the refugee crisis, Islamist terror in France, The ascension of populist right wingers everywhere, with Donald Trump the most visible, Brexit in the UK, which one commentator explained as  a “howl of outrage\" by those left behind in the global scramble for a place in the sun, whose votes were tricked out of them  by shameless lies and, most recently, the attempted military coup in Turkey with far from transparent origins. We hear of endless shootings in the US, which we hardly recoil from any longer, telling ourselves that  an obsession with readily available weapons will logically have only one outcome.So much is happening, Dear World, how can we stop the carnage?It may sound macabre, but we are so swamped with daily dollops of unbearably horrendous information that we are in danger of forgetting that 1000s have drowned in the Mediterranean  on their way to a “better life\"and that the Italian coastguard has recently found a boat on the bottom of the Med with 675 corpses.They’re just the ones which have been discovered. How many more are there? How many more atrocities can France bear?How many more men, women and children will have to leave everything they hold dear behind and run for their lives?

{"title": "A Warning", "date": "Monday 27 June 2016", "text": "Since Friday morning six a.m. I have done little but follow the unfolding Brexit horror story; on the TV news, in political debates, newspapers, both digital and paper; I have opened every chime on my phone and checked news of developments on my tablet for hours every day. And when there were no new developments I read the old ones over again. And comments. And political blogs.In a word, I’ve been obsessed. Still am. But I want out now. Enough, for heaven’s sake. You will understand if I tell you that I have done this in two languages other than English, namely from the EU viewpoint via German and French sources as well. As my French is pretty poor I earned myself several severe headaches into the bargain.After months of relentless bombardment with ‘project fear’ on the one hand and a merciless diet of lies, some of them whoppers, rebutted and shown for the lies they were, but taken as gospel by people desperate to believe them, on the other, the populace has voted. Lots of them have since woken up saying \"WTF have I done”, particularly now that the liars are back-pedalling like mad on their promises and the ‘project fear’ lot are suddenly not quite so certain that Armageddon, a nuclear holocaust, world war III, and economic collapse loom. It’s too late, in spite of a three-million-signatures-strong (so far) petition to reverse the process. We have ‘project farce’.The funniest result is that the winning side now has absolutely no plan on how to implement vox pop’s wish. “There’s no hurry to execute withdrawal” they say. now that the repercussions are becoming apparent. I am allowing myself a smidgeon of Schadenfreude seeing that I am on the losing side.The winners have been handed a poisoned chalice.  'Le Monde' said that it’s like a death sentence without an executioner. Nobody wants to carry out the sentence.Now for the warning: many of my readers are US citizens. You are being offered a poisoned chalice yourself. Before you accept it make absolutely sure you know what you’re doing. And that you have a shrewd idea what the wrong decision will mean for you.Good Luck to all of us."},

{"title": "A Mixed Bag of Inconsequentials", "date": "Monday 20 June 2016", "text": "It’s really hard to come up with a worthwhile blog post when your mind is preoccupied. I may also be suffering from writer’s block, all my writing, even my diary, remains ignored for the most part. But I love reading. I can’t get enough of that; books have always been my bolt hole, from a very early age I felt the need to escape into someone else’s life when I didn’t like my own very much. I’ve just finished two books, Emma Healey’s 'Elizabeth Is Missing', a story about an old lady’s Alzheimer’s-coloured obsession with her friend’s whereabouts and buried secrets of her own past, and Kate Atkinson’s ‘A God In Ruins’ about a bomber pilot in WWII, a kind of second half to her ‘Life After Life’. Neither book is light escapism, but well written and easy to read in spite of the subject matter.The weather has been filthy, there’s been little gardening; the picture of Paul and Beloved having a tea break was taken on an exceptional day.  I am very glad we have stopped opening for the public. The tallest and most impressive flowers are the white umbels of the pernicious ground elder, an absolutely destructive thug whose roots get into anything and are very hard to eradicate. The bane of my life, second only to the dreaded dandelion.Millie has recovered from her crise de nerfs; luckily we have had no further violent thunderstorms round here, although other parts of the country have been  inundated. We were invited to a birthday lunch at a very grand and very rich house, not by the owners, who were not in residence, but by their dog and house sitter, our good friend Jay, who is neither grand nor rich.The dogs in question are pugs. a small black one and a beige-brown one, a little larger. (The picture is from the net pets-for-homes.co.uk). They were in a spacious enclosure behind a wire fence. Apparently the owners are terrified that they could escape and get run over. They are never allowed to leave the premises.Surely pugs are among the ugliest dogs ever? I am sorry if you are the proud owner of one, I mean no offence, although, no doubt, you are offended now. When I went up to the two of them to do my usual silly impression of a dog-besotted idiot they barked at me. Well, barking is exaggerated. They wheezed and snuffled at me in a hostile manner. The small one was pathetic: every two wheezes and he had to take a laboured breath before he could squeeze the next wheezy bark out. He had no tail at all, not even a stub end. His rear end was smooth, he’d been docked until there was not even a smidgeon of tail left. Poor little blighter, no wonder he was in a bad temper. The other one was older and seemed resigned.How can it be good for a dog to be bred until he has a completely flat face and no nose to breathe through? Give me a Millie, with a great big wet hooter and a solid tail to wag any day, even if she’s the result of an unfortunate liaison between a collie and a lab.We took her to the pub where she found shelter from the storm after she escaped and were told that she rushed in like a bat out of hell and shook herself all over the guests sitting at the tables. Well done Millie, they’ll not forget you in a hurry.Millie’s been to the dog groomer. I swear that girl moults more than other dogs. She hates it when I leave her there and if I should stop and chat to Tina, the groomer, and Millie is already in her pre-wash and brush up cage, she growls and whines and weeps bitter tears. ‘Mummy, how could you’, she says. Two hours later when I pick her up, she pulls like a train to get out and away. Dogs just don’t appreciate a pampering session. Not like me, I went to Helen’s for a delicious facial and I didn’t growl or whine once! Instead, I purred.Beloved hasn’t got any worse, in fact, he’s perked up a bit. I treated him to a couple of theatre visits: the RSC’s almost all black ‘Hamlet' with the rising star Paapa Essiedu in the title role and the Globe’s 'The Merchant Of Venice' with Jonathan Pryce as Shylock. Both productions were excellent. “The seats are too hard”, Beloved said of Hamlet (his bottom is skin and bones now) and when asked about The Merchant he flatly stated that he didn’t like it. My friend Sue, who had asked, was rather taken aback. “What don’t you like, the play or the production?” \"I simply don’t like plays whose entire action revolves around prejudice”, he said. Okay, Hm? Are there any plays that don’t have some form of prejudice? In fact, isn’t human frailty the whole point of Shakespeare? I agree to some extent, though, The Merchant is tragically nasty throughout.Anyway, I have booked tickets for three more productions; I shall be going by myself."},
{"title": "Sunday", "date": "Sunday 12 June 2016", "text": "Sunday wears a crown, and has a golden beard and a ring.Sunday sings his psalms, and laughs and jokes,and teaches his lessons in a booming voice.And all creatures sleep in the peace of the earth,and the earth in Sunday’s hand. *I like this poem, particularly the last two lines; true, the mystical aspect of it is of less importance to me than to the poet, but the image and feelings he conjures up go right to the heart of my own Sunday self.For as long as Beloved and I have been together I have made our Sundays stand out. The only exceptions have been the Sundays when he had a Sunday engagement, an afternoon concert, say, in some spa town, or at summer festivals. Moonlighting at weekends. If I went along we’d usually have a quick pizza between rehearsal and concert, which was all that was on offer in places like Tunbridge Wells or Brighton. Things might have changed a bit since then.Until we met and moved in together, Sundays were nothing special to Beloved. Many English people use Sunday for d-i-y jobs, shopping trips, household chores. During my years of single-parenting and a full-time job I did as much as I could on Saturdays and always attempted to keep Sundays free; admittedly, mainly to recover from the past week and recharge batteries for the week following. There was a lot of solitary putting up of feet, involving listening to music and reading. The kids were old enough to amuse themselves and happy doing it. All three of us enjoyed solitude. except at Sunday dinner, which was a far more elaborate meal than weekday ones.In my years with Beloved I have kept up the custom of making our Sunday meal special. Three courses with wine are the minimum requirements. Not that I do all the cooking, I might buy something at the delicatessen’s, certainly the starter, and sometimes the pudding too. But we sit and eat at leisure, savouring the food, sipping a glass of something pleasant, and talking. Talking is the main ingredient. it’s almost as if sitting at table fires up neurons and loosens the tongue. We are never at a loss for topics, even now. We might start by remarking on the weather: “Isn’t it still today, not a leaf stirring”/ or: \"Heavens, just listen to that rain pounding the glass roof (of the conservatory)”. Then there are compliments about the food and, after careful sipping of the wine, a remark about how pleasant it all is. We'll mention what we did during the week, recall people we met, a play we saw, maybe a lecture we attended. Because it’s Sunday and Sundays are for being kind, I keep criticism to a minimum. Beloved is always kind, even on weekdays. Until we reach politics, current affairs and the deplorable state of beastly humanity, as evidenced by scores of examples daily. We never have to look far. We might not always agree on the causes or the strategies of amelioration; the debate could even get quite heated. It’s amazing how (mildly) reactionary I have become with age, when I was accused, for most of my life, of being “your textbook bleeding heart liberal’.In this fashion we spend a good two hours being friends and enjoying each other, until Millie nags me into getting up and feeding her. She has her second meal of the day at 3pm on the dot and woe betide me if I forget. So I don’t. Usually.And after that? Like the creatures in the poem we “sleep in the peace of the earth”. The wine might have had something to do with that.*Eliseo Diego1920-1994transl. from the Spanish by J.M.CohenAnd so it goes, there’s little change; days flow into each other, one after the other.This is how I started the last entry in a private diary about our slow slide into oblivion. I don’t feel that I can - or want to - share every moment with all of you, some things need to remain private. Pain, distress, the inexorable progress of disease, mental and physical, are not suitable subjects for the mundane and often frivolous confessions we spill into social media. I have since realised that the first statement is not altogether true any more. There’s little change in the situation, yet there is some small change in me.  I may have said, here or in my private diary: “I am permanently stressed and permanently depressed.” If I haven’t said it, or written it, then I have thought it. But that’s not true now, either.There comes a time when one accepts even the most hopeless situation. Life goes on. An innate sense of survival takes over. I think that is what’s happening to me.The weather has been fine, I have spent a lot of my free time gardening and when it’s been too hot to go out I’ve read indoors. Beloved has been happy to potter about outside, leaning on his stick, snipping at this and pulling on that and when he’s been tired he’s just sat in the sun.I’ve stopped watching him all the time. In an emergency he’d soon know how to get my attention. Besides, he has a panic button. I’ve gone out for up to three hours at a time and he’s been fine. He’s not likely to attempt anything that requires physical strength or mental athletics.Even Millie is settling into the new routine. I take her out for a short walk in the morning and not again until late in the afternoon. She has a daily paddle in the river and several doors are open for her to come and go as she pleases. She is not meant to leave the garden - we are hedged or walled in and gated, but the other day, during a violent thunderstorm, she panicked and got out, I don’t know how or where, but she made her way into the village and ended up at the pub after having raced along the high street. I expect the pub door was open and she made for its darkish, cool and cavelike interior which might seem to be a safe haven to a frantic dog. I happened to be out in Ludlow at the time. Beloved never even noticed that she was gone until a young man brought her back after the storm. Two messages told us not to worry, she was safe; we didn’t listen to either of them until afterwards.Perhaps Millie has the right idea, a village pub is indeed a safe haven in a storm and we should all three seek its comfort more often."},
{"title": "My Own Worst Enemy?", "date": "Monday 23 May 2016", "text": "On the terrace of the RSC Stratford-upon AvonBeloved sitting on the left.The thought has been in my head off and on for the past two weeks, so yesterday I googled it. Mr Google has the answer to everything and cites many examples of self-sabotage. Picking just one of the many, here is a psychiatrist and career consultant saying:  \"We unconsciously respond to stressful situations in ways that hurt us.”My situation is stressful, yet, there are women in Valley’s End who have a much harder row to hoe than me. And, in public anyway, they appear to be coping better than me.  I can tell they are tired, I can tell they wish things were easier, but they remain cheerful, they smile, they cajole and badger and drag their poor old relics into the bright light of public display. And it does both them and their spouses good.I went to see my lovely GP for a minor niggle of my own and, him being an absolute gem of a man, he said that I must get out by myself at least once a week, that I must continue with activities I enjoy and, most of all, stay in contact with friends and have as much social interaction as is available.And that is exactly where the doggie lies buried: I am not, never have been, a fan of organised or communal entertainment. The ladies I mentioned in the earlier paragraph are never happier than when they are in the company of many, sitting at a table for twelve, say, in fast and furious conversation, shouting louder than anyone else - in a nice way - and generally having a wonderful time.We’ve tried it. We’ve joined a pensioners’ luncheon club. Beloved sat over his plate, miserable, deeply bored, irritated by the noise; I sat opposite him, equally bored, inwardly fuming. Why can’t we see these lovely people for what they are: salt of the earth and making the best of a bad job. My hearing is good, I can’t decide whether that was an advantage or a disadvantage during the riotous banter going on.We have yet to try a daycare centre. On the face of it, it would be a good place to drop Beloved off while I continued into Shrewsbury for some me-time, but the moment the kind and compassionate staff showed signs of organising games and communal activities he’d grab his stick and crawl out of the place.Call us stand-offish, conceited, superior twits, but we find a quiet lunch for four or a trip to the theatre much preferable. We did both, had a lovely lunch with a couple where the husband is in the advanced stages of Parkinson’s, when we mostly talked about books; we also went to Stratford to see a performance of Shakespeare’s Cymbeline with just two friends. Whereas the communal jollities happen frequently, the outings we prefer come round only occasionally, leaving us isolated and at a loss to know what to do for the best. Although I may wish we were temperamentally suited to join in and, in the safety of a group of sociable, boisterous and gregarious people, forget our woes, going against our nature - Beloved and I are very similar in that respect - won’t do us any good either.Once life was joyful and exciting, complex and satisfying. Now we realise that it is finite and sad and can be intensely frightening. Whatever it is, it has to be borne. And I don’t believe that going with my instincts makes me an enemy to myself.To each his own."},
{"title": "Thanks very much anyway,", "date": "Monday 9 May 2016", "text": "for the kind enquiries I’ve had from  many of you as to my state of mind and general wellbeing or otherwise.You realise, don’t you, that if you ask me “how are you?”  I might just possibly tell you? No manners, that’s me. Telling you how it is is not at all the done thing in the UK and the correct answer is always “Not too bad, thanks” if you’re common and “Very well, thank you” if you’re posh,  even if you’re shortly to be thrown into the fiery furnace, weeping and wailing and gnashing your teeth. Like if you push your shopping trolley (hard, and maybe deliberately, because they’re slow and you’re in a bad mood)) into someone’s ankles they invariably turn round and say “Sorry”. Whereas I would quite likely say “Watch where you’re pushing that thing!\"And if you ask me “What’s new?” I have nothing to say at all, except maybe that the garden is overgrown and weedy, that Millie is getting fat for lack of walkies, that I’ve had three separate bouts of AFib in the last four weeks, but am feeling better (who knows for how long - see, there’s positive thinking!), that Beloved's still eating and drinking and sleeping, and making bad jokes, that I’m bored out of my skull and utterly depressed most of the time when I’m not stressed to the point of wanting to rip everybody’s head off.Told you I’d tell you. Satisfied?What’s even worse is that I’m compensating for stress and rage by eating chocolate, loads of it. And getting fat. Without chocolate I’m a fiend in human form, impossible to get along with. I did an hour’s round trip to get to my favourite chocolate shop on Friday, taking Beloved along for the ride and his own chocolate fix. What do you think happened? He ambled along the shelf, pawed a bar of the stuff here and there, put them all back and said “I don’t really feel like chocolate!”On the drive to the chocolate-selling town we’d stopped off at a very fancy Food Centre, posh and horribly expensive, and what did we do? we argued about bread. Apparently, all bread has a rubbery edge now. Or so he says. He wished to explore the breads this Food Centre had on offer, he said in a posh voice. He’s good at big words in a posh voice. So I said that one of the freezers at home is stuffed full of bread of all kinds, shapes and sizes, wholemeal, sourdough, white, black, French pain de campagne, German rye, English soft. Very well, he says, no need for me to go in then, you go and buy what you like.It was lunchtime, attached to the Food Centre is a restaurant, nothing fancy, good enough for a bite and a drink. We even had a table outside in the pleasant sunshine. Millie came too; she lay between us looking up first at me, then him, hoping for a handout. She was in luck. Beloved said his lunch of pulled pork was tasteless, practically inedible, chewy, too bready (bread again) and as for the salad, which consisted of rocket leaves, well, he said, how am I supposed to eat this? With my fingers? Apparently the fork wouldn’t spear the blasted leaves.When, in the name of all that’s sane in this crazy world we have been pitched into, will we get used to the status quo? There is no hope. The prognosis is bleak and cure is there none. We can bicker and row and make the rest of our time together a penance or we can stop and enjoy what’s left. Positive action is the only thing that helps. How long does it take to accept your hand and play it for all you’re worth? Even the doctor said ‘it’s quality of life that counts, not quantity’. When I told her that I wasn’t going to nag Beloved into giving up his glass of wine, eating only the most sensible food, stopping him from sleeping several hours during the day, making him take exercise he can no longer cope with and any or all of the good advice handed out by helplines I thought she’d want to tell me off. But no, staying as happily together as we’ve been for many years was the thing to do, she said. Put the nagging on hold.I am leaving the comments section open for this post. Although I am very grateful for your empathy, your kind thoughts and prayers, please don’t go soft on me. If I need anything, it’s a calm and competent and very thorough talking to, otherwise known as a kick in the backside."},

It is happening, it is real; Beloved is ill, both mentally and physically. It no longer matters who or what caused it, if last year’s medications tipped him over the edge we must accept it. Playing the Blame Game won’t make a blind bit of difference.We are once again waiting for an assessment of his state of health and therefore in limbo. I have a permanent headache, feel flat, depressed and obsessed with the situation. It’s like standing at a carousel in the Arrivals Hall at the airport, helplessly watching a big suitcase full of demons going round and round and round and nobody claims it for their own, least of all me.What on earth can I blog about? Perhaps I could start a new blog: 'The Road To Oblivion’. Or I could list the outings we undertake, singly or jointly, like meals with friends or in the pub, shopping trips; there have been some rare family visits, one where the visitors actually made a difference by clearing some long neglected jobs; there’ve been long or short walks with Millie, depending on the weather. Also depending on weather have been stints in the garden. Nothing has brought any lasting relief, that merry-go-round in my head is merciless.So deep is this misery that I don’t want anyone to try and coax me out of it. When I told a friend how flat I feel she said that coming out with them to see a movie would be good for me, that I always seem to rally when circumstances demand it. I know all about brave faces and accepting their invitation might have been a good idea but afterwards I still have to go home and climb into my screeching head again.I’ll come back here when the load lightens, or when we’ve had the assessment.

There are too many sites which concentrate disproportionately on hyped and blown up bad news. Headlines scream at you, deliberately phrased in such a way that you are drawn in against your better judgement. Result: depression and feeling down-hearted. Yes, bad stuff happens all the time, but concentrating on it to the exclusion of good stuff doesn’t make it better.Living in a phoney bubble of privilege and positivity is plain stupid, we must face reality. After all, we are part of the human race, living at this time,  constantly confronted with the awfulness of traumatic events. Desperate refugees pressed up against barbed wire, children with huge hungry eyes, mass shootings, politicians in the UK all but shredding each other over the EU referendum; and then there’s the surreal and well nigh unbelievable spectacle of Donald Trump. But there was better news too more recently:What, really?Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall? I can’t have been the only one whose face cracked into a huge sneery grin when the news came through. Finally, something to make me giggle. I loved the pictures of the happy couple, (particularly the close-ups), arm in arm, Jerry in flat shoes, so as not to tower over her shortish groom who's 84, and looks every day of it. And so Rupert plays his part.

At 84 his money bags can still cause our craven government to kowtow and let him have all the best programmes on the BBC for a song.

{"title": "Permutations, Perambulations and Pictures ", "date": "Tuesday 1 March 2016", "text": "Millie is throwing me a dirty look from under lowered, speckled-white eyebrows: “Can we Please go out? It’s a lovely day.” “Oh, very well then.” She’s right, it’s chilly but the sun is out and I really shouldn’t waste the morning. I’m still very much up and down, given to mood swings, feelings of depression one minute, hopeful the next. A brisk walk in bright sunshine would surely do me good. It is indeed a cheery morning. We go up the old track leading out of Valley’s End towards Bishop’s Castle until we get to the crossroads, where we turn right, with our backs to Bicton Hill.Ever since we’ve first lived here I have called this crossing of two field edge footpaths “Gallows Corner”. I can no longer remember who told me this but today, wanting to find out more about this gruesome, now disappeared, relic of past justice I asked several long time residents and local historians; none of whom had ever heard of it. Mr. Wells remembered the stocks next to the Town Hall, now the village museum, where wrong ‘uns, who had celebrated market day a little too carelessly, were shackled by their legs; I suppose they were lucky not to have been thrown into the lock-up proper from where they wouldn’t even have been able to see the fun, there being no window in the mouldy cell. On the other hand, well-meaning burghers might have pelted them with rotten vegetables?Having walked along 'The Modems’ (again, I must find out why this track across the hill on the Southern edge of Valley’s End has this name), towards Radnor Hill we climbed the stile conveniently cut into the hedge into the next field.  Radnor Hill is mainly limestone, discovered and quarried by the Romans when they colonised this part of the country in the middle of the first century AD, and even today there are remnants of very early quarries on top of the hill, with several smaller and more recent quarries nearer the base.Back down in the village, having slithered down a still muddy and steep path, via the old pool which has caused so much controversy and falling out of neighbour with neighbour, and along a small stretch of road past the entrance to the alms houses, we turned left to the allotments and the kissing gate, which leads to a track between two fields.  A kissing gate is a type of gate which allows people to pass through, but not livestock. The normal construction is a half-round, rectangular, or V-shaped enclosure with a hinged gate trapped between its arms. The kissing gate is often the subject of chatter about the origins of its amorous-sounding name. The prosaic answer is that it derives from the fact that the hinged part touches – or ‘kisses’ – both sides of the enclosure rather than being securely latched like a normal gate.That hasn’t stopped many clinging to a more romantic notion: that the first person to pass through would have to close the gate to the next person, providing an opportune moment to demand a kiss in return for entry. I know which answer I prefer.Kissing gates are often found at the entrance to church graveyards but there is no evidence that this has any symbolic significance.Once we are through the gate - I have to hold it open for Millie and she snakes through without demanding a kiss - the field track to 'The Green’ lies ahead. (in spite of its name, ‘The Green’ is our tiny industrial estate consisting of three low and rather attractively built structures - one even has arched windows, like church windows. The industry pursued here is entirely rural, causing neither pollution nor noise.) The lower slope of Radnor Wood  is getting closer.Three ponies and three sheep live in the paddock  at present. The field on the left has some kind of crop growing, possibly rape. Or perhaps winter wheat? I have no idea why just three sheep, when they are so plentiful everywhere else and are certainly never given any special treatment.One of the ponies comes to inspect us. I often have an apple in my pocket, perhaps that’s why. Millie and the pony sniff each other but then lose interest. (‘The Green’ industrial estate is visible over the hedge on the other side of the paddock). At the other end of the field edge track we climb a stile and return to the village and the ford across the river.Snowdrops and daffodils brighten he banks of the river. The waters have receded, although the river ‘was out’ when we had those endless heavy rains earlier this year and at the end of last year;  the levels have sunk, roads are clear and 4x4s can cross the ford again. I wouldn't like to try crossing in my small and ordinary car but then, I don’t have to. Valley’s End has a perfectly good humpback bridge built as recently as anno 1450 and still going strong. Well, with the fairly regular exception of lorries crashing into it, causing the locals no end of amusement while watching desperate drivers trying to extricate themselves without doing too much further damage. Many times drivers who had miscalculated the angle from road to bridge simply shot off, leaving the scene of the crime in as great a hurry as our narrow country lanes would allow. But, no more. Valley’s End has installed a camera! The guilty party will be caught and made to pay! Unfortunately, the parish finances are none too healthy and I am not sure that there was enough money in the kitty for both camera and film.Millie was right to get me out. I am feeling much better.

That ambitious contract many of us enter into with ourselves, being absolutely determined to lose weight, get fit, take up the ukulele, travel the world on a tricycle, blog regularly....etc. etc.What, you are sticking to it? I don’t believe you. For the sake of the vast majority who made rash promises while in the company of others, equally inebriated, I sincerely hope you have forgiving or short-memoried friends; if these friends aided and abetted you in your folly or made similar promises, you are home and dry. Resolutions? What resolutions? Never speak of them again, at least until next New Year’s Eve comes around and the embarrassment at a year-long failure to pull your socks up and finally master Mandarin Chinese brings a hot blush to your face.New year, new you, entirely new life, was the slogan of an online advertisement sent to me (and a million others) by a  department store with a seemingly benevolent face in early January. I was told that completely remodelling my home, buying the latest colours, hard and soft furnishings, would leave me revitalised, as new a woman as my new home; a woman enabled to stride forth into this shiny, brand-spanking new year with renewed vigour and determination, master of my fate and able to control and overcome all obstacles in my way. I may be exaggerating a bit here, but not by much.What is it with this new year rubbish? Why do we tell ourselves that a change in the calendar year will make all the difference?You may recall that 2015 was an annus horribilis for me - as the Queen would say - a year of disaster and misfortune. Towards the end of it things improved a bit but there was never any hope that all would be sweetness and light once the numbers changed. I am no more in control than I was in 2015. I don’t make New Year’s resolutions now. In another life and at another time, there were long years when I promised myself that “next year I will be brave, take courage and make changes” but I never did until my hand was forced by outside circumstances and change imposed itself on me rather than the other way round.No resolutions for me last New Year’s Eve except the one: I would develop the ability to take what was coming, to accept and, hopefully, be without overwhelming resentment. Well, dear ones, I can’t even do that. In many ways life is easier than last year but my attitude hasn’t changed all that much.When I ask people paddling similar leaky canoes like mine how they cope they tell me “just get on with it, there’s nothing else you can do” I see the resigned look in their eyes. They’re right, of course.Resignation and resentment, two singularly unpleasant and unattractive attitudes. Where’s that speeding bus? If any state of mind ever deserved being squashed flat, these two do."},

So that’s why I have been shedding followers since early in December.Any of you who are not informed of new posts on my or any other blogger’s blog are not being blocked by the blogger but Google itself, that giant, all-consuming steamroller flattening and levelling all who come into its clutches.This is what Google said:In 2011, we announced the retirement of Google Friend Connect for all non-Blogger sites. We made an exception for Blogger to give readers an easy way to follow blogs using a variety of accounts. Yet over time, we’ve seen that most people sign into Friend Connect with a Google Account. So, in an effort to streamline, in the next few weeks we’ll be making some changes that will eventually require readers to have a Google Account to sign into Friend Connect and follow blogs. As part of this plan, starting the week of January 11, we’ll remove the ability for people with Twitter, Yahoo, Orkut or other OpenId providers to sign in to Google Friend Connect and follow blogs. At the same time, we’ll remove non-Google Account profiles so you may see a decrease in your blog follower count. We encourage you to tell affected readers (perhaps via a blog post), that if they use a non-Google Account to follow your blog, they need to sign up for a Google Account, and re-follow your blog. With a Google Account, they’ll get blogs added to their Reading List, making it easier for them to see the latest posts and activity of the blogs they follow.We know how important followers are to all bloggers, but we believe this change will improve the experience for both you and your readers.Posted by Michael Goddard, Software EngineerI am not asking any of you to take on a Google account if you don’t wish to.

{"title": "The Weather Outside is Frightful . . . .", "date": "Monday 28 December 2015", "text": "with skies of unrelieved grey; wet and grey and muddy underfoot. As if Christmas on its own weren’t bad enough. However, I survived, as I hoped I would.It wasn’t as bad as I thought it might be, it was a toned down English version, an English Christmas without the paper hats and streamers; without the family rows, and bored kids; without endless hours of television. Even without a turkey. Dear kind friends took pity on us and gave us a Christmas dinner of roast goose instead. All very civilised, with good conversation and enough goodwill to solve half the ills of our planet. Sadly, nobody takes notice of sensible, kindly, friendly and peace-loving folk like us.Christmas is usually a difficult time for me. It’s the time when I’m most aware of being in voluntary exile. The Christmases of my childhood were slow and modest and contemplative ones, festive, with an unchanging order of events, lasting for at least three day, including Holy Night (Christmas Eve in the UK), Christmas Day and the second day of Christmas (Boxing day here). Nowadays, I do my best to forget, ignore, avoid all old-country-ways but all it takes is a sliver of Silent Night sung by a children’s choir on German TV and a secret tear rolls down my face. Ah well, there’s sentiment for you.We had promised ourselves that we would finally broach our very small collection of decent French reds which we bought many years ago from a proper French dealer in the Loire region. \"After all, we don't know what next year will bring; will we still be around to drink it?” We use this phrase rather a lot now. I chose this Gigondas from 2002 to start us off, entirely suitable to go with roast beef on Boxing Day. Beloved took the bottle between his knees and operated on the cork, which promptly crumbled and broke off halfway through uncorking. I had a go and broke the remaining bits of cork. I’d managed to poke a hole through though and laboriously and very slowly emptied the bottle into a plastic jug by means of a paper towel lined funnel. From there it went equally slowly into a glass jug.And what do you know, it was still drinkable. Not that either of us knows what a 14 yr old Gigondas, chateau-bottled, tastes like before it’s messed around by a pair of rank amateurs. Cheers.TV was an acceptable part of the festivities too; we watched the final, very final and very stickily sweet  two-hour-long episode of Downton Abbey. All’s well that ends well with not a dry eye in the house. Even the below-stairs lot gets paired off. Most of Doctor Who passed me by, the tremendous noise irritated me; Then there’s the Dickensian, a rather messy soup of most of Dickens’ novels which goes on for twenty half-hour-long episodes (will I stay the course?) and Agatha Christie’s ‘And Then There Were None’, a stylish adaptation to my mind. I like a bit of mindless murder and mayhem, particularly when it’s done in muted colours, bristling moustaches and kind elderly gentlemen being sweet to damsels in distress.But the best thing about Christmas, as in so many Decembers of our gradually warming climate, are the snowdrops, bravely poking out from the muddy ground. Harbingers of spring? Or foolhardy little treats just waiting to be nipped by frost and covered by snow?"},

{"title": "2 am and counting . . . . .", "date": "Saturday 12 December 2015", "text": "It’s 2 am and sleep remains elusive, in spite of having taken two sleeping pills.  It’s almost like I don’t want to go to sleep, there are too many thoughts chasing each other in my head. Not unpleasant ones, just everyday kind of thoughts; the kind which may appear trivial during the day but assume great importance at night. At night these thoughts matter and make sense. I have a suspicion that my subconscious welcomes them.I have made up my mind that I won’t live longer than 80, if I get that far. There’s no reason why I shouldn’t, we have a good number of nonagenarians  in the valley, so why not octogenarians. Right now, old age doesn’t raise the same terrors as it does during a day of assorted aches and pains. Still, 80 is probably enough.I have several wardrobes full of clothes, some of them totally unsuitable for a lady well-travelled down life's highways and byways, with a few experiences under her belt. Some of the items in the wardrobes suit different ages, lifestyles, shapes, and purposes no longer relevant to me. I even still have work clothes. A clear-out is imminent.Still, during the years I’ll allow myself to live I shall wear clothes to suit my mood; bright and unusually colourful clothes, just a touch out of the ordinary, without causing others to point  fingers at me and snigger behind hands. I am not a beige or greige person, I must have something more suited to my personality and attitude. Actually, I no longer care what people find acceptable; a wonderful perk that comes with advancing years. I might don Mum’s fur hats and maybe even Aunt Josephine’s mink coat on very cold days.Then there are the shoes, My daughter called me “the Imelda Marcus of Hertfordshire when we lived there, - you have to be a ripe old age to remember Imelda - when she could still bring herself to speak to me, that is, my daughter, not Imelda. I’ve never spoken with Imelda. I  have scores of  boxes of shoes, most of them hardly worn and therefore still pinching. I will take them out of their boxes, give the ones I no longer like to charity, and wear the others; at first in the house to wear them in a bit, then outside. It’s a great pity that wherever I go in Valley’s End I meet mud, soggy fields, and narrow roads bordered by deep ruts and puddles. Realistically speaking, wellies are the most suitable footwear round here, but when I die, I shall leave some really posh and expensive shoes behind. Enough to make me ask for some to be buried with me. I daresay I shall still be buying shoes when I’m in a wheelchair. I recently gave some black and gold satin shoes to Dee, my daughter-in-law.  She takes a smaller size than I do, but she loved them enough to wear them with a bit of padding.And then there’s yoga. Several years ago I broke my leg and ankle in several places, needing the insertion of a collection of metal plates, nails and screws. Recovery took a long time and at the end of it I had a stiff ankle which would not bend in the required yoga contortions. Ever since then I have given up on yoga which was really of great benefit to me before the accident.  I must start again, somehow, either by myself or with the friendly yoga teacher who lives in the village. Because of my panicky fear of driving up steep hills and down again (only here in Valley’s End) I shall have to walk up to her house above the village, a fair climb, which I might manage after some initial difficulties. I will have to take frequent breathers and admire the view.And blogging: I will do more of it and make new friends too. It’s such a pleasure when I put my mind to it and find something to write about. Comparing daily life with others on other continents is informative as well as fun; how else would I have got to know some of you who give me insights into your days. Besides, I enjoy writing, something else I’ve almost given up completely. So many writing projects require completion. A friend, who reads this blog, spontaneously said : You write very well, I do so enjoy your blog. You really should write more again. Somebody else asked me to write regular book reviews for a local news sheet. I’ve already turned her down.Come to think of it, I will try and make friends elsewhere too. I have so few, in spite of many invitations to join groups. Beloved and I were talking today about loneliness; neither of us is at all capable of nurturing a friendship. I have an inkling why that is so: we are sufficient unto each other. Sadly, that may not be for very long, and the quality of our sufficiency has changed. It’s hard to keep each other stimulated after years of marriage, particularly when one of you is fading in mind and body; luckily dementia and/or Alzheimer’s are still a way off but age brings a slowing down of the faculties of even the sharpest and most agile brain that roamed the earth in company with the dinosaur. Yes, that long ago.So here we go, friends have to be found. I shall make a very careful selection of suitably like-minded people and throw myself on their mercy. But I’ll draw the line at the Senior Citizen’s Club. And the Women’s Institute.I actually wrote this collection of thoughts between 2 and 3 am. I’ve reread it and corrected many spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, otherwise it’s what came into my head unprompted.Conscious thought: Isn’t the management of life easy in that state between fully awake and semi-consciousness."},

The stiff and naked limbs of our one remaining giant, a stately, ancient beech tree, swayed heavily in the gusts coming up the valley from the West. So far, the river Clun has risen merely to within an inch of the top of its banks, any more rainfall will see the castle meadow flooded and Millie will have to paddle for her afternoon constitutional.Inside, it’s been a very quiet week. Fearful of being blown off the road into hedges and ditches I left the car in the garage and made do with the village grocery shop for items like fresh milk and bread. Even that was a struggle, catching a lull in the rainstorms. There will be plenty more such weather, the forecasters say, to do with global warming and man-made climate change. If that is so then I will not be able to keep many appointments during winter, which take me away from the village. As it is, an afternoon meeting of German conversationalists was cancelled because nobody fancied getting trapped on flooded roads. I did, however, have a very pleasant hour long telephone conversation, in German, with a fellow blogger, another German lady living in the UK.We have only just started this contact and are still in the early stages of exchanging life stories.So, for most days we did what the poet said: we put our feet up, drank tea, wrapped ourselves in cosyness and welcomed peaceful evening in. We had a short, two-hour power cut one night;  there was enough light from the sky for me to go outside through the nearest door, grope my way around the terrace at the back of the house and through another door into the scullery where the torches live. Armed with a torch it was easy to find candles and matches. I was almost disappointed when the lights came back on. We so rarely sit side by side, exchanging quiet thoughts and comfortable silences.* from  The Task by W. Cowper** from As You Like It by Shakespeare"},
{"title": "Reporting Failure", "date": "Monday 30 November 2015", "text": "I knew I would regret starting a week-long series of posts on positivity. It’s just not like me to go searching for 'reasons to be cheerful’, (as in Ian Dury and the Blockheads’ song), or ‘Looking on the Bright Side of Life’ (Monty Python and the ‘Life of Brian’) or ‘Counting my Blessings’ as the hymn tells me to do.Don’t get me wrong, the attitude of looking at life through positive spectacles is to be welcomed; perhaps one needn’t go as far as Pollyanna and play the Glad Game whatever happens. Finding a pair of crutches in the Christmas stocking would make me cross enough to hit the giver over the head with them. At the other end of the spectrum, Ambrose Bierce in the Devil’s Dictionary writing off ‘positive’ as ‘mistaken at the top of one’s voice' is just plain unkind towards people whose philosophy tends to embrace certainty, tiresome though these people can be.There have been plenty of good things happening this week, which ended in the first Sunday in Advent and with it the first pheasant dinner of the season: a live screening of Shakespeare’s ‘The Winter’s Tale’ at a local theatre, a pleasant meal at a cosy pub, some clothes shopping, and the poetry evening and beauty treatment already mentioned in the previous posts. Actually, it’s been an exceptionally good week. It would be hard to see it in anything other than a positive light. But these are not the cosy things bloggers praise when they write about appreciating humble, small joys. Heart-warming stuff, good stuff. For my week I needed leisure and a reasonably well stocked wallet. Bragging about it in detail would be bad taste. Of course, at times I am a smug git, but I’ll try not to show my true colours here.I am profoundly grateful that I live in a peaceful country, that I am not one of the desperate people fleeing torture, bombs, destruction, hunger, disease and the horrors of civil war.  Not for me the undignified queueing up on Europe’s borders, begging to be admitted to shelter, food, work, and a life free from fear. Not for me the fate of being called a terrorist, a scrounger, a welfare tourist. Winter is coming and too few European nations seem to be aware that help is urgently needed to prevent chaos and save lives. Although in the UK we are spared pictures of the footsore and shivering crowds making their way across Europe from East to West - compassion fatigue sets in quite quickly here, the subject seems to have been swept out of sight recently - I have access to European TV channels and find myself utterly fascinated by and unable to look away from so much misery.Being aware of my good fortune and counting my comfortable little blessings seems almost shameful in the face of suffering humanity. Therefore, rather than listing a week’s worth of pleasures, small or otherwise, I shall try to emulate those of you who find unexpected joy in the moment and, if I think about it in time, perhaps share it here."},

We were standing in the middle of the roadway - we do that here in Valley’s End, cars frequently have to make their way around gossiping villagers - catching up. It was dark and dank and dismal and I was hoping she would join me in a moan and a whinge about  . . . .  well, anything really. I’m not fussed.

{"title": "My Friend The Tree Is Dead*", "date": "Saturday 21 November 2015", "text": "For the average German the forest is more than just the sum of the trees. When trees are threatened, Germans go on the warpath. I well remember the time of the late 70s when “sour rain” (i.e. acid rain), supposedly coming from Scandinavia, caused the great dying of the forests, particularly coniferous forests like the Schwarzwald (Black Forest). At the time the damage was thought to be irreversible. In Germany the forest is not only a cultural landscape formed through forestry and the result of modern recreational activities ranging from GPS-guided hikes to treetop trails. Much more than that, the woods and trees possess great symbolic, spiritual and fairytale-like charismatic powers and have always been celebrated in German poetry, art and music. Many of the fairy tales collected by the Brothers Grimm are set in Enchanted Forests.  In this way the forest is deeply rooted in the German consciousness – not only when we are using the woods for recreational purposes.Two millennia ago, when Germany was 90% woodland, (compared to about 20% now) the army of Hermann defeated the then greatest military power on earth, the Roman army, by setting an ambush in a narrow corridor between  impassable swamps on one side and hilly, thicketed forests on the other, the great battle of the Teutoburger Wald in 9 AD. The victory gave the woodland warriors a symbol of invincibility in the forest.Even hard-headed German politicians subscribe to the cult of trees; in a 1983 interview Chancellor Helmut Kohl said : mythology,  Germans and the forest, they all belong together.still standing - beech and truncated horse chestnutWhich brings me to the death of our own ancient horse chestnut. It has been sickening for some time - a few years ago we lightened its load by having the sail trimmed drastically - but during the recent gales on two consecutive days and nights it finally gave up the fight. During the first night the left hand fork came down and the next night the long branch on the right collapsed. No one was hurt but the garden beneath took a direct hit. My heart broke when I saw the terminally damaged giant.the left forkThere was no help for it, the tree had to come down completely. Tree fellers moved in and set to work, trimming what was left of the canopy, power-sawing, chopping and chipping mercilessly, and carting the slaughtered remains away.There is now a great gap in the hedge, allowing clear views across the valley; you’d say that’s not so bad, but it also allows the wind coming up the valley funnel newly opened access to the garden, probably bringing down several smaller trees which were damaged in the giant’s fall in the process.The damage to the woodland garden is considerable, tree fellers trampling all over it during the removal of the horse chestnut hasn’t done it any favours. Fences are down, the leaf mould enclosure is no more, and a few terracotta pots have been shattered, their contents lost in the general mayhem.As a dedicated tree hugger minus one very special specimen I am very sad.*Title borrowed from a German song by Alexandra \"Mein Freund Der Baum Ist Tot\"."},
{"title": "A  Do-Gooding Liberal Goes To The Pub.", "date": "Friday 13 November 2015", "text": "The first thing I heard was a woman’s loud voice: “ Oh, he’s gorgeous. What a lovely boy.” She went on and on in the same vein. “What a darling. Look at his beautiful eyes. Just look at them. Oh, you darling, you are a beauty, Here, let me cuddle you.” And more. “You are a sweetie, and so good. Isn’t he well-behaved”.I was sitting, on my own, at a corner table in the Church Inn in Ludlow, right hand stabbing at scampi, chips and salad, left hand holding my iPhone book.  I couldn’t see who this miracle creature was, but obviously the cutest thing on two legs. Two legs? Surely not, nobody makes as much fuss of a child. Besides, there’s always a ‘coo-chi-coo in it when there’s a baby involved. This creature was not being patronised, this creature was admired as a paragon and petted.Ah, petted. It had to be an animal, most probably a dog. The Church Inn allows dogs to come in. Children are allowed in too but  not quite as welcome. Finally, the woman stopped shouting and a couple came past my table, making for the exit. They had a large, rather stout and very hairy dog in tow.  He was indeed well-behaved and docile, his lead hanging fairly loose and all three of them relaxed. The waitress, for such she was, followed them for a few steps, stopping at a table opposite me. “He’s lovely,” she sighed and “isn’t he a big boy.”She had my full attention now that I could see her. Fortyish, a bit buxom, like all the best barmaids, dressed in tight-fitting black clothes, black boots, with dark abundant hair pinned back with combs. A real pub landlady.The table opposite me was occupied by a middle aged couple, having a sandwich lunch. They were clearly regulars, because the waitress appeared to know them.“I prefer them to children”, she offered. “You wouldn’t believe the kids that come in here sometimes.

The other day there was a kid who scribbled all over the table with his crayons. Would you believe it?”“I wouldn’t mind so much if they were regulars. No, they come in once and think they own the place. Think their kids can get away with murder. Tourists are the worst.” November is not tourist season, there was no danger that one of that particular breed of customer was within earshot. Ludlow depends very much on the tourist trade and it would never do to insult a tourist to his face.“Give me dogs any day\". She stopped for a minute to make sure she wasn’t offending the couple at the table. “Do you have children?” The couple shook their heads. “Right, you’re like me. I don’t have kids either, never wanted any. Dogs are less hassle any day.”“Actually,” she continued, in full flow once again, “I blame the parents. Do they stop the little darlings from creating havoc? Do they, heck. Not likely. It’s all - here her voice attempted a posh accent - 'do stop it, darling; don’t do that'. But they don’t really stop them. Bloody liberal do-gooders. \"Eh? I must have missed something. Where and when did liberal do-gooders come into the picture?“Bloody liberal do-gooders, that’s who I blame,” she continued. When I was naughty as a kid, I got a clip round the earhole and a smart smack on the back of my legs. Didn’t do me any harm. Nowadays, you’re not allowed to touch them.” The couple agreed with her and all three snorted in disgust.” No, give me dogs any day. No trouble, dogs.”All this time I kept my head well down and my eyes fixed to the screen of my phone but certainly no longer reading. Would the waitress recognise me for who I am when she saw me? A bloody do-gooding liberal? Finally, she turned away from the table opposite, came over to me and reached for my now empty plate.“Alright?” she asked in a mellow voice, and much reduced volume. “Everything alright Darling?” Weakly I nodded. “Yes thanks, lovely.”"},
{"title": "Kindness", "date": "Tuesday 10 November 2015", "text": "Even a person like me, often given to cynicism, runs up against unexpected kindness, both of friends and of strangers. “The Kindness of Strangers” is a lovely phrase, no wonder it was taken into the language with such enthusiasm. Tennessee Williams has Blanche DuBois say it at the end of “A Streetcar Named Desire”. In the play it is a very sad phrase, Blanche is a lonely, confused woman, broken and about to be taken into an institution; she has no real friends and the kindness of strangers she has experienced has been much in her imagination.Recently, Beloved and I have been shown much genuine kindness. Late yesterday afternoon was a case in point; I returned a friend’s call, who had phoned to offer to take Millie for a walk while were out. The friend had already gone out and come back home, but when I mentioned that Millie had been in the car with us all afternoon and had not had a walk, she said she’d take her out anyway, although it was getting dark by then. I was tired from driving and taking Beloved to see health professionals and very grateful for having this additional task lifted from my shoulders.Beloved now has a small army of personal carers visit him in the morning to get him ready for the day. They have little to do because he is quite independent again, but getting in and out of the bath can be tricky; they are professionals and know how to keep their charges safe. Their work can be unpleasant and stressful, they work long hours for minimal pay, yet each one of them is friendly, smiling and willing, full of good cheer and compassion. And, above all, common sense. Good old practical common sense allied with natural, abundant kindness. I wish there were a way for me to make those in power realise the goodness and worth of these people and see that their remuneration matched their qualities and labour.I had a day ‘off’ last week, to go into town and do some urgent shopping which had been neglected for months. I’d left Beloved with a lady from one of those charities that give the occasional respite to full-time carers - I was a little taken aback when I got home to find that she had left her own and Beloved’s washing up for me to do, but Beloved said she was a pleasant woman and he didn’t mind too much having her around during my absence. Anyway, she’s not the one who showed special kindness, that was left to a middle-aged woman on the park-and-ride bus back to the carpark where I’d left the car. As I entered the bus, laden with bags and parcels, scanning the interior for a vacant seat, this woman got up and offered me her seat near the door. I was fairly surprised, it’s never happened to me before but, reader, I took it. Perhaps the woman saw how exhausted I was. It was my first visit to town after being ill; something of my need for a rest must have been obvious to her and she simply got up and stepped into the crowded aisle before I had even got over my surprise and internal debate whether to accept her kindness. Sitting down felt enormously satisfying and I have every intention to do the same for an old lady the next time I feel able to stand on the bus.You might ask what the picture of a spider has to do with kindness? She was stuck in the bath this morning and I rescued her, but took her only as far as the outside window ledge from where I left her to find her own way home. She’s probably shinning up the drainpipe right now and climbing through the plug hole back into the bath."},

Those of you whose blogs are blind or non-existent and who have a no-reply-email-policy thank you anyway although there is no way I can get back to you. Perhaps you don’t expect me to?That lingering little virus I mentioned in my last post turned into a full-blown and very nasty chest infection, with lots of symptoms and unpleasant complications. It’s all over now and I am back in the land of the living. And sane. A high temperature plays havoc with your perception. If I hadn’t been so weak I’d have directed a serious rant at author David Nicholls for making the male protagonist of ‘US’ into a wet blanket whose family walks all over him. As it was I spent one whole night fuming and that even before I’d finished the book.  In the clear light of day - several days and a reduction in temperature later - I saw that my rage had been a tad misdirected.Apparently, it is a well known fact that carers succumb to illness the moment the cared-for recovers and that is exactly what happened to me. Good old NHS. I was a costly and labour-intensive patient for more than three weeks and all tests and treatments came free. I wasn’t even charged for plentiful sympathy from all health practitioners involved!A funny thing happened. One of the complications was that I became intolerant of the prescribed brand of antibiotics. I turned spotty and red all over. You could have used me as a beacon in the red-light district! Guaranteed to brighten the gloomiest dive!Beloved is lots better. Had he not recovered as well as he has after his dreadful spring and summer he’d have had to go into respite care. None of our many (six) assorted children offered any assistance at all; I am not really surprised, they all live a great distance away and lead busy professional lives. The solution for us was to pay for help; luckily, finances allow us to do that and we shall keep it that way. It’s so much easier to tell an employee what you want them to do than to ask family for favours.The only creature in the house who benefitted from the situation was Millie. Almost daily kind friends and neighbours took her for hour long walks; she enjoyed gorgeous autumn weather while I could only gaze longingly out of the window at splendid hazy mornings and sunny afternoons. The picture above was taken on one such morning, when there were still leaves on the trees and the hillside opposite was draped in floating mists.2015. I want it hung, drawn and quartered and any remains burnt on a funeral pyre and scattered to the four winds. When I mentioned that I can’t wait to be shot of it somebody said “Don’t, you’re wishing your life away.” Absolutely true. But there have been days since May when I would gladly have swapped non-existence for the frightening and miserable times we endured."},

Beloved and I have had no enjoyment of summer at all; a whole barrowload of problems has seen to that. And when his problems lessened came the tailend: first I fell over, then I came down with a sudden cough and bronchitis which are lingering. Cough medicine on an empty stomach made me feel nauseous. Resourceful as I am, I thought to make myself sick with a finger down my throat. The resultant dry heaving was not only extremely painful, it also set off a bout of AFib. Once again, resourcefulness was called upon: I took a double dose of my beta blockers, paracetamol and a tranquilliser (Oxford spelling - I just looked it up!) right away, and the ordinary dose at the regular time. Whenever I tell a doctor they present a short intake of breath, and mumble: “some cocktail”. Anyway, it worked.I have written about nothing but doctors and ailments and our general physical decrepitude for weeks. And even that only very intermittently. No wonder followers are leaving in droves. (I can’t be bothered to find out who you are - so no repercussions.) Thank you to all who have stayed with me, sent good wishes and wrote lovely comments. It feels good to know that one is not alone when the going gets tough and that others too have experience of sad times.I am trying to make gardening easier. Removing clumps of herbaceous perennials I often come across co-residents, as this frog. He hopped away from me when my fork came a bit too close for his liking but he jumped no more than a couple of feet, there staying stock-still and posing for my camera. I encourage these fellows, in their capacity of slug police they cannot be faulted.For several months a rumour has haunted Valley’s End that our favourite doctor, the one who saved our lives during the recent calamity, is about to retire. One chap had him taking up a job delivering BMWs, somebody else said there was general short-livedness in the doctors’ family and he was going to retire to enjoy whatever time he had left; yet another person had it for definite that the doctor’s wife had killed herself and he just couldn’t get over it. And more, each reason more outlandish and far fetched.I can’t be doing with rumours, I need facts. At the end of the last consultation with him, we had the following conversation:Me : “What on earth are we going to do without you?Doc., laughing: “Nobody is indispensable”.Me: “O yes, you are. You are too valuable for us to lose you. You are the only one who takes the time to explain things. Besides, you aren’t old enough to leave.”Doc., laughing again : “well, I will be 60 at my next birthday. But leave? Not as far as I know. Who says?”Me :”There’s a strong rumour doing the rounds that you are about to leave, even worse, that you are leaving before the end of the year.”Doc. “Leave? I’ve already booked a holiday for the rest of this year and put in a holiday request for next year. So it might seem that I’m keen on holidays but I’m not retiring just yet.”Beloved, heaving a great sigh of relief,: “Right, so I can be sick for a bit longer.”Laughter all round.Who comes up with such drivel? How does the rumour mill function? Who sets it off? Many patients have been going from person to person, doing the ‘between you, me and the bedpost’ dance, upsetting many others. As soon as I am told anything ‘in the strictest confidence’ I know I am being but a cog in the rumour machine, expected to spread the word.Well, no. Find another muggins."},

Sinking onto her couch. snuggling down under thick, fluffy towels, lulled by softly indeterminate music, I gave myself over to bliss!We hadn’t seen each other for months, we had a lot to catch up on. Not exactly the ideal way to spend an hour’s facial treatment, but we are fond of each other. Helen sees me as something like an auntie, or maybe a mum substitute and I am very happy for her to open up to me, and I have sometimes got a blog post out of her.This time she had a tale about her two boys. Her flamboyant daughter is a budding actress and singer, gone off to find fame and fortune. The boys are fourteen and eighteen, and live at home. Lately, Bryn, the fourteen year old, has been walking around with his chin scraping the floor. His girlfriend just finished with him. Her mum doesn’t allow her to go out on weekdays; as they also live more than 10 miles apart and go to different schools, young love does not have an easy ride. Bryn is heartbroken. Helen is sympathetic, “I am sorry it’s not working out,” she said, “but what can be done?\" Thinking she’d cheer him up by offering him a present she said: \" What can I do to make you feel better?”, expecting him to ask for some digital gadget, money for an outing or a new pair of trainers; Bryn’s reply was: “Mum, could you have me transferred to my girlfriend’s school?” At fourteen true love runs deep!Now, Liam, the other boy, at eighteen, has no girlfriend and has never had one. With Bryn’s despondency on her mind she got hold of Liam at a quiet moment. “Poor Bryn,” she started out, “he’s got it bad. What about you? Isn’t it time you told me about your girlfriend/s?”“Me mum? What would I do with girlfriends? I don’t want a girlfriend. She’d only get in the way for rugby or football. Besides, my mates wouldn’t like me mooning after some girl, when we’re out clubbing.” (I always thought the point of going out clubbing [known as dancing in my time] was to get closer to the opposite sex?)  Apparently, Liam is a keen party animal and an even greater sports fanatic, belonging to a number of clubs and frequently playing at away matches and competitions. It seems that neither activity has so far brought him into contact with a suitable love object. I wonder what will happen when he finally does fall?Come to think of it, their sister, the actress, is still gloriously unencumbered at twenty one. What is wrong with the little one? Perhaps he got the other two’s share of romantic muscle?"},
{"title": "Nine Lives", "date": "Monday 14 September 2015", "text": "So here we are, almost back to normal. A bit thinner, a bit greyer, a bit chastened, a bit the worse for wear, but alive and thinking of making elderberry wine. Beloved and Millie, carefully and slowly, went down to the big elder tree in the field to check on this year’s berries and yes, there’s an abundant crop waiting to be picked. With lots left for the birds. Best get on with it then.One lifetime is not enough. We spend the first years learning to pick ourselves up after a tumble, doing our sums and letters, making best friends today and pulling each other’s hair out the next. When we stop crying and running to mum because the world does not turn at our command new problems arise. We fall in love. First love is always painful. Exhilarating, exciting, deeply disturbing, and always painful. Once we get the hang of this strange emotion, and love follows love, we settle down. Sometimes just for a stretch, or sometimes for life. Now problems come in tiny packages which, by and by, grow larger, bringing bigger problems. This is the long and arduous period when we are wholly preoccupied with earning a crust, raising the next generation and looking after the previous one.There’s little time to sit back and think who we are and what we might have been put on this earth for.Then we reach sixty. It has taken us all this time to grow up, to see sense, to stop being foolish, to choose peace over the endless treadmill of duties, obligations, commitments; actually, sixty might be a little optimistic, many of us are still running on the hamster’s wheel well beyond sixty.The first health niggles appear, joints are not as flexible as they once were and we become familiar with the doctor’s surgery; we are on first name terms with the receptionist, and the aches and pains we used to take to mum we now take to the practice nurse.Soon enough we’re old, in second childishness and mere oblivion, sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.*And before this happens is where I’d ask for another lifetime. Not to start again from the beginning. Certainly not. Have all that hassle over again? No thank you. But building on the experiences of a lifetime, having learned from mistakes and gained peace of mind and serenity in daily dealings, that’s what I want. No ailments, either; let them stay away. At a stroke short-termism would be done away with. We (and that includes politicians who only ever plan for the short period they find themselves in office) could finally get down to  fulfilling our dreams; there’s time to achieve everything we once strove for, everything that got buried in busyness. We could lie in the grass on a summer’s night, look up to the stars, remember the early promises and make them come true. After all, there’s world enough and time, finally. ** And because we have done our duty and are done with it, we can do what we always wanted to do: Make A Difference. *'The seven ages of man’  Shakespeare** “To his coy mistress’  Andrew Marvell"},
{"title": "HELP! How do I find back to", "date": "Wednesday 2 September 2015", "text": "MYSELF?I am full of admiration for people who do what I’ve been doing for just the past four months for years, people who are forced into it for the long haul, until such time as death-in-life itself resolves the problem. An ending in terror seems much preferable to me than a terror without end. And don’t tell me that one gets used to it. Of course one does, one gets used to anything, or so they say. But at what cost? Being ground to dust between the millstones of fear and anger, exhaustion and jaw-clenching determination to see it through, leaves no room for the joy of living consciously.How do you do it? How do you retain a sense of yourself when life itself seems to be suspended?For me, the worst is over. In place of fear of the future there is now a void, a hole where this all encompassing feeling of frantic helplessness is slowly seeping away like a trickle of water in the sand. You’ve been holding your breath, every fibre of your being has been directed towards survival; when it’s over, you stand there wondering who and what you were before. Before and After. Before and After. The Before has been lost and the After is as yet a nebulous concept.It’s funny, but when I myself was on the edge between living and not living I was never aware of losing myself. Perhaps one only does that when one is fighting for the continued existence of another person? Perhaps one ‘knows’ that one is not going to die, at least not yet? Not now?Whatever it is, I think that it’s easier to cope with personal catastrophe than someone else’s, a loved one’s, catastrophe.I am selfish enough to want ‘ME’ back, in capital letters. No doubt, since that famous 'corner has been turned’ I shall be able to dig deep and resurrect remnants of myself;  I don’t know what the future holds but I may not ever feel quite as overwhelmed and powerless as I did during the past four months. Acceptance may be the answer, acceptance and trusting to a sense of survival.I may be around a bit more again. Blogging, trite as it may be to some, offers a kind of release from the daily grind and can lead out of oneself into the wider world."},
{"title": "Up and Down. . . . .", "date": "Thursday 27 August 2015", "text": "....up and down, that’s how it goes.A bit more up than down just now, although I have long lost count of the number of times I’ve wailed :“Will this nightmare never end?”Every time I think, “yessss, we’re getting there!” something new and unexpected happens. Would you believe me when I tell you that Beloved took to falling out of his bed every night for about a week? I am glad to say he’s decided to stop and stay in bed rather than go-crawl-about on the floor, running into the dog sleeping on her bed along the way and settling down for a little cuddle, before having another go at heaving himself up by painfully and laboriously clinging to any piece of furniture he was finding himself next to. He insisted that he’d fallen on his head once or twice; I should have believed him right away, he was silly enough for that to be true. On one occasion he went to bed with a bit of food stuck in a molar, he said; nothing would dislodge it, not flossing, sucking nor poking with a toothpick. But falling out of bed did it, he said; it was the first thing he noticed on landing on the floor.Falling out of bed he hurt himself, scraping the skin on his shoulders, his neck (aha, he must have landed on his head!) and arms. creating small wounds, which bled and necessitated visits by district nurses to patch him up. District nurses are confident, capable, competent and friendly in a matter-of-fact way people; I am very grateful for their services. Unfortunately, they also tend to boss you around and refer you to all sorts of other services. We are now well and truly part of the ranks of the great unwashed, needy and vulnerable, who are considered to require the aid of untold agencies and their representatives. The trouble is, they all need to ‘assess’ us and our case and that takes time. Form-filling is a tedious occupation - more so for the ‘filled-in’ than the 'filler-inner’ - but it obviously pays their rent. I shouldn’t say that, they are all so earnest and well-meaning and I should just be thankful and shut up but I’ve always hated being patronised. But the young tend to do that, don’t they? So does anyone in the field of social care. I can only assume that most of their ‘clients’ are beyond working things out for themselves.There’s another reason I should be grateful just now. Yesterday week ago I took a bad tumble on a mossy and damp part of the drive and really badly hurt myself all down my right side, ribs, shoulder, leg and ankle. Bruised ribs and a swollen leg don’t make for agility or even basic mobility. I could barely care for myself, much less Beloved. Isn’t it always so, once you’re in deep doodoo, something happens and the doodoo becomes a giant midden! The pain is less now but I still can’t walk Millie. You should see me getting in and out of the bath! Bare bottom on Beloved’s newly acquired bath board, gently swinging first one leg then the other up and over, feet anchored on the bath mat and, ‘Houston, we have lift-off!’ Except lift-off is perhaps too strong a word for my slow ascent to verticality (? is that a word?).We now have a piece of paper stuck to the front door, inviting all and sundry to Ring the bell and come in. Door open. It takes ages for me to get to the front door or the landline phone so callers of either description might as well make use of this policy. Just as well we have few axe murderers in Valley’s End. And nobody carries a gun around with them either.The first district nurse who called on Beloved after I had hurt myself commiserated by saying :”At least you don’t have the time to sit down for long,” implying that limping around on a stick was a better remedy for my aches and bruises and swollen knee than putting my feet up in relative comfort.Ah well, there’s compassion in the world after all.The only creature benefitting from all this is Millie; she’s never had so much exercise. Her social life is increasing faster than mine is decreasing, and that’s saying something, since mine has already dwindled to nil. Millie has acquired lots of new best friends, all willing to take the ‘poor dog’ walkies.And Beloved is getting better too."},

Caregivers rarely use it and the one receiving care never utters it. ‘Being a burden’ is a harsh phrase, unkind and heartless. No one needing care does so for selfish reasons and should not be made to feel guilty.Occasionally, Beloved looks at me and sighs “What a useless burden I am to you.”  I mutter something soothing and give his bony shoulders a quick hug. What else can I do? Being a caregiver is not something I find easy to do, but I (and millions of others) have no choice. If the person you love needs help, you give it freely.“I dislike burdens, said Juanand at my back I often hear Time’s winged chariot changing gear.” *Quite so.When you are waiting for time to pass it seems to stand still.

Well and good. But tell me, when you are old and decrepit and quite useless how will you get to the hills? By taxi maybe?

But if life throws you a nasty one, right between the legs when you were least expecting it and the bugger just won’t go away, tripping you up over and over again?Give me routine, I cry.(Actually, Pace all you adherents of Sufi teachings out there, - I am not making fun of you, but does sitting, meditating and giving birth to wise words on a loop  not in itself smack of some kind of routine?)No, Joyce Carol Oates’ words are much more to my liking.“The domestic lives we live - which may be accidental, or not entirely of our making - help to make possible our writing lives; our imaginations are freed, or stimulated, by the very prospect of companionship, quiet, a predictable and consoling routine.”I couldn’t agree more.Since Beloved fell ill my creative juices have entirely dried up, shrivelled and shrunk to the size and consistency of tiny mouse droppings, too small to leave much of a visible trace. You’d think that I’d pounce on the hours he sleeps during the day, when I am not on duty, but the spiritual wherewithal is lacking, all I find is a heap of dust. Aristotle says:\" we are what we repeatedly do”. At present I repeatedly do nothing worth the mention, except yearn for an uninterrupted night’s sleep.Give me the comfort of surrendering to life on autopilot for all mundane, everyday tasks; make the day predictable in all unimportant aspects.

So he decided to get up, go down to the kitchen and make himself a cup of tea instead. By the time he sat at the kitchen table enjoying it, Beloved was still playing with the idea of being Napoleon.“Don’t be silly”, he said to me when I stared at him, hard, to find out if he had been hallucinating again, “it was just a dream, a real dream”.  Hm, I’m not so sure. Who, in their right mind, would dream themselves into being Napoleon in need of a cup of coffee? ‘In their right mind’ being the phrase that sticks out the most.If I don’t get back to some blogging I’ll never restart. I can see how people simply drop the habit. If you haven’t posted for a while, the ‘not-posting’ becomes the habit, and if, like me, you have little to say because life is just too boring and dreary and confined to your own four walls, then posting about nothing much becomes embarrassing. I know that lots of bloggers keep going with pictures, or quotes, or the minutiae of the daily round, and that these bloggers remain popular and find plenty of commenters, but that’s not for me. Each to their own. The enjoyment of writing a post I would want to read myself matters to me.Beloved’s mind is almost back to normal, I’d say a good 85% of what he says makes perfect sense. His sense of humour is back too. Physically he is less good. The consensus is that medication was indeed the cause of this mental and physical collapse and that it will take at least 2 to 3 months for him to recover. We’ve ‘done’ 5 weeks now. Every Friday is ticked off on the calendar as ‘another week gone’. Keeping him mentally stimulated is getting increasingly difficult. I’m running out of ideas. I’d asked some friends and acquaintances to pop in for an occasional chat but, with the exception of just one or two, nobody seems willing. Perhaps they are afraid that it might be hard work? Who knows.I did take him to a couple of live performances, Shakespeare’s 'Comedy of Errors' and the medieval morality play ‘Everyman'. He thought the former play too silly for words and Everyman too much of a raised forefinger kind of preachy play. Quite. At least I tried. He’s threatened to come to Stratford next Wednesday for a performance of Ben Jonson's ‘Volpone’. Wonder what he’ll have to say about that. As it’s a comedy about a sly old man playing off wannabe heirs against each other it might make him think a bit.I do what I always used to do during times when life was fraught with difficulties: I read. Every spare moment you’ll find me escaping into invented lives in a book. Even gardening is losing its appeal. I walk along the untidy paths, see the hugely overgrown beds, the rampant weeds and sigh. If only I could kick myself into some healthy activity. From your comments I know that many of you have experienced the not only exhausting, but also deadly dull routine of a carer. In spite of my whining, I realise that I am lucky, at least there will be an end to my labours, Beloved will recover. I cannot imagine what it’s like to take care of a loved one for whom the outlook is bleak.However, not all the news is bad: Millie’s had a bath and a thorough grooming session and whichever one of us she honours with her close proximity no longer sniffs the air and asks: “what IS that smell?”"},

I’m no Florence Nightingale - come to think of it, my track record compares favourably to hers, at least my patient is still alive whereas most of hers died - but there’s no point getting impatient with someone whose mind has gone walkabout, no matter how tired you are.Oh yes, he had another adventure: driving an old banger on Top Gear. It was terrifying, he said. Still, at least that was a bit nearer home than fighting in the Russian Revolution.I won’t be able to catch up with all your comments. I’ll have to start afresh.

And afterwards he went to the shop for some bread and milk for us. I think I have found another treasure even if he can neither work as hard nor as fast as Old Gardener.My thanks to everybody who has sent such kind comments to my tale of woe. Beloved is improving but there is still a way to go before he gets back to his old self, if ever. It is now almost certain that he had a somewhat rare adverse reaction to at least two of the medications; he should never have been told to continue with them when the effects became noticeable and I first took him back to the surgery. The Diagnostic Unit has plans for one more test, a head CT in the next week or so. Doctors don’t often commit themselves but two of them have now pointed the finger at prescribed medication being the culprit.Life is utterly boring now, I am not a terribly graceful nurse; besides, I am exhausted. But needs must and I do so want my dear Beloved back that I spare no effort to this end.I’ll be back fully in bogland as soon as I can. Until then be patient with me and kind."},
{"title": "Black Clouds - Delirium minus Tremens", "date": "Wednesday 24 June 2015", "text": "Sorry for being away for so long without an explanation. Do you know the feeling of holding your breath in fear and trepidation? For days on end? Beloved not quite, but almost out of the blue, became very ill with Delirium. I’d never heard the word before, except possibly in the context of the adjective “deliriously” happy;  in his case neither love nor drink were to blame. The problem is that there is still no cause to get hold of. If you have a cause, an underlying illness, then you cure the illness and thereby cure the condition.It all started quite inoffensively with a tendency to fall asleep during the day, at any time, and staying asleep for hours. A bit strange, but nothing really to worry about, I thought; that’s what old men do. He was still himself in all other respects, perhaps a bit more forgetful than normal, a bit more absent-minded, but sweet and funny and even-tempered. It’s not exactly stimulating to watch someone sleep but there you are, if you can do nothing about it, you put up with it. After all, he was doing no harm. I thought. And it also gave me plenty of spare time to read and garden and pet the dog.The need to sleep got worse and then he started to wake at night. Several times I found him dressed and drinking tea in the kitchen at three am. Still no cause for alarm, although this was really out of the ordinary. A mild worry surfaced. I know, I AM stupid. But I knew enough to see a doctor. I’d also worked out that the beginning of this strange period coincided with some new medication, three lots of new medication. Not in place of other medication, no, on top of other medication. What in the name of sanity do these doctors hope to cure with their ready prescription pads? Old age?“Oh fine”, she said, “let’s stop one of them and see if that makes any difference.” Surely she must have realised that I was describing the symptoms of Delirium?Now Beloved became confused enough to swap day for night, seriously disorientated and distressed when he couldn’t work out the simplest things. He also developed an amazingly active night life. He got up and got dressed because he had a film session booked - they were highly lucrative and not to be missed back in the day -, he was involved in the Russian Revolution, fighting on the side of the goodies by building a tramway up to the dock gates in St Petersburg - unfortunately he had to flee because the baddies caught up with him; he stayed at the Bridge Hotel where he was attending a conference and someone had left a turd in the corridor; when he saw me in the upstairs hall (in real life) he asked “do you have a room booked here too?” Another night he was running away from home, goodness knows what age he thought himself to be. And once he was in Sydney, Australia, at the Opera House, having to study an enormously difficult piece of music and being offered assistance by Australian pilots. First he welcomed their help, then realised that they too were baddies and he had to eliminate them. (I never trusted these Australians, you know).There were many more of these vivid dreams, all very complex and making perfect sense; except they were fantasies.And through it all, when he wasn’t asleep or showing signs of distressing confusion, he remained even-tempered and friendly, sweet and gentle, and when he managed to articulate complete sentences he spoke in his own, old-fashioned voice. Once I asked him if he knew where he was. “Not with any degree of certainty,” was the answer. My poor old thing. I was frantic with worry and fear.Beloved had lost the plot but now I was on the case. We saw a new doctor who instantly struck several medications off the list, arranged for blood tests and X-rays, evaluated and assessed and became determined to solve the puzzle. He rang first thing in the morning and last thing at night, for several days running, showing quite extraordinary devotion to his patient. Still, no clear explanation emerged. Except possibly the medication.Tomorrow we are visiting a special diagnostic clinic which will run further tests; perhaps they’ll come up with the solution.In the meantime, for the last two days, Beloved has shown marked improvement. He is weary and weak, but seems to be back inside himself again; there’s someone 'at home' again. He still sleeps, but now to recover his strength rather than simply as a symptom of Delirium. He’s not completely aware of what happened and how frightening it was for me. Another good thing is that he has regained his appetite, which was pretty much non-existent for a while. Eating and drinking have become a pleasure rather than a chore to be got through with great reluctance.Naturally, everything else has been on hold; all social engagements have been cancelled and I’ve hardly even felt the pain in my hip.Wish us luck for tomorrow."},
{"title": "A Man's A Man For A' That", "date": "Saturday 13 June 2015", "text": "taken from the bailey looking up the valleyK. has been a neighbour for several years. We meet walking our dogs, K. has a lovely collie called Sam; Millie can take or leave Sam, but she adores K. She and I were halfway up the hill when she spotted K. below us in the meadow by the river and down she raced to make a fuss of him and have him make a fuss of her.K. is a strange chap, lives on his own, is extremely hard up and spends most of his time - up to 8 hours a day - making wood carvings with a religious theme. He is self taught and tells me he has never sold a piece. Beloved and I knew that he suffers from depression, we have had long talks with him (I have given him wood for his fire from the garden and once or twice I’ve paid him to look after Millie; he terminated the arrangement, not me. I’d have been happy to employ him as an occasional dog sitter), these talks have been on the doorstep, his or ours, and in the field, never in the house before.When he saw me on the hillside he climbed up, Sam and Millie following.After a desultory exchange about the weather and “haven't seen you around for a while and how are you?” K. laughed his strangely strangled laugh and said he would love to find himself a partner. “Oh yes?”, I said. “Yes, but all the single women in Valley’s End are lesbians; “. He continued, \"I was thinking what a nice woman J. is but then Hen told me that J. is a lesbian. Hen is a lesbian, Trish is a lesbian, Jane is a lesbian . . . . .\"It’s true, considering the size of Valley’s End, we have perhaps a disproportionately high number  of lesbian and gay neighbours. Safety in numbers? Although that is surely hardly necessary nowadays. Maybe I’m a bit slow on the uptake but I didn’t consider being a lesbian (or gay man, for that matter) any kind of bar to making friends.“Yes, but I don’t want a friend, I want a partner.” K. continued, “but then I’m probably asking too much anyway.” He began to count off on his fingers the qualities he required in a woman. “She’s got to be a good cook, she’s got to like opera, she needs to be into art, she needs to be able to put up with me. . . . ““Aha,” I said, not being particularly tactful, “and what can you offer in return?”K. choked. “Sweet eff. all”, he said. I’m no good at anything, haven’t a penny to my name, and I certainly wouldn’t want to put up with me.”I suggested he might like to try and make friends first and to that end I invited him to “come on, come with me and have a cup of tea; we’ll wake Beloved from his afternoon nap and chat.” K. was very keen instantly, and I’d had enough of standing on a windy hillside by that time.Like many lonely and solitary people K. turned out to be a great talker. After he’d admitted that he wished they’d lessen with the years, we dropped the subject of his amorous needs, and he suddenly quoted the beginning of T S Eliot’s Ash WednesdayBecause I do not hope to turn againBecause I do not hopeBecause I do not hope to turnDesiring this man's gift and that man's scopeI no longer strive to strive towards such things(Why should the aged eagle stretch its wings?)Why should I mournThe vanished power of the usual reign?and from there it was but a short step to a discussion of singing and music, (K. has had training as an opera singer), poetry in general and T S Eliot in particular, drama, the arts, etc.“There,” I said, “you have a lot to offer, even if you have no money. In a place like Valley’s End you find many people with tastes similar to yours. What about joining a choir, for a start? Or a drama group?” I wasn’t quite ready to invite him to join our poetry group.“No, I couldn’t”, he said. “I have been told that I have an excellent voice - (true, he is a powerful baritone) - I wouldn’t really fit in with any local choirs or drama groups. Besides, they wouldn’t want me.”And then the flood gates opened. “I don’t fit in anywhere.” He quoted Philip Larkin’s ’This Be The Verse’ which startsThey fuck you up, your mum and dad. / They may not mean to, but they do. / They fill you with the faults they had / And add some extra, just for you.  K. is 61 years old and still chewing over the hurts and grievances of childhood and youth, still craving the love he believes he didn’t get as a child.  It is the common story, self-destructive and a barrier to living a full, independent life.His background is totally uncultured, his parents and siblings are working class people with no pretensions to being anything else, content with their lot. They haven’t read a poem or a book in all their lives. He left as soon as he could for London and education. He did college courses in various subjects, trained as a singer, earning a precarious living in his spare time. “But I couldn’t finish any of the courses,” he said, “ I even did half a Masters in arboriculture. But I ended up in an office, which I hated. I absolutely hated it.” K. began to drink. And carried on drinking for years. He finally hit absolute rock bottom, which is when he ‘was saved’, found religion of a sort and joined AA . He seemed still amazed at what he found there. He said “There were all these people, drunks like me, but they were sober now and jolly, clean and smartly dressed, with jobs and a purpose in life; they didn’t need drink to get them through the day anymore.”He talked for over an hour, occasionally close to tears. The main impression I had, and still have, is that he needs to find a reason for his years of self destruction and he finds this reason not within himself but in others, his family and circumstances.  In other words, he blames others. He appears to be totally lacking in self confidence at the same time as having unrealistic schemes of making his carvings count for something in the art world by approaching religious bodies, incl. the Vatican.If only K. could learn the truth of Robert Burns' famous lines which say that wealth, or lack of it, and social class should not be the measure of a man’s true worth.A Man’s A Man For A’ ThatIf he gave himself half a chance K. could be that Man."},
{"title": "Wishlist", "date": "Wednesday 10 June 2015", "text": "Castle MoatIt’s summer, it’s June and therefore double birthday month at Castle Moat. A pair of Geminis for those who attach importance to such matters.“So, what do you want for your birthday? Anything you can think of?”“Hm, what about you? Is there something you’d really like?”A perennial problem, one which we rarely solve. There was a time when Beloved bought me jewellery. Gold one year, amber another, jet from Whitby a third. Silver, pearls, a not terribly precious stone or two, rings, bracelets, necklaces, ear rings. I enjoyed them and wore them when the occasion arose. I hardly ever wear jewellery now. In fact, when I look at individual pieces I wonder who in the family, or more likely, among my friends, might be glad to have it.Clothes too, a silk blouse, a cashmere jumper, stuff I don’t wear often because I can’t be bothered with frequent dry-cleaning. In London things were different, with a dry cleaner in walking distance and your cellophane wrapped item speedily returned. In the country it takes a week and costs a fortune. Besides, when would I wear really smart clothes? Gardening and dog walking demand jeans and a fleece to cover the t-shirt.What about perfume? Nina Ricci’s L’Air du Temps was my favourite for years and I frequently found a pretty bottle on the breakfast table on the big day. I still use perfume occasionally, but so seldom, that I have a whole untouched bottle waiting to be broached in my dressing table drawer. (Heavens, that antique dressing table was a present once.)Hawthorn BlossomThe dressing table came when we hit on the idea of joint presents, after all, our birthdays are within two days of each other. A small piece of antique furniture, or a non-essential household item, a beautiful bowl, or a painting. Something decorative. (I hate ‘practical’ presents, I hate ‘useful’ presents). Something we could both equally enjoy.Now our house is full of stuff which we would love to pass on to an appreciative recipient, we are certainly not in the market to add to it. We look at our acquisitions and wonder “ would X like it?\"Wild Orchid in the FieldWe bought each other books galore, music CDs too. Now we mainly read ebooks and listen to digital music. That leaves the choice of vouchers for digital downloads. How romantic is that? For a while, we bought the more expensive bottles, a crate of French vintage wine or an oak-aged single malt. True, we still like a glass of wine and Beloved will have a glass of whiskey on cold winter nights, but an ordinary wine will do now. We never finish a bottle at one sitting and letting a good wine stew in the bottle for days on end is a crime against Bacchus. Beloved has also finally admitted that single malts do nothing for him and he much prefers an ordinary Scotch. Laburnum hanging over the Back Wall covered in Red Valerianand long fronds of honeysuckle waiting to bloom.What remains? Can you think of anything? A good meal at a nice restaurant is always an option, but we do that anyway when we feel like it. Our needs and wishes have shrunk dramatically and those few things which could be deemed special and worthy of present-giving are within reach any day. Should I wait for that book, the silk shirt, the box of hand-made truffles until my birthday or buy it for myself now, while I feel like it?What to do? What do you do? When I asked Beloved just now he said “I can’t think of a single thing that would give me more pleasure than for us to have a nice day, maybe have a special bite to eat and lift a glass in a toast to us and our pleasant life together.”Lovely man, if a bit unimaginative.I won’t even get a bunch of flowers. There are untold bunches to be gathered in the garden right now, all of them more beautiful than artificially bred, stiff-necked, one size fits all supermarket arrangements, irradiated for long life.Hold on a minute, though. I’ve just thought of something I really want: a cottage on the coast in Germany. And while we’re at it, how about a small flat in London for those hard to reach theatre visits? Not asking too much, am I? Oh yes, and a chauffeur to drive me from one to the other. And a housekeeper to take care of things while I’m away living in one of my several abodes.There you are, I knew I would come up with something if I thought long and hard enough."},

{"title": "Sinister and Dexter", "date": "Thursday 4 June 2015", "text": "Laburnum in JuneGood foot is still needed to go to heaven, but bad foot going to hell is already miles better; it was ever thus, the road to perdition is so much less stony than the way to heavenly bliss. It was sheer bliss limping to the theatre, though. First to a Live Screening of the National Theatre's performance of Shaw’s Man And Superman and then to Stratford and the Royal Shakespeare Company’s Merchant Of Venice. No two plays could be more different.  The Merchant with its ‘Bond of Flesh’ plot is truly sinister. It’s a disturbing story, even today, more than 500 years after Shakespeare wrote it  - or perhaps particularly today when anti-semitism appears to be on the rise again.  Suffice it to say that neither the Jew nor the Christians come out anything other than morally obnoxious.The stage at the end of the play, taken from the front row.(We are very fortunate, Jeremy being disabledgets us excellent seats at reduced prices)Synopsis:-  In the melting pot of Venice, trade is God. With its ships plying the globe, the city opens its arms to all - as long as they come prepared to do business and there is profit to be made.When the gold is flowing all is well - but when a contract between Bassanio and Shylock is broken, simmering racial tensions boil over.A wronged father, and despised outsider, Shylock looks to exact the ultimate price for a deal sealed in blood.Shaw’s Man And Superman is a sharp comedy, philosophical musing and surreal drama, a philosophical comedy of manners, if such a thing exists. A bearded Ralph Fiennes was excellent as John Tanner, who unwillingly accepts guardianship of a sly and manipulative young woman who is out to snare him in marriage. Fiennes rolls across the stage, slightly bent and swaying, apparently propelled by the fountain of his own words. Never once did he falter - there are over 57,000 words in the play and the majority of those are spoken by its intensely loquacious anti-hero. The play lasted the best part of four hours; I was never bored and laughed like a drain.I have a new crush: it’s Ralph Fiennes; he may be ageing and his hair may be thinning but his triumphant vigour and versatility, not to mention the perfect delivery of his lines, have won me over. It is so refreshing to be able to understand each word; TV actors mumble and stumble through their lines as if they’re ashamed of them.Finally, let me recommend to all of you who are interested in theatre (and now, opera) to make use of Live Screenings if you have the chance. Most of us can’t get to London, Stratford, Glyndebourne, or even New York - the Met does transmissions - but many of us can see performances locally at vastly reduced cost. The recordings are for the archives, so the actors are on top form. Performances feel intense, you know that all around the world people are watching the same show as you. And as you are seeing the show on a big screen  instead of from a cheap seat at the back of the Stalls, you have the added thrill of being the first to notice a  fluffed line or an actor corpsing.We’re off to ‘Julius Cesar’ tonight, which won’t be a bundle of laughs."},
{"title": "Sod’s Law", "date": "Saturday 30 May 2015", "text": "I’m sure I’ve done a post with a similar title at least once before; Sod’s Law is universal, it chucks its brickbats indiscriminately at all and sundry.Some years ago I broke my ankle; we were going on holiday and interrupted the journey to give our then dog, Boris, a pee stop on a pretty picnic site. The grass had been freshly cut and a large heap of clippings had been dropped down an embankment, which lead into some woods. A perfect place for a dog to empty himself, I thought. Boris thought so too. He made off down the slope into the woods, me following. And slipping on the clippings.An ambulance came and instead of going on holiday I went into hospital, where a lot of metal was nailed in place to mend the ankle.Some months ago this ankle began to feel rather stiff; not madly painful, just uncomfortable. Eventually I saw an orthopaedic surgeon who said other than operate and take out the assorted pins, plates and nails there was little to be done. Not an ideal solution, to my mind. It would take another lot of plaster and weeks of recovering mobility. He was a lovely Indian doctor, young, handsome and keen to do something for me, so, after feeling all around the ankle, studying the x-ray, playing a game of push and shove, twist and turn with my foot, he metaphorically scratched his head, sighed, and asked would I be happy to see a physiotherapist and do some exercises. Large deep brown eyes implored me to say yes and make him feel that he hadn’t failed his patient.So then I went to see the physiotherapist, another young man, this time with sweet blue eyes. He too fiddled about with foot and ankle and came up with no other solution than to give me some exercises to do.By now ankle and foot had recovered a bit anyway - or perhaps the weather had changed and dried up enough to ease the rheumatics - so I forgot about the exercises until, about two weeks ago, I saw the sheet of paper still lying on the hall table at the bottom of the stairs. One of the exercises uses steps so I had a quick go, whipping my foot up and down on the bottom stair. Ten times. It pulled a bit.By the next day I was in agony; the ankle was fine but my hip was on fire. For two weeks I have been limping and cursing, using a stick to propel myself forwards and clinging to chairs and tables and sofas, praying for the paradise of mobility regained.The hip is easing, finally. There’s been no gardening and only the most abbreviated dog walking. If it hadn’t been so very painful I’d have laughed."},
{"title": "If there’s a word for it", "date": "Monday 25 May 2015", "text": "it must be true.I may be an ‘Episodic’, not a ‘Diachronic’.*Standing in front of the mirror wearing a spring neckline, i.e. lower than a winter-up-to-the-chin neckline, I saw a faded scar running in a big arc just under my collar bone,  like a thin-lipped but wide smile. I had forgotten every word about it. Every so often doctors ask me about my medical history; although this was a particularly traumatic experience I have omitted to mention it for years. I clean forgot everything about it.I am not an amnesiac. I have a past, like any other human and I have a fairly normal amount of factual (and imagined) knowledge about it. But I don’t see myself as a product of this past, having arrived in a continuous stream of experiences at the point I find myself today. Looking back over my life, I find episodes that resemble rooms; each one with its own furniture of comfort and discomfort, pain and pleasure, heartache and joy. But each room has a door which is firmly shut and I have no feeling that I have passed from one to the other.Since I started this blog I have delved into the past and resurrected  it. But the child I wrote about is not the younger self of me today, nor is the young girl who came to the UK and found squalor and tawdriness my direct antecedent. Factually, that is nonsense, of course, but to me my life feels real only now, during my current ‘episode’. As it felt real during each of the preceding episodes. But, as soon as each episode came to its natural end, so did my connection with it. I feel that past experiences do not belong in any way meaningfully to the present-day ‘me’.Most people live their lives as a continuous narrative; ‘episodics’ much less so. Or not at all. Looking back over my life I see each of the rooms I mentioned containing a person who was me, but I feel almost no connection to her. That doesn’t mean that I can’t dissect her or write her biography. Or feel for her; passionately and dispassionately at the same time.I’ve often wondered why I feel able to move on quite easily, why I’ve never felt that even the most unpleasant or traumatic periods in my life have touched my ‘core’. as if there is something deep inside me which is inviolable because it is forever detached. I used to think of myself as just not caring enough but I don’t think that’s true. Equally, my inability to make lifelong friends has puzzled me. But if it’s true that the ‘episodic’ lives a life of separate chapters which are without continuity then any relationships are only meaningful for the duration of that particular episode in which they come about.I am neither sad nor happy about this realisation, just accepting. It’s like somebody switched on a previously dimmed light, illuminating vaguely perplexing shadows.Love After LoveThe time will comewhen, with elationyou will greet yourself arrivingat your own door, in your own mirrorand each will smile at the other's welcome,and say, sit here.

{"title": "Tipping out, tripping up and going underground", "date": "Sunday 17 May 2015", "text": "For several days now I’ve been feeling guilty for ignoring my blog; yes, I’ve been busy, but not that busy. I’ve gardened, walked the dog, read books and even, once, a magazine for the over 50s. Take last night, for instance. I was going to come upstairs straight after supper and start composing. Instead I decided to see what’s on TV and 2 ½ hours and a whole 100 gram bar of chocolate later I finally switched it off. And got ready for bed instead of switching my computer on.Talking of getting ready for bed: when I went to the loo the seat unexpectedly cracked under me and bit my bottom. I knew I shouldn’t have had that bar of chocolate. Whenever I use the upstairs bathroom now, and until we have a new seat, I have to be very careful. Perhaps we should get one of these elevated loo seats they advertise in the magazine for the over 50s. And while we’re at it, perhaps we should check out walk-in baths and showers, stair lifts, Zimmer frames, motorised scooters, beds and chairs that tip you out when you press a button on a cord. The magazine is full of good advice on expensive holidays, investment opportunities, retirement apartments and leisure activities. All interviews are with glamorous and famous people of a certain age, who lead interesting lives. The letter pages are written by smarmy, self-congratulatory pensioners in need of a friendly slap to remind them of the reality of a penurious and frail old age which is the lot of so many of the ancients.At Friday’s poetry group meeting I was confronted with another side of reality: old people who find themselves not only hard up but also isolated and lonely because of an inability to cope with modern life. When Lorna first mentioned them I misunderstood and said something unfeeling and flippant like: 'well, hadn’t they better learn to live in today’s world?’  It turns out that this inability to cope is not self-inflicted as in unwilling to learn to use digital media and smart phones, but due to EHS, or electromagnetic-hypersensitivity.We’ve both considered Lorna to be a bit of an eccentric - well, to tell the truth, a regular fruitcake in some respects - but it seems that many of her idiosyncrasies are due to the symptoms she experiences when exposed to mobile phones, for instance. One side of her bungalow is swathed in yellow draperies over walls and windows. It’s like swimming in a murky aquarium. She has a strict rule that no mobile phones are allowed inside. Once I forgot to leave mine outside and after no more than ten minutes she became restless and red in the face. “Someone has brought a mobile in,” she said. Naturally, I apologised and took it outside. When she uses her computer - only ever for a very short time and mainly for emails - she covers exposed skin in aluminium cooking foil.EHS is not recognised by the medical establishment. Wikipedia says: The reported symptoms of EHS include headache, fatigue, stress, sleep disturbances, skin symptoms like prickling, burning sensations and rashes, pain and ache in muscles and many other health problems. Whatever their cause, EHS symptoms are a real and sometimes disabling problem for the affected person. However, there is no scientific basis to link EHS symptoms to electromagnetic field exposure.Lorna and the members of her self help group are often unable to go out at all 'because there are more and more masts around' she says, and she won’t visit anyone else’s house because most people have numerous digital gadgets.

{"title": "Out To Lunch", "date": "Wednesday 6 May 2015", "text": "It’s spring, time to reacquaint ourselves with the natural beauties of the Shropshire and Herefordshire countryside.It’s always pleasant to sample the delights of hostelries sprinkled across our nearby counties in the company of friends; our small group of ‘luncheon club' foodies gives us the ideal opportunity to do so.The Riverside Inn is situated deep in the heart of the Herefordshire countryside just on the southern edge of the Mortimer Forest, yet still close to Ludlow and Hereford, ideal for walking, hiking, fishing and all kinds of country pursuits. Authentic and atmospheric, the 16th century black and white building is surrounded by the natural beauty of the River Lugg valley. The Inn sits on the river bank in the small village of Aymestrey. The river and its banks are full of wildlife – dragonflies, dippers, otters, kingfishers, brown trout and grayling all live here.The bar and restaurant are deliberately kept in a traditional style – log fires, candles, hops and oak beams, bricks and stone. There is plenty of space by the river or in the terrace garden to eat when the weather allows. Our table was ancient, Beloved thought it might have been made of elm because it was covered in thousands of black scratches and marks, much like the wood of elm looks like under the bark. You had to keep an eye on your cutlery, a careless shove could have sent it down the open cracks between the thick planks. The place is totally unpretentious, no fine napery or fancy drapery; everything is plain but in excellent good taste. We sat at the table under the big picture in the back, there was ample room for the six of us before our dishes arrived; after that it was a bit cramped, there was rather a lot of food. Every course was generously proportioned.This is exactly what the Lugg (funny how all our local rivers have these one syllable names, as if the ancients had barked them out in disgust) looked like today. Millie came too but I wouldn’t let her go for a swim, it was just too cold in a rather bitter wind. Instead she got a massive doggie bag. We could of course stop with two courses, or maybe have just a starter and a pudding, but when you are in a first class eating establishment you want to sample as much of the delicious fare as possible.  We were three couples and each couple ordered different dishes, so we could have a taste of each other’s food. Bad manners, I know, but we’re not really bothered. Rules and regulations are ignored when you’re indulging yourself.Here are just a couple of examples of a starter and a pudding. The Inn is perfect for me because guests with special dietary requirements presents no problem to the chefs. Normally, I have to dissect menus very carefully and ask for changes to be made in the preparation. The Riverside Inn happily caters for even the fussiest eater and still manages to provide excellent dishes.I think we’ll probably go back very soon, with or without our luncheon companions. There’s only one thing wrong with a meal like this at lunchtime: I have absolutely no need of anything else to eat for the rest of the day."},

{"title": "Free Your Inner Child ", "date": "Tuesday 28 April 2015", "text": "at reasonable prices.A colouring book, a packet of crayons and coloured pencils, a rubber and frequently licked forefinger, and a tongue busily poking out from between tiny teeth, what else was there to keep a small child occupied on a rainy seaside Bank Holiday Monday? Any boring place adults dragged you to became just about bearable if you hadn’t left behind your half finished colouring book, or, bliss, been given a new one as a bribe.Nowadays even tiny tots are digital natives and carry their smart phone or tablet around with them. Parents don’t seem to find this at all outlandish. For all I know they have drawing apps on the gadgets and doodle childish scribbles on a screen rather than a nice rough paper book with creases and dog-eared corners. Not to mention chocolate ice cream stains.It seems, however, that parents have rediscovered colouring books for themselves. At one point in the past few weeks colouring books for adults were rated first and second on Amazon’s bestseller lists. When I first saw mention of them I thought the ‘adult’ part meant just what it usually means, sexually explicit, a bit smutty, porno for retarded types who need to follow graphic instructions.Far from it. I have since learned that these colouring book have romantic, if somewhat misleading, titles like ‘Enchanted Forest’ (hm, that could still give you the wrong impression?), 'Secret Garden' (golly!)  or 'Animal Kingdom’ (Roar!). Do you think the titles are deliberately chosen to tempt you?Then there are the people who are keen to help you de-stress yourself, find yourself through art, realise what a busy mum you are and how a return to mindfulness can make you into a better person. There are adult colouring books to cater for all needs, therapy on the (not so) cheap for you and a nice little earner for all graphic artists who get on to the bandwagon in time.I expect this craze will die a natural death once the market is saturated and consumers, beg pardon, recipients of therapy, realise that they had perhaps best leave childish pursuits to children. In the meantime, if colouring books light your candle, feel free to indulge. In small doses it’s probably harmless. Now where did I leave the coloured pencils I bought decades ago?"},

The neighbour rents a garage at the road end of our drive and saw Paul unloading a barrow’s worth of twigs into the grid cavity. There’s a field between neighbour and us and we have a fairly good relationship. Neighbour was worked up because he’d been lumbered with a small grandson who obviously had ideas of his own how to pass a  jolly hour or two; I heard grandad hissing “sit down, sit, sit down”. I am glad Paul, who gives the impression of being a very gentle man, didn’t let neighbour bully him. Neighbour is the kind of man whose mouth is permanently turned down at the corners and who seems to have an equally permanent bad smell under his nose. Still, he usually admires me because he thinks of me as one of those highly organised and efficient Germans. “I don’t work for you,” Paul told him, “Go and take it up with 'She Who Must Be Obeyed’ instead\". Sensible man. Neighbour hasn’t uttered a word.dandelions, celandines and violets on a bank above the riverThere’s been a touch of the melodramas, the dreaded Afib came for a visit. Because I dose myself up the minute I notice the rhythm changing I usually manage to sleep through several hours of an attack; for the remaining hours (ten in total this time) I manage to stay calm and wait for either a return to normal or, after twelve hours, a call for help. I’d been a bit tense for a few days, then a very dear friend of ours fell ill suddenly; there was a debate about cancelling/not cancelling a theatre trip, risking or not risking a journey which could easily end in disaster. As I have the unfortunate habit of feeling obliged to take on the woes of creation, whether creation wants me to or not, the adrenaline levels rose and my heart played ‘silly-buggers’.Well, I ask you. If you can’t even rely on a ten-years-younger friend, fit and strong and willing and able, to stay upright, whom can you trust? Friend is home again and in good spirits, I am extremely glad to say. He now understands why I hate going into hospital and drag out calling the ambulance service for as long as I can.daisiesSon and daughter-in-law and stepdaughter came for a short visit over Easter. We see little of family, there are many months between visits, although son and I are on reasonably good terms. But I think I must appeal to son’s kind heart and get him to drive over more often: there are a surprising number of jobs too small for a paid handyman and too difficult for us; in other words, just right for the d-i-y skills of an intelligent chap who can reach those hard-to-get-to spots without climbing on a precariously balanced ladder or breaking his back to crawl into tiny spaces.In case you think me totally selfish: I quite like to see him anyway.So there we are. I’ve read a few books, cooked a few meals, saw a few friends, went to the pub, had a drink or two, wrestled with a couple of computers, cuddled the dog, saw a play, read some poetry, argued with Beloved, and got used to not having easy and unlimited internet access. Apparently, there is great danger of becoming dependant on social media and the net. Can’t say I’ve noticed. For a few days it felt strange not to be blogging and reading blogs but the feeling caused me no great anxiety. Still, all of you who have remained faithful to my inconsequential burblings rest assured, I shall gradually get round to visiting and paying my dues."},

The price of the things!Apart from that, and on a lighter note, I am lucky to be alive. Millie did her best to kill me. Nearing the road home on a walk she suddenly saw one of her best friends, Kevin, who was out with Sam, his collie; the two of them were crossing the narrow entrance that closes off the dirt track into the main road.  There are thick metal bars across this gap, with a staggered opening, to stop kids running into the road.Millie saw Kevin and rushed towards him. Millie loves men. The way she throws herself at her favourites is almost indecent. Terrified that she would run into the road I screamed at her. NO! She crouched on her belly, but only for a second. NO! More crouching. Believe me, when I bellow NO! the whole street hears me. Everybody around stops dead instantly. Not Millie. She slowed just enough for me to catch her by the collar but then she gave one almighty final tug to reach Kevin. As I was leaning over her I was off-balance already, so I went forward in an arc, my head hitting the metal bars, scraping knees and arms in the process. Kevin grabbed my arm, hard, which didn't help, Ralph from across the road came rushing over and a lady arrived from her garden gate. I was winded and hurt all over, so I simply sat there trying to catch my breath and whimpering a bit. That made Sam come and give me a slobbery kiss, while Millie, firmly held by Ralph, looked a picture of innocence; a little pained at having been deprived of greeting two of her favourite men in the manner to which she feels entitled but otherwise calmly wondering what all the fuss was about.Eventually I allowed myself to be dragged upright by my kind rescuers and Ralph, still firmly holding Millie's lead, took me to the gate into our field. When I said \"hold her close, don't let her get run over\", Ralph said \"why not, she deserves it.\" He was joking. He's another one Millie loves to distraction.

{"title": "Shadows of One Sort and Another", "date": "Wednesday 18 March 2015", "text": "I was quite pleased with myself last week. There are few weeks when I can sidestep the black hole altogether, and keeping a black cock hatched in March as a protection against evil spirits - it is said they are terrified of his crowing - isn’t on the cards as I don’t keep chickens, so feeling good about myself and the world around me was surprisingly pleasant. I must try it more often. This week started a little less bright but at least the weather wasn’t all bad. Afternoon sun threw shadows across the field, and the river sparkled. Paul and I chucked a couple of hours' work at the garden too, another first for the year. I’ll get those pesky endorphins moving yet. In fact, I’d better. A winter of sitting on the sofa reading books and eating chocolate has done my shape no favours at all. I got on the scales the other day and took a quick look over my shoulder to see if anybody behind me was putting a foot on; but no, it was all me. A lot of me.The reason I was feeling proud of myself last week was a very simple one: I rediscovered the joys of going outside my comfort zone. In a previous existence I depended on no one but myself for everything, child raising, money earning, household keeping etc. All the obligations of adulthood landed on my shoulders. Not a state of being I’d wholeheartedly recommend. With Beloved it all changed; the children had grown up and left - that blissful state all of you whining about empty nest syndrome will one day come to appreciate - and I became not only a kept woman but one who found a solid presence beside her at all times. And now that solid presence isn’t quite as solid as it was and I am having to relearn being the one who not only does, but also makes a lot of the decisions to do what, when, where and how. It happens. Take driving to town and going shopping. Any kind of driving, in fact. Beloved didn’t feel like coming  along, so I went off by myself.“I am a bus virgin”, I said to the uniformed driver of indeterminate gender, as I stepped on board the ‘park-and-ride’ in the county town - s/he had a kind of curly halo of dark hair and I didn’t want to stare - “please tell me how this works.” I always find people are willing to teach you anything provided you act dumb and ask nicely. Shrewsbury is a lovely town, with steep lanes and smart little shops. Once I’d completed the main errand, collecting a watch from the jewellers’, I decided to roam. I bought some new undies, a lipstick, some smart notepads, a few tasty treats at the delicatessen’s and made various other totally unnecessary purchases, only limited by having to carry them to the ‘park-and-ride’ which would take me to the car park on the edge of town, the supermarket for boring groceries, and thence the hour's drive back home to Valley’s End. It was nothing, most of you do this daily, but I’ve been leading my life in tandem for many years now and going it alone is a whole new, slightly scary but not unpleasant, departure. Throughout the week I kept up this determination to step out of the twosome. We had dinner guests, a meal which I planned, shopped for and cooked - something usually goes wrong, this time I burnt the roasted vegetables. Prof. Tony was kind enough to say that he preferred his vegetables crispy - ; I drove us to a theatre one night, only a short journey, but I’ve been avoiding night driving for a long time;  going to a restaurant on my own was something I did all the time years ago, now I am doing that again too. Beloved will still accompany me on many outings but sometimes he feels the effort is too much and not worth it.The shadow of old age encroaching on daily life is something we must all face eventually, but it needn’t be the death knell of all endeavour, singly or jointly."},

The moment Georgie's dad came home from work he too was treated to this staggering revelation, as was Georgie’s sister Chloe. “Dad, I've got a penis and so have you and Chloe has a China. “ Georgie just couldn’t get over it.This little gem came up because Kelly told me about an exciting week with Chloe, who is twelve and has just started her periods. Chloe is miffed because she can’t go swimming this week but otherwise she is taking it in her stride. She is annoyed at being the first in her class but Kelly has assured her that she’ll therefore be the coolest among the girls and she’ll be the centre of attention for a while.How times have changed. We had one lecture in my all-girls-school, for all ages, from 10 to 16 year olds (16-18 year olds were excused, presumably because they already knew the difference between boys and girls and the fun you could have with that difference). A man, he may have been a priest in my catholic grammar school, or less likely, a doctor, stood in front of row upon row of giggling girls in the school’s assembly hall and held forth about the birds and the bees and how kissing was sinful and the first step on the road to perdition. Come to think of it, he must have been the school priest, surely no doctor would have spouted such nonsense even in the unenlightened days of the late 50s?I was one of the youngest and my knowledge of all things physical and carnal was still zero after the lecture. Menstruating for the first time was a frightening experience for an innocent like me, I was sure I was about to die. My mother, who never made any effort to explain the facts of life to me, blamed the school for not having done so.Dear Aunt Katie, with whom I was staying at the time, just smiled reassuringly and when my mum came to collect me, told her to speak up, finally. All my mum managed was, “you’re alright, you’re not dying. That’ll happen every four weeks now.” Poor mum, she just never could overcome her inner straitjacket."},

It’s only the fourth day today and already March has lived up to its name and nature, roaring in like a lion. To a gardener like me it seems to be the most provocative and exciting month of the year, full of promise, albeit broken at a moment’s notice. March flirts with the sun, calling you out to admire the many signs of new growth, only to fling pellets of hail at you the moment you put your trust in the brave light. Blizzards, showers of grey, cold rain, followed by the treacherous breath of a soft south westerly breeze which quickly turns into an icy gale bringing renewed snow flurries as soon as you discard your woolly hat.  My longing for an hour in the garden lures me out to prowl among the beds and borders, secateurs at the ready; twenty minutes later I scuttle back to my warm hearth, fingers frozen. Even the most battle-hardened gardener’s enthusiasm is forced to retreat before the eccentricities of the March barometer.And yet...the crocuses are out in their early glory. They may be small and unremarkable, but look closely and their simple beauty will astound you. Then there’s the pigeon taking a long, slow look at the huge conifer in the hedge which year after year provides a home for it and its family. It’s the early bird which takes up residence in good time, ensuring a favourable position on the housing ladder.And thenthere are the glossy leaved periwinkles, evergreen and growing anywhere, in sun and shade, in woodlands or as here, with  roots in the foundations of a brick wall. In a mild winter the periwinkle will give you a few blossoms as early as January.In France the periwinkle, which is sometimes called ‘the Magician’s Violet’, is considered the emblem of sincere friendship, and as such is much used in their language of flowers. The English have adopted this evergreen plant as the representative of ‘Tender Recollection’. In Italy the country people make garlands of this plant, to place upon the biers of their deceased children, for which reason they name it the ‘Flower of Death’. But in Germany it is the symbol of immortality, and, because its fine glossy myrtle-green leaves flourish all through the winter, they term it ‘Wintergreen’.From The Language of Flowers 19th Century"},

The Vet said they had taken a lot of the area surrounding it away, so if it turns out to be cancerous they might well have removed most or all of it.The lump in her side was just another fat lump but as it was bothering her it was as well to remove it while they had her on the operating table.She was only gone for five hours. Within a day she had recovered and now she is herself again. The only difference is that on these gloomy days the patch shines out like a traffic light, more visible than the rest of her from a distance.Dogs are wonderful patients, Millie remained calm and seemingly untroubled, once she had recovered from the anaesthetic. Where humans make a tremendous fuss, dogs just accept what is. Millie has not even tried to bite her stitches and the big plastic collar is still sitting there, unused.Ten days after the operation the stitches need to come out.

{"title": "Orchestral Conductors  -  Mud From A Scraper  - No.7 In An Occasional Series", "date": "Tuesday 24 February 2015", "text": "I saw that Prufrock at Prufrock’s Dilemma has published a serious and learned guest post on the Art of Conducting. Those of you of an equally serious musical bent might like to pop over and read this well researched and well written essay. Anyone of a lighter disposition could continue reading here, although !WARNING! this may well turn into an overlong post. (I don’t expect comments)0-0-0-0“What! up and down, carv’d like an apple-tart?”Taming of the Shrew - ShakespeareWith the exception of a few who are truly great, conductors are either popular with audiences or the orchestra; to have a large public following and to command the respect of the players at the same time, is not given to many.Whilst most lay audiences will admit to their incompetence in judging matters of sound, they claim the right to pass judgement on what they can see. Orchestral players assess the merits of a conductor solely by the quality of his music making, and find any unnecessary display on the podium merely distracting. A beat that looks impressive from behind is usually difficult to follow, whilst a stick technique, from which all extravagant gestures have been amputated, affects an audience no more than would a metronome.There are as many types of beat as there are conductors - or ‘carvers’ as they are known in the profession. Some of them beat in circles, some diagonally, some give no down beats, some nothing else; some sweep the stick decisively from one extremity of their reach to the other, and some oscillate their elbows and expect to produce cohesion.All carvers however, though differing in every other imaginable way, expect an orchestra to play the final chord of any slow pianissimo cadence on the fourth waggle of the stick, and not before.A conductor should understand all instruments and be able to play several. He must be capable of judging balance and tone and appreciating the finer points of orchestration; he must be a student of human nature and applied psychology, and he must be able to understand the composer’s intentions - which is often overlooked. A great conductor can do all these things. He also has an attitude of humility to his art, and a great respect for his players. He achieves his results by taking an orchestra into spiritual partnership and treating them as equals. He never loses his temper or bullies players - nor does he need to do so.There is a regrettable attitude among conductors that, by virtue of their craft, they are the social superiors of mere instrumentalists.  An orchestra is quick to judge the character of a carver. Musicians will co-operate with a conductor who is sincere and who has a musician’s approach, even though he has no pretensions to greatness. They will not approve of incompetence, over-theatricality, or simply lack of musicianship.Given a good orchestra, any musician can stand on the rostrum and conduct it - provided that he makes it clear when the players are intended to start and to stop. The result will always be passable with a well-known work, because the performers can, and often do, play it from memory.Conductors’ musical reputations are made and lost at rehearsals. No orchestra will co-operate with a carver who keeps going over a passage without saying what is wrong with it, or one who stops and points out an accidental error from ten minutes ago. To a certain extent, an orchestra knows its own failings, and if a conductor points them out he is considered sound. Musicians will, however, find means of retaliation if a conductor complains about a section that musicians know to be in order.Musicians will rarely approve of a visiting carver’s new interpretation of an old familiar work. An interpretation that has been accepted for twenty years is not to be upset by the whim of any jack-in-office who couldn’t conduct a tram. A conductor who has earned the orchestra’s respect may, however, break convention in moderation without losing face.The least pleasant conductor to play under is the composer. His technique is rarely any worse than that of a professional carver, but he will know every note of the score, and require to hear them all; he will also enjoy himself and expect to see the orchestra fascinated by his brain-child.There are many symptoms by which a conductor can tell whether or not an orchestra likes him, should it make any difference to him. Sabotage is rare, being difficult to reconcile with an artistic conscience and wrong notes played at concerts are generally accidental. Passive resistance, however, is frequently indulged in, and, among other time-wasting efforts, consists of a general lack of concentration at rehearsals.Finally, should any orchestral musician, through misguided ambition or avarice, aspire to become a conductor, he must be prepared to renounce all his old friends and allegiances; also in so doing he will encounter all the mistrust and suspicion otherwise only experienced by a man who meets his ex-wife’s relations."},
{"title": "Sunday Sunday", "date": "Sunday 22 February 2015", "text": "“What’s libertarian?”  Beloved couldn’t give me a definite answer. We were both guessing.It’s late Sunday morning and we are having breakfast. I must hurry because I want to watch a programme on German TV at 10 am our time, a weekly discussion on socio-political and cultural topics. At breakfast I invariably open my IPad to check the day’s news: on the BBC, The Guardian online and HuffPost. The three teenaged girls who appear to have run away from home to join ISIS make the headlines. They’re either still in Turkey or have crossed the border into Syria by now. Their families are distraught.“Authorities Failed Girls”, screamed one headline. Instantly I get cross. Is no one responsible for themselves anymore? Or have fathers and mothers abdicated responsibility for their underage children and expect the authorities to take over?So then I thought of Libertarianism . I looked it up on Google. I often look up definitions on Google that I used to look up in dictionaries. I don’t think I like it. I like the idea of the weak and helpless being safe in the arms of a benevolent society until such time as they can help themselves again.Getting back to the three teenagers. Apparently there are dozens of young people from European countries following the call. We all know that ISIS revels in unspeakable acts of cruelty and barbarity. They say these young people are brainwashed into joining; what kind of mental deficiency allows them to overlook these acts? We all have this pat little phrase: ‘I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy’. I expect we even mean it some of the time. If these girls and others like them know what they’re doing they deserve everything they’re going to get.The discussion programme on German TV was on the Police. Your friend and helper in times of trouble on the one hand and the abuser of power on the other. It was a lively programme, spoilt for me by the sole politician member who tried to monopolise it by dragging party politics into it. I shout at the screen: ‘yes, yes’ we all know that’, 'you are repeating yourself', 'that’s not the point’, but he paid no attention to me. Politicians never do. The moderator wagged his finger at him to shut him up. Do these people not know how annoying they are? Hides like a rhinoceros, politicians.I was glad when it was time for Sunday lunch. We have a thing about Sunday lunch. It’s special. I cook meat and several vegetables, roast in winter, and there’s often a starter and aways a pudding. Wine at lunch is not a good idea because I must walk Millie in the afternoon but the weather was foul and I knew I wasn’t going to go far, so I treated myself to an extra glass. Beloved has sherry beforehand and wine with, but then he only has to fall into his chair afterwards, where he promptly nods off. I like our Sunday lunches, they are cosy and companionable, with a table cloth, good china and glassware and candles on dark days. We had roast pork, roast root vegetables and apple tart today.The bottom field was awash. Sue was sloshing through with Jake, a gorgeous long-haired golden retriever, about 100 years old. Jake never misses plunging into the river, Sue was racing ahead, waving at me from a distance. Normally we stop and chat. Not today. Brian was throwing tennis balls for his two collies, Murphy and Badger - Brian likes Irish stout. I lifted my golfing umbrella slightly so I could see him. ‘Filthy weather’, ‘that wind goes right through you’, etc. \"Go on, get on home. Have a nice cup of tea\", Brian advised me. Nice cups of tea figure high on an Englishman’s list of priorities on a day like today.Millie didn’t seem to mind having her walk curtailed. Poor girl has to go in for yet another operation next Thursday. A growth on her belly, not a fat lump this time. I’m being extra nice to her, feeding her lots of biscuits. If she gets too fat she can’t have an operation, so I’d better watch it.J.K. Rowling has written a couple of thrillers. I finished one of them lying on the sofa, duties done for the day. I never read her Harry Potter books, nor ‘A Casual Vacancy’, her first book for adults. The latter has been turned into a TV series; I saw the first episode, didn’t like it, and gave up on it. The thrillers aren’t great either but, what the heck, I’ll try anything once.Which brings me to supper, very light because of the large lunch, eaten in front of another German TV programme, a cop show. English cop shows are cosy and bloodless and usually portray genteel murderers in picturesque villages, solved by bumbling policemen with a side kick who makes inane remarks. German cop shows are nastier, grittier, full of big city realism and the kind of murderer you want caught, hanged, drawn and quartered. I know which one I prefer. The English variety is soporific, asks nothing except suspension of disbelief, an ability to overlook wooden dialogue and looks pretty. What more could you ask on a wet evening in February.There you have it, Sunday chez Friko. It might make a fitting punishment for my worst enemy, being bored to tears should describe it adequately."},

{"title": "K is for Karneval -  Helau and Alaaf !", "date": "Monday 16 February 2015", "text": "Karneval in Cologne, image Fourth ThingKarneval, the Rhenish name for the Fools' Season, is centuries old - Mardi Gras is an offshoot, but the two share nothing else but a common European ancestry. The Ancient Greeks and Romans celebrated Mardi Gras in the form of spring festivals as early as the 6th century B.C. In medieval times the \"Feast of Fools\" was celebrated as the last opportunity for merrymaking and excessive indulgence in food and drink before the Solemn Lenten Season. In some areas of Europe Karneval became a theatrical demonstration, an effective way of mocking monarchy, governments and other rulers without being punished.Karneval is a Catholic tradition and in Germany is found almost exclusively in Catholic regions such as Bavaria and the Rhineland. However, there are Karneval celebrations in some Protestant areas, notably in Berlin and Braunschweig. (Braunschweig’s Karneval procession was cancelled this year at the last minute because of fears over terrorist attacks. I saw grown men weep on the TV news.)Cologne Karneval is huge. As many as half a million people line the streets some years, dancing and singing and shouting ‘Koelle Alaaf' and swaying (schunkeln) the cold away. The Rose Monday parade which was first held in 1823 is more than 6 km long, with elaborate floats mocking politicians and politics, foreign and home grown, celebrities, curiosities and the carriages bearing 'Karneval Royalty’. There are endless parades of groups on foot, some as small as a dozen, others fifty or more. Dozens of bands provide noisy music, as if the noise from the crowds and the carriages and floats weren’t enough to deafen you. Everybody wears some kind of costume (it keeps you warm). 300 tons of candy are flung into the crowds from the floats, as well as flowers, rag dolls, other small presents and whole bars and boxes of chocolates. Each Karneval society has its own band of ‘soldiers’ with uniforms dating back to Napoleonic times, when the Rhineland was occupied by Napoleon’s forces; when the Prussians sent Napoleon packing, the populace in turn mocked them and their occupation of the Rhineland by dressing in Prussian uniforms,  also represented today.Karneval, called the fifth season in Germany, the Season of Fools, starts on 11.11 at 11.11 and ends at midnight on Shrove Tuesday. It goes into a sort of temporary hibernation during Advent, Christmas and the New Year celebrations, but comes back in earnest in February, with the last week before lent being an almost non-stop party for members of the ancient and venerable Karneval societies and everyone else who wants to celebrate. Since Karneval originated as a mocking of Royalty, of course there must be a Royal Couple, the Prinzenpaar, who are crowned at the beginning of the season.With them comes the “Hofstaat, the Royal Court.\"  This consists of the \"Hofmarshall\" (Prince's Grand Marshall), the \"Adjutant\" (Princess' Attendant), the \"Hofdame” (Lady of the court), and the \"Mundschenkin\" (Toastmistress and keeper of the wine.) Then there are the very important Princes’ Guardsmen in their tricorns and elegant uniforms.  ‘Funkenmariechen’, in their red and white uniforms are the female equivalent to the town soldiers, who were disbanded by Napoleon. All of these honours don’t come cheap and are highly regarded. The Funkenmariechen, who are an acrobatic corps de ballet, train for months before they perform at Karneval shows, called Sitzungen.Karneval is very traditional in aspect and procedure. A whole ‘industry' exists for just this season. There is Karneval music, food, cabaret, and Buettenreden, (humourous and satirical rhyming speeches), grand balls and not so grand hops and other festivities all tailor made. During Karneval behaving madly and overindulging is a virtue.Drunk or sober, in the grip of the mother of all hangovers or happy and fighting fit, on Ash Wednesday it’s all over. Those who feel they have sinned (which is allowed during Karneval) go to confession, are absolved and receive a thumb print in the form of a cross on their forehead and promise to behave well until the next Fool’s Season."},
{"title": "A Valentine for Beloved", "date": "Friday 13 February 2015", "text": "At a 93rd birthday party recently I was sitting on the sofa next to Wendy, a sweet old widow lady, a fellow guest. Nearly all the guests were elderly, the host and birthday boy being the oldest.“Are you making any plans for the summer” she asked me, probably meaning trips and holidays.Beloved was sitting at the other end of the room with the men.I pointed to him and said: “ Not at the moment, my husband isn’t really up to travelling. He feels most comfortable at home, where he can arrange his life to suit his needs.”Wendy made sympathetic noises. I didn’t want to sound like a woman put upon and hard-done-by, so I continued :”I don’t really mind. He is such a nice man that it is no hardship to spend time together at home.”I didn’t get any further. “O,” Wendy burst out, “ how wonderful to hear this. I am always listening to women going on about their husbands, how tiresome they are. You have no idea how refreshing it is to hear of a couple who are friends, who like each other. If only I still had my husband; when I hear these women complaining I ask myself how would they feel if they lost them, would they be glad or would they actually miss them.”Pleasantly surprised by this outburst, and a little touched by Wendy’s obvious sadness at her widowhood, I realised once again: it isn’t how much time you spend together, or how busily you spend this time; it’s harmony in your dealings together, and the pleasure you derive from being with each other, which matter.As Berowne says in Shakespeare’s Love’s Labour’s Lost, which we saw only Thursday evening:And when Love speaks, the voice of all the godsMakes Heaven drowsy with the harmony."},
{"title": "Of Gardening and Gardeners", "date": "Sunday 8 February 2015", "text": "In these wintry days, it’s only too easy to call Shakespeare’s take on February to mind. In ‘Much Ado About Nothing’  Don Pedro says to Benedick : “Why, what’s the matter that you have such a February face, so full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?”Today the valley had a Sunday face, full of bright skies and sunshine, not a storm cloud anywhere. I decided it was time to walk around the garden to look for signs of spring. And I found some:the first buds of helleboresa golden carpet of aconites under the trees the splendid tendrils of the hamamelisand unforced rhubarb shooting in the fruit garden.Paul is once again out of action and will remain so for several weeks more; he had to have a carpal tunnel operation, so no accident this time. Which is progress of a sort, I suppose. There are a number of jobs which need doing before spring is here, the compost heaps need turning, a climbing rose needs moving and a pile of wood needs chopping and burning or taking away for firewood. I have heard nothing from old Gardener for months now, I doubt that he’ll return, which meant gardener number three had to be found and interviewed.The first thing Jon said was “I have been suffering with my back for the past three weeks; paid a fortune to a chiropodist so I don’t want to put it out again with lots of digging”. Eh? What is it with me and gardeners? How come I only attract the ailing and accident prone kind?Anyway, Jon took a look at the jobs and I assured him that he could take his time over the digging. That is, until he told me his hourly rate: one and a half times the rate I pay Paul and nearly twice what I paid old Gardener. I am happy to pay a living wage for the hard or unpleasant work I ask people to do for me. Jon looked at me sideways when he mentioned the rate, not fully turning and looking me in the face, but swivelling his eyes in a ‘let’s see how she reacts’ kind of way; he mumbled something about that being the rate most people asked round here and he was going to do the same in the coming year with all his clients.I felt both annoyed with him and sorry for him at the same time, but kept my face perfectly straight. Why do I feel embarrassed when people treat me like a fool? I need the work done now. It means that when Paul gets back he can carry on with current tasks rather than spend time on jobs which are a bit beyond him anyway. Jon appears to be a nice chap, he seemed grateful when I accepted his demand. Some acquaintances in the village employ him, so he comes recommended. But he is an unskilled labourer, not a trained gardener; I will pay him what he asks but he will have to work for it. Damn, I wish I weren’t so old and feeble. I’m not cut out to be an employer."},
{"title": "SHORTS - Gossip", "date": "Wednesday 4 February 2015", "text": "One winds on the distaff what the other spins. (Both spread gossip). Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Dutch proverbGossip is idle talk or rumour, especially aboutthe personal or private affairs of others.Prudence said we should come and have a coffee. I accepted with alacrity. Sometimes I like to gossip. Problem is, I never know any, so people like Prudence are very useful to me after a long period of abstinence. Before we go, I arrange for a parade of people in my mind’s eye whom I haven’t seen or heard of for a while and with whose current circumstances I need to familiarise myself. Not all the gossip is malicious; Beloved came too and he wouldn’t stand for that, but some bits are just too juicy to keep under wraps. Prudence is an old lady, one of the many in our small village who can be relied on to have her finger on the pulse of public opinion on any delicate matter, like who has offended whom and why, who’s having an affair with whom, whose son is in trouble, etc. On this occasion it was righteous indignation at the shenanigans of an 80+ year old who very recently buried his wife and is already actively on the look-out for her replacement. Well, at 80+ he doesn’t have all that much time left for renewed nuptials; I can quite see the reason for the hurry. All the same, we were united in tutting at such callous bad taste, as well as wondering who could possibly be desperate enough to take him up on the offer.In a historical thriller I read recently ( one of C.J. Sansom’s Shardlake series - highly recommended if you want something light, fast paced, Tudor, and well researched) the etymology of the word gossip was mentioned. So I looked it up. It comes from Old English gossib, god sibb,  a godparent, close relation, confidant. What an enormous distance for a word to travel,  from something good like a sponsor, a friend and mentor, to an idle tittle-tattler who can cause real grief and unhappiness. Beloved must have been quite confused, he left one of his gloves behind, he thought. One glove on its own is an abomination, if you must lose one, make sure you lose both. Having hunted high and low, not finding it, even retracing steps from Prudence’s door to ours next morning, I rang her. Putting the receiver down I heard a voice from the lobby: “It’s alright,” he said, “found it. It was here all the time. Pretending to be a plastic bag.” Do you wonder I need the odd bit of light relief occasionally?"},

The Hurtlers take their next way over hills, dales, hedges, ditches, yea, and through bushes, briars, mires, plashes and river whatsoever: so as you shall sometimes see 20 or 30 lie tugging together in the water, scrambling and scratching for the ball. A play both rude and rough. The ball in this play may be compared to an infernal spirit, for whosoever catcheth it, fareth straighways like  a mad man, struggling and fighting with those that go about to hold him. You shall see them retiring home as from a pitched battle, with bloody pates, bones broken and out of joint, and such bruises as serve to shorten their days; yet all is good play, and never Attorney or Coroner troubled.”They did that sort of thing in Cornwall at the beginning of the 17th century.

Beloved is nothing if not to the point.I should have had a camera handy,” he said, standing at the kitchen window, looking out, when I came in. Millie and I had been for a short walk and afterwards I grabbed a couple of hand shovels to clear up a small accumulation of detritus left by her over several days. She uses a particular area in the garden for her morning evacuations and normally I clean up after her the same day. But on cold winter mornings I like to forget. Hence the lady in mink hunting little piles this afternoon.  Hunter’s gumboots, a wooly hat pulled down low,thick gloves, and Aunt Josephine’s mink coat completing the outfit, I was as warm as toast.So, Millie walked, sh*t shovelled, birds fed, kitchen bin taken to the compost, meant my outdoor duties were completed for the day. I was glad to get back in. My, but that wind is cold. As cold as a non-Quaker feels at a Quaker funeral. I had my first experience of a Quaker funeral service, which is not so different from an ordinary Quaker meeting, I understand. It didn’t help that we got lost in a maze of muddy lanes and arrived at the last minute. At one passing place (English country lanes are sometimes only a car width wide and need special passing places every so often) I imperiously flagged down a black car to ask directions and realised, horror-struck, that it was the hearse which had delivered my friend’s mortal remains to the chapel where the service was to be held. My friend’s husband, who is artistic to the point of lunacy, had given us directions which we seriously misunderstood.Long silences were interrupted by a handful of people who felt moved to stand up and speak a few words, otherwise there was nothing except quiet contemplation. Even for a very infrequent churchgoer like me it seemed terribly bleak, lacking the comfort and reassurance of ritual. Afterwards we stood around in the biting wind (no mink coat this time) and watched the coffin lowered into the grave in silence. It was a green burial, in a field surrounding the chapel, there were no head stones, no flowers; no formal words were spoken. One of the bearers held a bowl of earth and a few people followed the family and threw a handful on to the coffin.My friend, who suffered from Alzheimer’s for the past twelve years and whose death was, finally, a blessed relief, was a Quaker herself and she would have known many funerals such as hers. Personally, the thought of a humanist service and green burial appeals, but I would certainly like to have a little more fuss made over me, no matter how insincere. As is due to a Lady in Mink."},
{"title": "SHORTS : Anxiety", "date": "Wednesday 28 January 2015", "text": "The Great Storm of 1987About five o’clock one morning last week I was woken by strange noises outside. Rattling and thumping, high-pitched whistling, a kind of roaring which ebbed and flowed in irregular bursts. The storm forecast earlier had arrived. Nothing like the Great Storm of 1987 which reached over 130mph gusts; no, a small seedling of maybe 50/60mph, which would soon blow itself out. The UK rarely suffers more than the tail end of the hurricanes other parts of the world experience, but even little puffs like these are enough to shake our house which sits in the mouth of a funnel formed by the river valley. The noise kept me in that state between sleep and waking, neither one nor the other, the helpless state, where irrational fears easily get a foothold.Suddenly I was engulfed by terror. I saw the road I was to drive in the morning as an insurmountable obstacle course, the many twists and turns across some very minor hills filled with danger. There is a short stretch of road called the gander’s neck, rather narrow, the bends tight and close together, which always requires the driver’s full attention. I saw myself entering the first bend, coming up against storm broken trees blocking the road and being unable to turn back. One side of the gander’s neck falls steeply off into the valley below and on the other side the hillside rises equally steeply.  I was swept into helpless imagination of every detail of the road like a film before me, the damaged trees, the narrow road, my car slewed sideways, other cars about to crash into me. Frantically I worked out what to do. Leave the car, walk back to the beginning of the curve, put up a hazard sign? Wave down other drivers? My heart was pounding, I was literally paralysed by anxiety, lying there in my warm and comfortable bed. Forcing myself to come fully awake I got up, switched on the lights, had a drink of water, went to the bathroom, told myself not to be silly. Nothing worked, my pulse raced and afraid of going back to bed still in the grip of this irrational anxiety I popped a Lorazepam from my secret stash.This is a nothing story about a non-event but driving that road for real later that same day the night-time fear was still hanging around and I drove more carefully than at any other time."},
{"title": "How To Build A Bomb", "date": "Sunday 25 January 2015", "text": "Tom McCall as Hans Bethe, John Heffernan as J Robert Oppenheimer and Ben Allen as Edward Teller in Oppenheimer. Photo by Keith PattisonFrom The RSC ProductionSeeing the same play many times is like re-reading a favourite book: there is always something you missed before;  with Shakespeare’s plays I would go so far as to say you must see them as often as they come back to a stage near you. It will take several productions before you can stop concentrating on every word - and so miss the performance. Only when you know what comes next will you appreciate the depth, colour, drama, the layers of humour and tragedy, the sheer genius of the works, whether written by one man or several.But sometimes the first performance of a play is all you need to get goosebumps. It happened to me yesterday with a brand new play by a relatively unknown dramatist called Tom Morton-Smith, namely, “Oppenheimer.”  Synopsis:1939: fascism spreads across Europe, Franco marches on Barcelona and two German chemists discover the processes of atomic fission. In Berkeley, California, theoretical physicists recognise the horrendous potential of this new science: a weapon that draws its power from the very building blocks of the universe. The ambitious and charismatic J Robert Oppenheimer finds himself uniquely placed to spearhead the largest scientific undertaking in all of human history.Struggling to cast off his radical past and thrust into a position of power and authority, Oppenheimer races to win the 'battle of the laboratories' and create a weapon so devastating that, with the detonation of a single device, it would bring about an end not just to the Second World War but to all war.As the political situation darkens, Tom Morton-Smith's new play takes us into the heart of the Manhattan Project and explores the tension between the scientific advances that will shape our understanding of the fabric of the universe, and the justification of their use during wartime, revealing the personal cost of making history.The play left the four of us rather subdued and in need of a fortifying cup of tea before tackling the long   journey home from Stratford-upon-Avon back to Shropshire. To break the spell I decided to pop into the theatre shop for some cards. The merchandise at the RSC gift shop is undoubtedly overpriced but tasteful rather than tacky, as in so many other gift shops where a bit of additional cash is raised for an attraction.As I took my purchases to the cash till I overheard one of the assistants say to the other :  “Is Oppenheimer out yet?”  Being a helpful sort of person I butted in and said “ O yes, quite a while ago.”  Whereupon the second assistant said, deadpan and with no discernible trace of irony in her voice or facial expression: “Good, they’ll have had time to build another bomb then.”Reader, I fell for it. Blame the play and my continued preoccupation with it or blame my natural slow wittedness. All excited and breathless I said : O, do they build a new bomb for each performance?” (a large bomb-shaped object is suspended from girders and slowly appears above the stage in the final part of the play, culminating in darkness and the noise of an almighty explosion)“O yes,” the assistant said, “of course they do.” She kept her eyes firmly lowered, it doesn’t do to make fun of the paying customer too obviously.I felt a 'proper Charlie’ but when I stopped being embarrassed the spell the play had cast over me was broken. Which was not a bad thing."},

She is paid a pittance, barely above the minimum wage, whereas her employer takes a fair dollop of cash off both private and state employers.Although this state of affairs makes me extremely cross it’s the not the point of this post.With many of her co-workers succumbing to the flu, Kelly was swamped with calls over the Christmas period. One of her chaps, a man of 84 whom she described as a very sweet and friendly old gentleman, felt unwell when she visited him the day before Christmas Eve. Kelly decided to do something, she rang his doctor and the old man’s daughter too, to let her know that dad was poorly. Kelly stayed with him until the daughter arrived, who lived just half an hour away. The old man was still on Kelly’s roster the next day; she heard that the doctor had been and prescribed some medication. She did what she had to do and left for her next patient.On Christmas Day a colleague of Kelly’s was on duty. When she arrived at the house she found the old man lying on the floor in front of his bed, stone cold. She immediately phoned for an ambulance and was told by the switchboard operator to attempt resuscitation. Kelly’s colleague said that rigor mortis had already set in and the man must have died sometime during the night, alone and helpless. In spite of her conviction that she could do nothing she performed CPR.I don’t know whether the old man could have survived if somebody had actually taken care of him, but I’m thinking that death in the embrace of his family would have been infinitely preferable to such a miserable and lonely end to his life."},

The relief that it’s all over is great. If ‘festive’ is companionably sitting and moaning, feeling ill, picking at dried flakes of snot and flicking them off to join dog hair and dust bunnies in the corners of the room and generally stewing in your own phlegm, watching bad TV and reading arse-clenchingly dull books, I can do without it. If ‘festive' means feeling obliged to cook ’special’ meals, all of them elaborate and large, all of them costing the earth and requiring hours of labour and then nobody eats them and the whole lot bar a few forkfuls wanders into the freezers, then I beg to be excused from joining in.Give me humdrum any day. For a good two weeks we stayed under self-imposed quarantine, neither going out nor letting anyone in. Whenever one of our wonderful neighbours called to walk the dog for us we took Millie to the back door, handed her and her lead over and retreated to a sofa. Actually, once we felt and sounded not completely at death’s door it wasn’t so bad. When others were obliged to attend parties, entertain families and generally pretend to joyously embrace the festive spirit and knacker themselves in the process, we put our feet up. It’s true to say that we lacked the energy to do otherwise but being allowed to recover in peace was wonderful.Christmas and New Year were wash-outs, which surely means it can only get better from now on? Just look at those snowdrops.Kelly came to clean up dust bunnies and snot flakes and kind friends came to eat left-overs with us. I’ve started to make inroads into festive letters and emails - why do people who never write at any other time insist on telling you about their whole boring year at Christmas? I’ve made arrangements to bring our Wills up to date, sort through tax receipts, cleared my desk of clutter, reconciled bank statements and may even get round to renewing my passport. Millie is taking me out again although I’m not nearly as keen to walk for miles as her temporary minders were.Let the good times roll!"},

I was picking him up outside the supermarket, literally so, out of the gutter, as it happens;  he’d done some shopping while I went for my hour with Helen. I was sitting behind the wheel, hadn’t even switched off the engine fully. One minute he was there,  the next he’d gone, on his bum on the pavement. Quite hard, actually. It took a few minutes to get him upright. He’s a bit sore today, which is why he asked Kelly if she could do the area round his chair without disturbing him as he wouldn’t find it easy to move about.Well, it’s nice to get sympathy from a pleasant young woman like Kelly when you’re an old man, isn’t it? “Aw. bless,” she said.Kelly is not just my cleaner, she is also a carer; I am sure she is a good and conscientious one. Beloved’s mishap got us talking after he had left the room. ‘Bin there, dun that’.  Pratfalls are nothing uncommon.“I was going to this lady on a freezing day”, she said. “The others in the office told me about her step and how slippery it was and that you had to be extra careful going in. But you know how it is, you are running late, calls are backing up, and you just rush about. Well, I did an almost full somersault, feet went from under me, shot in the air and  landed on my head and shoulders, completely winded. Wheezing and choking. Not a breath left in my body.I crawled to my knees and the first thing I did, before I even checked myself for injuries, I looked round, all sides, left to right, and behind me, to see if anyone had seen me. I felt such a fool.”"},

They say “Jeder ist seines Glückes Schmied”, or ‘Life is what you make it’. Even the ancient Romans knew that. Appius Claudius Caecus told us that  ‘Every Man is the Architect of his Own Fortune’. I expect everybody has their favourite proverb but do we all follow the sentiment?Well, I think I’ve cracked it. For the whole of the year I was determined that apart from the odd stumble here and there my path would be smooth, that I would not let indifference, unkindness or bare-faced lying on the part of others, no matter how close the connection, push me into unhappiness or illness. And I’ve done it. Two separate relationships have made me very unhappy in previous years; one is severed completely and the other is cooling. So, that’s that. I am amazed at how easy it was in the end. I feel regret, but accept what is and cannot be changed. Both situations have been fraught with unease and pain in the past, in both cases a catalyst caused me to stop and examine my motives for continuing with them, when there was no profit and all loss. It feels good.Half the young ladies in London spend their evenings making their fathers take them to plays that are not fit for elderly people to see.               G.B.ShawAll the pleasures and happinesses of 2014 have been modest, play-going chief amongst them. Thanks to a good friend we have had many trips to the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford; many more are planned for 2015. That wonderful new institution, Live Streaming from the foremost theatres in London, as well as the Royal Opera House, have meant that we hardly had to miss anything we crave. As well as going to poetry meetings in Knighton, over the border in Wales, we have resurrected poetry readings at our house once a month; wine and poetry in a circle of like-minded friends make for wonderful evenings which require little effort but give an inordinate amount of pleasure.A Book Is Like A Garden Carried In The Pocket.Chinese ProverbAren’t I lucky. I have both. An endless supply of gardens on my shelves and an outdoor garden for work and play. The balance has been shifting, I’ve allowed myself far more reading than gardening time during the year, partly due to the ease with which I can, thanks to a Kindle app, read for hours without stopping. Gardening has been important too but I’ve relaxed my harsh policy of eradicating every weed that dared show its face; or if a plant wants to lean over, muscling in on its neighbours' space, so be it. I will not chastise and imprison it in a rigid corset of stakes. Besides, I’ve dug up and given away many clumps of herbaceous plants this year to replace them with easily cultivated shrubs. But best of all is to be out in the garden in summer, drag a chair into the shade of a tree, fetch a drink and open a new book. Bliss. Writing is the only way I have to explain my own life to myself.Pat Conroy: My Reading LifeTo my great surprise, I’ve continued with blogging throughout the year. Had you asked me five years ago I would have said that this is an activity destined to last but a short time. I am posting less, reading fewer blogs, leaving comments only once or twice a week. I have made absolutely no effort to gain new followers and have cut down on the numbers of those I follow. But I am still blogging. It’s my only other addiction apart from a craving for chocolate. Will I give up either next year?I often think that the night is more alive and more richly coloured than the day.Vincent van GoghLeaning out of my window last night, breathing deeply to get rid of stale central heating air in my lungs before bed I looked up into a clear, cold, starry night. The swollen river hummed monotonously, deeply soothing to the spirit. The night was calm and so was I. Counting my blessings is not for me, but appreciating the joys of the simple life is. Whatever happens in the new year, I will be kind to myself."},

Peaceful co-existence may not be to everyone’s liking, but having experienced the opposite, this harmonious way of life is the one for me.But there is something else we are no longer passionate about, something probably far more controversial,Men grow too old for love, my love,Men grow too old for lies;and that is physical protest of any kind. Fighting the same old battles, over and over, to protect the environment, save the planet, take away from the rich and distribute to the poor, stop wars, stop hunger.Fat chance.Perhaps this is the unpleasant cynicism of age but, apart from making contributions in monetary terms, joining online pressure groups, and keeping our own footprint as light as possible, we now do nothing. When I watch those with two homes, a flat in the city and a house in the country, families with more cars than necessary, tourists flying to all corners of the world on short breaks and a couple of holidays a year, wailing over that poor polar bear stuck on his melting ice floe, I need to turn my back and bite my tongue. While we want to eat cheap and plentiful beef, the rain forests will continue to be destroyed. While we want to wear cheap t shirts, more and more people will have to work for hunger wages. While we want to own ever more gadgets, natural resources will have to be exploited until none are left. Someone, something, somewhere, always has to pay.I don’t say that we, Beloved and I, have become indifferent, by no means, but we can do very little beyond what we do and for the sake of our own peace of mind we now leave protesting to the ones who will need this planet long after we have left it.We accept our limitations.Food,Yes, food,Just any old kind of food.Pheasant is pleasant, of course,And terrapin, too, is tasty,Lobster I freely endorse,In pate or patty or pasty.2014 has seen the number of private social events shrinking too. And we don’t mind at all. Large parties are usually pretty boring, with all that standing around and shouting at each other;  small gatherings are less so, but only if the assembled company is easy to get on with. I used to do my utmost to ‘sparkle’, now I can barely muster a dull glimmer. The selfish gene has kicked in and I want return value for my effort. We still enjoy small lunch and supper parties for no more than six, both giving and receiving them. Even so, when we are the hosts the concentrated hard work before and afterwards requires at least half a day to recover.Health problems come in to it, of course. If your heart is liable to set itself off in violent protest at having to cope with excitement you soon learn to keep yourself subdued.

It is a filthy afternoon of biting winds forcing thin draughts of cold air through tiny cracks in the frames of well insulated doors and windows. All the same, the house is warm and cosy and the wind-flung rain spattering the window glass makes me glad I am indoors and there is no need to leave the house this evening. Millie must take her chances and use the garden tonight. I will neither take her nor chase her out in this weather.No season to hedgeGet beetle and wedgeCleave logs now allFor kitchen and hall.It’s perfect musing weather. With the year drawing towards its end I have been doing a lot of this lately,  a habit I indulge in at the close of most years. But this year something is different: I feel at peace with myself. No self-recriminations, no desperate desire to improve myself, my attitudes, no futile promises to do better, do more, get organised. No, I see no need for major change. Hubris, do you think? Coming before a fall? Yes, possibly.It’s also possible that this is something to do with age. The period between the childishness of youth - with some people it can reach well into their late thirties - and the onset of second childhoodWhen all my days are endingAnd I have no song to sing,I think that I shall not be too oldTo stare at everything;and the foolishness of old age can be a wonderful time. One feels adult, not driven by the opinions of others. On Helen’s couch this morning, waiting for her to start ministrations on my face, we got to talking about how good it feels to turn ones back on hurts and offensive remarks. “You know when someone says something or does something and you say to yourself ‘Right, I don’t want this to upset me, don’t want to let it get to me, just let it go, but you know full well that it will anyway, if not now then later?” she asked. “So when the time comes and you really don’t care, when you know that some people cannot help themselves but behave unpleasantly and for years you have been trying to ignore them and their barbs and criticisms, and then suddenly you do ignore them and shrug your shoulders?”“When you’re in control and not always looking over your shoulder to see how what you do or say goes down with someone else?”I am the master of my fate,I am the captain of my soul.We were agreed that the journey to self-confidence has many obstacles.  Helen is a good 25 years younger than me, if she has already reached the blissful state of indifference in the face of baleful mischief-making, she has done well. It took me many more years.All things considered, 2014 hasn’t been altogether fruitless. Beloved and I were having a conversation along similar lines last night; it’s seasonal, it seems.

{"title": "Permutations on Lamps and The People Who Owned Them - (V) ", "date": "Friday 28 November 2014", "text": "At Grammar School my trials and tribulations hadn’t quite come to an end, but I learned to keep my head down and follow the rules. I was now a pupil at a fee-paying Catholic Girls’ School, the child from a poor background and the offspring of communist/socialist atheists, who took their convictions seriously; I should therefore have been totally out of my element. Like many children lacking in confidence, I was only too happy to blend into the background; I’d had enough of being the focus of attention, temporarily anyway.I made friends with girls whose background was as unlike mine as possible; girls whose parents were well on the way to renewed prosperity, girls from professional backgrounds, business people, farmers who had got rich during the period when most people were starving, and the daughters of minor ex-Nazis. Germany's ‘economic miracle’ was taking hold but there was still a lot of confusion.The last time a lamp made a particular impression on me was at a birthday party at the house of one of these friends. Birthday parties were rare and modest affairs, and I didn’t really feel like going because Mum couldn’t give me money to buy a present. On the very few occasions I accepted an invitation all I could take was a tablet of chocolate or a second hand paperback. Sigrid was the daughter of a businessman, she had new clothes and a proper haircut and lived on one floor of a large house in a once well-to-do area. I remember the living room as enormous, although it would probably not be as grand today as it seemed to me then. The room was well and comfortably furnished, with a special and separate seating area near the large window: three upholstered easy chairs around a small table, and a standard lamp in the corner behind it. The lamp drew me like a magnet and I asked if we could sit there instead of at the dining table at the other end of the room. Sigrid was surprised when I sat down in the chair under the lamp, leaned back and stretched out my arms on the arm rests. In the end we sat on the carpet and admired her presents, until her mother came in with hot drinks and cake for the three of us, Sigrid,  Elke, whose war widow mother was a teacher, and me.I’ve got used to all sorts of lamps now; our lighting is slightly haphazard, some lamps have permanent positions, others are moved about the room to wherever they are needed. Ceiling lights are strong and have shades; Beloved with his poor eyesight likes them best and, if he had his way, they would all blaze away at the same time and cosy little corners with dim lighting would be done away with in our house.AfterwordWriting this necessarily abbreviated series has not been easy. I’ve smoothed over some of the rough edges, yet a whole host of painful memories came flooding back and I felt great pity for the sad and lonely girl who didn’t really fit in anywhere. As an only child I carried the full weight of my parents’ hopes and aspirations; inevitably, they were disappointed many times. Ungrateful, they called me when I displeased them yet again. “How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child. Away Away!” so said King Lear in a fit of rage to Cordelia, and, like her, I left.None of that matters now, one can’t live ones life in permanent regret for what happened in the past; it becomes a story to tell like so many other ups and downs one lives through; looking back, events become distant and unreal. There is, however, one aspect I regret very much nowadays, particularly when I read bloggers’ posts or listen to friends’ accounts about their close connections with siblings, the places they lived in as children and throughout adulthood, from school years to university and through professional lives. I envy the continuity and the ties that keep such lucky people firmly anchored and deeply rooted. I know that rarely do two people remember their joint past in quite the same way but I would love to be able to argue about it. I have lots of unanswered questions and no one left to ask, much less answer them."},
{"title": "Permutations on Lamps and The People Who Owned Them  (IV)", "date": "Monday 24 November 2014", "text": "Yes, there had indeed been a meeting, possibly the sort of thing that might be called an emergency council. We didn’t know about it at the time, it was much later that a fellow pupil in my new school told me in confidence, urging me never to reveal the ‘secret’. Or else her Dad, who was a member of the school’s governing body, would get into deep trouble. She also confided that her Dad and my Dad shared political sympathies; if these were known they would jeopardise his position. I was a loyal little body but also so cowed by now that I obeyed without thought, not even telling my parents. I don’t think I ever did.Herr Thomanek stood above us on the level half landing with Mum and me on the steps below him. His physical attitude was that of a bully but his voice had softened a little. He seemed to be uncomfortable and spoke quietly. I was crying enough not to be able to hear him anyway; Mum listened, she didn’t speak for a long time. She nodded and appeared to agree with him and said to me “I’ll tell you when we get home.” They didn’t explain or ask my opinion..Before we turned back down the stairs to leave I urgently wanted to make Thomanek understand that I never meant to be ‘cynical’ (whatever the word meant) and that I only smiled at him during lessons because I liked them. Hopefully, I lifted my tear-streaked face, but he turned abruptly, without looking at me.In the German Secondary School System Middle School was the less academic branch of higher education. Although core subjects were taught, i.e. foreign languages, maths, geography, history etc., the school for academically gifted children was the Grammar School, where subjects included classics, science, music, German literature, etc. School fees were higher and students stayed on to 18/19 years of age.At that time, in the 1950s and early 60s, both Middle and Grammar schools were occupying the same large building. It was one of the few in the town left unbombed and everywhere schools and other establishments budged up to make room for those who had lost their premises.The heads of both schools, their senior staff and representatives of the governing body, including my fellow student’s Dad, had decided that the situation in Thomaneks’ classroom had become toxic and it would be impossible to restore order. I would have to leave. I would be offered a place in the same year at the Grammar School; school fees would be waived and I would continue to receive a scholarship. It was to be hoped that I was bright enough to catch up. It was fait accompli. Take it or leave it. The alternative was to return to basic education in the ordinary compulsory state system for all children, which precluded any chance of further academic education. Nowadays the choice would be called a No-Brainer.Within days I was a Grammar School pupil. Some teachers disliked me from the beginning, rumours of misconduct had gone round both schools but, as now and always, gossip and rumours come and go. The girl whose Dad had spoken up for me and my parents befriended me, we discovered a joint liking for literature and poetry. I didn’t catch up in all subjects, certainly not in those I hadn’t been taught for three years, and I slipped from being top of the class to somewhere in the middle. By and by new, younger teachers came for whom I was an ordinary pupil, not tainted with having caused a teacher’s fall from grace, and we took/didn’t take to each other as such things are arranged in the natural course of events.Middle School and Grammar School took outdoor breaks at different times but on the same school playground. Sometimes we’d overlap slightly and I’d see Thomanek doing supervising duty. I knew better than to smile at him and besides, he always turned his back on me.there’s a paragraph or two to do with another lamp to come and a bit of an afterword. But the drama is all over."},

If you have anything to say about what happens at school you have to bring it up there.”Mum stood her ground, but he wouldn’t budge. “You have no right to invade my privacy.” He continued to attack us, insisting that he was not going to discuss any complaints except at school. A time was fixed for the next day and we left, having achieved nothing. He had bullied us into submission but his extreme reaction made Mum determined not to let the matter rest. Thomanek knew this, he knew that he would have to answer for his behaviour; Mum, working class, with no more than a basic education and quite unsophisticated, would demand answers from the school establishment.Alas, she never got them. At least, not in so many words. In 1950s Germany most ordinary people kept their political allegiance, past and present, quiet. My parents, however, were among the few exceptions, foolishly perhaps, but definitely bravely, as they and the family had been during the whole of Nazi-Germany, for which they paid a heavy price. In the 50s the Cold War was raging, with divided and four-sectored Germany the buffer zone between East and West. Twelve million people had fled and migrated from East to West and, until the erection of The Wall in 1961 put an end to it, the mass exodus still continued.In the end, Herr Thomanek's persecution of me was not due to personal antipathy, but the politics of hatred and fear. He was one of those who had gone on the long trek from East to West.As a child I was sickly. Weak, under-nourished, too tall, too thin, with lung disease and all the ailments that befell children who had had a poor start in life. I wasn’t the only one, there were many of us. Twice I had been sent to sanatoria, once during the war to the mountains of Bavaria and once after the war to the island of Norderney in the North Sea. It was hoped that mountain and sea air would heal, or at least strengthen, my lungs.During the time I was a student in Herr Thomanek’s class, Dad was offered a place for me in a sanatorium on the Baltic coast by one of his friends in the Socialist Movement; the problem was the holiday would have to be during term time and require permission from the school authorities. Permission would probably have been granted had the sanatorium been anywhere else but in East Germany, the place many of the teachers at the local schools had called home and had been forced, or had chosen, to leave. Dad, in his naiveté, had committed a monumental blunder. Permission was refused and Herr Thomanek turned against one of his star pupils.Mum and I still had to meet him. She knew nothing about the politics of the staff room, all she knew was that her child was hurting and she wanted to know why.We met him during morning break on the half-landing between two floors, leaning against the stone banister. Thomanek was standing above us, looking down. I was half sitting in a window embrasure, crying bitterly all the time of the interview. Although he was physically in a position of superiority, he was noticeably quieter, even conciliatory. The Headmistress had spoken to him and advised that he try to calm Mum down. There had been a meeting, he admitted as much as that.But what would happen to me?to be continued"},

All would be well. I begged to differ. The cold was the perfect excuse for backing out. What teacher didn’t know was that I had long had cold feet and the nearer the day came the more terrified I became. \"No, Miss, I am certain the cold won't be gone in time and please excuse me from going on stage”.Snivelling little idiot.Frl. Optenberg was frantic. I hadn’t ever heard the phrase ‘The Show Must Go On’; Miss begged, cajoled, implored. I sneezed pitifully, then I had an idea. If it meant that much to her I’d get her a replacement. I’d get her Klara. Klara was plump, small, stupid and in possession of a much healthier, more powerful voice than my lung-sick one. Klara jumped at the chance and was so abjectly grateful that I began to doubt the wisdom of my abdication. Aladdin’s cave was no longer mine for half an hour twice a week.My cold evaporated, the day of the Christmas concert came and Klara was a great success. Neither Mum, Dad or I were in the audience.This was the beginning of a lifetime of doubt in my own abilities.Then came Middle School; I passed the entrance exam with flying colours and was granted a scholarship. There were school fees which my parents couldn’t afford, ends were barely meeting. Still pig-tailed, tall and very skinny and ten years old I joined children from varying backgrounds, some already well-off, particularly the children of farmers and professional people, and some from poor backgrounds like mine, on scholarships. We scholarship kids were the bright ones, the kids from the farms the least able. (That’s not prejudice, that’s how it was. After the war many farmers were rich, had their girls been bright enough they would have gone to Grammar School, where the fees were higher.)Herr Thomanek was my form master. I adored him and he seemed to enjoy teaching me. For three years all went well. When kids from professional households made fun of my pronunciation of foreign words he shut them up and patiently explained where these words came from and how to pronounce them. Herr Thomanek was my favourite master and I had a bit of a crush on him, as a thirteen year old  might.When from one day to the next he turned on me I was devastated. Open-mouthed incredulity met every unkindness, every jibe at my expense, every shouted term of abuse. It’s no exaggeration to say that my form master bullied me unmercifully. He focussed the attention of the whole class on me. “There she goes, sneering again. That cynical grin of hers, look at it. What makes you so superior, I would like to know.\" Once I just couldn’t stand it anymore. I got up from my seat, howling in fear and frustration, making for the door. “Look at her, look how she runs and howls; exactly like one of the Furies.” I went home and finally told my Mum.That same afternoon Mum grabbed me and we went to Herr Thomanek’s house. His wife came to the door and said we couldn’t come in, they were about to have their evening meal. Mum insisted. For once she believed me without looking for confirmation elsewhere and she was going to get the truth out of him there and then.We were let into the sitting room. I was probably too distraught to take in details, but I instantly saw an old fashioned roll top desk in an alcove, with lots of papers on the open flap and a lit desk lamp on the shelf above.

(I)", "date": "Saturday 15 November 2014", "text": "\"I can’t stand a naked light bulb,amy more than I can a rude remark or a vulgar action”,Tennessee Williams’ Blanche Dubois in “A Streetcar Named Desire” gives herself away with this line as someone who prefers illusion to reality; who believes that dressing up naked truth prettily makes everyone happier and everything pleasant and easy. “I don’t want realism, I want magic,” she says in a later scene.I woud hate to take Blanche as my role model but I admit, that as far as the softly glowing light of a prettily shaded table lamp - or standard lamp - is concerned, I am firmly of her opinion. It’s the kind of magic I want for myself. Standing lamps have always fascinated me, perhaps because such luxury was never my lot as a small child. Naked bulbs dangling from the low ceilings of cellars where Mum and I hid, the narrow glory hole of my bedroom or the slightly higher ceiling of the kitchen/sitting room in which we spent most of our time provided sufficient light but no comfort.  The apparent security and privacy of an individual light wasn’t mine to enjoy until I was an adult, in my own home. Once the hardship of the early postwar period was over, my parents had the means to buy lamps but, although ceiling lights were now provided with lampshades, table lamps were outside any experience they themselves had ever had. Light was a matter of necessity, not comfort; light had to be efficient, nothing more.Fräulein Optenberg was my Infant School teacher;  she lived with another woman and it was in their sitting room where I saw my first ever upright lamp. It was Advent and a school Christmas concert was planned and I was to go on stage and sing some songs, solo. I was bright and enjoyed singing;  for teacher to choose me from all other children was flattering beyond all measure. But I was also shy and inhibited. I had none of the natural confidence some children are handed in the cradle. Rehearsals were to be held at Frl. Optenberg’s and progressed well. The first time I went, properly cleaned up, my long hair plaited and in my Sunday smock, the two ladies invited me into a room the like of which I’d never seen before. It was probably very modest by today’s standards but to me it was like Aladdin’s cave. There was a carpet, a small dining table and chairs, a desk in a corner, a pair of easy chairs and, in the alcove by the window, a piano, and, on the piano, a table lamp. It was afternoon, the lamp was lit. Immediately I knew that I had no right to be in this room, a room like this was not for me, and that all my life I would strive to win one. I was seven years old.During the course of rehearsals a nasty episode happened. On the way home from school I daily passed  the house where Frl. Optenberg and her friend lived. On this particular day a group of boys, some infants like me, others up to fourteen years old, stood in front of her house, shouting and jeering. I couldn’t make out what it was they were shouting and when I did, I couldn’t understand what the word meant. ‘Mannweib’, the boys shouted, over and over. (Literally ‘Mannish Woman’, ‘Virago’.) I saw Frl. Optenberg appear at the window and I ran off, I didn’t want her to think that I was part of the rowdy group of children, the numbers now swelled by other girls returning home from school. I told my Dad what I had heard and he said to take no notice, that the boys were naughty and rude. The next time I went to rehearsals I stammered that “it wasn’t me who shouted at you” to Frl. Optenberg and she smiled and said “I know, child.”The day of the concert came nearer and I caught a cold.to be continued."},

{"title": "A Family Reunion - All Saints Day -  Part III", "date": "Thursday 30 October 2014", "text": "The more specific maintenance of the graves fell to Uncle Peter and Aunt Katie. They often grumbled about it. Grandfather, who owned the plots, felt that it was only right and proper that the task of looking after the family graves should fall to his surviving son. He was the only one still living in the family home, rent free, as grandfather frequently pointed out. Aunt Johanna, one of his daughters, who lived in  a village less than an hour’s walk across the water meadows away and whose husband had a truck, pleaded ill health, which made her cry a lot every time somebody asked her to do something. Uncle Peter and Aunt Katie carried on working on the graves, spending time and money they could ill afford.  Aunt Katie liked to keep the peace, besides, there was nowhere else for them to go, they were dependent on grandfather’s goodwill. The old man spent little time thanking Aunt Katie for the hard work she did for him, the way she put up with his moods, fell in with his demands and tolerated his high-handed and sometimes scornful treatment of his son, her husband.The mourners for the day stood around in the biting wind, murmuring platitudes and wishing themselves out of it and back in Aunt Katie’s warm kitchen, but not quite daring to suggest retreat for as long as grandfather stood his ground.“I wonder who’ll be next”, they said, each hoping it wouldn’t be them but allowing enough suffering into their voices to imply it might be.“All gone, all of them gone, who knows where.”“Stupid woman,” I heard father whisper to mother, “dead and gone, with nothing left of them, that’s where.” Father was getting tetchy, mother’s family could be trying at times. He had long ago fallen out with two of his siblings and disliked his own father heartily.“The old man is going to catch his death of cold”, his daughters muttered, “somebody should get him to move.”Grandfather was a stubborn old man, he knew the family had had enough but he would be the one to decide when it was time to leave, be the wind ever so chill. He had lost his wife many years ago and celibacy and loneliness had hardened his once kind heart.But even grandfather couldn’t go on ignoring the cold seeping into his old bones. “How much longer do you want to stay here,” he asked, sounding impatient for the others to make a move. “We’ve done what we came for.” He’d done nothing. “I for one have had enough and I’m off, stay if you want.”He turned away from the graves and without a backward glance went towards the centre path dividing the cemetery, and made for the main gate.Women and children scuttled after him, The men followed in a more deliberate, statelier procession.The short day was ending, we had a train to catch, the widow of grandfather’s second son and her two children had an hour’s walk ahead to reach their home in the next village the other side of Muehlhausen.. Only Uncle Hans had brought his family in his truck. It was too soon after the war, long before the economic miracle took hold; nobody else in the family owned more than a bicycle. Petrol was expensive and not easy to come by, and Uncle Hans never offered anyone a lift.Aunt Katie provided coffee, while the women cut sandwiches; the talk was loud and free now, the relief at having escaped for another year palpable. They were alive, they had survived, not just the day but the years of hardship and terror lay behind them. Life was still a struggle but they could see the promise of a future without fear. “See you at Christmas”, they said jovially, and “get home safely”. The men slapped each other on the back and the women hugged and smiled broadly.The kitchen heat had warmed the blood. My coat felt heavy and unnecessary, my hat and mittens itched. I wanted to take them off, stay here and climb the stairs to the cold attic and get into bed with Gisela.“Kommt gut nach Haus”, Aunt Katie shouted after us from the open cottage door as we trudged back to the station. The night was dark, there was no street lighting. I clung to father, who held my hand. Afraid of the dark, afraid of the potholes waiting to trip me up, I stumbled along as fast as I could.Nobody in the family was ever late for anything, setting out in good time was a virtue. Perhaps their generation had had punctuality and reliability drilled into them to the extent where it had become second nature.We arrived at the tiny, single-storey brick-built station and the waiting room with its wooden benches with enough time to spare before departure, for me to study the signs over two doors in one side of the room once again. I was a good reader from an early age, but these signs defeated me. “HOMMESGENTLEMEN” and “DAMESLADIES” they said in capital letters. Each time I saw them I separated the syllables, saying them quietly to myself. “hom – mess – ghent – lem - men” and “dah-mess-lah-dees”.When I asked mother what the words meant she said “they’re Klosetts; do you need to use them?”  “No thanks,” I said, but was no wiser than before. “Toilets?” Klosetts were called ‘Männer’ and ‘Frauen’ not these strange words which made no sense to me.On the journey home the monotonous rumble of the train rocked me to sleep.  Father was still an invalid and not strong enough to carry me on to the connecting train at the market town and he certainly couldn’t carry me on the walk home from the station to our house in St. Toenis.During the last half hour I made slow progress. My legs ached. Shivering with cold and tiredness, I stumbled along in the middle of the road, mother and father almost dragging me, both of them holding me by a hand.  “Not far now”, they said encouragingly, “home soon.” It had been a very long day."},

{"title": "A Family Reunion - All Saints’ Day - Part II", "date": "Wednesday 29 October 2014", "text": "Aunt Katie’s welcome smile ushered us in. The black and white tiled hall of the cottage was unheated. We shed our coats, hats, scarves and gloves as  quickly as we could and  made for the kitchen-livingroom  where the round cast iron stove blazed fiercely. Grandfather was sitting in state on his sofa under the window; he didn’t get up for us, and we had to squeeze past the table in front of the sofa to shake his hand. I didn’t like to hug him, a peculiarly stale and dusty smell enveloped him, which offended my nose. Although we liked each other well enough, I was never his favourite grandchild; that honour belonged to my cousin Gisela, Aunt Katie’s daughter, who had lived with grandfather since the day she was born.I loved Aunt Katie. Her smile lit up her whole face and her deep blue eyes sparkled with pleasure. Her kitchen was always cosy, and the large kettle on top of the black stove sang a sweet song of hot drinks to come. The aroma of a good thick soup tickled my nostrils. I was always hungry at Aunt Katie’s; mother hated that. She never stopped complaining about what she called my greediness in Aunt Katie’s kitchen and my lack of appetite at home.“Let the child eat if she’s hungry,” Aunt Katie blustered in her forthright manner. “Food in other people’s houses is always tastier than food at home, that’s how it is. Everybody knows that.”By and by Aunt Katie dished up and we all ate her nourishing soup and a piece of good country bread to mop up the last drop and wipe the bowl clean.Soon other members of the family arrived and grandfather’s cottage began to feel very small. It was time to wrap up again and walk to the cemetery, which was a mile out of the village. We children were not excused the trek, honouring the dead was a duty we learned to perform early.Once out of the village, a forbidding reddish brown brick wall rising to more than two metres loomed out of the mist. It was breached by equally tall wrought iron carriage gates which rarely opened. The only other entry into the nunnery and convent school, for that was what lay behind the wall, was a much smaller gate let into one wing of the carriage gates. To the villagers the nuns were mysterious creatures, who  never left the convent but allowed services to be held in their chapel on special occasions and, if you paid them, for funerals and weddings. No village child attended the convent school in those days. Cousin Gisela and her friends thought it a spooky, frightening place; they told each other gruesome stories about little girls being whipped and kept prisoner within the high walls. Whenever we visited grandfather, I refused to walk past the gates without holding on tightly to a grown-up, for fear of a hand reaching out and dragging me inside.The convent was the last building we passed before we left the main road and took the turning towards the cemetery, an avenue of mighty horse chestnut trees, the candle decked branches a picture in spring, but now dark and bare, shiny brown conkers freed from their prickly wrappers sprinkled in the thick layer of dead leaves underfoot.The cemetery itself was enclosed by low stone walls, with wrought iron gates, wide enough to allow entrance to a hearse, in the side facing the road. There were no other buildings, no chapel, no trees, just bare open fields in all directions; only the dead safely tucked up underground could escape the bitter East wind and its spiteful, bone-chilling whistle. I kept close to the larger adults, their bulk affording my skinny little frame a small measure of protection.It was the custom in our family that Aunt Katie and her husband, my mother’s brother, my Uncle Peter, ordered wreaths and flowers in the village and that the others paid for their share on the day. Uncle Peter had only very recently returned from a prisoner-of-war camp in Russia, and his little barber shop barely earned him enough to feed his family. Grandfather, whose savings languished untouched, didn’t like to advance him the cost of the wreaths, which meant that the flower seller didn’t get his money until after All Souls Day.Traditional grave decorations were bouquets and wreaths of asters and chrysanthemums, interwoven with ivy and holly and ferns and backed with fir twigs. The men had been carrying them and now they were fussing over their position on the graves. Mother’s family had three plots, all in a row, one large family grave reserved for couples and two narrower ones for single men and women, much like the large wooden sided double beds and the narrower cots in the bedrooms at home.When each man was satisfied that his contribution had a prominent enough place on the graves,  the women lit everlasting candles, which burned from the afternoon of All Saints’ day until the morning of the day after All Souls. The candles were placed in small lanterns, heavy based to stop them toppling over in the wind, and set on flat stones, each of which denoted the final resting place of an ancestor or sibling. Great grandparents lay there, grandmother too, and uncles and aunts who had died young. There was room for grandfather and a few more awaiting their turn.“The graves are looking good this year, the cemetery gardener has done well. \" He always did, he was conscientious about performing his task. “Very orderly the way he’s raked the pebbles;  zigzags are so attractive.\"If you owned a grave, you paid a small annual sum for general maintenance to the cemetery authorities.“We must do something about the headstone, is it leaning to the right, do you think? And what about the moss, shouldn’t somebody clean it off?” There was always someone finding fault. Making a fuss made the complainant look concerned.to be concluded tomorrow."},
{"title": "A Family Reunion - All Saints’ Day - Part I", "date": "Tuesday 28 October 2014", "text": "In November the wide and fertile flatlands of the Northern Rhineland cower in the path of angry storms, which travel unimpeded for thousands of miles across the North European plains from as far away as the Urals, mercilessly sweeping a never-ending army of lowering clouds before them; when they arrive, trees in the woods huddle close together, bending their crowns and weeping raindrops into muddy puddles; October’s fireworks are dead and gone. Fallen leaves rot underfoot, the air is dank and in the lanes, along the banks of hidden brooks and by secretive ponds, in the copses and clearings in the woods, where timeless mosses grow deep and soft, the smell of mould is all pervasive.  Grey days lean heavily on the bony backs of black and white cows, listlessly standing in damp meadows, yearning for shelter, while white mists rise from the ground like shrouds abandoned by the long dead.November wears a mourning band.The feast of All Saints on the first of the month is followed by the feast day of All Souls, the day when tradition demands that we remember our dead. It is the day when families get together at the graveside of those they have lost.In my childhood, we travelled to my mother’s home village;  Allerheiligen or All Saints was a solemn public holiday.  Early in the morning of the feast day, before daylight had fully woken, we stood out in the open on a draughty station platform, stamping our feet and rubbing mittened hands curled into fists to keep warm, clouds of breath visible in the morning chill. The station consisted of a wooden hut, where the stationmaster sheltered from the worst of the weather, and a pair of wooden benches for the convenience of passengers, one each on the down line and the up line. Here we waited on the edge of the down line for the train to transport us from St Toenis, the small village where we lived, to the sleepy little hamlet crouching among aspen lined streams and mist shrouded fields, where grandfather’s house stood. Muehlhausen was no more than one long street, a continuous row of houses lining it on both sides; occasionally a farmyard interrupted this line, leaving a broad strip of muddy, grassy verge free between it and the road. Wherever a break occurred, a ditch ran along the side of the road, nearly always half full of stagnant water. In winter the ditch froze over and children, their feet shod in clogs, skated upon the run of ice. Halfway along the village street stood a chapel dedicated to St Vitus. Every time we passed the tiny chapel, which was really more a shrine than a chapel, I expected to be smitten with St. Vitus’ Dance and start jerking uncontrollably. I had been warned not to get too near the Saint’s statue and certainly never to touch the icon or remove the flowers devout villagers had placed in his niche. Grown-ups always assumed children would do damage and needed dire warnings to stop them.A long slow whistle pierced the gloom of the station platform, announcing the arrival of the smoke plumed train, the engine showing its displeasure at being forced to stop by hissing hot steam in all directions. We were usually the only people embarking; knots of people alighted, pulling their coats close about them as they stood for a moment on the platform; the men settling hats more firmly and women fussing with children’s shawls and woolen caps and securing their own scarves more tightly under their chins, before they started the cold walk down the Chaussee into the village and thence the cemetery, bound to perform the same offices for their dead as we were.The stationmaster held aloft his red signal disk, and put the whistle to his lips. Doors slammed shut, a short blast on the whistle sent out a shrill warning and the disk slapped down. The locomotive hissed once more, the train chug-chugged into motion. The smoky plume renewed itself triumphantly above the carriages.Black and white cows floating on deep cushions of pure white mists briefly looked up as the train drifted past and an occasional avenue of poplars marched into the distance. Farmhouses, embraced by barns on three sides, lay low, broad and solid among them, sheltered from the prevailing East wind by a stand of oak or beech.Inside the stuffy carriage with its wooden seats you could smell the smoke snaking back from the engine; the fug and regular rat-tat-tat of the wheels induced a light doze. “Don’t fall asleep,” father chided me, “you know it takes you forever to shift yourself.” Father had to stay alert, it took less than an hour to reach the small market town where we had to change to a branch line which would take us to just one village away from the hamlet where mother’s family home stood. The train’s destination was Kaldenkirchen, a town on the Dutch border. Up to now it had been slow, with frequent stops at villages along the way, but once past the junction with the branch line, where we would have to change trains, it would gather speed and make for the border without further delay.Although it was fully daylight now, I found it hard to alight into the cold, damp, air at our destination. The open road from the station to grandfather’s house was the part of the journey I liked the least; the wind blew across the fields, the mist clung in cold droplets to my nose and eyelashes, blurring my vision. I constantly wiped my sleeve across my face.to be continued tomorrow"},

It had long blown out its destructive fury across the other side of the world and the gales and rain storms it brought our way were unpleasant but not deadly, although a woman was killed when a tree fell on her.Sitting in the conservatory this morning,  looking out at the high winds playing with trees and shrubs and listening to small twigs, beech mast and leaves cluttering on the glass roof, I felt snug and warm and safe. Breakfast over, but the day not fully begun I was counting out pills and capsules - all supplementary vitamins, minerals, fish oils, plant sterols, glucosamine and chondroitin, etc. etc. for the next twenty days, thinking how soon daylight will end at four pm again and I will once again struggle to cope with SAD.It’s my name day today, Oct 21. I don’t celebrate it as I would in Germany, in fact, I usually forget it. Ursula was adopted as a Christian saint and a great embroidery of innocence, piety and sacrifice was stitched around her in a long, involved and frequently changing legend, (depending on who is telling the story).A more interesting story can be read in a 6000 year old script, 'Old Europe Script’,  symbols invented by ancestors of the Celts,  seen by some as the earliest proto-language. which refers to the ‘Bear Goddess’ : The Bear Goddess and the Bird Goddess are the Bear Goddess indeed. It could mean that the bear goddess and bird goddess merged into a single goddess.  Some archaeologists have claimed that the bear is the oldest European deity. I like this historically equally unproven story better than the legend of the holy maiden who was martyred for her piety.Looking into the Perpetual Almanack for inspiration I found this short entry for Oct 22:**By Tradition, the anniversary of Creation:“In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth. Which beginning of time, according to our Chronology, fell upon the entrance of the night preceding the 23rd day of October, in the year 4004 before Christ.”James Ussher  -  The Annals of the World 1658**I thought that William Blake’s work “Europe a Prophecy\"The Ancient of Days, copy K from the Fitzwilliam Museum, would be a fitting end to Ussher’s pronouncement and to this rather cobbled together blog post.It’s been one of those days."},

{"title": "SHORTS: False Assumptions", "date": "Wednesday 15 October 2014", "text": "The party was huge, with people crowding everywhere; a Brazilian friend of the hosts was singing Latin American popular songs and guests stood around in knots, craning their necks to see the singer. The overflow was in the hall, and others, who had no interest in the music, were talking in subdued voices, either in the rooms nearer the front of the house or blocking the entrance door.She left halfway through the concert, having to go to her own house to see to some dishes of party food  she’d left to finish cooking, before taking them back to the hosts’; a neighbour had promised to help her carry the two large, heavy dishes. She’d asked him to follow her home in about fifteen minutes.When he arrived he said the concert hadn’t finished and they decided to have a glass of wine while waiting for the food to continue browning. They also assumed  that they would find it impossible to push through the crowds and force their way into the kitchen. Ten minutes later they checked the food and it was fine. Taking the dishes out of the oven they realised that they were far too hot to carry, even wearing oven gloves. They decided to have another glass of wine while waiting for the dishes to cool a little. They took the bottle into the living room, sat down and started a conversation.When they returned to the party they found they had been missed. They were greeted with cries of “where have you been?” The concert had ended just a few minutes after the neighbour had followed her to fetch the dishes and food was to be served immediately. Various assumptions had been made as to the reason for their delayed arrival. 'Had she suddenly fallen ill - she was usually so very reliable - had the food been spoiled, had they slipped on wet grass, had one of them tripped over the bars of the cattle grid in the dark, had they dropped the dishes . . . . . .'Not aware of having done anything wrong, they didn’t apologise.

{"title": "In The Kitchen and Elsewhere", "date": "Friday 10 October 2014", "text": "The weather is changing, high winds and squally showers, a lot of them quite heavy, make being outside unpleasant. I’ve said it before: I am strictly a fair weather gardener. Perhaps I’ll take to tending my rather neglected blog again, now that autumn’s here. But for today I had other duties.My friend Sally asked me to make a culinary contribution to her big birthday party tomorrow, so that’s what I started on this morning: the bottom half of a cottage pie to feed about ten people. I’ll do the top half tomorrow, as well as a pudding of similar dimensions.  As I was in the kitchen anyway, I decided to prepare a mackerel pate as a starter for our own Sunday lunch - pate does better when the flavours have had time to blend.Doing the vegetables for the meat layer of the cottage pie, I thought I might as well do the vegetables for our Friday lunch, which was to be baked chicken, rice, carrots, sweetcorn and leek, saving me having to start all over again later.By now I was resigned to finding no time for anything else, so I did a couple of loads of laundry while waiting for the various constituents of the meals to cook. Beloved came in now and again, asking “can I do something, like peel a grain of rice maybe?” but when he got round to it, I was usually at the stage where you do not want 'outside interference’ and I shoo’d him out again.Things brightened up a bit in the afternoon and Millie and I rushed out for a very short walk once round the castle and a sniff of the breeze up on the bailey. Millie has been back at the Vet’s for another minor operation, this time an exploration of her ears. She was most unhappy when I took her into the back rooms at the surgery and she was, again, very unwilling to allow herself to be shoved into a small cage prior to being sedated for her examination. I bet she rues the day when she was adopted by her new, unfeeling family, who seem to be doing nothing but letting her in for all sorts of indignities. Poor sweetie. The cause of her facial lesions has still not been determined.  I am hoping that autumn will bring relief, what with the impact of both seeds and insects lessening. Either could be causing the allergy.In the short spell of brilliant sunshine the freshly washed hills looked welcoming but we decided not to risk a longer walk. We found a small tortoiseshell sunning itself on the path. There was a whole flutter of half a dozen or so of them, probably the new generation hatched in August/September, which will live through the winter,  often hibernating in garages and sheds, or even inside houses in the corners of ceilings and under curtains and pelmets."},

{"title": "For The Love Of Autumn", "date": "Tuesday 30 September 2014", "text": "Every year round about this time, in common with many other bloggers, I post pictures of autumn colours. Trying to ring the changes, I’ve given the posts various titles, ‘Autumn Cheer’, Autumn Leaves’, 'Autumn Tints’ etc., but basically they are a celebration of this most spectacular season of the year. I don’t get bored setting out and admiring the splendour all over again; after all, this kind of beauty remains inspirational, and repetition does nothing to diminish it. Not as far as I am concerned, anyway.This is the view from an upstairs window of the cherry tree and the sun-kissed stems of a rowan, with the wooden bridge over the river visible through the trees.Another perennial favourite is this Virginia creeper on a neighbour’s house which is only just beginning to turn. My own is a little later in the season and burgundy-coloured.Even the very ordinary and utterly humble ground cover workhorse, the prostrate juniper, useful as weed suppressor and for winter colour, becomes attractive when brown leaves nestle in its folds.Nothing humble about this spectacular variety of spirea! Golden in spring, it really comes into its own this time of year. I have two bushes growing side by side. When I look out of the window during late afternoon, when the sun streaks into the garden from much lower down on the horizon than it does in high summer, they positively glow. I took this photo after an overnight shower. Viburnum opulus is another common or garden tree/small shrub (cut it to whichever size you want) which shows its true colours in September. The leaves will turn yellow before they fall and the fire-engine red berries hang in generous clusters; birds gorge on them until none are left.(btw, although viburnum opulus has been adopted under the name ‘European cranberry in the US, it is absolutely nothing to do with the fruit) Two very common wildflowers brighten disturbed verges and open grassland in September. Pink rosebay willowherb has lost the fluffy seed heads, exposing the bottle brush like flower stems.Willowherb is such a pest, self-seeding everywhere, but I have to admit that it is really quite spectacular and I am willing to admire its architectural qualities when situated nowhere near my garden.Another familiar sight in waste places, roadsides and hedgebanks is yellow tansy, with its 'gentleman’s buttons' bundles of flowers. Once upon a time tansy was a culinary herb, French chefs used it when preparing omelettes in much the same way as we use fines herbes today. Our palates have become less sturdy than those of our ancestors, the rather spicy savour is too overwhelming for modern tastes.I’ll leave you with the wise words of a gardener in charge at Kew Gardens Arboretum. On the news today, he was asked by a reporter if we should get worried about the extremely dry September we have just experienced.“Oh no”, he said, stretching each word with his flat Yorkshire vowels.  “No need to panic. Nature’s great. It’ll all work out in the end.”He also promised us a very colourful autumn. Bliss."},
{"title": "As Happy As A  Cow", "date": "Saturday 27 September 2014", "text": "in a meadow full of juicy clover.That’s me.A week ago I needed to check the internet consumption on my iPhone. Vodafone told me I was nearing my monthly limit and would have to pay extra for further use.  Investigation was needed. There’s this handy app called ‘My Vodafone’ but, somehow, I couldn’t download it. Vodafone promised to help. “You’re not fully registered”, the chap said. “You need to be fully registered first, before you can download the app”. Not fully registered? I’ve used the phone for nearly a year and paid the monthly bill by direct debit.The chap accessed my phone (with my permission), fiddled and faddled, registered it and downloaded the app. “Fine,” I said, and “thank you very much.”Very quickly I noticed that internet access had slowed down to almost a standstill. Mysteriously, my IP address had changed to an unrecognisable set of figures. More investigation. More Vodafone chaps. Three of them, in fact, each taking about an hour to tell me they couldn’t help. Over several days.If you are anything like me you will know how I felt. Lost, injured and insulted, confused; like a patient coming round from an operation to find that the surgeon has forgotten a foreign object in her innards; furthermore, a surgeon who has no idea how to remove the instrument.Then I thought I’ll ring Apple Inc. They’ll know. Three hours later the new iOS 8 was installed on my phone but the interloper IP address remained obstinate and immovable. Thanks for trying, kind and patient Tiger in Kentucky. I had a lovely time chatting with you throughout but, in the end, you had to refer me to Alex, iOS Senior Advisor, who took me through the whole process again; sadly, again without success.Overnight I had an idea: switch off everything, disconnect all Apple gadgets as well as the router, leave the lot to stew for an hour and reconnect them all at the same time. As an amateur with a colourful imagination I thought the four of them could encourage each other to whoosh along the same wifi path and come up with a single address between them. Preferably the correct one.It worked.So what, you may say. We’ve all been there. This is boring.But now comes the extra special bit, an instance of Customer Service which is pretty much unheard of in the UK.  A day later, Alex Tanner, the iOS Senior Advisor, rang all the way from Kentucky to find out if my internet access had been restored, and, if not, he was offering to get in touch with talktalk, my broadband company, himself.  I couldn’t even find a talktalk helpline!Luckily, there was no longer any need. Instead, I asked Alex to help me install iOS 8 on my iPad, which he promptly did.In the US you may be used to such service, as a UK citizen I am certainly not.So, thank you once again, Tiger and Alex, all the way over there in Kentucky in the offices of the Apple helpline.I am glad to say I am back in the Land of the Connected."},
{"title": "Self Pity And Other Vices", "date": "Thursday 18 September 2014", "text": "When delving into the philosophy of how best to live life in midlife and beyond, many bloggers stress the importance of remaining productive, being positive, keeping busy, working for others via charitable deeds, and practicing gratitude for everything life hands out, every breath we take, every additional day we are granted. Idleness, self-indulgence, a bout of self-pity, a moan about ’the unfairness of it all’, some healthy self-interest, are castigated as unworthy, foolish, sinful. There’s that little word ‘self’ again. Perish the thought it should get a foothold!Well, I don’t agree. Not in the blanket, no-deviation-allowed-ever way.What did the ancient Greeks call a person who takes the afternoon off instead of concentrating on filing her (overdue) tax return? A lotus-eater! A diet not to be sniffed at in my opinion. What’s the point of having reached that famous midlife and beyond point if I’m still flogging myself into a frenzy of activity?I am looking up poems for tomorrow’s poetry group meeting. The subject is ‘Happiness’, which, according to the advocates of all those virtues mentioned in the first paragraph, is the sure-fire result, if only you practice what they preach.Guess what, not a single poem on Happiness I found, praises relentless positivity, busyness, rattling through the days on a quest for achievement, aching muscles and a to do list with every item crossed off. A bunch of lotus-eaters if ever there was one, these poetry merchants. They are happiest lying on their back in the grass, watching drifting clouds,  their reverie interrupted by the cries of a flock of geese. That’s all they need to set off a train of thought ending in something as fleeting and immaterial as a poetic idyll. (Unless they are enclosed in an attic, starving and warming their hands on the pitiful flame of a candle stub.)I’m all for it. (The lying in the grass, not starving in a garret)As for the most vilified sin of all, self-pity, who can say that they are entirely free of the occasional bout? Why is it considered to be particularly disgraceful? I see it as neither a virtue nor a vice, but simply an inevitable emotion. Others may sympathise with our misfortune, but the moment affairs of their own divert their attention, we are alone again, unconsoled. We have to be sorry for ourselves: nobody else can sympathise with us as steadily, as loyally as we, and it is from such sympathy that we draw strength to put a decent public face upon our misfortunes.I’ll allow gratitude. Aesop, another ancient Greek, said ‘Gratitude is the Sign of a Noble Soul’. But I doubt he meant it in the sense of being grateful for all the nasty surprises life has in store for us. When the people of Delphi sentenced him to death on a trumped-up charge of temple theft, he cursed them. After they’d thrown him to his death off a cliff, the Delphians suffered pestilence and famine."},

Not only all good things, all bad things come to an end. It’s been that kind of a week. Up and down.George rang to say that  Millie’s biopsy lab results had come in. Would I like to come and discuss them with her. (George is a girl vet, real name Georgina; I don’t think she can remember far enough back to when she was last called that.) Well, she said. why do things the easy way when complicated is an option. Talk about unusual, she said; personally, I’ve never come across another dog with the same symptoms.“This sample shows an extensive area of ulceration and superficial necrosis. There is a heavy cellular infiltrate dominated by granulocytes with a substantial number of eosinophils. There is haemorrhage. Lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages are also present. . . . ....locally severe ulcerative dermatitis . . . . eosinophilic folliculitis and furunculosis of the face is present. . . .”Enough already, this is Millie we are talking about, Millie, who is a sweet and gentle creature with a rare ability to stick her nose into all sorts of dungheaps and a well developed talent for scavenging, who loves everybody, animal and human and would never willingly forego the pleasure of demonstrating this love. The short diagnosis: Eosinophilic Dermatitis. No certain trigger, except possibly an allergy to arthropod bites or stings. Among even more uncertain other triggers. The only treatment for the condition is steroids. Although steroids hinder the healing process, the holes on Millie’s face are closing up; unfortunately, along the way she decided stitches didn’t suit her; she unpicked them,  and now she has a small scar on her nose which is permanent. All that before her second birthday in our house! (She’s nine-and-a-half now and going strong). In spite of her recent trials she happily comes for walks, although on our ramble to the blackthorn hedges on the Shropshire Way to pick sloes for Beloved’s wine making she appears to find her tongue a heavy burden to carry.Paul and I made some beautiful compost this week. He is shaping up to be a worthy successor to Gardener in that respect. I wish I could help lighten his mood, but he is a true clinical depressive and we just have to be patient and wait for his medication to kick in. I really should know that the dead-eyed monster cannot be influenced but, in spite of knowing, I still find myself chatting brightly and encouragingly. Idiot woman. There’s a large dollop of selfishness in my thinking: although I am deeply sorry for Paul, I am also desperately worried that I might have to find yet another gardener which would send me into another black hole, being one of the causally afflicted.Even on a dull day as here in this picture, our part of the world is an earthly paradise.It’s rotten luck that sometimes the golden fields of paradise are obscured by gloomy skies."},
{"title": "What’s HE Doing?", "date": "Saturday 6 September 2014", "text": "Thanks HilaryThe waiting room in the skin clinic was quiet; people were  reading, staring out of the window, occasionally shuffling their feet and drinking water from plastic cups filled at the water fountain. Although the clinic was busy, there were plenty of empty seats and the atmosphere was peaceful and patient. Everybody was middle-aged and older except for one young mother and her son, a little boy too young to be able to read but old enough to look at pictures and recognise what they depicted.I had my Ipad to read; there was one empty seat between me and the little boy and his mother. The centre table held a pile of magazines which soon engaged the child’s interest. He fetched one magazine after the other and plonked them on his mum’s lap; once he’d collected the whole pile he asked mum to open them and to look through them page by page. So far so good, he was perfectly quiet and didn’t really disturb anyone else, except those who might have wanted to glance at a magazine themselves.Now comes the bit I found to be worthy of comment: the magazines had pictures, the usual stuff,  people, cars, houses, etc. The little boy pointed to each picture in turn and said “What’s HE doing”, the emphasis on the ‘HE’ regardless of the subject.  Again, that in itself is no great cause for concern but to me the mother’s reaction to his unchanging question was. Invariably, patiently, kindly, she answered him by telling him that 'the car was shiny, the man smartly dressed, the house big, the lorry articulated', etc. etc. Never once did she do what to me would have been the most natural response, namely to invite the child to explore the picture with her and for the two of them to work out what was happening in it.After about the 20th ‘What’s HE doing’, I muttered under my breath ‘You tell me, mate’. He heard me and very briefly looked at me, but quickly turned back, continuing as before.Is learning really just being told what’s in front of you or is a great part of it discovering things for yourself, with the help of someone else naturally, working them out, browsing, getting them wrong sometimes but persevering nevertheless. It’s a long time since I had small children but I can’t remember ever just stuffing them with ready made answers to their questions. Not that they would have appreciated this, they probably complained that I ‘made a fuss’ and 'talked too much’.There is this lovely story about David Attenborough  -  Godfather of Natural History TV  and one of Britain’s National Treasures  -  as a young boy finding an animal bone in the garden and taking it to his father, a GP, who pretended not to recognise it. Instead, they pored over zoology and anatomy books together. “They shared the excitement of discovery.\"If one of the little people in your household shows open curiosity and a wish to explore, indulge them, and gently lead them on the path of discovery. You might even learn something new yourself."},
{"title": "Stupidity squared", "date": "Sunday 31 August 2014", "text": "I really shouldn’t give this book free publicity. Rarely have I been more cross with myself for wasting hours and hours on a book. Another 700+pager but, oh dear me, what a lot of rubbish.BookBub or a similar site were advertising the title as an Amazon ’special offer' ebook; as I’ve seen the author in the Guardian bestseller lists I thought I’d give him a go. Bestseller lists are by no means indicators of quality writing; I really must remember that for the future.So there you are in a story about the intended rape and plunder of a pharaoh’s hitherto unknown tomb with the regulation sets of baddies and goodies. The goodies do all the work and the baddies reap the benefits. Once, twice, three times. The goodies (who aren’t really much better than the baddies because they also plan to smash and grab for themselves rather than a worthy cause) don’t seem to learn that the baddies are only a step behind them at every turn and merrily and enthusiastically dislodge a whole river and mountain to get at the treasure, trusting all and sundry on the way with their secret (secret? shifting a river and half a mountain?) undertaking. Scores of people are mown down irrespective of creed, colour, holiness, except, of course, our heroes and heroines (yes, two very beautiful women also figure prominently).Naturally, the baddies die horribly, each separately and slowly and our heroes emerge victorious. Even more nauseating, the author inserts his name into the story as the famous chronicler of such derring-do throughout the book, just in case we forget who is serving up this delightful dish of tripe.Why did I persevere? a) because I am stupid andb) I wanted to see the ending.Although I skipped a lot of the book during the last third I was hoping he would surprise me and do what he did to the river: diverge into an untried channel. He didn’t, he stayed true to formula right to the bitter end."},
{"title": "Stupidity", "date": "Friday 29 August 2014", "text": "What is it with me and, no doubt, many others.You know that what you are doing isn’t good for you. Experience has shown that that is so and you have often paid the price. And yet, you refuse to learn.\"It needs doing”, is what you say. Or  “It’s my duty”.  Or  “But I enjoy it”.“Maybe this time I’ll get away with it”.“Let’s just test the waters, no more than a toe .... \"“I promise to stop at the smallest sign”.“I’m sure it’ll be alright”.Luckily, it was. At the first sign of trouble I stopped, terrified. Sat down, swallowed my medicines and waited. Pathetically whimpering “please, please, not again.”  Not out loud, of course, that would be too shameful. I do have a bit of dignity left, in case you’re wondering.Stretching up into the plum tree, picking what the birds had left, then heaving a dozen heavy fork loads of damp vegetation from one compost bin into the other, following this with filling the green wheelie bin ready for garden rubbish collection and dragging it 170 yards down the drive to the road, none of that would have fazed me before. In fact, it would have been barely a couple of hours work.I hate that I can’t do this now without repercussions. It’s not fair. Not bloody fair.How stupid of me that I can’t get it into my head that things are what they are and that the judicious application of common sense would ensure a relatively trouble free existence for many years to come.“Yes, but ..........\"Against stupidity the Gods themselves struggle in vain,” so old Friedrich von Schiller said.I left the fork leaning against the compost heaps. Every time I go by I pick it up, load it up and dump the load into the next bin. One or three forkfuls at a time. I wonder how long I manage to restrict myself."},
{"title": "Swings and Roundabouts", "date": "Saturday 23 August 2014", "text": "Did I sound just a tad smug in my previous post almost a week ago? Being self-satisfied and boasting about how good things are never pays off. Not for me, anyway. This week has been a humdinger for stumbling blocks and domestic misery.Paul the gardener called for a morning’s work; hardly had we got started when heavy clouds chose Valley’s End, and my garden specifically, to shed their load. Paul carried on regardless, so I couldn’t chicken out. We adjourned to the compost heaps under some large trees - the rain was less wet there - and chatted while we worked. Suddenly Paul burst into tears. “Sorry”, he sobbed, “I just don’t know what’s wrong, I’ve been very weepy and desperately depressed for days.” He knows that I understand, being a depressive myself, so I let him talk and made appropriate noises. There’s nothing else you can do. Eventually he calmed down and we continued working.I spoke to him a day later and he said that the cloud had lifted, he felt much better and hoped he wouldn’t need to weep into my compost next time. I suggested that peeing into the compost might be better than crying. We also agreed that it would be more productive if he didn’t top himself until he’d helped me to lick the garden into shape. Gallows humour. Depressives find that sort of talk funny.Then the dog came home with new lesions on her face. The last course of treatments was to have sorted them out permanently. Back we went to the Vet’s Surgery. “Come back in the morning”, Sarah said, “and let George have another look at her”.  George had seen her before, as had Anne and Percy, two other Vets. So that makes four opinions altogether, so far. George said all that remained to do was to take blood samples and undertake a biopsy under full anaesthetic.  Millie has become a very expensive dog, and there’s no end in sight to the Vet’s bills. But we love her.She had her op on the same day as Beloved had to be taken to hospital for a consultation with another one of his many specialists. This pretty much meant that I was on the road from nine in the morning to near six in the afternoon, ferrying Millie and Beloved around. I get tired and a long day’s driving and hanging about is not what I had planned for my old age. I was exhausted at the end of it, looking forward to some time off.Then, out of the blue and without any prior warning, two basins in the downstairs loo and bathroom seized up. Nothing would shift the water. A plumber was called and his attendance promised for the following day. And the day following that day. He still hadn’t called this morning. We have other wash basins, so the lack of these two in the bathrooms was inconvenient rather than serious . . . . . . . . . . . . until the boiler which supplies hot water and heating for the whole house packed up. It sits next to one of the basins.  One minute Beloved was doing dishes under running hot water, the next the water turned cold. The boiler man from Bosch was called and his attendance promised for next Thursday.“What?” “Next Thursday?”We had only just had a service done and paid through the nose for it. Bosch is a very reliable firm and they pride themselves on the perfect workings of their product. We wouldn’t dream of having any other boiler, and the only engineer we would let near it would have to be a Bosch trained one. They are expensive, but worth it for the peace of mind. Until something goes wrong . . . .“Calm down”, the lady at the other end said. “That’s just for the records. I will of course, right now, see if one of our engineers is in the area before next Thursday. I’ll be in touch”.She was as good as her word. The engineer called this morning. “Nothing much wrong with the boiler”, he said. I’ll fix a new fan, it sounds a bit rough. Still, while I’m here, I’ll have another look”.“Funny”, he said, \"the boiler seems to be full of water. Did you say this basin is blocked?”It turned out that the boiler is a condensation boiler and needs an outlet for the condensation it produces. (Aren’t I clever, I understood that!) And its outlet was blocked.I was ready to go spinning down the plughole myself by now. The plumber supposed to come and fix the blocked drains still hadn’t called. I rang Kevin, his boss, the owner and slave driver of the building company involved and complained - well, threw myself on his mercy. Beloved says I’m good with people like that. Besides, we frequently use the company and always pay our bills on time.Kevin came within the hour, had a chat with the boiler man who was just packing up his equipment and set to work.  He took apart pipes in both rooms, found nothing, opened manhole covers outside, found nothing, and scratched his head. “I’m going to have to take the bath panel off and see what’s under the bath”, he said. He did, found the blockage in a complicated junction of pipes from several directions, removed it, replaced the pipes, fixed the panel back into place, and after a bit of a clean and tidy up, you wouldn’t know anything had been amiss.So there you are, keep flushing your pipes thoroughly, and all will be well. I wish the same could be said for Millie and Beloved. Not to mention my own pipes."},

Days without plan, without purpose,days when I can land on any activity I fancy, at any time, suit me well.They don’t come around very often but this weekend was a real treat.Digging around in the ‘spare’ freezer I came upon two bags of last year’s plums.This year’s crop is all but ready to pick, so what to do with them?Why, make a few pots of jam, of course.o-o-o-oAnd then there’s the garden, an hour here and there is always a pleasure. It’s neither hot nor cold, fairly dry, perfect weather for some pruning, chopping back and even a touch of weeding. The clumps of daisies, faded now and wilting, have gone, weeds have been pulled from cracks in the paths and a few shrubs have been thinned and pruned. The currently freshly filled compost heap is gigantic; it’s needs turning and shovelling into the one next door, which is still filled with ripe and ready compost. That’ll be a job for Paul when he next comes.But there’s been a lot of standing and staring in admiration as well. The flame bush is out, the shrub border which has lost all its flowers is looking very interesting and the flower border proudly presents an attractive display of late summer flowers.Yes,  for once  I am pleased.Just look at clematis ‘Abundance’, climbing high up into the plum tree.  It’s name is a fitting one.  In one season, after being cut right down to the ground the preceding autumn, it climbs and rambles and spreads itself without thought for any other plant in its path; even a tree doesn’t stand a chance. Up and over it goes. The flowers last for weeks, right until the early frosts. Anyone who has a tree that looks better dressed up could do worse than try ‘Abundance’. It’s fully hardy too.Not a bad show for late summer.Yes, I am quite pleased, for once. I complain too much about weeds and mess and disorder,I should take a step back and look at the overall picture more often,forget about weeds.o-o-o-oA neighbour came to collect Millie for an hour’s walk this afternoon.Splendid!That meant that we could take our time over Sunday lunchand enjoy the best part of a bottle of Merlot with our meal.But I didn’t want Millie to feel abandoned by her mum so I gave her a very thorough brushing in the garden when she came home. That is a big pile of dead fur. During her last illness, which was most probably due to a deep seated infection caused by mites getting into the skin and erupting into small, bloody, craters all over her nose, she was on steroids and antibiotics and parasite repellent for her coat, all of which came with nasty side effects, making her feel a bit sorry for herself. The medication didn’t improve the condition of her coat either. But she’s getting better and the thoughtful expression on her face is mainly due to the close attention she is giving to a large treat in her mouth, which takes some serious chewing.o-o-o-oThe rest of the time I have been reading. A never ending yarn of 832 pages, ‘The Luminaries’ by Eleanor Catton, a hugely entertaining novel about the New Zealand goldrush of the 1860s. It’s a fascinating story of hardship and skullduggery,  a consummate literary page turner, intricately crafted and beautifully written. But it definitely requires staying power. I have reached page six hundred and fifteen.  An awful lot of words."},
{"title": "I Want Dogs' Ears, Please", "date": "Wednesday 13 August 2014", "text": "Last weekend we went to a dinner party, that high point of social interaction. Yes, there are still people who invite us; in case you are wondering why, I keep this blog secret. You know my general opinion of parties and social events, but some dinner parties are great. This one was. A group of bright, clever, articulate people assembled round the table in a convivial house, I really don’t know how we got through the IQ security gates; a temporary wand malfunction? There was a real life published literary novelist (not like so many of us blog scribblers calling ourselves writers when all we do is pen blogposts of questionable quality - yes, you in high dudgeon over there, I am including myself). There was a painter, again real life, a journalist and writer of academic books,  and assorted actors - teachers - singers. All very much real life. And, like I said, us.A dazzling company. No wonder the host forgot about my food allergy and cooked Coronation Chicken with creme fraiche instead of mayonnaise. He gave somebody who can’t eat red onions a side dish containing lots of them and another guest carefully examined the chicken for bits of mango. Mangoes bring on an asthma attack in him. (Notice that I am handing you an idea for an icebreaker if you ever need one at one of your own lavish parties?  Free of charge. Just make the food memorably inedible for a section of the guests and you’re more than halfway to a successful evening. Provide enough quality wine and the guests will be begging you for another chance to be poisoned by you).But the conversation was great. So was my food in the end. The host magicked me a delicious omelette in the blink of an eye. I was served before the other diners had had access to all the dishes going round.Getting back to the conversation - the two gentlemen either side of me were extremely adept socially, each spoke to me in turn.  Just as it should be. You turn to your partner on your left and then, at a suitable break in the conversation, or when the next course is served, you dazzle the lady on your right. And so on round the table.I  hate it when there are several conversations going on at the same time because I always want to listen to the other one. You could just have four people, of course, but then there wouldn’t be enough different viewpoints. And I admit to liking a rowdy table, particularly as the evening progresses. I noticed that the ladies sitting in the middle didn’t bother with dinner party rules: they just spoke across and to right and left as they pleased. This particular host frequently places me at the top end of the table, thereby putting me at a disadvantage, at least until we are all suitably relaxed and I can lean over, usually into the pudding, to catch what is being discussed at the other end.This is where dogs’ ears come in. Dogs can swivel their ears independently from each other, helping them to identify and capture sounds from different directions, even pick up sound from far away. They can hear things that haven’t even been said yet. As in thunder, for instance. Mille knows about thunder in the next county when I’m still chewing on the first course and she can hear a doggie biscuit tin rattle while she is deep in conversation (i.e. with her nose up another dog’s bottom) in the field by the river.Hang about though, I’ve just thought of another, more easily achievable way of not missing out at table: dinner parties with a round table. Then we will all be shouting across at each other! No tops or bottoms involved! In or out of the pudding."},

Maybe.We have a lot of bird visitors to the garden, most of them lbjs (little brown jobs), but we are also blessed with crowds of blackbirds and, even more fortunately, several pairs of beautiful song thrushes, all of whom seem to have survived the breeding season.We also have raspberry, worcester berry and gooseberry bushes growing close to a thick mixed holly, elder and maple hedge. The berry bushes used to be under netting in a fruit cage, but when this collapsed in heavy snowfalls, we didn’t bother to replace it. Laziness, lack of foresight, can’t-be-bothered-ness, call it what you will, we no longer have a fruit cage.Paul, my new gardener - henceforth only gardener - said he’d take some of the tart goose- and worcester berries off my hands. Beloved uses some to make wine, but the rest of the annual crop usually remains in the freezer; I can’t eat them in gooseberry fools because of the lashings of cream and I don’t much like them otherwise.So we took what we wanted for ourselves and left the rest for Paul and maybe any other interested parties to pick at their leisure. Unfortunately, the other interested parties turned out to be birds. Whenever I visited that part of the garden I heard scuttlings and scuddings and scrabblings and scratchings, which I took to be birds hastily seeking refuge from human intervention in the hedge; but the fruit remained on the bushes. Until one fateful morning: overnight every gooseberry, worcester berry and raspberry had disappeared,  not one single berry was left, the bushes picked clean as a whistle. A whistle and a quick cheap-cheap is all that the blighters left behind. They’re not even bothering to repay me in song.Paul took some of our frozen gooseberries home with him.The bird that feeds from off my palmIs sleek, affectionate and calm,But double, to me, is worth the thrushA-flickering in the elder-bush.so says the incomparable Dorothy Parker, but I don’t think so.*Fruitless fruit bushes are boring, I’m giving you a picture of my leucanthemums/argyranthemums/marguerites instead.

Fine, I said to myself, so you can’t go online to blog but you could prepare a blog post or catch up on emails. For a moment I was quite serious about that, eagerly making for the computer corner, until I realised that, no, I can’t do that either. I use the mac for writing, researching and blogging, ipads have small keyboards, they’re of no use to me for ‘proper’ writing.There was definitely something missing to which I have become seriously addicted. How do people who say they have no need of a computer manage to live with themselves?After an absence of a day and a half mac’s R&R was over and I could fetch him (him?) home. Mike the macman explained that all was well again and that he’d added an extra 2Gb of RAM to the measly 1Gb available on such old (old? OLD?) desktop computers and that that would speed it up a bit and that he’d sorted out a lot of inconsistency on the hard disk. I felt exactly as I do at the Vet’s when I pick up Millie after a minor op. I embraced my mac as I embrace Millie and put him on the back seat. Millie only gets to ride in the boot (of the hatchback - last time I mentioned that Millie rides in the boot somebody threw up their (blogging)-hands in horror at the very idea of such cruel incarceration).But here comes the contrary bit: once I’d carried the mac upstairs to my study and set him up on his desk, I reconnected everything, checked that all was in working order and promptly ignored him for the rest of the day.A bit like a man; it’s nice to know they’re around to use anytime you need them."},

You speak of the support they give, how they help out when there is need, how you enjoy each other’s company, the hours you spend together for no particular reason, just being friends.I always say I have acquaintances, not friends. Being able to make friends seems to elude me, it’s not one of my, admittedly few, talents. It doesn’t occur to me that anyone would want to seek my company, although I am quite reasonably polite and not altogether socially inept. Just not madly forthcoming.And yet, to my surprise, there are people here in Valley’s End who want to spend time with me, just like that. Not for any ulterior motive. Even an intolerant old grouch like me finds that gratifying. There was an Open Studio event the other day; a dozen or so of the many artists living here opened their doors to give the rest of us an idea of how they work (and perhaps sell a few pieces). Not only did somebody suggest we accompany each other on these visits, but I was also greeted by a few people I hadn’t seen socially for some time with warmth and pleasure. All most encouraging. Thank you.o-o-o-oMy mac is going to a nice man  for a little bit of care and attention tomorrow morning.

{"title": "Women in Medicine", "date": "Sunday 27 July 2014", "text": "Mediaeval IllustrationThey say you can tell you are getting old when you see policemen getting younger. You know you must be old when your doctor, who is younger than you, retires.  In our time here the head of our country practice has always been a woman, although we also have a much appreciated and very popular male doctor. My lovely female doctor has retired, another female practitioner has taken her place. Even the most old-fashioned and hidebound countryman now accepts these providers of medical care without turning a hair.From earliest times, women have nursed the sick and cared for newborns and the elderly in their homes. Childbirth was entirely in the hands of trained midwives; but it was not until the 1900s, and after much struggle, that women won the right to study and practice medicine in the same way as men. Even so, this right is still not granted in all parts of the world.Women have always been central in providing medical care, whether in the home, nursing or acting as herbalists. However, the medical profession has been male dominated for most of its history. In Europe this came about from the 1400s, when many cities and governments decided that only those trained in universities were allowed to formally practise medicine. As women were not allowed into the universities they could not gain a licence.In my copy of 'The Portable Medieval Reader' I found “The Case Of A Woman Doctor In Paris”. (1322)  A certain Jacoba Felicie was prosecuted by the medical faculty of the University of Paris for practicing without their degree of the Chancellor's license. :“ . . . . in the inquisition made at the instance of the masters in medicine at  Paris against Jacoba Felicie  and others practising the art of medicine and surgery in Paris and the suburbs without the knowledge and authority of the said masters, to the end that they be punished, and that this practice be forbidden them . . . . . “The Court produced a whole range of indictments, i.a. that Jacoba visited many sick persons, afflicted with grave illnesses, touching, feeling, holding their pulses,  examining body and limbs, and inspecting their urine.  Not only that but she also said to these sick persons:  \"I shall make you well, God willing, if you will have faith in me”, making an agreement concerning the cure with them and receiving money for it.\"Many witnesses came forward to testify that Jacoba had indeed healed them whereas, although enduring the care of very many expert masters in the art of medicine, they had not been able at all to recover from the illnesses, although the masters applied as much care and diligence to these as they were able. And the said Jacoba, called afterwards, had cured these sick persons in a short time, by an art which is suitable for accomplishing this.In their wisdom the medical faculty accepted defeat and Jacoba was allowed to continue to cure the sick. It is a pity that it took the medical profession another 600 years to come to the conclusion that women could do more than wipe a fevered brow."},

{"title": "Brain Boxes", "date": "Saturday 5 July 2014", "text": "What comes first: a great intellect or a great memory? Can you have one without the other?We have just waved goodbye to a couple of visitors, family, who are doing a tour of the UK and came for a flying visit lasting less than 24 hours.  Eve is of ordinary intelligence, artistic, Adam's the brain box.It’s impossible to have an argument with Adam. He’s read every book on every subject remotely connected with natural sciences, history, the environment, literature, etc. etc. He remembers them all and can quote every argument expounded in them. It’s most tiresome.Not every book written is worth the pulp it’s made from, whether wood, cloth or grass. New research unearths new facts and findings all the time; some last, others are overthrown.  My mum used to say “paper is a patient medium, you can tell it anything, it never complains”.We were talking about the theatre. Beloved and I are enjoying a particularly rich period of play-going, mostly Shakespeare. We love it.“Ah”, says Adam, “ did you know that there are great doubts that Shakespeare wrote the plays?”Yes, we had heard. Theories as to who wrote ‘Shakespeare’ are as old as the hills.Most people are content to accept that an Englishman with that name was born in 1564, died in 1616 and wrote plays, sonnets and poems in the interim that changed English literature forever.Some, however, see things differently. They don't doubt that the man from Stratford-upon-Avon existed, or that the plays attributed to Shakespeare are foundational and sublime. But elements of the Shakespeare canon are incompatible with his known biography, they say. An intimate knowledge of court affairs. Fluency in French. Familiarity with Italy. Shakespeare, they claim, was not written by Shakespeare.Not only that, but  no hand written manuscripts are in existence and his signature appears only twice, with different spelling.It seems that a Stanford Physics Professor has developed a scientific way of evaluating Shakespeare.Adam had obviously either read the new book or detailed reviews of it. We hadn’t and aren’t likely to do so. He had us silenced pretty quickly. I couldn’t even work out if Adam himself believed in the theory he threw at us, or if he was merely playing Devil’s Advocate. Don’t you just hate it when somebody’s superior intellect and phenomenal memory grind you into the dust?There were other debates and arguments, none of which we won.

Nothing too serious, you’ll walk through them. Would you be willing . . . .?”I thought, why not, perhaps we’ll even find that mislaid memory stick.Question 1: “a name and address, to be repeated instantly and then recalled at the end of the process.” John Brown, 42 High Street, West Kensington - easy peasy; I’ll never forget the gentleman and his fictitious address now, not ever. But what about the walking stick?Question 2: “what’s the date today?” It was lucky that I’d checked the date before coming out to the surgery. It doesn’t do to present yourself when you’re not wanted. Normally I don’t even know what day of the week it is, much less the numerical date.Question 3: “What’s in the news at the moment ?” Ah, that I do know. The horror of it! So I came back with “apart from football? What’s not in the news: Syria, Iraq, Ukraine, people fleeing impossible hardship, war, hunger and disease, Africa, children dying . . . . . .”She stopped me, “Yes, but what about London, what’s happening there?” Well, as far as I know London is quiet apart from the insane noises politicians are making. So I nearly but not quite scratched my head. “London? Nothing much?”“Yes, yes,” she said and clicked her tongue, tick-tock-tick-tock, while batting her hand from side to side.“Oh, London, Wimbledon, the tennis you mean?”She beamed at me. \"Yes, Wimbledon”!Friko, get your priorities right!She asked two further questions, which I answered correctly; sadly I have forgotten what they were.Aunt Josephine’s walking stick and the socks were found, peacefully cohabiting, on the newel post.Somebody - could it have been me? -  moved the socks from the rail around the AGA, where they were drying after I’d got my feet wet in the tall grass, and had hidden them under Beloved’s cardigan, which had also found a temporary home there.I thought I remembered that I had slipped the walking stick inside through the open door, while I took my shoes off and promptly forgotten all about it. When I came to look for it next day it was not to be found in any of its usual places: not hanging from a rung of the ladder in the shed, not slipped over the towel rail in the scullery, not in its proper place in the umbrella and stick stand in the lobby. Somebody had moved it. Or had I lost it on the way home yesterday and never brought it in at all?It’s my favourite stick, fits into my hand and is high and sturdy enough; Aunt Josephine was as tall as me and the stick saw her through many an arduous hike in the mountains. It’s handy for whacking nettles and fighting off axe murderers. I needed to find it and therefore went out and retraced every step of the walk of the previous day. Nothing.And then I found the socks.As for John Brown? He’s still at 42, High Street. West Ken. And ever more shall be so."},

{"title": "Fear", "date": "Tuesday 24 June 2014", "text": "I expect Florence had something there.Fear can be quite debilitating. Shakespeare says in Romeo and Juliet: “ I have a faint cold fear . . . . . . . that freezes up the heat of life.” I know what he means.Being afraid is not always cowardly. In fact, fear can make you think before you do something stupid or dangerous, which is surely good.  I have little sympathy for people who risk their lives unnecessarily and expect rescuers to endanger their own lives to extricate them from their folly.But it doesn’t always have to be quite as serious as that. Beloved tells the following story against himself:-While floating along on a narrowboat on the Oxford canal with friends, their seven year old daughter fell overboard. Beloved can’t swim, he is terrified of water and doesn’t even like to get his face wet in the shower. Nevertheless, he instantly jumped after her, only to find that the canal was no more than 5ft deep. His heroic effort ended with him STANDING on the bottom, feeling rather silly, while the girl swam back to the boat and scrambled aboard. The fact remains that, when he saw the girl fall, his instant, thoughtless, impulse to rescue her overcame his fear of drowning. He also tells me that, had this been a fast flowing river instead of a gently drifting canal, he might have needed rescuing himself.What Shakespeare and, to a lesser extent, Florence Nightingale mean, is something different. Something with which I am very familiar.Both Paul and Gardener have been poorly, neither has come to work for three weeks. Some serious jobs were waiting, so I attempted them myself. Pulling apart large root balls, grubbing up stubborn weeds, cutting back overgrown clumps of herbaceous plants, shovelling and a bit of digging. I was enjoying myself, adrenaline flowing. Gradually I became aware of a niggling pain in the throat area; \"hay fever\", I said to myself, although I should have known better. True to form, during the following night I woke up with a racing pulse, thumping all over the place, an episode of Atrial Fibrillation. Since last November, the last time I was hospitalised, I had only had a couple of minor, short-lived episodes, not more than half a day long, and I had put my otherwise more or less permanent apprehension about a renewed attack to the back of my mind. Along the lines of “new medication - new improved me”. Apprehensive, but a bit foolhardy.I am better again, it was a mild attack, lasting nine hours; for most of the time I slept thanks to sleeping pills and tranquillisers; and then it stopped again, as it always does. A couple of days of taking it easy (saving me from a play-reading party for which I had little stomach anyway) and I was back to normal.Back to normal, but also back to the ‘faint cold fear, that freezes up the heat of life’. You have no idea how sad that makes me feel."},

I promised Millie a paddle in the river and I must keep my promise.Here is another reason why I am not a great enthusiast when it comes to summer days: our daily walk takes us through lush meadows, where grass and wildflowers reach chest height in places. As I come down the slope to the river I can hear a great cry of joy going up “DINNER!” Before I go out I have to put on Jeans, socks and shoes, nettles sting me and bloodthirsty creatures feast on bare arms and legs.The tallest plants to wade through are the common hogweeds (not giant hogweed) with their large flat umbrella-shaped (hence ‘umbels’) flower heads.  Reflecting sunlight they are very pretty but by moonlight they turn luminous, ghostly. They are a bit of a menace in one of the meadows by the river because lack of access makes mowing impossible.Another large spreader by the river is water balsam; very pretty, but another eager coloniser. I think there have been efforts to remove it; as you can see, without much success. And here she is, almost at the end of our walk, enjoying a bit of a splash before we make our way through buttercups and clover, our errand done and tea waiting for us in the garden. Not bad for a total of thirty minutes’ walk, give or take 20 minutes either way for contemplation."},
{"title": "Weather for Chickens - Permutations 2 (rewritten)", "date": "Monday 16 June 2014", "text": "Perhaps they’re not ‘weeds’ but wildflowers. After all, a weed is simply a flower growing in the wrong place. \"It is not the business of the botanist to eradicate weeds. It’s enough for him if he can tell just how fast they grow.” (C. Northcote Parkinson) The average gardener, on the other hand, is obsessed with them; under no circumstances will he tolerate them in his tidy beds. The gardener knows only too well how fast they grow and spread.Some weeds (okay, back to calling them weeds) prefer poor, free-draining soil. No wonder that the small patch of land left over by the new bungalows for disabled and elderly people has this wonderful display of Orange Hawkweed, also called fox-and-cubs. It’s easy to see why the nestling clusters of tawny-orange flowers and buds are so-called but one of the hawkweed’s other names,  Grim-the-Collier, is harder to explain.Some years ago Beloved saw these pretty flowers and thought he’d love some in the garden. He went round collecting seed and spread them on the grass at home. We were extremely lucky that the seed didn’t take except for a few straggly specimen which soon disappeared with mowing. Unless you want to use toxic weedkiller the only other remedy is salting the lawn.Contrary to the English preference for a manicured lawn I am not at all bothered about our grass. As it is it consists mainly of moss and clover which keep it nice and green looking. But applying generous quantities of salt would have been a bit too much even for me. The next swathe of weeds along the footpath is this Lesser Trefoil. It’s a tiny plant, another grass weed, and probably the true Irish shamrock, - the seamrog, or 'cloverlet’.  It’s only really noticeable because where it grows - usually stoney ground or on the edge of tarmac - there are fairly large patches.A bit further along this very short path running from the High Street to Trinity, a wonderful enclave of ancient almshouses, via the sheltered housing, is this luminous strip of geraniums. Somebody probably had a few too many plants in their garden - the old people’s bungalow gardens are very small - and they simply planted them on the verge between hedge and footpath. Nobody minds that sort of thing in Valley’s End. Geraniums can be a weed, they multiply before you can get the secateurs out. Millie was panting; all my stopping and starting obviously did not please her, so I promised her a dip in the river. But before we got to the castle ground and from there to the river we had to pass the children’s playground. No children were in evidence but chicken escapees from the surrounding gardens were using the ramps for a bit of harmless fun, clucking away peacefully and contentedly.PS: I had to rewrite this whole post; there is no way lost blogposts can be retrieved and Blogger is no help.

I am itching already and the bits of me that have caught the sun are turning spotty. I can’t abide getting sweaty just breathing. It has to be said, however, that you get a better class of weeds in summer than at any other time. I had an errand at the other end of the village, all of ten minutes walk away if you use the High Street, but I chose the scenic route, which takes another five minutes each way. and to distract myself from the heat of the morning I took pictures, while dodging sunlit open spaces and seeking any kind of shade I could find along the way. Millie came too and she was huffing and puffing, her tongue flopping at the side of her mouth and her pace leisurely. No mad dashing about following smells, more a patient and long-suffering acceptance expressed in every flap of ear and flick of tail. A less superior being would have raised its eyes and sighed deeply at the imposition.Not exactly a weed, this laburnum tree, but there it was, hanging over the wall by the petrol station. Yes we have one of those; it sells bread and a few other kinds of long-life groceries and you can rent videos too.  Although the pumps are set in concrete, the surrounding yard is tufty grass and there is a flower bed in front of it and round the back and sides you have hedges. And a laburnum tree. Gardener calls it Chains.There is a big shed where you have repairs done and buy 4x4s and trucks, old ones, of course. A small Jack Russell, one of the yapping, bossy kind, guards the forecourt. I am surprised to see he has lasted as long as he has without getting squashed. I don’t like Jack Russells, they attack Millie.Gardener isn’t very well again. I rang his wife this morning to see if he was coming and she said “oh no, he won’t”. Bang, just like that. She sounded really cross. “Oh?” I said, putting a whole questionnaire into the sound.“He’s not well, he’s had a turn.”“What kind of turn?” She really was making me earn every utterance.“Same as before.” She was unbending just a smidgen. “He hasn’t worked all week.”“Has he seen a doctor?”“No”,  a bark; back to basics.“Can’t you send him?”“No.”“Have your tried?”“No, I’ve given up on him. He’s worked too much, and when he works, he works like a maniac. Just won’t listen. I’ve given up.”Since the weather has warmed up I’ve noticed Gardener sitting down more. You are my witness, I have said before that he’s not the man he used to be. And I’ve been happy to sit with him. Neither am I the woman I once was.What with Gardener and Paul’s frequent ’turns’ not much gets done.  It seems to be time that I hired myself a gardener, a fit and able one who will last at least as long as me. Number three. I’ll try not to get confused. Poor Austin, I shall miss him. Dreadfully. I love the contrary old goat. (Did you notice I called him by his name? First time ever)Anyway I am still on my errand. Right opposite the garage, in  Hospital Lane, on the wall surrounding the Methodist Church, a whole long and wide swathe of campanula has taken up residence without a by-your-leave. Nobody’s planted it, it just arrived years ago and has settled in nicely, thank you. It probably escaped from somebody’s rockery originally and cannot be called a weed either.That reminds me, this was to be a post about weeds, among other things. I’ll have to come back to you on that. Tomorrow. I wonder how many posts I can get out of a 30 minutes’ walk."},

For nearly all of May most country lanes and hedgerows are edged with the frothy white blooms of Anthriscus sylvestris. The scent is unmistakable. Some of the paths I wander daily are only just wide enough for Millie and I must wade through the narrow opening between the mass of silken stems as if were swimming in a green sea.Cow parsley has many names, among them adder’s meat, bad man’s oatmeal, Spanish lace, kex, Mummie die, Grandpa’s pepper; my favourite is the one Beloved called it when the two of us first tramped the country lanes of South East England many years ago,  Queen Anne’s lace. There is a lovely story about Queen Anne, who suffered from asthma, and her ladies coming out into the meadows and fields around Kensington to get fresher air. As they walked along in spring sunshine, they carried their lace pillows and made lace. The flowering cow parsley resembled the court ladies’ lace patterns, and so the country folk began to call it Queen Anne’s lace. It is a pretty tale, albeit too pretty to be truth.The garden is bursting its seams, self seeders (volunteers) and deliberately chosen herbaceous plants vie for space with each other. For the moment there is ‘Lebensraum’ for all; the shrubs are still young and haven’t yet reached their final seasonal height and width; for the moment all-comers are welcome, particularly if they are as pretty as the wild geranium, which has insinuated itself amongst purple aubrieta. Wouldn’t this arrangement make a splendid wallpaper? Or rug?How do plants know what sets them off best, which neighbours to choose to dazzle the eye of the beholder? Or is it that in nature nothing ever clashes as it does in artifice? I have seen pink, deep red and purple colours close together in a flower bed and admired the audacity of the wearers but I’d never dream of matching these colours in fashion, say, or room furnishings. Perhaps I am just not brave enough and too easily guided by the taste of the moment.Old Gardener came today and we worked all morning. Neither of us lasted the full four hours. I noticed several times that Gardener sneaked a crafty sit-down on a wall and once on a bench. When he saw me looking his way he started to pull up weeds growing underneath. Poor man, I know only too well that the spirit may be willing but that the flesh is getting increasingly weak. Neither of us is as young as we once were."},
{"title": "This Girl Gone, Well and Truly", "date": "Tuesday 3 June 2014", "text": "On Kindle, Gillian Flynn’s ‘Gone Girl’ is just under 900 pages long. I spent all of yesterday afternoon , post lunch to bedtime, reading it. A marathon, every hour or so I needed to blink a layer of film off my eyes, but soon it was head down and onwards again.By now there can be few readers of contemporary novels who have not read it, so I won’t be spoiling anything if I talk about it. The book was on the bestseller lists both here and in the US for weeks some time time ago. I tend to come to current bestsellers late, mostly because bestsellers are not often my preferred choice of reading. In the end, when everyone, including the Guardian reviewer ( A Must Read!),  is raving about a particular novel, I give in. I have ‘The Goldfinch’ and ‘The Luminaries’ downloaded but if or when I’ll to get them remains to be seen.I’d never heard of Gillian Flynn, but this is not her first novel.Judging by this book Flynn is an extraordinarily good writer.She hooked me in right from the start and didn’t release me until the end. Nick and Amy are a happy couple, New York writers both; they lose their jobs, money becomes tight and they move to small town Missouri to look after Nick’s mother and father. Their marriage suffers, they bicker and fight and then Amy disappears. The Police think Nick has killed her.Gone Girl switches between Nick's narrative, as the hunt for the beautiful, blond Amy consumes the attention of America's media, and Amy's diary, as she writes about the early days of their relationship. We never know who is telling the truth. We can never quite say who the protagonists are.Gone Girl is a psychological thriller, again, not my favourite genre. For instance, I find Patricia Highsmith almost unreadable, she scares and disturbs me so. But Flynn is good, she knows me and readers like me. She pulls us in gently, only gradually increasing the suspense, delighting, baffling, disturbing us in turn, until we have no choice but to continue to the clever, funny and ultimately terrifying conclusion.If I have a niggle, it is a minor one. Towards the end the police are more stupid than they need to be in a novel of this calibre. Only one officer sees the truth. On the other hand, if the facts of Amy’s disappearance had been fully revealed to the authorities, the ending wouldn’t have been half as terrifying as it is."},

The woman sitting right behind me enjoyed it so much that she tittered and sniggered and giggled at every innuendo and visual gag, often before they were fully born. Shakespeare’s comedy play is peopled with confusing and confused characters, mortals and spirits, a secret night-time forest, magic potions, a band of amateur actors, the Rude Mechanicals, performing a play within a play, who brought the house down every time they appeared, and the darkly mischievous world of Oberon and Titania with Puck and a band of faeries. It’s great fun - unless you are bored by the unlikely story, like Beloved said he has been every time I’ve forced him to see the play. Even he laughed during the second act, but only were laughter was appropriate. The woman sitting behind me drove me to distraction and I frequently braced myself for her next onslaught. Unfortunately, I mentioned my irritation to the friends we had come with. We half-heartedly wondered if we should move, but that would have been excessive. I should have kept my complaint to myself, in the interval I saw them stand with the giggler and her husband, having a conversation. Only then did I recognise her as a Valley’s End inhabitant who is a leading light in the Amateur Dramatic Society.So often nowadays directors feel they need to freshen an old play by dragging it into a more recent century. It so rarely works. This production stayed firmly where it was meant to be, in a magical, unreal Elizabethan world with a fictitious Athens at the centre; the actors were dressed in the most astonishingly beautiful costumes, even the ones who were semi naked.I am enormously glad that the National Theatre and now the RSC at Stratford and Shakespeare’s Globe in London transmit so many of their productions digitally. You can see the whole of the action clearly, hear every word and see the acting up close and doubled in size. Although I love it when we go to live performances in actual theatres, with their noise and buzz and the smell of backstage, I am very happy not to be driving for hours and paying high ticket prices every time."},

I was always aware of his distinctive face, without ever studying him too closely. His doctor once said that he had the head of a ‘Caesar’. To me, of course, he was just dad. Annoyingly himself. Always.And now I am him. Oh dear. Not bad for a man but for a woman, not so good.o-o-o-oI have been a tardy blogger for weeks. Not that I’ve lost interest, it’s just life being contrary. I may have two gardeners, but one of them, Paul, is one of those people who only need to look at a tool, or swat a wasp, for it to jump up and bite them somewhere painful. Since I’ve employed him he has had blood poisoning from a rose thorn, a swollen arm and near collapse from a poisonous spider bite, something totally unheard of in this region, and now he has cut half his finger off with an electric saw. And lately it’s done nothing but rain on old Gardener’s day, giving him a perfect excuse not to turn up.o-o-o-oThen there’s Millie. You’d think an old girl like her would stay away from confrontations. Not Millie. Good-natured and sweet though she is, she is curious and forever sticking her nose in where it’s not wanted. Last thing at night she strolls down to the paddock to see who else is around. Whoever it was she met gave her a thoroughly bloody nose, deep gashes over both eyes, and a small round hole in the side of her face. The first night it didn’t look so bad, but by morning the wounds had became infected and inflamed. She developed large, angry red blisters in her armpits and groin and both ears are lined with pebble-like lesions along the edges. It’s impossible to say who attacked her, fox, badger, a cat, but she certainly didn’t come away victorious. A course of antibiotics was prescribed and then treatment with steroids, to reduce the inflammation. We are back and forth to the Vet’s. o-o-o-oBut May has had good aspects too. Social life is picking up. It’s never right though, is it? When people invite us I complain that I’d much rather stay at home, and when they don’t, I complain even more.  Shades of my dad? Theatre outings are high on the list of diversions. Three so far this month; Simon Russell Beale as the National Theatre’s King Lear; then Henry IV, Part I, (Part II still to come), and Roaring Girl at the Swan in Stratford.  There is much to be said for going to see familiar plays; you know them well enough to concentrate on an actor's interpretation of his role and the differences between productions, rather than straining to listen to every word.  But I’d never even heard of ‘Roaring Girl’ before. This Dekker and Middleton comedy written in 1611 is the story of Moll Cutpurse, a cross-dressing protofeminist 300 years ahead of her time. Updating the play to the Victorian 1890s didn’t altogether work; the verbal filth, smells and sounds of Jacobean London which permeate the original play didn’t match my idea of prim and proper Victoria’s city. No ‘ruffianly swaggering and lewd company' in her time. If you believe it.Just one more play to go before the end of the month.  I’ll try and turn up here a bit more often than once a week too."},

Nothing very interesting, just the usual lunch party chat between people who know each other without being close friends.“Please do”, I said. Anything to keep the conversation going.  Mr. Walker is twice a widower, his second wife, Wendy, having died six years ago. “I miss her terribly, she was wonderful company”, he said.He has also suffered a stroke and his mobility is impaired;  he doesn’t get about much and is very happy to have an audience.“Let me tell you a romantic story,” he repeated.\"We hadn’t met for 54 years,” he began. \"She had written an article for the Chronicle (a local paper), reminiscing about her school days in Valley’s End. It was an interesting letter, giving her address at the top. So, one morning I was sat there and I read this letter and remembered her, because we went to school together. From infant school to grammar school, and we also used to go to dances together, you know in the thirties and forties, and we went to choir together and did all sorts of things together when we were young. So I wrote to her and wondered whether I might get an answer or not. But I did. So we corresponded for quite some time.At the time I was still getting the curtains and things for the new house (Mr. W. moved house after his first wife died) and I was going to Birmingham to collect a large parcel of home furnishings. She was living about six miles outside B’ham and I wrote and asked if I might come for coffee on the way. She said of course. So I arrived with the obligatory bunch of flowers and a box of chocolates and when she opened the door she thought that I was my father. She hadn’t seen me for 54 years!So that started our association; we were getting on very well. She was a widow on her own and I used to fetch her over to meet her sister.One day I said to her “ will you pack your bag ready for Tuesday morning? Put enough in your case for four days\". She said “Why” and I said “I am taking you on a little holiday”.  She wanted to know where but I said that was a surprise and she would find out soon enough. But do bring your passport.\" I drove to B’ham airport. She asked again where was I taking her but I kept quiet.So, we were flying in and the Eiffel Tower went past and that’s when she found out. “Paris, you are taking me to Paris.” She was delighted. We stayed at a nice hotel round the Tuileries and had a lovely time. There was an excursion to Monet’s Garden and we decided to take the opportunity to see it.Picture Monet’s Garden\", Mr. W. continued, with the pond and the bridge across it. It was a very hot day and we’d bought some apple juice. So when we were standing on the bridge I thought now is my opportunity and I put my arm round her and gave her a nice kiss and I said “Wendy, will you marry me?” She said yes, so I gave her another kiss and she said “sticky chops” and I’ll always remember it.Mr. W’s voice cracked a little but he smiled. “Yes, it was lovely,” he said,”we had such a good time.”Their time together was short, but Mr. Walker took his Wendy on many more trips and they enjoyed every minute of the few years they were granted."},

More than a decade-and-a-half since my mother’s death I am still working on our relationship. All I can say with any certainty, is that I am beginning to understand her. Perhaps understanding will eventually become acceptance and forgiveness for both of us. My post today is not about me; it is about an artist friend living in Valley’s End, Russell G. Morris, who lost his mother after a long illness. This is what he says:“During the four years that my mother was hospitalised I kept a visual diary, making one or two drawings per visit. This became a way for me to remain engaged and attentive once my own conversation was exhausted. Mum had ceased to speak long before she was admitted to hospital and communication was only made possible by her tapping on my free hand whilst I watched, waited or drew.Each day I simply made a record of the time spent between us - and whether a drawing was good or bad seemed irrelevant, because they were done just for us. Mum was happy to be the object of my attention, although there were obviously times when enough was enough, and then silent regard remained between us.”Although the drawings were “done just for us “,  Russell was persuaded to exhibit them. I took photographs of several in the series, and have chosen to publish four of them here, starting with the earliest one and progressing to the last one of Russell’s mum's final day.Russell is not only a painter, he is also a poet.These are three poems he wrote after his mother’s death.For a time of lastsYour last breathyour unexpected tearthe making of my last drawingand then with your eyes closed and arms foldedI leave a few coins tucked inside your evening bagfor the crossing overbefore the last kissof a particular coldnessInvitationAt least for tea,would you come?I’d meant to ask soonerbefore you left.I have your good chinathe best set washedand the silver pot for Sundays.I’ve kept all of thatin case you might find a wayto set endlessness aside for a moment.Lifeline : A DrawingIt’s the way you were left,with one hand clenchedin a fierce and pitiful claw,your anchor, blood-slow, cursedand hooked fast between a dead sea of pins.Whilst the other turns to tapping morse against my palma code I’ve come to understand and translate line to line.For each visit a fresh pagewhere my first few lines float upon the surface,until you appearto be mostly watching mestruggle to watchas you endurea few more hours of my desperation.R.

{"title": "A Library on the Coffee Table", "date": "Tuesday 6 May 2014", "text": "Normally, I’d have had my head in a book these last two or three weeks of withdrawing from the world. True, I read. A dozen and more books, but all on the e-reader.  I see a title reviewed or a friend recommends an author. I check if the book is available in e-format, order it and within seconds it’s there for me to read. Any time of day or night. Where’s the fun in that?Getting away from the misery of the black dog via stories, true or invented, often works for me. While I’m immersed in someone else’s life my attention is focussed away from myself. I’ve also concentrated on humorous writers, recommended by a friend. Evelyn Waugh was new to me, I started my journey with him with ‘Decline And Fall’, a darkly witty social satire, which brought forth an involuntary bark of laughter on practically every page, in spite of feeling slightly uncomfortable throughout. Nancy Mitford too was a new discovery. Her novels (I’ve read three of them so far) read like eating ice cream laced with sharp plum sauce. I shall finish her oeuvre and read more of Waugh, but not ‘Brideshead Revisited’, which made him known to those who don’t read. There were a few by Wodehouse and E.F.Benson, who are funny, but without the painful bite. Barbara Pym came in somewhere too, I used to like her years ago; she still has something that appeals, although nothing she wrote could ever cause offence. I have Muriel Spark’s ‘Memento Mori’ ready to go, also recommended by the same waspish source.Too much of the same diet makes for indigestion, so I interrupted the satirical reading with Penelope Lively’s quasi memoir cum musings on aspects of a long life ‘Ammonites And Leaping Fish’; I like her novels and these essays address ageing, memory, time and a life in the 20th century.  A few mysteries leavened the broth further, Christopher Brookmeyer is a thriller writer I can bear to read and I’ve also recently discovered that Jill Paton Walsh, a very reasonable writer, has picked up the Dorothy L. Sayers baton and is prolonging the literary life of Lord Peter Wimsey. So you see, there’s plenty up there in that Cloud waiting for me, all wrapped up in one slim volume.If only they were waiting in a tottering pile on my book table. Going to the library or, much better, to a book shop, browsing the shelves, talking to the librarian or the bookseller, getting chatting with other book lovers, comparing notes, flicking through a book, getting trapped by a passage, finding a new writer and wondering ‘should I give them a try’;  no, Amazon has none of that. It’s a lonely business, ordering books and music online (heavens, do you remember the old record shops where you stood in a narrow booth with clunky headphones and listened to an album prior to purchase?). Taking your treasures to the till, having them wrapped in the store’s bag and proudly bearing them off home - half the pleasure was in that.And now I use ITunes for music downloads and Amazon for books. The record shops have gone and my eyes, damn them, have grown feeble and prefer e-books where I can adjust the size of type. I’ve been thinking of buying the book favourites anyway and maybe even a cd instead of downloading to an e-device. But that would be silly and unnecessary, wouldn’t it?Anyway, all that reading (and listening to music) have made me feel a lot better."},
{"title": "By Way of a Diary Entry ", "date": "Friday 2 May 2014", "text": "I need a wife. Even a husband would do.I am old. Like the castle. And like the castle I just want to sit and look pretty. I want to brandish my pension book and leave big decisions to others, younger than me. I want to choose what I do, not have a course of action forced on me.   Enjoyable things. I don’t want to learn new tricks or do jobs which are meant for young people. Or men. Yes, men. Nothing of the feminist about me today.Yesterday I was hanging out of the velux on the sloping roof trying to clear the channels either side of the window from moss and debris. There’s a new seepage stain in the cupboard in the roof space, which means rainwater gets in somewhere. Three different sets of workmen have looked at the roof, scratched their heads,  rearranged their boys’ bits, fiddled with tiles and sheets of some metal and gone away, leaving a big bill behind. One of these days that window will be the death of me.I’ve been going into CBT -  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy -  on the internet this morning. There’s this phobia I have about driving up a particular steep lane in Valley’s End. About five years ago I lost control of the car on this lane, rolled backwards into a gate, demolished the gate and wrote off the car; nobody else was involved and nobody got hurt. Since then I have avoided this lane. Unfortunately that makes coming into Valley’s End from the Welsh side a bit of a bummer; either I have to go the long way round, two to three miles extra, or persuade Beloved to do that bit which actually takes no more than five minutes. Beloved no longer has a driving licence because of his poor eyesight.  Making him drive could cause problems with the law. So you see, one way and another it would be good if I could get over this phobia.I told my doctor and he advised CBT. Really and truly, I would prefer to sidestep the whole issue, ostrich-like (do ostriches really stick their heads into the sand? I must find out); but Knighton is where the poetry group meets and my face-girl has her treatment room. Which do I choose? Give them up or endure the inevitable panic attacks?A competent wife or husband would take this decision off me. They’d only need to be part-time, of course. The law also frowns on bigamists.I learned on the website of MIND - for better mental health that CBT can be an effective therapy for a number of problems:anger managementanxiety and panic attacks *chronic fatigue syndromechronic paindepression *drug or alcohol problemseating problems * general health problemshabits, such as facial ticsmood swings *obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) *phobias *post-traumatic stress disordersexual and relationship problemssleep problems *The list awards me seven brownie points, that is if chocolate cravings and a mild need to arrange pills, chocolate buttons, newspapers, spoons and socks in orderly matching pairs, strictly aligned according to length, count.What happened to those wonderful days when the aged were shoved into the inglenook, or in particularly drastic cases, pushed into a cupboard, fed when someone remembered and otherwise forgotten and left to get on with drooling and gnashing their toothless gums. They never had to make a decision.  Actually, that sounds remarkably like some modern nursing homes, except there you may have the added excitement of being called names and given a slap when the carers can’t force your arthritic arms and legs into your garments quickly enough."},

And walking Millie; Millie-walking is obligatory, if I had the choice I’d probably shirk that job too. Just look at my ‘writing’ desk (as opposed to my ‘computer’ desk). There are invoices, receipts, official letters remaining unopened after a week, private letters gathering dust, bank statements, yellowing newspaper cuttings, ticket stubs, programmes and even orders of service for two funerals. What is happening to me?I was always tidy; the need for tidiness was drilled into me from a very early age, like an act of faith, never to be abandoned. “You’ve dropped something, pick it up this minute!” “Have you finished with your book? Put it on the shelf, don’t leave things lying around.” I had few indoor toys but I knew better than to play with more than one at a time. I was a mainly silent child, reading or inventing stories which took place entirely in my head and never ended; neat and tidy, they could be picked up and put down again without leaving a visible trace.This compulsion for order could have a nightmarish effect. I can’t have been much more than six when I had to go into hospital to have my adenoids removed. This was in the early years after the war, there were few fully functioning hospitals in rural Germany and I had to spend the night on the women’s ward. I was the only child there. Having come round from the anaesthetic I dislodged a piece of paper from my bedside table, which sailed to the floor. I knew I had committed a cardinal sin, I’d made a mess. My thoughts ran along familiar lines: I should not have reached for the paper in the first place and thereby caused it to land on the floor. In the dim light the white square gleamed malevolently. Somehow I had to pick it up. But I had also been told not to get out of bed. My cot had bars and I didn’t dare climb out. The only thing I could do was to stick my arm out and grope. Alas, the harder I tried the more the bars rattled. The sheet of paper stayed just out of reach. Perhaps being poorly and fresh out of the anaesthetic had something to do with it but I remember being terror-stricken.The woman in the bed next to mine stirred. “What’s the matter,” she asked, “ is something wrong?” How could I tell her that I’d been really naughty? I mumbled no. “Then stay still now,” she said. There was nothing I could do. I lay there, fully expecting to be told off in the morning.Mum came to fetch me home. “Has she been a good girl?” she asked the woman. “She was a bit restless at first but then she settled down,” the woman answered.The sheet of paper had gone, a nurse bringing me a drink first thing had bent down and picked it up without a word."},

'Be More Sociable', a University study says.  Another one says ‘Fake It ’Til You Make It’; or there’s the one that advises you to ‘Compare Yourself With Someone Who is Worse Off Than You’. As if I cared about someone else’s misery when that black dog has me by the throat. ‘Listen to some sad music or read a sad book’. Weep. Apparently, that’s catharsis, about which the ancient Greeks knew a thing or two when they invented the concept. Guaranteed to make you feel better.So there I am, one black dog scampering at my heels, the other one firmly clamped atop my shoulders, pushing my head forward and down. The blackthorn is in full bloom. I have a smile on my face, a rictus grin to split the atom, but I still can’t ‘Make It’. That one is a waste of effort. The sociable bit is better. Luciano* is with me, pretending to be Cavaradossi waiting for his execution in the morning, but admiring the bright stars anyway.  E lucevan le stelle. Yes. He is definitely worse off than me, particularly since Tosca, the one he loves, is going to throw herself off the battlements, although he is spared that knowledge, since he's dead by the time she jumps. I once saw her do that and bounce back up. They’d made the mattresses too springy.The company of Luciano/Mario and his sad story should, according to the professors who research such subjects, have had me gambolling like a new born lamb. Instead of which I plodded along. Perhaps Pete** would help.  He might not have been the most cheerful folk singer but he was wise enough to know that the seasons must turn, turn, turn and that there is a time for every purpose under heaven.  He also says that We Shall Overcome, aiming this splendid mantra specifically at people with a pessimistic outlook.I was humming along to Luciano and by the time I got to Pete, I actually sang a verse or two. Things were looking up until i remembered that I was walking with dead men.Visiting Llareggub (try reading it backwards), the sleepily subversive Welsh town of Dylan Thomas’ play for voices Under Milk Wood which, according to the (also dead) actor Richard Burton is ‘entirely about religion, sex and the idea of death’ suited my mood perfectly. We went with friends, both alive, which made my grumpy rude mood unforgivable. I should wear a warning sign round my neck : Beware Of The Dog.The play was brilliant. Polly Garter, the ever pregnant girl who scrubs floors and sweetly sings about her lost love, little Willy Wee, and sleeps with everybody who asks, almost made me cry. I covered it up by concentrating on the pure and pitch perfect voice of the singer. Then there’s Gossamer Beynon, the schoolteacher who thrills to the ticklish sensation of a sailor's \"goatbeard\"; Bessie Bighead \"kissed once by the pig-sty when she wasn't looking\"; and Dai Bread who dreams of \"Turkish girls. Horizontal\". And has there ever been a more poignant image of spinsterly unfulfilment than Myfanwy Price's \"lonely, loving hotwaterbottled body”?If you can’t make it to a performance - it’s coming to the States too in this, the centenary of Thomas’ birth, and the 60th anniversary of the BBC’s posthumous premiere of his final, never-quite-finished masterpiece, at least read it. The language will blow your mind. It’s sheer poetry.Catharsis guaranteed.*Luciano Pavarotti** Pete Seeger"},

Allocating two mornings a week for the services of two separate gardeners is a case in point. Both are keen and willing,  and perform different functions -  Paul, the expert, gets to prune and do the careful weeding round delicate plants, and Gardener, who’s been around for ten years but has still not learned that to chop a choisya ternata aurea in half just before flowering will severely limit the attraction of said shrub, does the digging and mulching and tickling and lawn tending, as well as cooking up a mean compost heap. However, at only a third of an acre the actual garden area isn’t big enough to provide ongoing work for two gardeners and their gofer. i.e. me.Two mornings a week gone on gardening,  a season ticket to hospitals and doctor’s surgeries for all sorts of routine treatments and tests for Beloved as regular as a mum’s school run and a day all-told for housework,  plus shopping and afternoon walkies with Millie, leave little time to  stand and stare. There’s hardlytime to stand beneath the boughsAnd stare as long as sheep or cows.The cherry tree almost went unadmired until it blazed at me one evening at dusk and I simply had to take its picture. With an old camera, there’s not been enough time to learn the intricacies of the fancy new one.Paul doesn’t know yet that he will feature in my blog, this picture was taken on the sly while he’s weeding the fernery. Ferns haven’t unfurled yet, so clearing the bed now will avoid trampling them into the ground later.But nobody can live by work alone, there has to be leisure.A poor life this if, full of care,We have no time to stand and stare.Can you call theatre visits ‘stare’? Sure, I can.Sixteen visits to be exact, just to be getting on with, between now and February 2015.Will we still be alive? There’s another corner ready to pounce.I’m only asking the ‘being alive’ question because we went to another old friend’s funeral today. We’ve been climbing that hill to church far too often recently. I’m beginning to recognise the hymns.And only four weeks ago we went to her birthday party.Man muss die Feste feiern, wie sie fallen, my mum used to say. Loosely translated ‘make hay while the sun shines', or 'carpe diem’.This was brought home to us quite urgently at yesterday’s poetry meeting. A member who hadn’t been attending for a while turned up with his wife. He sat very close to her on the sofa. She read, but he just sat, listening. Not long ago Donald was an excellent reader of poetry, very knowledgable, erudite, an ex Oxford classics scholar and long-time grammar school teacher and clergyman. Now he clings to Audrey, frets and fusses when she’s out of his sight. What is left of his first class brain is rapidly fading and after a life of respectability and courteous good manners he is turning into a coarse vulgarian. Audrey herself is frail and, for the life of me, I can’t see how she copes. But she does. It terrifies me.I need to get back out into the garden this weekend;  hands caked with dirt and a sore back from bending are marvellous means of dispersing  morbid thoughts."},
{"title": "Gratitude Attitude", "date": "Tuesday 8 April 2014", "text": "Quite a number of grannies are complaining about grandchildren’s lack of manners when it comes to saying thank you for gifts of money. I saw the second or third such article in a magazine recently, with an agony aunt giving advice on how to deal with the problem. Ideas both the grannies and the agony aunt came up with ranged from ‘tell the parents’, ‘write and ask for confirmation of receipt’, ‘pretend to be worried that the money got lost’,  to ‘include a return envelope, stamped and addressed’. The advice didn’t actually say anything about just picking up the phone and asking outright. All the grannies seemed embarrassed, as if the bad manners were theirs and not the grandchildren’s.I don’t understand why a plain ‘thank you’ should have gone out of fashion, but if it has, then there isn’t much the giver can do. We can teach our children to be courteous and well behaved but they will, at some stage, follow their own rules. Once grandchildren have reached teenage and beyond, they are removed further still from our personal sphere of influence.Poor Grannies!My advice would be : after a suitable interval ask outright if they were glad to receive the gift. They’ll probably say ‘Yes, Thanks’. That should do to remind them next time. If they ‘forget’ again, grumble at the parents. If that doesn’t help when the next birthday or Christmas present is due, you might as well make up your mind to go without expressed appreciation. You can always tell yourself that they are really very busy but probably love you anyway. And that there is more happiness to be had from giving than receiving.  You can also tell your friends, or anyone who will listen, and start sentences with “In my young days . . . .”On the other hand, if it’s happened too often and it really bothers you, keep the cash and treat yourself instead. That’ll teach ‘em."},

Goodness, 27th already.”A vague thought entered my head: isn’t there some special date in March?“Beloved, we forgot our anniversary.”“O dear, so we have. I do apologize. I remember mentioning it earlier this month, but then it totally slipped my mind.”“Don’t worry dear, I forgot too.”For the first time in 27 years of marriage we both forgot our anniversary. No matter, we shall have a slightly belated celebration.Contrary to Paltrow and Martin and their ‘conscious uncoupling’ - ( have you ever heard a more pretentious way of announcing a divorce? Are they a train?) - we shall stay together.Actually, I blame having two gardeners for our absentmindedness: it is totally confusing to have them turn up on two separate days of the week, stay for three hours and disappear again. It means that I have to be around, ready to work alongside them, make tea and conversation, answer questions and make suggestions, listen to gossip, give instructions and have them gently ignored in favour of each gardener’s ‘better idea’ and make sure their dates never clash, twice a week.One of these days I’ll have to come clean, if only for the sake of my marriage."},

Even attaching the strap securely was several days’ effort. I need time.On the day before the solstice, when I still believed that spring had sprung, I took my new toy out into Colstey Wood to snap away. It was one of those glorious afternoons we don’t get very often in these parts; an afternoon not to be wasted.There is still plenty of mud around after the winter rains. This puddle looks like it has a chalk covering over the brown clay bottom. Millie and I started the climb to the top.Colstey Wood is a plantation, with parts of it harvestedregularly every few years.Once the tree fellers have gone, deep ruts are left behind by their heavy machinery.But there are also small cuttings which have been left unforested.

{"title": "Not so much Wordless (Wednesday)", "date": "Wednesday 19 March 2014", "text": "as speechless.This is a picture of the clock tower in the little Welsh market town of Knighton, just over the border from Valley’s End.Speechless might not be a suitable word either, for the good burghers of Knighton have had plenty to say since it’s become known that a new inhabitant of the peaceful town has made an official complaint about the clock, under noise nuisance regulations.  Every fifteen minutes, day and night, there’s a ding, and a dong, and a ding dong, just like it’s been for 142 years. “It may be an irritating clock”, the townsfolk say, “but it’s our irritating clock.  Besides, you soon stop hearing it going on about its lawful business; and we’d all miss it if it weren’t there any more. It’s part of our heritage.”God help those who interfere with tradition in a sleepy, openly old-fashioned, slightly batty Welsh market town, which has a fair sprinkling of ex hippies, poetry and violin and book group lovers and a flourishing young farmer’s drama society.The new inhabitant is a writer from Ireland. She has bought a large house in the square and opened a B&B for nervous writers who need a retreat to concentrate on their muse and whose delicate sensibilities suffer from the noise a clock makes.  Did it seriously not occur to her, that the chiming clock tower, that is barely 20 yards from her window, might be a slight drawback? It’s not as though she can’t have noticed it, what with the thing going off every 15 minutes, night and day. And walking up and down the high street to the ‘narrows’ , that warren of small streets and higgledy-piggledy houses on the border of which the writer’s house stands, you have to step sideways not to hit the tower. It’s large, it’s ugly, it’s unmissable, a typical Victorian monstrosity.I went to see Helen in Knighton for a facial treatment this morning and this story was the first she told me. “It’s gone viral,” she said. It’s true, I’ve since googled ‘Knighton Clocktower’ and it’s all over the media. One thing’s for sure, whether the lady silences the clock or not, and I don’t believe she will, the Welsh are nothing if not bloody-minded, she’ll have had some very good publicity."},
{"title": "De Mortuis Nil Nisi Bonum . . . .", "date": "Monday 17 March 2014", "text": ". . . . . Don’t speak ill of the (recently) dead.Two men, both larger than life, both on the very left of the political spectrum, have recently died in the UK. I briefly met one of them during a one day conference; being there as the hired help (I was one of the interpreters), this ardent socialist and defender of the common (wo)man, ignored both me and my colleague comprehensively. We had both been looking forward to meeting him and telling him how much we admired him. Ah well, ‘handsome is as handsome does’.Both these men made many enemies during their careers; it is amusing to watch those, who thoroughly disliked them and all they stood for, now scraping and dredging for the most fulsome praise. And all with a straight face.But I was going to talk about funerals, one of which I attended and the other I was told about.Kelly’s dad recently died. He and Kelly’s mum had been divorced for many years. Apparently they couldn't live together and couldn’t live apart. He visited his ex frequently and the eight children of the marriage continued to get on well with him in spite of the fact that he had been busy fathering another four with a new partner, whom he never married. None of this is my business, you will quite justifiably say, but Kelly was perfectly frank about her father's busy life, which he pursued happily despite his many ‘aliments’. The funeral brought the two families together. It must have been quite a rumbustious affair. The second family overthrew all the funeral arrangements the two lots of children had initially agreed on, including changing the venue from a 'large catholic church to a paupers’ church’. “We’d given them money for half the costs but we took it all back again”, Kelly said, “we were really disgusted with what they did.\" She is a member of a large gypsy clan to whom appropriate funeral rituals are very important. “We did manage to give him his rosary beads and my sisters put a few ‘trinkels' in the coffin before it was closed”, she added.The other funeral was here at Valley’s End. It was a short, matter-of-fact service, only two hymns were sung and even the eulogy was lifeless and dry. The deceased was “a man who didn’t suffer fools gladly, if at all”; and “did everything he undertook to perfection\". The mourners heard it and made up their own minds about the kind of man who could be found behind these statements.  There was a moment at the  graveside which made up for the bland service: a bugler from the British Legion played the Last Post, while a comrade lowered the flag, in a brief, moving salute. The deceased had requested that this be done. Perhaps he had made all the funeral arrangements himself, which would account for the nature of the service. Valley’s End is usually so good at funerals.All the funerals I’ve ever attended had one thing in common: a jolly bun fight afterwards. I am often surprised at the excellent appetite and thirst the mourners display and once you’ve paid your respects to the immediate family, you are free to mix and mingle and chat and gossip. Loud laughter is never frowned upon; perhaps the relief at 'it not being me this time' is something to do with it? Only on one occasion have I been present when the deceased actually was the centre of attention after the funeral, but that was a party nobody who was there will ever forget. On that occasion the eulogies went on and on and all the good things said were true.o-o-o-o-oIn “The Open Grave”, by Louise Elisabeth Glück, the mortuary phrase is repeated as a framing cadence.My mother made my need,my father my conscience.De mortuis nil nisi bonum.Therefore it will cost mebitterly to lie,to prostrate myselfat the edge of a grave.I say to the earth“be kind to my mother,now and later.Save, with your coldness,the beauty we all envied.”I became an old woman.I welcomed the darkI used so to fear.De mortuis nil nisi bonum."},

Paul came yesterday, then today it was Gardener’s turn.  Gardener still hasn’t twigged about Paul. Neither of them gives me more than three hours, which means that between them they provide the day’s work I need. Paul is very different from Gardener, no doubt I shall have to train him up. But there’s promise; he may appear in these pages and we may all get to know him as summer progresses.During tea break he was telling Beloved and me that he’d taken a long time getting to grips with his chainsaw. “I was really nervous handling it at first,” he said. Sensible man, chainsaws are not to be operated in jest.Beloved, not a hard worker, but keen to be part of the labour force, told a story.“When the Royal Opera took the orchestra to Los Angeles a friend and I went to the beach, Venice beach, I think it was called. We saw two men juggling with running chainsaws. They were throwing them at each other, catching them in mid-air.”When we’d finished laughing, Paul said : “Look, no hands.” I told you he shows promise. He’s not bad as a gardener either.St Gregory was another punster. That awful Ambrose Bierce said of punning: a form of wit, to which wise men stoop and fools aspire. I like it; Bierce often pleases me.Yesterday was St Gregory’s Day. In spite of my catholic schooling I am no expert on saints, I simply have access to an almanac. The Venerable Bede had this to say about Gregory the Great (papacy 590-604):He was moved to send Augustine to convert the Anglo-Saxons by an encounter in the Roman slave market with some fair-haired English captives. On being told that they were Angles, he replied ‘not Angles but Angels' and on hearing that they came from Deira in Northumbria, he retorted that he would save them from the wrath (de ira in Latin) of God. And finally, when informed that their king’s name was ‘Aella’, the relentless ecclesiastical punster rejoined that Christian ‘Alleluias’ would soon be heard in their land.Apparently, Gregory was also responsible for Gregorian Chant. Who says the early Church Fathers didn’t have a sense of humour.I still like Paul’s ‘no hands’ though."},

I don’t greatly care for the palaver of white linen napery, fancy cutlery and a scrum of waiters in black monkey suits falling over themselves to refill my glass after every sip. Puree of this and foam of that you can keep too. To me that’s the elevation of show over substance; besides, I don’t go for camp.My kind of place is The Stagg Inn at Titley in Herefordshire. It’s the destination of choice for the discerning foodie for miles around. A friend of ours recently had the big 6-0 birthday; thinking what would give her most pleasure we hit on the idea of a memorable meal as a belated present.The Stagg is a very attractive roadside inn, right in the middle of the black and white villages of the Marches border country. It’s fame has spread as far as the States, R.W. Apple, Associate Editor of the New York Times, reviewed his experience here in glowing terms. When you enter the very modest doorway there is neither pomp nor circumstance. The Stagg is friendly, down-to-earth, but the skills behind the kitchen door would put many a grander establishment to shame. There is more modesty here than you could shake a Welsh leek at.You sit on upholstered chairs at wooden tables, set on wooden floors, the decor is so simple as to be non-existent; all is clean and fresh and comfortable.It’s only when you read the menu that you realise you are in Michelin territory.It was no easy task to choose our dishes, but this is what we had between the three of us: Duck liver parfait, smoked duck breast, fig Marinated mackerel, orange pickled carrots, tarragon creamMadgett’s Farm duck: Confit of leg, roast breast, turnip, kale, cider potato fondant   Lamb:  Chop, almond coated Moroccan spiced shoulder, apricot, lemon, potato dauphineSpringfield farm chicken breast, artichoke, purple sprouting, potato dauphinoiseHaving made our choice, we stuck with it; there was none of that “let’s have a taste of yours” which is all very well when it’s a question of stealing a potato chip (French fries) but rather vulgar in a rarefied atmosphere as this.Only two of us had room for pudding, we chose home made ice creams and sorbets; the coffee came with truffles and there was a small chocolate goodies bag to take home as well. We think our friend enjoyed her present."},

He'd slipped and fallen. “I just lay there for a bit”, he said. Well you would, wouldn’t you. Mud is soft and comfortable, and it wasn’t raining for a change. He was fine, a bit shaken, but no breakages.In spite of the almost springlike scenes outside I dawdled and dithered. Why can you never trust anyone to do as they say they will? Kelly was due to get back to cleaning after the kids’ half term; I was also hoping that Gardener would turn up. Neither even phoned. Being put out I threw a tantrum and cooked vegetable stew, leaving cleaning and gardening for another day. Everything left in the fridge went into the big stewpot. Rule BritanniaAfter lunch it was my turn to take Millie out. On the whole, Valley’s End is a neat and tidy place. I have often shown pictures of pretty, flower-decked cottages and small terraces. Today, feeling cross, I decided to take one of the grotty fronts. That flag has been blowing in the wind for several years, never managing to hide the broken window pane.Warning: When I am an old woman I shall wear purpleHow do you like my purple  boots? I bought them in December but haven’t worn them much; it’s been too wet and I didn’t want to spoil them. There’s logic. Winter boots to keep the rain off your feet too delicate to be worn.

In all of them my face looks like a cauliflower, deep cracks, fat cheeks and lumps. Like a ventriloquist’s dummy. Or my dad. On my dad the crags looked manly and distinguished. In the end I gave up on the close-ups, and took the ipad to my bedroom mirror.  The lighting’s kind and I’m standing several feet away.  It’s getting dark outside now and I feel guilty for having wasted a good day’s outdoor work. I’m hoping that adding insult to injury and watching both ’Tatort’ and ‘Inspector George Gently' tonight will make me feel so bad that I’ll never do it again.Fat chance."},

Ecclesiasteswas wrong about that. ‘So starts the poem “A Man in his Life\" by Yehuda Amichai (1924-2000). I am inclined to believe him.The Seven Ages of Man - sculpture byRichard KindersleyLast week was an unusual one, I spent four days running exclusively in the company of people well past retirement age, both friends and strangers. Meetings of the poetry group, the German conversation group and an 88th birthday party fell on consecutive days. Topping the whole thing off was an afternoon in the waiting area of the busy Lucentis clinic, which treats eye disease.Shrunken shanks, bellies and boobs gone south, sensible shoes and elasticated waistbands, bony, shrivelled frames as well as well-fleshed ones, spectacles, hearing aids, walking sticks, all were in evidence. Groans sitting down and getting up, a sure sign of 'getting on a bit’. I must remember to avoid that in future.The people in the waiting area were a sad lot, uniformly grey and old and rather shabby. The threat of losing your sight is a wretched business,  we know the feeling well, so I may have to forgive them their air of doom. All the same, I doubt that they have done all they want to do, seen all they want to see. Nothing to look forward to?  I bet not a single one of them is ready to call it a day.The members of the poetry and language groups certainly haven’t had season enough for every purpose. There is much left to learn, their enthusiasm for art and literature, poetry, travel and music is undimmed, their pensionable age notwithstanding.  All use the internet freely, all have young families to enjoy and instruct, all follow current affairs and have well defined opinions on anything that goes on in the world.The birthday party was probably the one with the greatest tally in years and hearing aids. If you are eighty-eight most of your friends are old. But the party spirit was undiminished; glass of wine in hand, a plate with a few small delicacies precariously balanced on a knee or a side table, the guests enjoyed themselves. Plans were made for future entertainments: “We should all chip in, then nobody has to do all the work”. Although the laughter was a bit throaty, the conversations shouted, and the anecdotes no longer fresh, the company was well and truly alive. There are seasons to come. Life is sweet. Cram in as much as you can, it’ll still be too soon when it ends, and you go to that place where there’s endless time for everything.A man needs to love and hate at the same moment,to laugh and cry with the same eyes,to make love in war and war in love.And to hate and forgive and remember and forget,to arrange and confuse, to eat and digestwhat historytakes years and years to do.To be honest, I prefer my company more mixed, a variety of ages; I wouldn’t be happy living in a retirement enclave. But there’s nothing wrong with old age that a curious mind, an active life and a glass of wine with a friend cannot cure."},

{"title": "The Wonders of the WWW", "date": "Sunday 16 February 2014", "text": "or How to Spend a Profitable Afternoon. (It’s still raining)What started me off I no longer know.  I remember I was idly looking for poetry by Wilhelm Busch, to enliven a meeting of the German Conversation Group next week.  Heinrich Christian Wilhelm Busch (1832-1908) was a German humorist, poet, illustrator and painter. He published comic illustrated cautionary tales from 1859; the one most people know is the tale of Max Und Moritz, a Rascals’ History in Seven Tricks:Ah, how oft we read or hear ofboys we almost stand in fear of.For example, take these storiesof two youths, named Max and Moritz. . . . . . .Busch was a wise old bird and I enjoyed my trip down memory lane. How Busch led to Tannhauser I have no idea now, but Tannhauser was the next port of call. I am frequently surprised that the obscure subjects which interest me can be found on the internet at all;  I am duly grateful, nevertheless.Wagner’s Opera Tannhauser is well-known; I wasn’t after Wagner, I was after the legend on which Wagner based his libretto. Tannhauser was a knight who,  based on his Bußlied, (song of atonement) became the subject of legend. The story makes Tannhäuser a knight and poet who found the Venusberg, the subterranean home of Venus, and spent a year there worshipping the goddess. Not from afar, either. As these things go, he duly became aware of his sinful behaviour, left the Venusberg, asked Pope Urban for forgiveness but was told that forgiveness was as likely as it would be for the papal staff to burst into blossom. Which it promptly did, it’s a legend, after all. But Tannhauser had already gone back to ground with Venus and was never seen again.Tannhauser wasn’t only a legendary figure, he was an active courtier at the court of Frederic II in the 13th century,as I found when I clicked on a learned text, the Codex Manesse, the single most comprehensive source of Middle High German Minnesang poetry. The manuscript is famous for its colourful full-page miniatures, one each for 137 minnesingers.The Codex was compiled in the first half of the 14th century and lists the names of Minnesingers of the mid 12th to early 14th century, Tannhauser among them. (How he became the stuff of legend is not immediately apparent. I expect somebody somewhere knows but I’d have to go on clicking for a lot longer to find out.) The Codex itself has had a very turbulent destiny, having changed ownership in many wars, disputes, a succession of rulers and even for filthy lucre at times. Now it’s back in its spiritual home of the University Library of Heidelberg.The www is a wonderful tool, but rather lonely. Beloved and I used to do this sort of journey of exploration via books in the old days; ending up with piles of them, each reference leading to another, until books and time ran out. So, come suppertime, I told him of my researches and we instantly fell into the old habit, minus the pile of books. Wagner’s Tannhauser came first, Beloved being knowledgable about opera, but then we went off at a tangent, confusing Tannhauser with Lohengrin, who is a character in German Arthurian literature. The son of Parzival (Percival), he is a knight of the Holy Grail sent in a boat pulled by swans to rescue a maiden who can never ask his identity. His story, which first appears in Wolfram von Eschenbach's Parzival, is a version of the Knight of the Swan legend known from a variety of medieval sources. Wolfram was a German knight and poet, regarded as one of the greatest epic poets of his time. As a Minnesinger, he also wrote lyric poetry. (The miniature is taken from the Codex Manesse, as is the one of Tannhauser above.)Naturally Elsa, the maiden whom Lohengrin rescued and who became his wife, asked after his origin, which made Lohengrin take up boat and swan and disappear back down the Rhine, never to return.We hadn’t quite finished with our exploration; having been to Kleve (Cleves) and the Schwanenburg with the tower from which the legendary Elsa espied her knight in shining armour floating down the Rhine to rescue her, we briefly revisited our memories of the trip but soon got back to more ancient times, i.e, Anne of Cleves, the Flanders Mare, who became Henry VIII 4th wife from January to July 1540. They clearly didn’t hit it off and the marriage was speedily annulled. Holbein’s painting of her is said to be more flattering than realistic.Having arrived at Henry VIII, about whom we know far too much to feel the slightest interest in exploring him further than in theatrical plays on the stage, we finally gave up.I had a lovely time, we both did. I even enjoyed writing this post."},

Jackie is a painter, a delightful lady, very pretty, small and slim, invariably beautifully dressed. I envy her. Compared to her I am a clumsy tank.She beamed at me.”You know, I haven’t seen you for absolute ages. How are you?”I replied with the usual modified rapture, as most of us do. “Not too bad, mostly ‘-ish’.  And you?”Jackie’s smile disappeared. “Well, actually, I am not very happy at all. John’s been diagnosed with cancer.”My face fell too. It turned out that her husband had been having ‘indigestion’, went to the doctor, had tests which proved inconclusive; had more tests, was told it didn’t look like cancer. One final test showed that, yes, it was cancer. Of the liver. Inoperable. With a life expectancy of one month.“It’s quite unreal,” Jackie said. \"After the initial shock we just went back to doing what we always do. It’s as if nothing has changed. John is spending time putting his house in order, dealing with banks, insurances, etc. but otherwise we act normal. we even laugh sometimes. It’s only at night that it hits me. I lie awake, staring into the darkness.”I hugged her. There’s nothing much you can do.I’ve always wanted to know the worst. It even said so in my hospital notes: ‘U. needs to be told.’ Every time I’ve been seriously ill, I’ve researched the illness, pressed the doctors for every bit of information, asked about treatments, possible outcomes, secondary effects. The lot, anything a lay person could grasp.Would my need-to-know extend to foreknowledge of the date of my death, give or take a week? Once death becomes foreseeable, it is probably good to know how much time there is left to tidy up; the sort of jobs John’s taking care of now.  It is universally accepted that nobody wants to know the date of their departure in advance, nobody wants to be ticking off the years, months, weeks, like pouring beans out of a jar. until there are none left.I’ve been thinking about this question a lot, since I met Jackie. (It’s still raining hard.) Beloved and I have discussed it.I think I am in favour of being told early enough to clear the decks (golly, all these euphemisms), to make good, to say good bye properly. Or possibly, just to live in peace with myself, maybe a little more aware. Like John and Jackie are doing now.Getting old and knowing that life is running out is different from actually getting the date in the post. I cannot really imagine what that feels like."},

Millie and I went out twice, morning and afternoon.  We met Robin up on the castle bailey throwing a ball for Horace, the shaggy whippet who looks as if he’s wearing an Afghan coat. Millie was not amused. She likes Robin well enough and makes a fuss of him, but every time Horace raced past her she growled. Old dog ladies are like that, they feel the need to put these whippersnappers in their place. Robin and I just stood there, mesmerised by the unnatural feeling of sun on our necks. Two adults standing on top of a flat, low hill, watching a pair of mad dogs and stretching out their arm to their full extent, grinning like idiots.Magnus Manske - Wikimedia CommonsBack home I took a closer look at the garden. There are signs of life everywhere, buds and tiny shoots are appearing and the Daphne Odora Aurea-Marginata - the gold-edged fragrant Daphne - is about to burst into life. It was getting too dusky for a photo, so I filched this one from Wikimedia Commons, but mine is exactly the same. I shall take the camera round the garden at the very next opportunity and see what there is.With all this rain I’ve spent many hours reading. Good stuff and not so good stuff. One book I can recommend whole-heartedly is Barbara Kingsolver’s ‘Flight Behaviour’.  I could barely put it down.  The main character, Dellarobia Turnbow is beautifully observed, and her development from drudge to a woman with renewed hope is described with sympathy and understanding. Even her rather dreadful family on the rundown farm in the Appalachians is ultimately accorded compassion. But the main theme of the book is climate change. If there is anyone who still doesn’t get it - and I know, there are many - you might do worse than read this novel. But if this should prove too arduous a task, look at the myriad of blogposts from all corners of our planet telling us about the weird weather patterns we are all experiencing.Flight Behaviour was published in 2012 and is Kingsolver’s seventh novel; it is a New York Times Bestseller, and was declared \"Best book of the year\" by the Washington Post and USA Today.Finally, a bit of advice. Yesterday was Saint Apollonia’s day.This aged Christian matron having had her teeth pulled out before her martyrdom, is invoked against toothache. If she can’t help, “take a nail and make the gum bleed with it, then drive it into an oak.\" The very stout William Neal, who was mad with toothache and ready to shoot himself, was thereby cured.So says John Aubrey in his Miscellanies of 1695. At least he doesn’t advise us to drive the nail into the gum."},

Nostalgia was invented in 1688 by a Swiss medical student, Johannes Hofer, who described it as a “neurological disease of an essentially demonic cause.” The German word ‘Heimweh’ was eventually translated into the nationally unspecific ‘homesickness’, which means anybody can catch it, of whatever nationality.  In the 19th century, due to vast numbers of immigrants, America was the most openly homesick society known.'Home is where the heart is’ or some such drivel. Platitudes don’t help. I am not sure if the feeling of displacement ever leaves a first generation immigrant. Nowadays we call them ex-pats; the word implies an eventual return to the mother country, a temporary sojourn in a country other than the country of origin, for whatever reason.In London I knew lots of immigrants to the UK who said they would go ‘home’ again some time in the future; people of many nationalities who had lived here for decades, like me. In Valleys End there are just a few of us, less than a handful, all residents to the end of life. Probably.Going ‘home’ is a fantasy. In any case, it is far too late for me. In spite of watching German thrillers, documentaries and clever talk shows on TV, I wouldn’t know my way around, wouldn’t know modern life, wouldn’t be able to conform anymore. Worse than that, I have got into English habits. I am no longer used to excellent workmanship, efficiency and cleanliness. I have no better way of describing it than saying that I have got into the habit of sitting down on a bench in the open without wiping it  first.Also, I no longer have any close family there.So, here I am, and here I’ll stay.But there is one thing I can do. I have made arrangements with those in my family who still speak to me that I want my ashes to be chucked into the nearest river that flows into La Manche/Nordsee/The Channel. However diluted, I will eventually wash up on home ground. There’s a thought for a rainy day!"},

The unalloyed joy of grandchildren, the generous help the young give to the old, and vice versa. Lovely. I am very happy for you.But!Where are all the middle-of-the-road families, the broken and re-assembled families, where good periods and bad periods follow each other as sure as night and day? Are there only two sorts? Hellish or paradisiacal?To my utter amazement both my own children recently referred to their childhood as “dysfunctional”. Blimey! I know we had quite a rocky ride for long stretches; there was nothing ‘ideal’ about our lives for about fifteen years. It was a mainly single-parent household with a frequently absent father and a very much present working mother, who put food on their plates, a roof over their heads and clothes on their backs. And in between there were rows and cheerful times, tears and laughter and one or two seriously hairy events.Dysfunctional? One of them appears to have been gracious and forgiven me, while the other seems to want a wholesale apology and thinks it would probably be for the best if we called it a day.It’s been a few months since I was told of my inadequacies; it’s taken me all this time to absorb and digest it. You know how it is when you hear something which strikes you as really far-fetched and you put it away as unreal? That’s what I did. But, of course, the word has been niggling away at me since.  I finally looked it up.The outlook is good. My reaction has surprised me: I am entirely reconciled to the situation as it is. It’s not the first time we’ve fallen out.Much worse is that the rain just won’t stop."},

I know that lots of you are worse off than us in the Shropshire hills. Some of you have ice and snow and heat waves and biblical floods. I am truly sorry for all of you, but somehow that doesn’t make it any easier to bear what we have here: rain and permanent grey cloud cover. It’s like telling somebody to eat up their greens because there are starving children in Africa who’d give their eyeteeth for a plate of food. Your own experience of misery is always greater than an imagined one.Millie and I grabbed the opportunity and took the lane up the hill; only tarmac walking is possible at the moment. Small streams of water running downhill met us and the ditches were full to bursting. No matter, at least we weren’t drenched. Even Leonard Cohen coming over the earphones couldn’t dampen my newly resurgent spirits.I said yesterday that I was going to explain about music in our house. Beloved is a professional musician. All his life he has played with, and for, extraordinary performers, singers and soloists. He is incapable of listening to a piece of music, any piece of music, without judging and dissecting and analysing. It used to drive me mad. In the end I gave up unless I knew it was something or somebody he would listen to without comment. My tastes  are eclectic, you might even say, indiscriminate. For me it all depends on the mood of the moment.  Having finally got round to modern technology, late, as with everything, I am now able to indulge my musical preferences at any time, even in the same room as Beloved. Mind you, I still have to be careful when and where I give croaky voice in enthusiastic accompaniment!If only I had had children to introduce me to the powers of modern technology; I could have been dancing and singing years ago.

Busy minds are a sure way to keep the sleep angels away, you know the ones I mean, the four that stand at the corners of your bed and softly rock you to sleep, bestrewing your covers with rose petals and fragrant cloves; surely you know Brahm’s Lullaby? No? Your loss.Try it, this is only a short excerpt. I sang it when I was small; I can’t recollect my mum singing it to me, although I remember her singing, a lot, once times were normal again. I, in my turn, sang it to the youngest child of an English family, usually in the rose garden, just before her bedtime. I spent less than two months with them and long after I’d gone again, every female voice she heard singing on the radio, she’d stop what she was doing and say:”that’s U.”Anyway, I decided to get up and make for the drawer with the sleeping pills and promptly got side-tracked by the computer. The next time I looked it was 3.30 in the morning. Still raining outside.Talking about singing: I had been feeling particularly happy the  previous afternoon, because I’d managed to grapple with downloading some of my old CDs on to my iphone via the mac desktop. I also bought, via the ipad, a few CDs of German folk music and Lieder, stuff I hadn’t heard in decades. Going through my CD shelves I found a collection of Mittel-European music, songs my mum used to listen to on the radio and hum or sing along to. Operettas,  Kaffeehaus songs, Chansons,Viennese songs. Not being a techno whizz and working with three different digital gadgets, I could feel myself getting more and more excited when it all came together. I was also looking forward to getting stuck in with the earphones. Excitement and happiness are not good for me, a visit to the medicine drawer was indicated,  for a tranquilizer to take me back down a bit.Music can be a little problematic in our house. ( I shall have to explain about that tomorrow.) Music via earphones is fine, I can listen undisturbed, even when I’m in the same room as Beloved. There I was, stretched out on the sofa in the living room, stupid smile on my face, positively swooning. The perfect occupation for a wet afternoon. Beloved reading, Millie dreaming by the fire, Not such a bad life after all!Except that, by the time Marlene Dietrich oozed nostalgia and the heartbreaking strains of ‘Lili Marleen' into my ears, I was bawling, tears streaming down my face, more homesick than ever.This version is in English.                                                                               I want to wallow in peace, so no comments.

The island mentality of the Brits is getting me down, their endless bickering about anything ‘bloody foreign’, their need to be in competition with other nations and whistling in the wind of their imagined, natural, inborn superiority.

I need something light and easy, nothing that will require research, nothing too serious, nothing too personal.”Having just finished reading ‘Stoner’ by John Williams, the must-read novel of 2013 according to the literary establishment in the UK, I was still deep within the pages of this bleakly depressing and utterly gripping book; nothing suitable sprang to mind.“Have you mentioned 'Bring Up The Bodies’ yet?” Beloved answered, metaphorically scratching his head. We went to see the second of the Mantel adaptations at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon last Saturday.“I want something light and entertaining. Besides,  the people who read my blog are not culture vultures. A review of a serious play would interest few of them.”“Yes, I see that; of course, you want to write for your readers. Mind you, the Tudors are absolutely at the top of the tree of current interest. You can’t get away from them on TV.”Beloved had a point. There’s one more or less populist programme after the other about them; learned researchers and historians strutting their stuff in front of the cameras, not to mention fictionalisations with added cleavage, smouldering, meaningful looks and gruesome executions galore.Henry VIII went in for gruesome executions on a grand scale. Depending on which source you follow, during his reign between 1509 and 1547, a­n estimated 57,000  to 7­2,000 English subjects lost their heads, and not in a nice, flirtatious way. As soon as he ascended the throne he chopped off the heads of his father’s most influential advisers; he was probably just following the old adage  'start as you mean to go on’.  New brooms and all that. By comparison, his daughter , who succeeded him on the throne,  killed fewer than 300 people during her six years as queen. But she came to be called ‘Bloody Mary’. Talk about double standards. Feminism still has a job to do on this one, even in these enlightened times.“No, writing about Tudor politics doesn’t strike me as an apt subject for a lightweight blogpost.” I needed to turn the conversation back to the matter in hand.“Put like that, I agree.”“Just think though, nowadays, if governments want to do away with politicians who have served their purpose, or others, who have become a thorn in the flesh of whoever happens to be paying the piper, they get the media to do it for them. No blood visible. Public opinion will do the rest. Blood and circuses for the 21st century. In Tudor times, the populace gathered around the scaffold or the executioner’s block, today, we read the Daily Muckraker.“At least we no longer kill them dead.”“No such luck, instead they get to ‘spend more time with their families’ “.“This is all very well, and I’m sure we could go on, but it still leaves me short of an idea for a blogpost. Something light and funny, maybe?”PS: For US readers: “Spending time with one’s family is a metaphor for being sent into the desert politically."},

Unannounced, just on the spur of the moment. We invited him in, sat him down at the kitchen table and gave him a cup of tea. The first thing I noticed was that he’d lost weight.“You said I could pop in any time I was passing, so I took you at your word. I’m just on my way to Costcutter for a few things for lunch.\"It’s true, it’s what I said. And meant.When we first met him, sixteen years ago, Bernard was upright, entertaining, a pillar of the community, the Church and the Conservative Party. An ex-soldier, and something to do with the Ministry of Defence afterwards, he had literally travelled the world. I don’t think there was a continent on which he had not left his footprint. He was full of stories of his travels, all of them amusing; and most of all, he was full of himself,  but in an easy, relaxed, way. He and I got on very well; when his stories became too expansive and unending, I pulled his leg. He seemed to like that, possibly felt flattered.Now, at 92, Bernard is no longer the man he was.“One’s social life dries up with age, you know. We find entertaining rather difficult now and we hardly ever go to anyone.”Bernard’s wife Annabel is an invalid; the two of them have help in house and garden, but he is her main carer and does all the cooking and general looking-after. He cannot understand why former friends and acquaintances appear to have dropped them.“Annabel is fine in the afternoon”, he said, sounding genuinely puzzled and a little sad.Many of their friends and acquaintances have died and those who are still around, are old themselves. There are a few younger, more recent acquaintances, like Beloved and me, with whom he and Annabel socialised into their eighties. I feel guilty for not having had them to tea or lunch in recent months. My feeble excuse is that they are a very difficult couple to slot into any social occasion.Bernard sat and chatted. His need to talk about himself has not abated, but instead of travelling yarns he now talks about his children and grandchildren. And his and Annabel’s health problems. The sort of thing lots of old people talk about. Ambulances and doctors’ surgeries and medication feature prominently.\"Of course”, he said, “the old waterworks don’t function all that well anymore either. I’ve started to leak. They’ve given me incontinence pants to wear.” He grinned at me.  “Yes, they’ve engineered them for men to wear. Who’d have known?”"},

My dad was particularly good at that; we used to let him work through the list and congratulate him when he finally matched name to person.No, none of the above.I am talking about the really good ideas, the clever ones, the insightful, creative ones.

Or at work, a problem which has irritated or confused you for many months, and suddenly, you have that light bulb moment, and there’s the solution, as plain as the nose on your face.  Or maybe you have a really insightful thought, one of those that should be anthologised, an aphorism destined to be forever repeated by bloggers given to filling their posts with quotations.I am sure you know the sort of thing I mean.If you do, and are the person who experiences a flash of brilliance, I advise you to write it down there and then. Somebody, something will interrupt your train of thought and the solution to all the evils of the world will have disappeared for ever. Einstein/Shakespeare/Beethoven never allowed a mere mortal  to disturb the creative muse, that’s for sure.But now I finally come to the point of this post (the idea for which I’ve nicked from PerlNumquist at his blog Mental Floss) : what happens to that collection of bright thoughts which appear like shooting stars across the night sky, only to disappear as quickly? Where do they go?Everything on our planet is recycled.Is there a bottomless pit in the brain where they collect, become a kind of primordial compost heap of thoughts which rots down over the years, only to be recycled as manure for new growth?Is it possible that ‘wisdom comes with age’ is nothing more than absent-mindedness during middle age?"},

THE RIVER AVON - SHAKESPEARE’S AVON! Are you all too polite to put me right or could it be that one river in a far-off country is much like any other, as it obviously is to me. It took my friend Frank to point out my mistake. He is good at that."},

I am a PUSSYCAT, I’ll have you know.So, for about two minutes, under the above heading,  I thought of becoming a brighter, sweeter, leaner, fitter, kinder me in 2014.The problem is that it is 2014 now and I would therefore have to make a start instantly. Have you seen the weather? Have you seen how dark and gloomy it is and how persistent the rain lashes the windows? Have you heard the slates on the roof rattle in the wind ? The baubles are packed away for another year, the candles have been extinguished and the lingering smell of myrrh and frankincense is turning a bit rancid. Villagers are exhausted after the relentless festive jollities, although it helps that grandchildren have waved a fond farewell and are once more the sole responsibility of their parents. Hibernation seems an admirable plan to follow. Leavened by chocolates, schmaltzy TV, and a lot of reclining on sofas with a not-necessarily-improving book, and a sprinkle of self-indulgent outings now and then to ensure that life support systems remain functional.If double-faced Janus, the Roman God who looks back to the old and forward to the new year, who gave this  long, dreary month its name, cannot make up his mind which way to march, who am I to decide for him?  By the time January is over, any pious resolve as to improvement of character will have got buried under the paving slabs of the road to hell, so why bother?On second thoughts, no New Year’s Resolutions for me."},

We’d wait for the bus then, about half past four. The bus driver used to get the papers for people and he’d chuck them straight through the window like, somewhere where we lived, and us boys would all line up and see who could catch the papers. Whoever caught them, took em, you see, 'cause we’d get an apple or some sweets if we took the papers that night. There’d be fighting between us who’d get to take the papers. It’s a wonder they got their papers all in one. Of course the furthest away would give you some apples and then you’d eat 'em all before you got home because you dinna wanna share 'em. You’d take your time coming back. We used to have to walk, didn’t have pushbikes or anything, always had to walk to take 'em.We used to pick all the apples around our way, and the blackberries. There weren’t no blackberries round our way we didn’t pick. And hazelnuts. The only thing dad ever did with us was when we were sledging, he used to come sledging with us, and the other time was when we were picking hazelnuts.Our mum, we'd go on the road with her, like, with the big pram and the baby would be in there and another one sat on the side like,  and another one in her tummy likely. and we’d go down the road like and her’d say pull the sticks out of the hedge,  and her would fill the pram across like and you couldn’t see the baby in the pram  because these sticks is all across, We’d get 'em home like and we’d saw em up for firewood for her. Wonder the farmers didn’t curse us for taking the sticks from the hedge. And she’d have this sack round her and go in the fields to help pick potatoes for the farmers and the pram’d stand in the middle of the field and when we got home like the pram was full of spuds. We had to pull the pram off the field some days when it was really wet. The farmer came round and mother got payed like; mother had the money, we never had any of it.  If she saw big ones, mother‘d say 'cover 'em over', we’ll have them later on.Them were days them were. We never sat in the house, we was miserable when it was wet because we couldn’t go out, be under mother’s feet.  Good days they were, everybody the same. You’d leave your back door open. Monday morning was wash morning and everybody have their washing out on the same day. We’d just have a bath on a Sunday night. all of us in a cold bath. You’d fill it up with hot water from the boiler like and we’d all get in there,  we all had the same water, three in a bath like. Mother then put all the clothes in and soaked em all, to get most of the muck off like and then fill the boiler again and boil the water again and put all the washing in the boiler  and you’d have a big stick like and stir it all up. Then you’d rinse 'em all out and put 'em in this old mangle. We’d turn the handle for her and then Monday morning out on the line they went. Bloody great line about half mile long, nappies, nappies all the way.Yes three of us in a bath. and we’d all try to get in first, because it was hot then, by the time you got out and the next lot went in, the water was cold. so you’d all be willing to get in quick like, girls or boys, be first to get in like, and it’d be clean water then.  There’d be an old scullery, somewhere at the back and everybody’d be shivering like mad, once you got out of the warm water, be bloody cold, shaking like, specially in the winter. In them days there was no heating. You’d run into the kitchen to the stove to dry off, and we never  had colds, we was hardy. It’s that entral heating you get colds from, innit,  have it too hot and then go out in the cold. That’s what does it.”PostscriptumSome commenters have assumed that Gardener must be a very old man and that his stories tell of a time long gone. Not so. Gardener is in his 60s and he was a boy in the 1950s when times in rural England and Wales were still very hard for the peasants and birth control was unheard of."},

I was  five when I was christenend. I had three or four behind me, following me like, a little baby and I think there was three others between me and the baby, we was all christened together. It didn’t make  me cry; they dinna pick me up either, they put some water on me forehead.O aye, there used to be a lot of us there on a Sunday morning at Sunday School, that’s the only time we ever got dressed up. When we got home mother said take all them clean clothes off, put the dirty ones on, go out and play now.  I had a little pillover, mother had knitted, short sleeves like, I think I was about five year when I first had it. I give it up when I was about ten. I used to pull it down, but I grew out of it like, over five years.Mother’d knit a sleeveless pillover in a night. Knit the back, do the front, then sew it all up. Her was quick, never looked at it like, the needles was going but you never see her look at it. We used to hold the wool out and roll it all up for her.We made a fair few carpets too. We used to cut the cloth to a certain length then you’d pull it through the mat. We did a hell of a lot of them for mother. My eldest sister went to Bridgenorth when her first left school. Her went to a carpet factory and her used to bring these offcut carpets and the wool like and we used to do it all with wool like, and patterns too; used to keep us busy at night. No telly then.  One’d be doing one pattern, the other’d be doing another. Could be about eight of us living at home at one time; three in a bed; me older brother and me younger brother. But he had more sense because he used to sleep in the middle and come winter time he used to pull the blankets and there’d be none on your side and the other brother used to sleep against the wall, so he could never lose his like, and I’d be on the outside and I’d be the one with nothing on me. We’d be tugging away there. trying to get covered.We went to Felindre  once and we stopped the night at me mum’s mother. She was in bed like, her was getting on,  her couldn’t get out of bed like and her’d have this stick and her’d be banging on the floor like and we’d be down below, listening. Her was just like a witch. The bedroom was all one big room with curtains like,  and we stopped this night and there was eight of us in one bed, and her was there round the corner, grumbling and mumbling like, just like a bloody witch.Me dad went with his brother in law fishing, salmon fishing like, and they didn’t get caught. Next morning, early light, we get back to Weston, that’s down the dale; we went to school at Compton. Of course, when we got home, we missed the bloody bus. The bus used to take us about two and a half  miles and then we used to have to walk about another mile to school. So we all had to walk down the road to school like; you had to, you couldn’t stay at home like because you'd missed the bus. We all walked together and we got to school.We had to walk another mile when the bus dropped us off, there was a happle tree on the right hand side; of course, being kids, we used to pick up sticks and chuck them in the tree like to get the apples to fall and catch ‘em, and if it had been a windy night you’d go the next morning and there’d be umpteen sticks in the road, all the sticks that had got stuck in the tree. Same as the conker tree it was; we were always there chucking our sticks up to get the conkers down. In the village we had a big hole in the hedge and there was a horchard off the road. Mrs. Dollor owned it and us kids, we dared one another to go, you know, go on, get through the hole, and get some apples like. I mean if we’d a gone and ast her, her’d have given us some apples. But it was just for the dare like, we had to dare ourselves like. We were right buggers for pinching.\"final instalment tomorrow."},

The gardener herself hibernates under glass in a heated room, buried up to the neck, not in compost, but in garden catalogues and books.Gardener turned up not so much for work as to bring annual Christmas greetings, coming into the kitchen with clean boots, well-scraped on the mat, and ready for a cup of tea, a piece of cake and a long leisurely ramble over the past.One of gardener’s pet grumbles is the ingratitude shown by kids. He had been telling us his favourite Halloween story, about how he’d given a ‘whole ruck of them’ sweets and bags of crisps, and how the ungrateful little blighters had opened the bags on their way to the garden gate and tipped them all out on the path. “They never got nothing from me any other year!” Gardener snorted in disgust.“Christmas is just the same”, he continued.\"Who believes in Christmas today;  people under forty. they don’t even bother to go to Church, do they.”  (Gardener is not in the least religious)“We were lucky if we got a present, a horange and a napple is what we got. The kids today’d chuck it back at you. Apple and orange is good for you, they tell you years ago. Fruits is good for you. Now kids don’t wanna eat it. If you had a banana they took the skin off you. I reckon if we all went to Church the world would be a lot better place. if everybody made a heffort to go to Church on a Sunday, dress up and go to Church, get to know all your locals and that, it would be a better place, like it did years ago. Like in Wales, see, they had Chapels, they used to dress up, all in their nines, go to chapel and they talk then, they’d get to talking, and they knew everybody in the village, all the scandal like.\"\"I can see my grandad now, with his trilby hat on and his suit on and his tie and all dressed up to the nines and his wife, granny, her ‘d have her big hat on as well, every Sunday, they’d walk about 2 1/2 miles to the Chapel. That’s the only time her take her pinny off, to go to Church Sunday morning, 11 o’clock like. get back for one o’clock for dinner and that. You’d put your meat in in the morning. and be back for one o’clock.\"\"The Welsh are more religious than what we are, chapelwise.  I used to go to Sunday school every Sunday from the age of 4 till I was 10 and-a-half. We left then, but up until then, every Sunday morning we was off to chapel, 2 miles away, we’d walk, all of us, we’d do drawing and all sorts, up at Ditton Priors. It’s still there, the little Chapel is.  Then at Christmas, we’d have a big do, in the main big Church, and in the Village Hall, and they used to give us a little present each, more than we had of our parents like.  It was a toy off the big christmas tree and they’d call your name out and you’d have to go to get your little parcel like, up under the tree.\"\"Mother’d give us a penny and you’d buy a penny stamp see and you’d put it in a book, off a Sunday, then you’d have your penny stamps all in there, I think mother got all the books, well I don’t know who’s got them now, but somebody’s got all the books, because we never cashed them in, so some lucky bugger’s got em or they’ve all been chucked away.\"Part 2 to follow tomorrow.Tabor:  One Day At a TimeActually, that would make a splendid post for many.

Babylon’s WhoreDefiled with superstition, like the GentilesOf Old, that worshipped onions, roots and lentils.'Later, however, the ‘solid, substantial, Protestant mince pie’became the champion of the English Christmas against‘imported foreign kickshaws’.Ah well, from Evil to Virtue and back was ever just a short distance,if it suited the prevailing fashion.Personally, I dislike mince pies; they’re too sweet, too sticky, too unimaginative for my palate.Mistletoeis sold in outdoor markets everywhere.Folklore says that it is on no account to be brought indoors until Christmas Eve.Clearly, nobody told the owners of this barn restaurant.Most powerful of all against evil is the rare oak-mistletoe, which should be gathered at New Moon without the use of iron, and never allowed to touch the ground; but mistletoe grown on apple trees or the sacred hawthorn is also especially worth having.Mistletoe is likewise an aphrodisiac and a plant of fertility, hence perhaps the originally Welsh Border custom of kissing beneath mistletoe boughs decked with ribbons, nuts and apples. After each kiss, the lady concerned should pluck a berry and throw it over her left shoulder; and when the berries come to an end, so should the kissing.There are an awful lot of berries on a bough!"},

Shakespeare said of such a sky: “ Like a red morn that ever yet betokened,Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,Sorrow to the shepherds, woe unto the birds.Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.”Hard to believe that a spectacular morning like this will soon turn into a wet and miserably grey day, even though there are plenty of metereological reasons. A German saying goes: Red dawn fills the well, red dusk will dry it.Still, the miserable day had a good outcome, we finished writing our christmas cards. Music, a glass of Gluehwein and some chocolates were all part of the pleasure.Finally, a bit of advice: Even in cold weather, beware of taking cats to bed for warmth.‘As this beast has been familiarly nourished of many, so have they paid dear for their love, being requited with the loss of their health and sometimes of their life......for it is most certain that the breath and savour of Cats consume the radical humour and destroy the lungs and therefore they which keep their Cats with them in their beds have the air corrupted, and fall into severe Hekticks and Consumptions.’Edward Topsell, History of Four-footed Beasts, 1607You have been warned!

{"title": "Advent Calendar Day xx The Common Holly", "date": "Friday 13 December 2013", "text": "The bringing in of evergreen branches to decorate homes and barns is a custom which goes back to pre-Christian times. The holly, with its red berries and sharp spines, was seen as a powerful fertility symbol and a charm against witches, goblins and the devil. Some writers say that it is unlucky to plant a holly near a house whereas others say that hollies were deliberately planted under the belief that they were good lightening conductors and would prevent the lightening striking the house. These contradictions could be a result of different practices in different parts of the UK. It is reputedly unlucky to cut down a holly tree and some believe this is why hollies may have remained when parts of woods were felled or hedges grubbed up. Other evidence suggests this may have been because the evergreen leaves provide sightlines and guides to those walking in the countryside or ploughing fields. In the past, boiled young holly leaves were used as a cure for colds, bronchitis and rheumatism and although they are poisonous, berries were recommended as a laxative!The Woodland TrustFrom the Language of Flowers 1834Holly: ForesightThe providence of Nature demonstrates itself in a singular manner in this handsome plant. Its berries serve to feed the little birds which never quit our climate; and it furnishes them with an hospitable shelter during the rigours of the months of frost. Would it not seem as if Nature, by a tender forethought, had taken pains to preserve the verdure of this fne tree all the winter, and to arm it with thorns in order that it might furnish both food and defence to the innocent creatures that resort to it for refuge? It is a friend which her all powerful hand preserves against the period when friends fly and all other reliance fails."},

Who was it who said “the best laid plans of mice and men go oft a-gley”, or similar? At least my punishment is not grief and pain, just feeling a bit sheepish. I really admire bloggers who post more or less daily, particularly those who write about more than their daily routines.We’ve been shopping, ordinary household shopping as well as Christmas shopping. I hate it. I have yet to meet anybody who has a good word to say for the pre-Christmas mania which seems to overcome a goodly portion of the population. For heavens' sakes, people, the shops will only be closed for 2 days max., and how much can you eat at one or two meals anyway? I am getting too old for pushing through crowds or standing in long queues, waiting for my turn at the check-out. Too old, too impatient, too cross, too cranky.An added irritation is the canned music. Tinny Christmas songs on a loop, over and over. I stood in line, fuming, mouthing “Oh, shut up already” and glowering at people who were singing along. The proverbial old witch killing the Christmas spirit.The only kind of shopping I can bear at the moment is the posh, expensive kind; small speciality shops where the customer chooses with care and baskets hold just a few items - you couldn’t afford to buy more - patisseries, hand made chocolate shops, smokeries for smoked fish and meat delicacies, a delicatessen, a cheese shop, a wine merchant. I love foodie treats. Ludlow, our local market town, is a foodie Mecca, a genuine slow-food-city, which still offers a choice between mass-produced and artisan-sourced goods.I seem to remember having posted a similar rant last year, and probably for several years running. What can I do, give up pre-Christmas shopping altogether? I’d have to find something else to complain about."},

Both bay and rosemary grow in the garden and both have a lovely scent when rubbed between the fingers, or simply placed in a warm environment.Evergreen rosemary - the rose of the Virgin Mary -  is one of the special plants for Christmas. There is a lovely legend connected with it: it was believed to blossom at  midnight on Christmas Eve, and to have acquired its scent from the garments of the Infant Jesus, which the Virgin hung out to dry on a rosemary bush. Rosemary does indeed flower in winter.‘Rosemary comforteth the brain, the memory and the inward senses. The distilled water of the flowers, being drunk morning and evening, taketh away the stench of the mouth and breath, and maketh it very sweet’.Gerard’s Herbal 1636Also:Where rosemary grows, the woman rules the House.

Children who had been well behaved and never told fibs and never irritated grown-ups and were most unchildlike during the previous year were finally rewarded for their creepiness.They might have saved themselves the trouble, the naughty ones had presents too, of course. They just promised to be good in future.Jane Collier in her The Art of Ingeniously Tormenting (1753) had a splendid use for real pests:‘There is no better use of having your children noisy and troublesome, than this of plaguing all your acquaintance. For you may suffer them, when you have visitors, to make such a racket that you cannot hear one another speak. Let them also, with their greasy fingers, soil and besmear your visitors’ clothes; put their fingers and dirty noses into the cream pot, and dribble over the sugar............... in short, be more troublesome and offensive than squirrels, parrots or monkeys.Fair enough; but wouldn’t it have been easier not to invite visitors in the first place?I’ve joined the ranks of the doddery, confused old ladies.The ones with capacious bags, shawls and gloves and a head like a sieve.I went for a hair cut today. It was a bitterly cold day with very strong winds and I shuttled up and down the high street as fast as I could. Perhaps that’s why I couldn’t find the Post Office on the way there. Actually, they’d moved it since the last time I went. Would you believe they’d hidden it in the back of the Boar’s Head ? They’re doing it to confuse old dears like me, I’m sure.Much worse is what happened after the hair cut:  I left the salon, coat done up to the neck and scarf wound round head and shoulders, spoiling my fresh hairdo instantly. Half way down the high street I thought my face felt funny, something was missing.  I turned round and went back into the salon.The girls looked up from the heads they were beautifying.“Did I leave my glasses behind”, I asked, slightly shaky and unsteady from being buffeted by the wind. \"I can’t see a lot without them. Or perhaps they’re in my bag?” I upended my large handbag and rummaged around in the contents, now piled on the waiting area sofa.“Which glasses do you mean,” Justine asked, looking round for them, then looking back at me.“You’re wearing them.”"},

We spoke to each other in Low German, laughing, giggling and sighing in unison, and recalling long lost family members. Now she’s gone.When I’m sad, cooking helps. I enjoy cooking at any time, but in times of crisis I find preparing food to be both soothing and healing, the messier the better. I found all the ingredients in freezer and store cupboard: minced pork, a roll of sausage meat and a slab of stuffing with nuts and cranberries. Add marjoram, thyme and oregano, herby French mustard, salt and pepper and get kneading with your bare hands.When all the ingredients are well mixed, form the meat dough into balls, again with bare hands, and either fry in a little olive oil or grill.I fried mine; for one thing, fried food is comforting (I don’t very often indulge) and for another, you get these gorgeous burnt bits, which scrape into a delicious Hunter’s sauce made with wine and slivers of champignons.We had a portion each for our dinner, toasting my dear old friend Helga and wishing her safe journey into the next world. It’s what we do in my world, food and drink are for the dead as well as the living."},
{"title": "Advent Diary,  day 3  -  In Ludlow ", "date": "Tuesday 3 December 2013", "text": "The plan was to leave home before midmorning, to drop Beloved off in town to do his errands at his own pace and for me to scoot around, rather faster, do some Christmas shopping, pop into Country Clothing for some much needed new trousers and maybe also replace a jumper; then go off to my afternoon meeting with the German Conversation group, which was the main reason for driving into town. I’d pick him up again in the supermarket car park and off we’d go, back home.“So, what’s the plan then? What exactly is it you want to do in Ludlow”, said he.“The same as I said last night,  do some shopping and pop along to the meeting”, said I.“How long will you be?”“That depends on when we’re leaving. Are you ready?”“Yes, but seriously, how long will you need in town? I am thinking of the time I have to spend wandering around. And what about the dog?”“Three hours, no less.”“That’s rather a long time, isn’t it? And what about lunch?”“The group will take up 90 minutes minimum. I won’t have time for lunch, I’ll buy a sandwich and eat it before the meeting, probably sitting in the car. And the dog will have to stay in the car too, until I have time to give her a walk.”“There isn’t really much point in me coming, is there”, said he.“That depends on what you need to do in town”, said I.“Well, I have to go to the Bank, but everything else can wait. If you could go to the Bank for me, I could stay here with the dog.”We had had a very similar conversation the previous evening. Beloved is by no means confused or mentally impaired, he just doesn’t like being left behind and he also doesn’t like spending time in town on his own. I think his secret plan was for a long, leisurely joint lunch, a quick visit to the Bank and for my shopping to find itself done miraculously, perhaps by the efforts of  Heinzelmaennchen,  those mythical fairies who in olden days allowed the good burghers of Cologne a life of indolence.“Of course I’ll go to the Bank for you. Anything else?”By now mid-morning had been and gone, Our conversations take a lot less time in the writing than in real time. They are dropped and picked up again in the ordinary course of leaving and entering the room, sorting bags, writing shopping lists, falling over the dog, getting the car out of the garage, putting the phone on charge, checking the temperature prior to choosing a coat and scarf, and making sure that the kitchen sink is safely stowed in the boot of the car.Finally, I was off. On my own. Exhortations to take care and come home safely following me. I reached Ludlow just after 12 noon. No time to eat, barely time to shop, and as for Country Clothing, some other day perhaps.Men."},
{"title": "Advent Diary, day 2 - In The Garden", "date": "Monday 2 December 2013", "text": "On a cold, dank, misty 2nd December gardening was less a pleasure than it’s ever been. But needs must, there were the final leaves to be swept off the lawn, gutters to be cleared, the most unsightly of the herbaceous clumps to be cut down, previously dug up dahlia tubers to be laid in boxes, stem side up and covered in compost, ready for sprouting next spring. The job which saddens me most of all is the final rose pruning. I leave buds and half-open flowers for as long as possible, well after the first frost; the bushes look totally lopsided and unnatural before I tackle the task. Long stems with a cluster of buds at the end reach into grey skies, wind beaten and defiant,  However, if I want to safeguard the bushes, I must cut all long, sappy growth back, regardless of flowers; strong winds would otherwise rock the plants and damage - or even lift - the roots. So that’s what Paul and I did today; rescuing just a few buds here and there, which will probably not survive for more than a couple of days in the warmth of the house. The last rose of summer - doesn’t that sound sad?Gardener still doesn’t know that there is a Paul in my life and garden. He was due here last Thursday; there was no call to explain his absence. He rarely comes during December, except to bring a small present and drink tea with us just before Christmas. The last time he came I made him linger over the tea break, asking endless questions about his childhood. He loves talking.The first Sunday in Advent today and I received my first enquiry regarding our plans for Christmas.“What are you doing for Christmas”, is the standard phrase used by everybody. “Have you got family coming?\"Millie and I were out for our usual afternoon walk around the castle. It’s close to the house and she can roam and explore to her heart’s content without having to be on a lead at any time. Mostly, I lose sight of her; at any rate, she knows her way home and I am free to wander and let my thoughts take me where they will.As I was climbing the bank, Piper, a huge and unruly Gordon setter came bounding up to me, which meant Helen couldn’t be far away. I could hear her shouting: “Gently, Piper, gently.” Piper is friendly but there’s nothing gentle about him. Since he once thumped my knees so hard that he had me reeling, I am careful of him. Millie saw him from afar and came galloping to the rescue, imperilling my foothold even more. Helen soon reached us and grabbed hold of Piper’s collar.“No family? Aw,” she said and pulled a face, implying that she was sad for me. “What about you, are you having a family Christmas?” I asked in return. Several members of Helen’s family live in Valley’s End. Helen looked away for a moment, then said, that no, she was going to have a quiet Christmas on her own and for once wouldn’t have to cook a turkey. “For the first time in 30 years”, she added. “We will have a family meal a few days before Christmas though.”  Helen was bright and cheerful about it. “I am going to eat cold things from the fridge and sit all day by the fire, doing nothing.” It was my turn to pull a ‘sorry for you” face. “No, no, she said, it’ll be lovely, I don’t often do nothing. It’ll be really good.\""},

The hole was deep and dark and nary a glimmer of light visible on the few occasions when I strained to lift my head. I kept away from people, both in the real world and here; poor Beloved had to bear the brunt of the antisocial, miserable, self-pitying, gloomy me.And please, don’t anybody come with a cheery “Be Positive” mantra.For the person who is physically and mentally on their knees it is the most counter-productive, useless bit of advice anybody could give.Strangely enough, it was a TV programme on my German home channel which gave me a leg-up this time. A discussion about death and dying, the five participants had either experienced life-threatening accidents and illnesses, or were involved professionally in the hospice movement. One man who particularly impressed me was the former Michelin Chef Ruprecht Schmidt, who gave up a career in top restaurants to cook for the ‘guests’ spending their final weeks of life in the Hamburg Hospice Hamburg Leuchtfeuer, giving each what they most wanted to eat, cooking the dishes ‘as mother did’. It seems that simple fare is what most people want at the end of their lives. Schmidt’s motto is “Wer isst, lebt noch” (you are alive while you can eat). Asked what made him decide to leave the stressful and competitive world of haute cuisine, he said : \"It no longer gave me pleasure; I wanted to do something important and meaningful”.Normal service will/will not be resumed tomorrow."},
{"title": "the table", "date": "Monday 18 November 2013", "text": "The kitchen was always the centre of the house, in fact, we had what was called a living kitchen then, one large room with a table and chairs in the middle, a cast iron range to one side and a dresser to the other. If the kitchen was the centre, the table was the heart of our home. We had our meals at it, father read the paper there and I did my homework. Any family discussions were held here, fists banging the table for emphasis when the talk became heated. The few visitors we had were invited to take a seat, and uncles and aunts had their own regular places. I took my books here, colouring books to start, later picture books, then reading books. In the evenings mum and dad and I played cards or board games, likeBlack Peter (Schwarzer Peter)and Mensch Aergere Dich Nicht.when it comes to suspected child abuse.Another week, another horror story about a child somewhere, in a perfectly ordinary street, in a house just down the road or in the next village, the next town, being ill treated, beaten, starved to death. We hear of it when the child is found dead, when dramatic headlines make us shudder, when the parents or childminders end up in court, justifying their miserable existence. And we stare at the angelic faces of toddlers smiling at us from the TV screen and ask ourselves how it is possible that somebody has slammed their fist into that innocent face.How is it possible that nobody noticed before it was too late? I am not talking about professionals, the child protection services, police, social workers et al. Each time it happens they trot out the same excuses and explanations: too many cases, pressure of work, lack of funding, manipulative and sly parents pulling the wool over their eyes, lack of co-ordinated working methods, working under impossible conditions.Be that as it may, we have to accept that the professionals do their best, although their best is often just not good enough. And always, after each new inquiry into another catastrophe: “LESSONS MUST BE LEARNED” is the mantra everyone is agreed upon.What I want to know is: where are the neighbours, the Nosy Parker women down the road? the curtain twitchers? the women who used to make it their business to know what goes on in the block of flats? the terraced road? Everybody's  auntie Ada, who knew the name of every kid, always had a nosy question, a dusty sweet, or a quick clip round the earhole if you’d done something naughty or dangerous. You ran from her mad cackle, but you also ran to her if you were in trouble.Where is that woman now?Keeping Herself To Herself, Minding Her Own Business, like all the others of her ilk? I want them back, one in every street, in  every block of flats. They’d know what goes on behind closed doors. They’d hear the screams of helpless children, they’d see the bruises and thin little bodies.  We’d curse them for busy-bodying, we’d ridicule them for interfering in matters that don’t concern them. Instead, we should praise their vigilance and willingness to help when needed. If they saved just one of these little mites from terror and abuse, I’d gladly put up with them.Come on, auntie Ada, do your stuff. You know you want to."},
{"title": "Overheard, or Life, Glorious Life", "date": "Thursday 14 November 2013", "text": "“Hello, Good Morning Mrs. Williams, I’m Doctor Barnsley, how are you today?”“Not too bad,”Mrs. Williams is an elderly lady, small, with a cloud of wispy, snow-white hair framing her delicate face, and possessed of a very sweet smile and gentle demeanour. She leans back into her pillow and awaits Doctor Barnsley’s further utterances.“I’m glad to hear that,”he says and sits down on the edge of her hospital bed. He is a big chap, robustly healthy, the rugger type, as so many doctors seem to be. He is in shirt-sleeves, his stethoscope casually draped round his neck. He takes her wrist in his large hand, his thumb on her pulse. “I’ve come to talk to you about the test results. You remember the ultrasound and x-rays you had, Mrs. Williams?”Barnsley is calm and professional. Mrs. Williams nods, she is poorly physically, but compos mentis.“Do you remember I told you that we found that lump in your chest? It’s bigger than we hoped it would be.” Barnsley gives Mrs. Williams time to grasp what he says. She continues to look up at him trustingly, her sweet smile still in place. Again she nods, but doesn’t say anything. “There’s nothing we can do about the lump; it’s too big and quite inoperable. We believe that the usual treatments wouldn’t be much use to you; they’d be harsh and it is unlikely that you would gain anything.”Barnsley’s voice is measured, slow, utterly dispassionate, yet not unsympathetic. He offers no personal emotion, but he repeats his sentence in slightly different words, to make sure that Mrs. Williams understands. Her smile grows serious but doesn’t disappear altogether. Mrs. Williams knows how to behave. Then she coughs, pressing her handkerchief to her lips. The cough is long drawn out; she finds it hard to get her breath.“But that doesn’t mean that we can do nothing at all,”Barnsley continues, his voice remaining even and relaxed.“We can make you comfortable, free from pain.”This is another sentence he repeats several times, using different words. “We can make sure that there is no pain and you will be comfortable at all times. You will have to have more care at home, of course. Who looks after you? How much help do you have?”Mrs. Williams has children and there’s a husband. “You will have to have professional help too; we can arrange for that through Social Services.”Mrs. Williams receives her death sentence as calmly as Doctor Barnsley pronounces it. I am no longer certain that she has fully understood that her days are not only numbered, as all of ours are, but that her numbers will run out in the near future and that there will be a period of suffering and pain to go through, no matter how helpful modern medicine is. Her smile fades. Her eyes become vacant, no longer focussing on the speaker.Doctor Barnsley rises to leave, gently putting Mrs. Williams’ hand on the coverlet, patting it, absently. “I’ll get the nurses to ring for your family.” Mrs. Williams speaks for the first time.“Thank you,” she says.Later in the day, husband and son arrive. Doctor Barnsley also appears. He speaks quietly to the two men. All I can hear him say, repeatedly, is:”She knows, she understands.”Mrs. Williams herself is silent, a barely perceptible presence.  Neither husband nor son address her directly. Doctor Barnsley excuses himself and the men stay at the foot of the bed; now and then a word punctures the invisible fog of helplessness surrounding them. “Come on, Dad, let’s go and have a coffee,”the son finally says. Dad agrees.“Back in a bit, Mum,” he says, as they turn to leave.Not much later Mrs. Williams softly snores. She has fallen asleep."},
{"title": "\"David? David Tennant?", "date": "Sunday 10 November 2013", "text": "is that you?I like your hair extensions.\"D.T. is not only famous for having been a splendid Doctor Who but also for his work on stage. His Hamlet, for instance,  was a revelation. By now everybody who is in the least interested in serious theatre knows what a huge success the current Richard II at the RSC in Stratford is. We booked our tickets last winter, when the box office opened. I think tickets for the whole run were sold out within a few days.Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king’s vanity and weakness threaten to drag his people into civil war. Tennant’s performance is mesmerising, growing in power as Richard’s authority declines. Richard only begins to value his kingship as he loses it to the usurper Bolingbroke and achieves tragic dignity only in his own downfall. I was spellbound throughout.I didn’t take this photo during the performance or in the auditorium itself. After the show Tennant and fellow actors came out into the foyer with collecting buckets for a Theatre Workers Benefit Society and, as luck would have it, we left the auditorium exactly through the door behind which David was standing, still in costume, rattling coins. Crowds of teenaged girls were mobbing him - they had obviously been to the play as part of their year’s syllabus -, creating a bottleneck, and there was a fraught moment when the situation could have become dangerous. Theatre staff cleared the mob and David took his bucket and was manhandled out of the way; but not before I had taken several photos of him. Cameras were going off all around him, adding to the unreal situation.During the performance I learned how theatres cope with an emergency in the auditorium. In the row next to us a member of the audience collapsed and a commotion ensued. The house manager calmed things down; she checked the situation in the auditorium, arranged for assistance and finally appeared on the stage, stopping the show and informing actors and audience of the incident. The person who had been taken ill was removed and once the doors had been closed the play continued, the actors returned to the stage,  instantly taking up their previous positions and continuing with the scene almost exactly where they had left off. Not in mid-sentence, obviously, but, seamlessly, at the beginning of their line.For anyone not able to see the RSC in the flesh, it might be of interest to know that they have, like the National Theatre, started to take their productions to a cinema near you."},
{"title": "Sod’s Law", "date": "Tuesday 5 November 2013", "text": "Nine months ago we accepted an estimate for a complete overhaul of the windows on the South side of the house, all eight of them. Ditto the back door, which has been quietly rotting away at the bottom. “Please don’t come during the week before ‘Open Garden’,” I said, \"but any other time will be fine.”  ‘Open Garden’ was in June.“Well, it depends on the weather and the order book,” said Kevin the builder, a very nice chap. He’s a local contractor,  all of his sub-contractors are pleasant chaps; we’ve used them all for one job or another and liked them all. Once you’ve found a good set of traders and workmen you bend over backwards not to lose them.Three months ago, when Beloved had a small operation to remove a BCC,  the surgeon said :”What’s that on your arm, that doesn’t look good to me. Better make an appointment for a biopsy.” For weeks both Beloved and his GP have been pestering the Dermatology Department at Shrewsbury Hospital for an appointment.“We are very busy but we'll arrange for a check-up as soon as possible.”In due course a letter arrived from the hospital with a date: “5th November.Yesterday we had a phone call from Kevin the builder: “Okay if we come tomorrow, 5th November?”Purely a rhetorical question, by the way.Beloved is no longer able to drive, he can’t see well enough. The LicensingAuthority are particularly unwillingto issue licences for half-blind people.I can see why, there is a certain kind of logic to that.What to do? To go or to stay?Hospital or builder?“I know, I’ll ask the Community Car People for help.” I’m nothing if not quick on my thinking feet.“Mary (the person who runs the scheme) is away in Shrewsbury,” Keith, her husband said. \"I’ll give her the message, when I pick her up. It should be no later than 3 o’clock.”By six o’clock, when neither Keith nor Mary had got in touch, I became a bit restive. I had to make a decision one way or the other. Keith sounded awfully fuzzy when I rang back. “Mary isn’t back yet, they’ve kept her in.” Kept her in? Kept her in where? It emerged that Mary was in hospital and had made no arrangements for anyone else to take over from her. I gave up on Keith and started ringing round for the names of the volunteers who man the car service. It then emerged that Keith is no longer the man he was, a bit ‘out of it’ as you might say, but that Mary was keeping it quiet. “She doesn’t like it generally known.” Poor Mary.A former volunteer was able to give me two names of people who might be willing to take Beloved to hospital in the morning. I rang them both. The first number died after four rings and the second number was answered by a machine. “Sorry, we’re out at the moment.”By now it was eight o’clock and I still had no idea what to do in the morning. Because of the many calls I had made, my plight had become known. Betty said Nigel might do it.  I rang Nigel. Another machine. An hour later I rang Nigel again, just to make sure I had called the right number. Still the machine. Don’t people stay at home anymore on dark and wet November nights?Beloved and I decided that we would wait for the builders to arrive, and give them free access to the house and windows, while I took him to his appointment. We’d hurry back and would be gone for no more than between three and four hours.At ten o’clock Nigel’s wife Joan rang. “Nigel won’t mind driving Beloved in the morning. He’s out all evening but tell me what time you want him and I’ll see that he gets to you.”I like a determined woman, who knows her husband’s mind, don’t you?The builders will be with us for a few days yet. I’ll be on hand to provide the tea."},
{"title": "The Wedding Feast", "date": "Sunday 3 November 2013", "text": "Resurrection Reunion 2, 1945, Sir Stanley SpencerThe Mag 192Provided by Tess Kincaid.Many years ago, I received an invitation to a very grand wedding; a beautiful young princess, with skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony, was marrying the King’s son and all the people of the land were to come and join in the celebrations. You can imagine how delighted we were to attend the festivities and see the happy pair be joined in holy matrimony. After the ceremony, tables were carried in laden with all manner of glorious food; there were capons, geese, larks, chickens, beef, bacon, lamb, salmon, herring, eels and other fresh water fish; the dairy had contributed cheeses and butter and great mounds of eggs.  There were huge bowls of sweet and spicy mead, there was ale, cider and perry, while the courtiers themselves drank wine. In short it was a feast to make the heart sing.When all had eaten and drunk their fill, a band of musicians entered the hall and a space was cleared for dancing.  Prince and Princess led the courtly dances with a Quadrille, but jigs and country dances soon took over and we ordinary folk joined the fray, kicking and hopping until our faces turned red and the sweat poured off the peasant’s brow.It was then I saw her: a beautiful woman, no longer young but well preserved, dressed in courtly finery and glittering jewels, dancing in the centre of the throng. I had had to take a breather, my heart was pounding fit to burst and while I looked round to find a way out and maybe a stool to perch on for a minute, my eye was drawn to her. She danced wilder and faster than anyone else around; other dancers had opened up a circle around her and as they backed away, I saw horror on their faces. Curious, I edged nearer, the better to see her: her feet fairly flew across the ground. Her shoes! Oh, Lord have Mercy, her shoes! they were of iron, red-hot iron and no matter how hard she tried to shake them off, they were stuck to her feet.And now I recognised her.I had, of course, heard of her and her envious, malicious and murderous deeds. Not content with banishing Snow-white she had then thrice tried to kill her; first trying to lace her to death, then by combing her hair with a poisoned comb and lastly by making her choke on a poisoned apple. Three times her plan failed and Snow-white was resurrected, twice by the dwarves with whom she had found a home and lastly by the Prince, who fell in love with her instantly, the moment he saw her lying in her glass coffin.The wicked stepmother’s machinations had finally failed and now she was paying the price. Condemned to dance herself to death there was to be no miraculous resurrection for her."},

We cry for our lost childhood and youth, we cry for what was, what might have been and now never will be. Those moments of nostalgia come unbidden, but luckily, if we are sensible, they also go again and we make use of what we have now.I yearn for ‘home’, wherever and whatever that may be, yet I know full well, that ‘home’ has vanished long ago and that even the people who made ‘home’ are no longer.http://eyeontheedge.blogspot.co.uk/It's the longing to be elsewhere that in Germany we call Fernweh, which is in my case also heimweh, the longing to be home - the terrible pull of opposites that torments the displaced everywhere.All that remains is the familiar slight ache in the bones, like an old wound when the weather changes, Heimweh or Fernweh?

The busy time is done and I could get stuck in again. The problem is, where do I start? What is conceivably of interest to anyone but us?“Well, you could start with food,” he said.Trust him. He is thin to the point of emaciation in spite of a good appetite.So, let’s start with food.First, a supper party. A good friend had returned from five weeks’ exploration of the environmental impact of hydro-electric plants on the Tapajos river in Brazil and it was time to catch up. I thought it might be nice to invite another good friend whom I owed several meals. (not that we keep track - well,  ok then, I do, just a bit) It was all a bit last minute, but unplanned parties are usually the best. At 11 pm two nights before the supper party Andrew rang.“Thank you for the invitation. I’d really love to come, but I have two guests staying.”“What a pity, another time.”“Well, we could all come. Think about it. It would be brilliant, just for the conversation. I’d bring the food for me and my guests, who are lovely people. You’ll love them.\"I was rather taken aback. Andrew seemed merry and very enthusiastic; in the background I could hear sounds of conviviality.“Think about it”, he repeated, “you won’t have to do a thing. I’ll bring lots of food and wine.”I was beginning to feel flattered. Andrew has been something of a grand personage in the past and isn’t exactly a nobody now. That he should be so keen to come to a humble supper chez Friko . . . . . .I do a lot for a bit of flattery.I made up my mind. I’d rearrange the position of the table, and add an extra leaf, to seat more than six. I’d buy the peripheral courses and do a simple main course. It could be done without great effort.The next morning my in-tray pinged.“Abject apologies. I should never have imposed on you. I phoned you on the spur of the moment after a very bibulous meal. (Who’d have guessed?) Of course we won’t crash your party; could you and J. come to me  for drinks before dinner on Sunday, instead?”I persuaded Andrew that it was all settled, that I’d consulted the other two supper guests, that the food was taken care of and that he should present himself and his guests at seven the next night. Which he did, laden with three bottles of wine, a large cool box and his house guests, two delightful South Africans. Many hours later they went home with the cool box incl. contents, but minus the wine, which had joined further bottles provided by Beloved and the original guests.It was a great evening and now Andrew owes me big-time.o-o-o-o-oAutumn is nowhere near our birthdays but Jay, another friend, decided that she wanted to take us out for a very belated birthday lunch. Pub meals are carb-heavy, just the kind of meal suited for a wet, cool Sunday in late autumn.This is a plate of roast beef, with roast potatoesand vegetables, as well as a giant Yorkshire pudding. Millie had lots of leavings in a doggy bag.The Lion in Leintwardine is a very attractive pub with rooms, a restaurant and bars, and sits smack on the banks of the river Teme.

{"title": "The Day of the Little Bear", "date": "Monday 21 October 2013", "text": "The Martyrdom of St UrsulaGerman art - 16th centuryIt’s been my name day today. In mainly catholic countries in Europe as well as Latin America, somebody’s name day is at least as important as their birthday, sometimes more so. In olden days a child was christened the day after birth and given the name of the saint who had died or been martyred on that day. For instance, Martin Luther was born on the 10th November and christened on the 11th, the feast day of Martin of Tours.Birthday celebrations have taken over in secular life and when I mention name days I always get “what’s that?” in return. But for my aunt Katie and her friends, who lived in a small rural community on the Lower Rhine, name days were the highlight of their personal year. Each one of them baked cakes and pastries in advance of their  own great day and invited the others and anyone whom they valued, brothers and sisters and cousins, to ‘Namenstag Kaffee und Kuchen’ and a little something home brewed to round off the festivities. They made fruit liqueurs in those days, potent enough to redden checks and loosen tongues; wine and ready bottled alcohol was beyond their means. Everybody brought flowers, often pot plants, and a small present. The more friends and family you had, with whom you were on good terms, the more often you were part of this harmless indulgence. My father disapproved and when he made his usual dog-in-the-mangerish remarks, my mum said “nothing to do with you; let them have their fun”; living in town she wasn’t part of aunt Katie's jolly circles. I am sure she often regretted it.I got my Christian name quite by accident. Mum and Dad had lost their first child and may therefore not have wanted to be too certain that the second child, i.e. me, would live; anyway, they didn't discuss names. When the nurse came to enquire, they looked at each other and said “we don’t have a name for her.” (Good start, wouldn’t you say?) Babies were kept away from mothers in communal nurseries until they were handed over to be fed.  The next time the nurse distributed her squalling and hungry charges, she said to my mother: “and for you I have a little Ursula”. “So be it”, my parents said, “one name’s as good as any other.” That’s how I became “the little bear”.The legend of Ursula is based on a 4th- or 5th-century inscription from the Church of St. Ursula (on the Ursulaplatz) in Cologne. It states that the ancient basilica had been restored on the site where some holy virgins were killed. St Ursula is no longer wholeheartedly endorsed as a Christian martyr, too many different versions of her story exist and there is little evidence that any of them are true. Ursula and 11.000 virgins were supposedly killed by the Huns when they overran Cologne. The figure of 11.000 is probably a misreading of the Latin text, and the 11.000 virgins were more likely 11 ladies of Ursula’s royal train.Be that as it may, I quite like the idea of being named after a Romano-British royal personage, who did good deeds and led a short but exemplary life. Granted, her ending wasn’t much fun, I’d have probably married the Hun prince rather than opted for martyrdom - where there’s life there’s hope of getting out of a sticky situation - but she wouldn’t have become famous if she had.I didn’t celebrate my name day but I had a lovely present anyway: the absolutely delightful Frances of City Views Country Dreams came all the way from New York to Ludlow, in the pouring rain, to spend a glorious afternoon with me, no sacrifice required.PS: that’s Ludlow in the UK, so from New York, NY to Ludlow, UK, is quite a distance."},

{"title": "(Not) Coming Clean and Making Jelly", "date": "Monday 14 October 2013", "text": "Having two gardeners is not necessarily a good thing. Although No. 2, Paul, knows that he is employed to take the weight off No.1 Gardener’s shoulders, No.1 has no official idea. He came last week for his usual day and noticed that various jobs had been done. When he said, all innocently: \"somebody has cleared the overhang on the path to the lane and filled a compost bin”, I agreed with a throwaway remark, implying that I had done it myself. “Yes, we had some good days for work last week.”“Yeeeees,” he said. Feeling uncomfortable I asked No. 1 to tackle the same path and dig out grass and weeds from between the stones.  He made an excellent job of it. “Right,” he said, “ now it looks like somebody lives here.”Apart from a permanent guilt feeling, having two gardeners, albeit temporarily, also means that I have to work twice as hard myself. Not for me the detached supervisory role; it’s “would you please . . . . “ and “if you don’t mind, could you help me with . . . . . .” round here. I come from a family who did for themselves, so when either gardener works, so do I. The same hours, although maybe not quite as hard, leaving me exhausted twice as often.  I have a small garden, no more than 1/3 of an acre, there won’t be enough work for three of us soon. However, in winter most outdoor work stops and No. 1 won’t want to come anyway.I’ve picked the Japanese quinces for jelly-making; they’re totally inedible raw but a lot of work, time and trouble turns them into a delectable golden jelly to accompany winter roast meats. I am sure you could buy quince jelly, but where’s the fun in that?Markham, in the English Husbandman of 1635 says:Now for quinces, they are a fruit which by no means you may place near any other kind of fruit, because their scent is so strong and piercing, that it will enter into any fruit and clean take away his natural relish. The time of their gathering is ever in October; and the meetest place to lie them in is where they may have most air and lie dry (for wet they can by no means endure); also they must not lie close, because the smell of them is both strong and unwholesome.”Strong? yes. Unwholesome? No."},
{"title": "Flu Jabs and The Golden Years", "date": "Saturday 12 October 2013", "text": "Shropshire Star - Flu CampaignThe Surgery waiting room looks different; normally,  people sit on upright benches around three sides, with two carvers along the third wall, easy to get out of for the arthritic amongst us.  Today, the toy table and baby chairs have been moved from the centre of the room and extra chairs, carvers and dining chairs, have been lined up in two rows instead. It looks like a makeshift cinema or lecture room, or maybe a charabanc outing.When we arrive at just before two pm, the room is almost empty. The receptionist giggles at us :”read the leaflet and roll up your sleeves.” It’s flu jab day and we have come for our annual vaccination against the debilitating winter bug. It’s free for oldies and the chronically sick. We qualify on both counts. I’ve brought my IPhone to read Mark Haddon’s ‘The Red House ‘while we wait for one of the nurses; it’s a brilliantly claustrophobic novel. Haddon’s forte is drawing children and young adults, his adult characters are slightly bloodless; all suffer existential angst in their own way.I don’t get very far, the room fills and the chairs are taken. Everybody knows everybody else. Greetings are called, chairs moved, news exchanged. Nobody is sick, all are here for ’the jab’. Somebody complains that they haven’t seen me for ages. “We often see J. but we never see you; how are you?” The atmosphere becomes that of a social club. Nurses come and call people by first names, two by two, into the treatment rooms.  There is banter and laughter.“Do you realise that they’ve booked the Ramblers’ Christmas lunch for the same day as the Senior Citizens’ lunch?” The voice is excited and concerned that they might miss a social occasion. It’s hard to believe that everybody here is over 60 and therefore officially ‘old’. Luckily, like so much in life, ‘old’ is relative. Some weeks the Ramblers walk for ten miles over difficult terrain, in all weathers. Boomers, bolstered by pensions, holding on to savings and brandishing freedom passes, cluttering up surgeries for free treatments, in possession of ample free time and adequate health and fitness, all of them owning their house, this is a generation which has it all. No wonder the hard-pressed young cry ‘robbers and thieves’.Old age pensioners are a new demographic, a group which is getting steadily larger. We swallow up scarce resources, creating problems for national expenditure. The average life expectancy is around 80 in places such as Valleys’ End; I know plenty of 90 year olds too. Scrolling back 2000 years, life expectancy was 25, in Roman times you might get to 40 and the medieval peasant who survived into adulthood didn’t get much farther than that. Now ’50 is the new 40’ and as 60 years olds we do not consider ourselves old, if we think about it at all.We’ve all been told to sit and wait five minutes after the jab, to make sure we’re okay to walk home. Hardly anybody does. We are perfectly capable to decide such matters for ourselves. Self-assured? Bone-headed? Full of vim and vigour and joie de vivre? Of course we are."},

{"title": "Adventures During The Age Of Aquarius", "date": "Friday 4 October 2013", "text": "Part VIFor the story so far click HERE “They’re all thieves”, Johnny said, “ anyone of them would nip behind the bar and steal what they could get their hands on. Never leave the till unlocked and always make sure all spirits are safely returned to the top shelf. I wouldn’t put it past them to fill their glass for free.” Johnny had a very low opinion of his customers.Shortly before eleven - last orders time in those days - he counted the takings and, depending on his mood, the number of customers still drinking and the day of the week, he either locked the doors and continued serving after hours or he would ring the bell and shoo everybody out. If he decided to stay open he advised me to stay too; by this time the customers were becoming more and more generous tippers and to give him his due, Johnny made sure I got all the tips left for me. People still used cash to pay and the later it was the less they counted their change.Although it must have been totally obvious to the local police what went on behind closed doors in bars and drinking clubs in the seedy areas off Hampstead Lane, they never turned up while I was there. After hours the windows were shut and curtains drawn but the noise became louder. By now the air was thick with cigarette smoke, male dancers took off their jackets, and women, their faces flushed and perspiring, ola’d and opa'd and clapped their hands in time with the shrill sounds of Cypriot music. Tsifteteli is a free form dance which includes both male and female dancers, whereas women danced the Arabiye,  heads thrown back, shoulders and chests shaking and bellies and hips swinging. It’s a very voluptuous dance, a sexy woman could get a whole room of men staring, whistling and clapping. But the best Arabiye I saw was danced by a man, a very tall North African, pale-skinned and quiet. I never saw him with any kind of companion, male or female, although he was friendly enough towards everybody. They called him  \"The Arab”. He drank only water; in spite of that Johnny always allowed him entry and treated him with respect.  I was curious about him, tried to involve him in conversation, but he politely but firmly put me in my place.There were other mysterious men who occasionally came up the stairs to the bar. Three brothers, two older ones and one younger, very tall, well, but soberly dressed in dark suits and crisp white shirts, not at all like the usual customers who were, at best, casually attired, appeared twice a month. They were English, spoke exclusively to Johnny, hung about for a bit, rarely accepted a drink but, if they did, it was on the house. The younger brother tried to flirt with me;  he was telling me how he had had his heart broken and was afraid to become involved with another woman; but, somehow, he felt that I was different, he trusted me and knew that a girl like me wouldn’t let him down. Like his brothers, I found him vaguely threatening and was in no way inclined to take him up on his offer.His brothers were aware of what he was doing; they called him back, much like you call a dog to heel, and my would-be suitor obeyed quickly, winking at me and mouthing ’sorry'. Negotiations with Johnny over, they left. Johnny, who was often rude to, and dismissive of, most of his customers, treated both “The Arab” and the three English brothers with respect. In fact, while they were around, particularly the three Englishmen, the bar quietened down considerably. Johnny never said what their business with him was, but, in hindsight, I’d go for protection racket as the most likely explanation.Three months into my employment I had settled into the routine quite well. I felt relatively safe. Johnny never seriously bothered me and he made sure no drunken customer pestered me more than I could cope with. The reason I left was nothing to do with me personally; one night, on the way out, I witnessed a nasty and brutish attack by a man on a woman which made me feel sick to my stomach and caused me to run down the stairs and out the door as fast as my heels would allow. I didn’t even stop to pick up my coat.to be continued. . . . ."},
{"title": "Epic Journeys ", "date": "Tuesday 1 October 2013", "text": "The time has come for swallows, martins and swifts to leave the UK and embark on their epic migration to South Africa, so make the most of the last few in the skies. A final preen . . .Swallows indicate the end of the summer when they depart for warmer climes and that is where our swallows are currently headed.  They undertake an impressive 6000 mile migration between the UK and South Africa twice a year in search of food. They nest in the UK in the summer, but as they only feed on aerial insects (the majority of which are large flies, such as horseflies and bluebottles), their food source starts to run out in the autumn.Faced with the prospect of little or no food, they start to head south during September and October. It’s no walk in the park for these tiny birds as their extreme migration takes them south through Europe and across the Sahara desert.They cover approximately 200 miles a day, generally at about 20mph – the maximum flight speed recorded was a whopping 35mph. During their epic journey, swallows easily fall prey to starvation, exhaustion and extreme weather conditions, not to mention being trapped and killed in Southern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa in their hundreds of thousands during the migratory period.  (The July issue of National Geographic covers the slaughter of birds in detail - don’t go there if you are at all squeamish) . . .  are we ready . . . . . . let’s go.See you on the other side of the world.The disappearance of swallows and other migrants in the autumn was for long a great mystery. Some firmly believed that they hibernated at the bottom of lakes or ponds, and others that they hid and remained torpid until spring.“In the Northern waters, fishermen often draw up in their nets an abundance of swallows, hanging together like a conglomerated mass. In the beginning of Autumn, they assemble themselves together in the reeds by ponds, where, allowing themselves to sink into the water, they join bill to bill, wing to wing and foot to foot.”Olaus Magnus, History of the Northern Nations, 1550But in 1776, in the Naturalist’s Journal, Gilbert White asked:“But if hirundines (swallows) hide in rocks and caverns, how do they, while torpid, avoid being eaten by weasels and other vermin?\"Karl Jensen  Karl Jensen (1851-1933):"},

When I asked him if he liked it still, he said “Of course I do. Who wouldn’t.”Can you see why he said that? I found a small clump of cyclamen in a hedge.

Borrowing the scenery comes free.He looked over the wall into the square and saw the town hall clock showing the wrong time, as it usually does. Valley’s End follows its own time schedule. “We do things our way and we’ll have nobody from off interfering in our business, thank you very much”, is the friendly advice newcomers receive from the ur-inhabitants.That doesn’t mean that said ur-inhabitants actually do very much. They are happy to leave town council and parish business to more recent incomers and if it weren’t for the latter, the town would have collapsed into a picturesque ruin long ago.But back to gardener and the town hall.“Do they do anything there now?”, he asked.“They certainly do, it’s an interesting little museum exhibiting local history artefacts,” I said. In common with many other incomers, in previous years, both Beloved and I did stints as guides and brochure sellers on several days during the summer in the slightly dusty two-room museum.  In years gone by the town hall also served as the lock-up, but that really was a long time ago.“Forty year ago, when I were a lad, they had dances there on a Saturday.  And all the lads from over Knighton way (in Wales) and the Castle (Bishop’s Castle - the next little town up the road) come over, looking for a fight. And when the Irish lads from Telford come, there was real trouble.” Gardener giggled his infectious, gleeful giggle, remembering the good old days. Then, just for a moment, he was serious.“There were gangs in them days, all the lads from the same town and the villages along the valley belonged to their gang;  and if you didn’t fight in your gang, you’d be called a coward. It wasn’t nice to be a coward; on the farms and in the towns they’d know you for it.” Gardener looked at me sideways, a crafty expression in his eyes. His small, wiry person all of a sudden seemed to be ducking and diving.“So I’d usually stay at the back, a look-out like, and when the lads at the front had done fighting, and the police was on their way, I’d scarper like. Nobody could call me a coward for that. I’d kept their backs.”He giggled again, quite proud of himself.Then he sat down on the low wall around the half moon flower border, clearing his throat before taking another drag on his cigarette.“Haven’t you forgotten to tell me something?” He exhaled through his nose and peered at me.“Have I?” I was fidgeting a bit. A bad conscience makes cowards of us all.“Where’s the ivy gone?”“Ivy? What ivy?”“On the stump.”“Ah, that ivy.”“So you got somebody for that, did you?”I’d been pointing out to him for a year or more thatthe ivy on the stump was swallowing and killing my‘Wedding Day’, a beautiful climbing rose andthat I wanted it freed and the ivy trimmed back.Lately, gardener has shown himself unwilling to domuch climbing himself. So I took a deep breath andwent behind his back to Paul, whom I had been considering as a possible replacement for Gardener.As you can see, Paul did the job.Gardener grudgingly admitted that whoever had done it, had made a good job of it. What he doesn’t know is that Paul has since done various other jobs for me and that he might become a regular over time.Which means that I’ve gone from half a gardener to two gardeners in the space of a month. Because of Gardener’s long illness and absence a lot of work has been left undone and, for the time being, I’m going to let both of them come, on separate days of the week, to catch up. Paul is tinkering around the edges while Gardener is doing jobs he had earmarked for a long time.I’m hoping that I’ll get away with it until the weather stops work anyway. If not, I’m in trouble.Perhaps I could call Paul ‘gardener’s backup’?"},

Before you know it black clouds roll in and overwhelm you.Up until a few days ago I felt quite happy. It seemed that several longstanding problems melted away with the judicious application of tact and a small handful of folding money.  I had found a man with a van to collect and dispose of heaps of garden debris; I tried out a new helper in the garden and Gardener seemed to be pleased that the hardest tasks had been done in his absence. There was a spell of warm sunny weather to aid the passing of summer. My son and his wife came and mended a wardrobe whose door had not shut for a twelve month. An electrician fixed lamps and light switches and promised to return and repair the outdoor lights on the drive. My daughter-in-law asked me for family recipes, writing them down there and then. “These shouldn’t be lost”, she said. I had never known that she considered my cooking memorable, so I was highly flattered. I was quite overcome and gave her my mum’s dough kneading machine, which I had never used.It felt good, things were falling into place; I don’t find happiness easy, bubbly is not the word I’d use to describe me; for me quiet optimism and contentment are very desirable mental attributes.But now the rains have come and a dark cloud has settled on my mind too. For several days the AGA has refused to stay alight, which means the kitchen is cold and I cannot cook anything at all. We live off microwaveable ready meals and pub lunches. I have yet to find a ready meal we actually enjoy and the allure of pub food palls when you depend on it. Two supper guests programmed for tonight had to be uninvited. The repairman called twice: \"short of a miracle the burner unit in the AGA has had it, it’s old age,” he said,” there’s nothing I can do.”  A new one will be £700 incl. of labour.  Ah well, if all the ailments that come with old age could be fixed with pennies and pounds we’d all save up and dance a merry dance instead of rubbing our creaking joints with arnica massage oils, hoping for relief from nasty arthritic twinges.You may say why does this depress her so. After all, it can, and will be, fixed. Well chaps, there is something else, something that cannot be fixed. I found out this week that somebody whom I have known for over forty years, somebody very dear to me, actually deeply dislikes and resents me. True, we have seen little of each other for several years, and the relationship has cooled. But to learn that she has been keeping a careful tally of grievances and grudges, not only against me but a number of other people, with me as the main culprit, was a body blow, wholly unexpected, leaving me gasping for air.The dark clouds have opened and shed their load; it’s raining outside and inside too."},

He wished the boy would come to a decision, spending too much time on one traveller might cost him more time than the company allowed; still, the boy’s earnest and single-minded study moved him, he stood and waited, arms folded behind his back, his black face in the shadow above the window, nothing visible to the observer but the smile. Life had trained him well.\"I’ll have.....”. The boy had made up his mind. He would have ham and eggs, tea and toast and some marmalade. His voice was steady as he ordered, his eyes barely rising from the menu as he read.“Yes sir, young master,” the waiter said.PS: US readers, please forgive me for my culinary ignorance.

So, they got the scalper out, did they? Yeah, it’s bleeding alright. They ought to have cauterized it\".\"They did. Nasty smell, burning me.”“I don’t hold with doctors much.” That’s rich, coming from a man who had a heart attack a couple of years ago, was taken to hospital by air ambulance and was given a stent within hours of arriving there.“You see some bloody doctor and he don’t know what he’s talking about. That’s all I see nowadays; all them locums, waiting, waiting. It’s a bloody pain, going there.”We suggest that he changes surgeries, goes to one a bit nearer home.“The missis keeps saying her might be putting the house on the market; I don’t know if it’s worth it. They’re gonna build new houses round us, two-three bedroom houses all down to the road. we’ll be shut in the middle then. And who’re they building them for? Bloody layabouts from bloody Telford. And we’ll be paying the poll tax for them.” “Layabouts from Telford can’t afford to buy two-three bedroom houses?” My remark makes Gardener snort in disgust.“They won’t be buying them, they'll be renting them and we’ll be paying the rent. And the poll tax. That’s what it’ll be for. Bloody overflow from Telford.”Common sense won’t get us anywhere with Gardener. It’s decades since the poll tax was abandoned. And the new estates are for sale, not rent. Beloved goes into generalities about building houses and we change conversational tack.“What on earth have you got your left hand in the sling for?” It’s his right arm which had the operation.“Just to put it somewhere.\"\"He’ll have his foot in there next”, says Gardener.A dog is yapping in the distance.\"Ours does that.

Her’s got her bloody eye on whoever's gonna come down there and her’s out.  Her sits by my side like on the settee, and off her goes. Her wants to join them. But you cannot trust her.” You can hear the regret in  Gardener’s voice. His dog is a maniac, a tiny little mongrel with the heart of a lion and totally untrained.That’s the end of that topic. Gardener looks round for something else to comment on.“I see we got some nuts on the walnut. They won’t come to anything, you need a proper walnut for that.” I don’t know what’s improper about our walnut tree, it looks  quite respectable to me.“They come from some other country.” Beloved seems to agree with gardener about our tree being incapable of producing edible nuts.“Mind, we always had hazelnuts. Hazelnuts, they’re alright. Gardener starts a story about his childhood, I’ve been waiting for him to do that.\"Dad used to come out with us,  on a Sunday morning. He had a big hook he did, and he used to shake the bloody thing like and we’d be picking them all up. He  used to shake the tree really hard and we’d get hit on the bloody head with the nuts. It’s something dad always did with us. He always seemed to know when they was ready. Big nuts they were.Then he’d put them in the big milk tins like, from the NHS like you used to get milk powder in.

{"title": "Adventures during the Age of Aquarius", "date": "Tuesday 20 August 2013", "text": "Part VClick here for  The story so far . . . .Considering London’s Soho at the time, La Rocca had been a reasonably respectable environment; although George was definitely walking on the shady side of the law, he kept the other waitress and me in the dark about whatever it was he dealt in. I never had the slightest idea what was involved, drugs, fencing, smuggling, or maybe even politics.  Most of the regular customers were young people, students, office clerks and shop workers, and illegally employed foreigners like me, all proudly shabby and determined to rebel. New and exciting music was the common bond.The Age of Aquarius was still in its infancy, the free and easy sex came later. I was aware that some girls were different; we’d sit and have a chat over a coffee, but when a man came up to speak to them they’d disappear for a short time. They all had steady boyfriends, who turned up several times during the afternoon and evening and took the girls aside without leaving the premises. Once, a girl who was small and slight and very pale, came back to our table after such an encounter, sobbing and shaking and collapsing on her chair. She was obviously very distressed and, foolishly, I said to her that, if her boyfriend made her unhappy, 'why didn’t she just walk out on him?’ For a moment the others stared in disbelief, but nobody chose to enlighten me. It took me weeks to understand.In the meantime, finding a job which would pay my rent was my first priority. I was told that Johnny, a Cypriot who ran a combined restaurant and drinking club on two floors of an old Victorian house in Robert Street was looking for a waitress. The area north of Soho, between Warren Street and what was to become posh Highgate was seedy and run-down, with rabbit warrens of dank and insalubrious side streets off Hampstead Lane.  Robert Street was one of them. A lot of the area was subsequently flattened and high rise blocks of flats replaced the Victorian houses. It took an army of yuppies to step in and stop the destruction; thanks to their efforts whole streets were rescued from the bulldozers and turned into very desirable residences. Prices rocketed and many of the large houses were sub-divided into flats. In the late eighties and at the beginning of the nineties  Beloved and I lived in the top three floors of one of these houses in a lovely street called Montpelier Grove in Kentish Town, by then thoroughly gentrified.Johnny looked me up and down. “Have you done waitressing?”, he asked. I had, first in the fish shop for one disastrous day and then several weeks at La Rocca. Johnny was short and square, with a shiny face and restless hands and full, rather moist lips. I didn’t like him at all. Johnny’s wife was running the restaurant downstairs which I found reassuring. Surely, no man would try it on with his wife a short flight of stairs away? He said I could start in the drinking club and we’d see how I got on with the customers. He took me behind the bar and explained the shelves of drinks, the cash register and the baskets of food. The bar served meze and the waitress had to cut up and dish out appetisers on very small plates. There were strict rules as to who got what: the man who came in for a beer had a dish of peanuts and a few olives and under no circumstances was I to give him more. “ Some of them sit all evening over a beer and expect me to feed them”, Johnny said. “You’ll get to know them soon enough”. The customer buying the most expensive drinks, such as a whole bottle of whisky, had a lavish spread, from olives and celery sticks to stuffed vine leaves, freshly grilled sardines, spiced and smoked meats and chunks of Greek bread. Sometimes there were tables of four who had a bottle of wine between them. To begin with they were to be given a reasonably generous array of plates; if they made no effort to buy another bottle, their dishes were not to be replenished.During the week I was often left alone upstairs, Johnny coming up around ten o’clock to make sure nobody had got drunk and made trouble. He didn’t mind them getting drunk, it was the trouble he objected to. He had impressed on me not to leave my station behind the bar except to serve a table. It was a small room, with the tables ranged around the outside and a small area in the middle left free for dancing. Often it was the men who danced, arms spread wide and interlinked and heels kicking. At weekends a fiddler and a bouzouki player provided live entertainment.I soon got used to it. Johnny was behaving himself.  Occasionally, just before closing time, he rubbed up against me when he squeezed past to get to the cash register; I could cope with that. Once he himself was behind the bar I was free to move into the room. At times I enjoyed myself.to be continued . . . . ."},

This grisly fate promptly qualified him to become the special patron of confectioners, bakers, and cooks. Obviously. Stands to reason.I came to cooking late in life. Before I met, and threw in my lot with Beloved, cooking was something confined to tin opening, defrosting and maybe frying in a pan. There was little time to produce elaborate meals, even had I known how to. The kids were home two hours before me and my shouts of “kids, I’m home” were drowned in a great rustle of biscuit wrappers hastily being brushed under the beds as I shut the front door behind me. I always found them at weekends, when I did the cleaning, but couldn’t very well complain. They were old enough by then to make themselves a sandwich, but when do kids do the sensible thing? Most of the time I felt guilty for leaving them home alone to earn our living and couldn’t get up enough steam to make our evenings miserable by wasting time arguing with them. Yes, yes, I know; say what you like, such was life in those days. And, no, neither of them has robbed a bank or become an axe murderer. Yet.My mother taught me how to make stews by default. It wasn't that I ever paid any attention at the time or that she made a point of explaining what she was doing, but somehow, in spite of our mutual lack of interest in handing over the few secrets of her culinary expertise to the next generation, I picked up the odd pointer here and there which stuck. I suppose being in the room in which cooking is done, automatically leaves an impression on the bystander, particularly when the process is repeated time after time during childhood. Mum wasn’t a bad cook, just not an inventive or adventurous one. She knew her dozen or two recipes, the food she produced was good and tasty, and my dad loved it. Which is really all that matters.Markham (1568-1637) in The English Huswife has it, that “the cook must be cleanly in both body and garments. She must have a quick eye, a curious nose, a perfect taste, and a ready ear; and she must not be butter-fingered, sweet-toothed, nor faint-hearted. For the first will let everything fall, the second will consume what it should increase, and the last will lose time with too much niceness.Note how even then it was the male who told the female how to execute her duties. And not a word about showing her how it’s done.The title question is a Beloved special: the chips were coming to the end of their time in the oven and this was his way of gently reminding me not to forget them."},

Impudence, ignorance, inhospitality, intolerance, indigent, impetigo, indifference, all lovely words, but it needs a philosopher to give them body. I is also for having being ill again, with an attack starting while we were having a delightful picnic on the terrace at Malvern Theatre in Worcestershire. Between the two acts of the last of the three Henry VI plays (we saw all three in one week), alarm bells were rung, and a lovely paramedic came to my aid, lugging his portable ECG and heavy apparatus, and in an alcove between the door to the cinema and the staircase to the theatre he sat me down, leant over me and undid the buttons of my blouse; as he still couldn’t get all his little stickers in place, he reached round me and undid my bra. Nobody has done that to me for a very long time, I’d quite forgotten the feeling. Pity I wasn’t wearing a dress, or maybe not, because as he was completing the readings the double doors to the cinema opened. The film had ended and I sat in the foyer, partly undressed, with the strains of The Bugle Boy accompanying my disgrace. The floor manageress and an usher played human shield, and the paramedic leaned in bit more.All the while the ECG was bleeping its disorganised notes until my heart decided that that really wasn’t an acceptable rhythm and showed us how it was done. Another emergency over. The merest hint that a hateful spell in hospital is on the cards and my heart stops playing silly-buggers and behaves itself.Since then I’ve taken things easy.

{"title": "Musicians - Soloists", "date": "Monday 5 August 2013", "text": "Mud From A ScraperNo. 6 In An Occasional SeriesAn instrumental soloist is a musician who, by virtue of an over-developed technique and an excess of individuality, is unsuited to playing in orchestras. His task is a thankless one, for he is always conscious that there are fifty or more performers behind him watching for flaws in his performance. A solo violinist feels that he is being accompanied by twenty players who have studied the work he is playing in detail, and who know that they could play it better. A cello soloist is more fortunate, in that he rarely performs before more than eight of his critical colleagues.Pianists are in a happier position as they seem to be divided into two classes: a) sensitive ones, who benefit from comparison with the insensitive ones who ignore the orchestra, and b) those others who are oblivious of any hostility they may arouse.Singers are judged by different standards. It is an old saw that people are either gifted with musicianship or with a good voice; thus a singer exhibiting the slightest trace of artistic sensibility is welcomed by an orchestra however inadequate the voice may be. The majority are praised or condemned for their intonation and the quality of voice, and except in rare cases will be unfavourably compared with famous singers of the past, not only for their voice but also looks and sex appeal. Players know little or nothing about vocal technique, but refuse to relinquish their prerogative to criticise anything in earshot.The artistic merit of any soloist can be gauged by the amount of applause afforded to him or her by the orchestra. Most players tap their stands at the end of a concerto or aria as an act of thanksgiving that the piece is over - but it also signifies gratitude for the audience the soloist has attracted. If they continue to tap whilst the soloist is taking his second bow, it means that they approve of the performance. If they are still tapping when he is recalled for a third bow, they think he is really good. However, no player applauds after this, lest the soloist be encouraged to play an encore.Many orchestral musicians entered their careers under the illusion that they would one day be soloists. Despite this, there is no trace of jealousy in their indictment of concerto players, for they come to realise, after fifteen years in the profession, that though there is no kudos to be gained in their work, theirs indeed is the higher calling."},

{"title": "There’s No Need For Guns,", "date": "Sunday 28 July 2013", "text": "Shakespeare manages to kill off almost the entire cast of  Titus Andronicus without a single shot being fired.In this play we have it all: war, murder, dismemberment, rape, stabbing, back stabbing, deceit, mutilation, conspiracy, feigned madness and cannibalism and, above all, bloody revenge. Tarantino couldn’t have done worse. Whereas I wouldn’t dream of going to a film where violence is the main ingredient, Shakespeare is different. There’s the beauty of the language, of course, and then, somehow, the violence makes sense. There’s a harsh but elegant symmetry to the action, in spite of the relentless slaughter. My sons are killed, I will sacrifice your eldest to appease the gods. Your sons have violated and dismembered my daughter, yours will suffer death at her and my hands. Well, stumps in her case, because it was her hands that the rapists chopped off.Production PhotoStephen Boxer as Titus and Rose Reynolds as Lavinia“The play is set simultaneously in timeless myth, imperial Rome and Shakespeare’s own Europe. It should be read as a compendium of two thousand years of warfare and violence.”  (programme notes)“Ever since the time of ancient Greek tragedy, western culture has been haunted by the figure of the revenger. He or she stands on a whole series of borderlines between civilisation and barbarity.” (programme notes)There were moments of horror so great that I gasped with shock; in a film I would have hidden my face in my arms, yet I never once looked away during the play. Not when Alarbus was executed, or when Lavinia was raped and mutilated; when Titus allowed Aaron to cut off one of his hands in return for the  lives of his sons, only to find that they had already been murdered. Or when Lavinia helped her father  butcher Tamora’s sons. And yet there were moments of grim humour too, when an unforced laugh burst out of me and everyone else in the audience, proof that we were all wholly engrossed in and captivated by the performance.Production PhotoKaty Stephens as Tamora with members of the castSeveral times I wanted to shout out loud: when Marcus, the Tribune, comes upon his niece Lavinia after Chiron and Demetrius have finished with her and instead of comforting her or at least falling into a stunned silence, he delivers a long, dissonant, stomach-churning speech.  Or when the lifeless bodies of Alarbus, Chiron and Demetrius are hauled up to the ceiling high above the stage very slowly, hanging upside down by their feet. In the first instance I could only just manage to stop myself from advising Markus to shut up and get an ambulance and, in the latter, I wanted to urge the stagehands to get a move on and get the actors up before they died from too much blood on the brain.All four of us came out of the theatre speechless to begin with. And then, with one accord, we exhaled deeply and fell into raptures over the performance. None of us had seen the play performed before. Beloved, who is usually rather subdued in his praise, said “That’s what I call a play!\"Synopsis of Titus AndronicusBelieved to be Shakespeare’s earliest tragedy Titus Andronicus is famed for its scene of cannibalism, when a mother unwittingly eats her own children, baked into a pie.Titus, Rome’s most honoured general, returns from a brutal 10 year war  against the Goths with their queen, Tamora, her sons and her lover, Aaron the Moor, as captives. Her eldest son is sacrificed by Titus in revenge for his own sons, lost during the war. Tamora vows revenge.The brothers Saturninus  and Bassianus are in contention for the Roman emperorship.On his return, Titus is nominated emperor by his brother Marcus, one of Rome’s tribunes. Titus declines, instead nominating Saturninus. To seal the bond of friendship, the new emperor, Saturninus, offers to marry Titus’s daughter, Lavinia. But she is already secretly pledged to marry Bassianus, Saturninus’ rival for the crown of Rome. Saturninus, by now infatuated with Tamora, the queen of the Goths, makes her his empress instead.Manipulated by Aaron, Tamora's sons, Chiron and Demetrius, avenge their mother by raping and mutilating Lavinia, and killing Bassianus. Aaron falsely implicates two of Titus's sons in this murder.In his turn Titus vows revenge and sends his one surviving son Lucius to the Goths to raise an army against Saturninus. With the help of  Lavinia, he achieves his revenge against Tamora by killing her sons. Titus invites Saturninus  and his court to a banquet.  After having strangled his defiled and mutilated daughter Lavinia in an act of mercy, he serves the remains of her sons to Tamora and kills her too.Ttitus himself is killed by Saturninus and his death is avenged by the returning Lucius, who is made emperor."},
{"title": "July - A Year In The Life Of A Lady Gardener - The End", "date": "Saturday 27 July 2013", "text": "July in the garden is like a big, blowsy barmaid who has seen better days in better pubs. A barmaid who has gone to seed, just a little, and whose corsets cannot quite contain her bulk. Plants, if left unchecked, overflow their boundaries, they spread and lean on their neighbours like drunken louts who fall about, making a thorough nuisance of themselves on hot summer nights.July is probably my least favourite month in the garden; the fresh green promise of spring has given way to brassy fact; some plants have given up altogether and just sit there, sullen and miserable like bored teenagers, and the mellow tones of autumn are still in the future. It’s the time of year when my fingers begin to itch for the secateurs. Shrubs which have finished flowering need pruning into submission on the one hand and stimulating into sufficient growth before the onset of cold days to help them produce abundant flowers next spring.Roses need pruning, but not so severely that those who produce a second flush have their job made impossible. Treated judiciously, the ones in this rose border will flower until the first frosts. I’ve cut the last ones at Christmas several years. In the meantime, they produce long, wavy, viciously thorny tendrils which can rip your skin to pieces. A perfect sleeping beauty thicket.And then there are the hedges. Because nesting birds mustn’t be disturbed it’s a good idea to wait until mid to late July to attack them; only by now you need industrial strength hedge trimmers for the job. Gardener is doing ours in stages. Before his heart attack he tamed the great beast in two days, single-handedly. What’s more, he used to burn the trimmings in one enormous bonfire, which always terrified me. I used to fuss and flutter around the fire, rake and hosepipe at the ready, pouncing on every stray spark. The fields around the castle have been bone dry for weeks and this year I’ve insisted that we stuff the hedge down the deep caverns under the cattle grids instead. My excuse is that I’m also saving hedgehogs from a watery, muddy grave when they fall through the metal bars.Hostas are being pushed out of the way by this part of the hedge.Behind the little window is Beloved’s desk. Fortunately, there is another window a little less smothered.One of Millie’s favourite garden gates is being swallowed up by a rampant rose on one side and a prostrate clematis opposite.Even a utilitarian path by the side of the house has plants encroaching enough to make access to the back door a bit of an obstacle race.No, I don’t like gardening much in July. The best thing for now is to forget about hard work and sit back and enjoy the view. And just think how full my compost bins will be when I finally have a free hand to start chopping everything down ruthlessly.There is a kind of insanity in my way of gardening: I do everything to produce the most luxuriant, abundant growth, I feed and nurture, chop and stake and prune, I weed and mulch with heavenly compost worth its weight in gold; then, when I have achieved what I set out to do, I can’t wait to rip it all out and start all over again.The twelve months of A Year In The Life Of A Lady Gardener are over. THE END"},

{"title": "Golden Potatoes", "date": "Monday 15 July 2013", "text": "photo Agustin BerocalTess Kincaid’s Magpie 177In the days when people undertook long journeys overland on foot a goldsmith and a tailor were travelling together.  One evening they had reached the edge of a wood when they heard music and laughter. They decided that such jolly sounds meant jolly company, so they entered the wood and soon came upon a group of little people, dancing and singing in a clearing, by the light of the harvests moon.The two travellers stood full of astonishment, watching the dance. The tallest of the little people, an old man, who whirled and stomped the hardest, beckoned them to join in. The goldsmith, brave as only a hunchback can be, jumped at the chance whereas the tailor held back at first, but when he saw how merrily all was going he plucked up the courage to step into the circle.The travellers sang and danced and leaped about, all fear having vanished. Then the old man drew a large knife from his belt, whetted it and jumped upon them. Instantly terrified the pair crouched and cringed but from within the circle of little people there was no escape. The old man seized the goldsmith and with the greatest speed shaved the hair off his head and then did the same to the tailor. The little people laughed and slapped the travellers on the back, as if to say how brave they had been and what good sports. The old man laughed the hardest and then pointed to a heap of potatoes to one side and urged the travellers to stuff their pockets with them.Not knowing what to make of it the travellers did and then continued on their journey. They found a poor inn where they spent the night on straw pallets, covering themselves with their coats. Waking up hungry in the morning a baked potato seemed a good idea. They went to the fireplace and were just about to put a potato each into the ashes when they noticed a golden glow: the potatoes had turned to nuggets of pure gold!  They had become rich beyond their wildest dreams. Happily, too, the hair on their heads was there again, thick as ever.The tailor wept tears of joy but the goldsmith, being a greedy man, instantly wanted more. He belaboured the tailor to go back with him when night fell and bring back still greater treasure from the old man with the knife. The tailor refused. He stayed at the inn and promised to wait for the goldsmith to return from the wood.In the evening the goldsmith hung a couple of bags over his shoulders so that he could stow away a great deal and took to the road they had travelled the day before. He found the little folks at their singing and dancing, and the old man again shaved him clean and signed to him to take some potatoes away with him. He was not slow about stuffing as much into his bags as would go, came back to the inn quite delighted and covered himself with his coat. He fell asleep with the sweet anticipation of waking an enormously rich man.O the folly of greed! The potatoes in his bags remained potatoes and what’s more, the previous night’s gold had turned back into nothing more than wholesome, earthy tubers. The goldsmith wept bitter tears, and his wailing became even louder when he rubbed his head and found himself as bald as a coot. The good tailor felt sorry for him. He comforted the goldsmith who was as contrite as any poor sinner facing up to the error of his ways and promised to share his own wealth with him. He kept his word and the two of them continued on their journey, steering well clear of singing and dancing and all such temptation they might later come to regret.(With a nod and a wink in the direction of the Brothers Grimm, two old men who might well have told a morality tale along similar lines)"},
{"title": "Calories Off Somebody Else’s Plate Don’t Count", "date": "Monday 8 July 2013", "text": "It was too hot to cook,  so lunch at the pub it was.Four late middle-aged ladies sat at the next table, all retired teachers to judge by their very lively conversation. Three of them were eating the speciality of the house, fish and chips, with a side order of mushy peas and a large dish of tartare mayonnaise; the fourth woman had a salad. As she was also the plumpest I wasn’t surprised when she explained that she was on the 5:2 diet. I’d only recently been told by somebody else that this is a relatively painless way of shedding a few pounds, so I was interested in what she had to say.  I looked over and saw her take a chip (French fries) off her friend’s plate.“Go on, have another,” her friend said. “O no, I won’t, just the one will do”, the dieter said.“It’s really quite easy to stick to this regime”, she continued, “I eat what I want for 5 days of the week and on two days I reduce my calorie intake to 500. I’m allowed 200 calories for my lunch today and tonight I’ll just have some chicken. I had a boiled egg and fruit for breakfast, so all in all, I shouldn’t be over my limit.\"The four of them continued to eat and talk and I turned my attention back to my own food, also fish and chips. The portions were very generous, too much for me, and I started to wrap up my leftovers to take home for Millie. She loves a bit of fish and chips.The ladies too had eaten what they needed and pushed their plates away, leaving some chips. The salad lady reached over and took another chip. “Nothing nicer than a well-cooked chip, is there,” she said, chewing. “Here you are,” her friend said, “ take them before they get too cold to eat.” One of the others pushed the half full dish of tartare mayonnaise over. “A bit of mayo to go with the chips?” All four giggled.“O all right, then,” the dieter said, dipping chips into mayonnaise and popping them into her mouth. “Delicious !” she said, “they really do chips well here.\""},

With one half of Europe (the populations of the countries involved) disgusted and the other half (the governments of said countries) declaring themselves innocent of all knowledge of nefarious deeds by the NSA/CSS,  I fell to wondering how the secret services tell friend from foe.I actually googled ‘security services’ and came up with reams of sites and pages and pages of newspaper articles on the recent scandals. Will this curiosity now put me on the list of suspect individuals? I’m probably there already because I carelessly said in a comment that, as far as I’m concerned, whistleblowers like Edward Snowden deserve a prize for bravery.  It beggars belief that vast resources are used to amass, sift, evaluate and store all the rubbish that floats about the world wide web. Every email, tweet, FB update, blogpost, etc. of millions of people is studied electronically.It’s impossible to put the genie of the internet back in the bottle; whatever would we do without it. Personally, I find the internet a good thing, it is enriching my life quite miraculously. But, having made these remarks electronically, I have the uncomfortable feeling that somebody somewhere might now consider me a threat to national security.However, be that as it may, my real googling activities are nothing to do with spooks and how they are out to get me, but a lot with cooking, literature, gardening, etymology, birds, plant names and what’s in the news locally.Here’s a small selection from last week:Imperial Rome in the 1st Century AD  Reading a history of the emperors of the period, as well as going to see Shakespeare’s gory play ‘Titus Andronicus’ who is absolutely nothing to do with the historical emperor Titus.Wasabi ChocolateI bought a bar, to see ‘what it tastes  like’ . It’s disgusting stuff, I’m going to throw it away.AM Homes - Who she?Another book, a novel, “May We Be Forgiven”, for which Homes won the Women’s Fiction Prize.It’s good but not that good. Too many detours, red herrings, unnecessary paddings.But worth reading anyway, at times moving and funny and an absolute action packed tour de force.What are Chinese Lanterns?There’s been a horrific industrial fire in a recycling warehouse; fire investigators blame a single Chinese lantern seen floating above stacks of packed recycling material on CCTV images. We only knew the horticultural variety of Chinese lanterns which look very pretty but have never been known to cause more than a rash.Nouns Of AssemblyA breakfast ramble. We were arguing about collective nouns, in particular jackdaws and rooks.  We have hundreds of these noisy, greedy, gregarious birds, at this time of year they bring along their entire families; all my clapping, shouting and beating a pillow with a stick to mimic a shot doesn’t frighten them into leaving.Jackdaws collectively are known as a train or a clattering, whereas rooks collectively are a building or parliament. I like the phrase  'a murder of crows’ , another member of the genus Corvus.Etymology of ‘barbecue’The reason for wanting to know this is easy, we’ve just been to one. There are lots of explanations but the most likely one is that the word originally came from the West Indian “barbacoa” which denotes slow-cooking meat over hot coals.There you are, all of it totally innocuous and inoffensive, not a search term amongst them which would give a spook cause for a sharp intake of breath. And all thanks to Mr. Google. It would have taken me days to assemble and dig through book information on these subjects.Now there’s a thought - would that have been more fun?"},
{"title": "Friko’s Everyday World", "date": "Friday 5 July 2013", "text": "Often I find myself in complete agreement with the people whose blogs I read; the reason is probably that I tend to follow bloggers who are broadly the same age, have roughly similar attitudes and background,  even though we find ourselves on opposite sides of the globe. The differences in outlook seem negligible, although our daily routines may vary wildly due to unimportant factors like geography and nationality. Occasionally a blogpost makes me stop and think; one of these was a recent post by Irene who writes the blog The Most Splendid Day, wherein she said :I find that not one day is like the other and that you can not predict what any day in your life is going to be like, although I used to think until quite recently that I had some control over that. But then I used to think that I had control over all kinds of things, and I have come to find out that this is not true at all.You can not predict what any day is going to look like, and as much as you would like to plan for it, it really can't be done, because the day unfolds as it will and you have to be flexible enough to accept that and not take it personally.I thought about it, but I can’t agree. Other commenters did agree.Either I don’t understand what Irene is saying or I live a different life altogether: my life is totally predictable from one day to the next. Basically, it’s all mapped out, not dull or boring - well, sometimes it is -  but planned, laid down in advance according to necessity, duties and obligations, appointments and dates.There is a diary with entries for all sorts of things: pleasant outings like theatre trips, meals out with friends or meals in with friends, or just meeting friends; the day gardener or the cleaner is coming; not so pleasant whole day shopping trips on days which are otherwise empty; taking Beloved to hospital and surgery appointments, having dealings with officials, like banks or the tax inspector. Hairdresser, chiropodist, beauty treatments, massages, all booked in advance.Village events are planned months ahead and I usually know which ones I’ll attend.I even know what individual days are like when ’nothing’s on': I wake up around the same time, have the same breakfast, read the same paper, tidy the same rooms,  walk the dog at the same time; I know which areas of the garden I’m going to work in, they’ll be the bits that need it most. I know which household chores need doing when (but at least I no longer have my mum’s laundry or cleaning day).It is the most mundane and humdrum existence, with duties and obligations, leisure and entertainment, me-time and time for others, all laid down and planned in advance.  I even know my favourite TV programmes which I’ll either watch or record for another day.Having read Irene’s post and thought about my own life I realise what a regulated and tramline-tracked routine I live.  We are retired and there is scope for spontaneity; occasionally things just happen  but even that usually depends on the weather;  living deep in the countryside makes every outing into an expedition requiring careful forethought.What I don't know is whether I'm going to be alive tomorrow.The only place where I go on flights of fancy is inside my head. Here ideas crowd each other out, philosophies and dreams jostle for space. Here I courageously and curiously follow that rainbow from beginning to end.  Inside my head humdrum doesn’t exist, routine marches to a very different beat. I never know what my head is going to come up with next. Sometimes the noise is deafening and I quickly go and iron some complicated shirts to soften it.Bored with routine? Me?"},

{"title": "Save A Bee Today", "date": "Saturday 29 June 2013", "text": "I find it impossible to kill any creature, I even open the window for a fly or wasp. I shoo mice out of the compost heap and garage; I pick up every bird which has flown into a window and prop it up somewhere safe until it has recovered. Every dead bird or mole I find is buried with full honours. It’s a good thing we have no poisonous snakes and other dangerous creatures; I’d probably see them off the premises with a rucksack full of goodies and a map to the nearest animal shelter.Whenever a bee loses its way and ends up in the house, usually bashing into the window pane again and again, I try to save it by means of a clear plastic cup and a piece of card. Most of the time I succeed.  UK bees are on the endangered species list and we must look after them to safeguard our own future.This morning before breakfast I found a huge bumble bee in the conservatory. It looked dead, flattened and legs akimbo, not surprising after twelve hours in solitary confinement without food or drink. Clearing it away after breakfast I pushed it a little and suddenly the legs twitched. Ah, signs of life, I thought, and immediately the full rescue package came into effect. I picked it up very carefully, took it outside and pushed it gently deep into a peony. A few minutes later it moved again.The bumble bee, legs still akimbo, shoved its bottom around and straightened its wings. After a further five minutes of immobility it moved again, climbing further into the flower head and visibly disturbing the petals as it moved in and out.Fifteen minutes later I went out again to check on the humble bumble’s progress and what do you know, it was climbing about with small sacks of pollen on its legs, making for the way out. The next time I looked it had gone. Mission accomplished!"},
{"title": "Tables", "date": "Thursday 27 June 2013", "text": "I am from a poor people’s kitchen with a large table . . . . . . What has happened to tables? In particular kitchen tables? What has happened to the idea of sitting around a table for meals, for work, for conversation? A place for families to sit at the end of the day and exchange the day’s news, to air small hurts and share happy moments, at eye level, as equals. The anchor that provides a safe place, a place where body and soul find nourishment.We had supper at a friend’s house not long ago, six of us sitting around a large kitchen table. There would have been room for at least two more, but as it was, we could  spread ourselves and when wine and conviviality loosened our tongues, there was plenty of space for elbows leaning on the table and hands gesturing to make a point. I remember how happy this expansiveness made me feel. I was also aware that there are now very few houses where sitting in such comfort is possible. Many younger people go without tables and eat their food from a plate held on a tray, even in company.Am I just showing my age again, lamenting the demise of shared meals round a table? In my childhood and my children’s childhood the kitchen was the centre of the house. When I was small we had what was called a live-in-kitchen, a large room with a table and chairs in the middle, a cast iron range to one side and a dresser to the other. Lifestyles have changed and I am not advocating a return to the ‘olden days’, far from it. I am very grateful I no longer have to work as hard as my mother did early in her marriage.If the kitchen was the centre, the table was the heart of our home. We had our meals at it, father spread his newspaper out on it and I did my homework. Extended family discussions were held here, fists banging the table for emphasis when the talk became heated. The few visitors we had were invited to take a seat, and uncles and aunts had their own regular places. I took my books here, from colouring and picture books to  reading books. In the evenings mum and dad and I played cards or board games, and after I had gone to bed they would still be there, finishing off their day. When we moved from the country to the town and the old table had to go because there was no room for it in the new home I missed it terribly.We have five tables now, too many you might say. If ever we decide to downsize, several will have to go. But three at least have a history and losing them would mean the loss of that history.I've been very domesticated this past week, shopping, cooking, visiting my old ladies. I find grocery shopping very boring, so to make the almost day long shopping expedition at all interesting we have a meal at a restaurant. The Shropshire/Welsh Marches are famous for the many good restaurants and food shops; we have a veritable foodie paradise here.The Pound Inn at Leebotwood on the A49 between Church Stretton and Shrewsbury has a pleasant atmosphere, friendly service and a menu that reads like a dream.The day after was free so I spent the whole morning cooking: a large meatloaf filled with roasted peppers and aubergines and an equally large chicken thigh casserole with vegetables. When I have spare time I often cook dishes which go into the freezers;  my own \"ready meals\", which come in very useful when I want to do other things. We very rarely buy in ready meals, I love to cook and entertain; I count having a well-stocked larder and freezer amongst life's pleasures. Naturally, I also love to eat good food."},
{"title": "Open Garden 2013", "date": "Tuesday 25 June 2013", "text": "\"A haven of peace”, the bouncy little lady said. “I love, love, love it”.At first I was a little taken aback, wondering if she could possibly be a fellow blogger, given to such effusive praise. She was one of he very few I spoke to, I hardly bothered to go out at all. Even the photographs are taken from just one spot, namely the open door of the conservatory. Anybody who came to ask a question, usually the name or variety of a plant, was welcome, of course. The whole weekend was cold and drizzly, with a heavy shower thrown in now and then. I doubt we had more than 100 visitors over the two afternoons, less than half of what we have had in other years.Millie had a few doggy visitors. She behaved very well, greeted them and their owners and never barked at any of them, although to her they must have been intruders. She was a little puzzled and kept close to us in the conservatory for most of the time; protecting us, no doubt.Beloved and I drank tea and wine, read our books and looked up occasionally to acknowledge a wave from the visitors, all of them huddled inside anoraks and cagoules, hoods and hats pulled down firmly against the chill wind and drizzle. It is so sad to see them slouching past the flower beds, rarely stopping to take a closer look.When I was manicuring and snipping and propping and titivating during the last two weeks of hard work, I should have remembered that most garden visitors look for vistas, the overall impression of a bed or even a whole garden, if it’s small; only keen fellow gardeners admire individual arrangements and plant groupings, and sometimes gratifyingly stand in contemplation of a single clump. It’s what I would do. It’s what makes the hard work pay off.This year visitors had an excuse for scanning rather than looking closely: the long winter and damp spring have caused lush growth but little colour. That’s still to come. By next weekend, with a little luck and warm sunshine, the whole garden will burst into life. The signs are already there, just two days later. Isn’t it always so : you should have seen the one that got away.We’ve been opening the garden to visitors for years. Mostly, they are appreciative and praise what there is. We have had lovely conversations with tourists, walked about with other gardeners and enthused over plans and new plant discoveries. We have exchanged views and, occasionally, addresses.  Some people have returned year after year, “to see what you’ve done”. If I’ve been unable to recall the specific name of a particular plant, be it shrub, tree, climber or herbaceous perennial, I’ve promised to do research and have the information ready for next year.In a good year 'Open Garden' is a pleasure; the event makes you look at your private space through foreign eyes, always a salutary lesson. I find I appreciate my garden more afterwards.The bouncy little lady was right: I have every reason to be proud of my haven of peace."},

Since he had his heart attack there is much less of him to go round, he has cut back on the number of gardens he works, as well as the hours he puts in in each individual garden;  all very understandably; now there are just three of us, another woman and me, and an old gentleman’s manor gardens. Recently the old chap has taken over most of gardener’s time to the detriment of the other two gardens. As a member of the class of centuries-established landed gentry, ordering the peasants about comes naturally to old Mr. Beesley, and gardener being a horny-handed-son-of-the-soil, having worked on the land all his life, always for the gentry and aristocracy, equally naturally defers to that class without question. Mr. Beesley even pays him less than I do, gives him neither tea nor tea breaks and certainly never ever treats him as an equal, but as a member of the Jilly-come-lately class I just haven’t the same clout, kindness and friendliness notwithstanding.Rather darkly, -  under my breath and not so that gardener's deaf old ears could catch it  -  I’ve been muttering about organ grinders and monkeys and looked for the ring through gardener’s nose every time he complains about the old gentleman’s demands but I’m probably fighting a losing battle. These are old-fashioned people, steeped in the tradition of master and servant, and modern attitudes have not reached them.I am looking for gardener’s replacement, just in case.o-o-o-o-oSo, I’ve been slogging away at it on my own when it wasn’t raining.  Consequently, I’ve been collapsing on the sofa at night, or even during the afternoon;  with feet up and a comfy cushion under my back I’ve taken to reading on my ipad. It’s made a huge difference; I’ve recently noticed that my eyes tend to blur after a bit and the small print in books is getting hard to read with ease. Ipads and Kindles are the perfect reading medium for tired eyes but there is some getting used to them to do. I’m the sort of person who likes the smell of books; I also sneak a look at the final paragraph while half-way through and, even worse, I read with a pencil in my hand, marking and annotating as I go along. An electronic reader is therefore like a straitjacket, flicking from page to page without detour; yes, I can electronically highlight,  but where’s the fun in that? Real bookmarks sticking out from between the pages let me get back to the paragraph or sentence which caught my imagination so much more easily.Another thing is that I find I can only read thrillers or soppy novels on an electronic reader. Non-fiction, literature, poetry, need paper pages for turning and returning to. I am thoroughly ashamed of some of the books I’ve downloaded and the worst of it is that all books appear on both Beloved’s and my electronic devices (I use the same email address) and when he shows interest in what has appeared on his home page I warn him under no circumstances to open certain titles.o-o-o-o-oWe had Sunday lunch at The Sun Inn, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding was on the menu. Home-cooked beef would have been tastier - although I don’t know how to cook Yorkshires - but it’s nice to go to the pub, chat with other guests and not lift a finger myself. block busternight nursewindow dressingdog foodhandkerchiefrain watercolouring book"},

Cloudy days are what we expect, at least one can follow the usual routine of sighing and complaining about the English weather. I like to know where I am.To tell the truth, I am also rather bored with this endless gardening; There’s still quite a lot to do before the Open Gardens weekend. On top of it I made a mistake with the date: it’s a week earlier than I had assumed. Even so, I am remarkably calm about the whole thing, not at all in my usual frazzled frame of mind on these occasions. Perhaps there’s something wrong with me.Anyway, here are a couple of pictures of the front of the house, along the drive and in the courtyard. The sun was still shining when I took them.This is part of the fernery, to one side of the house, under some mighty old beech, horse chestnut and sycamore trees. I love shady gardening, although it can be rather difficult to establish anything lush. It’s always best to stick with indigenous plants, exotics just won’t flourish. I tried some expensive Australian tree ferns, they were dead within a couple of years, victims of our frosty winters.This is a quick snap of some villagers on the bowling green, which is only a few steps outside the field gate. I love leaning over the fence and watching them, although I’ve not felt tempted to join them. There is something quintessentially English about these folk and their pursuit. The green is velvet smooth, a chap well into his 80s takes meticulous care of it and only the softest shoes are permitted to tread this hallowed ground.Spending most of my days out of doors has meant I’ve hardly touched my computer. I’ve missed blogging - well, a little - but doing mentally undemanding, physical work has given me plenty of time to think. Perhaps I will come up with rather more interesting posts again soon."},

{"title": "The Bomber Over Hampstead Heath", "date": "Monday 3 June 2013", "text": "sweffling at stopping by woods wrote a thoughtful post about seeing and hearing a Lancaster bomber flying in the skies above her peaceful Derbyshire hills on the recent anniversary of RAF raids on the Ruhr dams, the Dambusters.  When she heard it,  \"My legs turned to jelly, and silly old woman that I am, I felt very tearful and afraid.  It was the shape, the low rumble of engines, the vibrations and the potential.  Also the history.” she wrote. It’s alright, I want to say to her, don’t be afraid, it’s one of yours. RAF Lancaster Bomber It’s very different when the sound is deeply etched into your subconscious as a fearful noise you heard as a toddler, when your mother carried you, in your laundry basket bed, down steep stairs into the dark recesses of the coal cellar, lit, at pavement level, by the narrow slit of the open coal hole. The terror a mother feels, alone and helpless, is automatically transmitted to her baby. The day I was suddenly, literally out of the blue, reminded of the terror, Beloved and I were walking on Hampstead Health. It was one of those rare summer mornings in England when the air is soft and balmy, when the greensward shimmers with the last of the overnight dew, and people smile greetings at each other. London lay spread out below us and we could see the dome of St Paul’s and the towers of the City glinting in the light. We were also newly in love and nothing was further from my blissful mind than long-forgotten demons. And then it happened: one minute we were walking side by side, holding hands, the next I was diving into a gorse and bramble thicket edging the path. “What on earth are you doing,” Beloved shouted, utterly surprised. “The plane, the bomber, can you not hear it”, I said, cowering in the dirt.  On that day too the Lancaster’s flight commemorated a sortie in the bombers’ eventful and deadly history and the deep drone had caused a small child’s terror to resurface,  the very instant of hearing it, in the adult woman.“It’s alright”, Beloved laughed, “It’s one of ours.” But, of course, it hadn’t been, all those years ago."},

I need to swipe it.  No money will be taken but your card needs to go through the system.” She handed me a receipt for £0.00 and waved me away. “Take a seat”. She still hadn’t looked at me.Mr. Mistry was a nice Indian doctor. The higher up the medical food chain you are the less fancy your title. A consultant, an expert in his very particular field, with years of experience, is plain Mister.  Mr. Mistry is a cardiologist; I liked him and was willing to trust him. He read the GP’s letter, my notes, flicked through the test results and turned his professional gaze on me.Less than an hour of questions and answers later he was ready to give his conclusions. I’ll live. No operation necessary, no drastic treatments needed, an increase in beta blockers will probably do the trick. AFib is very common and although ablation has become fashionable, there are unpleasant side effects and the operation is not always successful, nor is it without its dangers. I am wholly relieved; the idea of having a bit of my heart burnt off was not something I relished. Now I know, and spending whatever it’s going to cost me was worth it. He answered all my questions patiently and exhaustively. For me, knowing is half the battle won.I’ll go back to the trusty old NHS with its friendly GPs, nurses and receptionists for medication and, if the condition at some time again necessitates urgent treatment or hospitalisation, I’ll know that the NHS will be there for me. And I won’t have to pay a penny.I’ve been gardening all day today; I am tired now but  have managed to keep elation and excitement within sustainable bounds. Mustn’t overdo the happiness. I’m still allergic to it."},

All of them expensive, although you were not asked to pay for them.After eight years you have grown tired of the lack of progress. Nobody ever followed up on the tests, although each time you were put on a waiting list. Lately you were told that the time for ‘Plan B’ has come, but Plan B didn’t materialise. Instead you went on another waiting list.Once again you found yourself in your GP’s surgery, complaining. “We can do nothing”, the GP said. “Once you’re on the waiting list you have to bide your time”. Ringing the hospital’s booking office didn’t help. “I can confirm that you are on the list, but I don’t know when you will have reached the top (or bottom) of the list. Try the consultant’s secretary.” The consultant’s secretary couldn’t help. “Yes, I can confirm that you are on the list. Ask your GP to write and state that your condition is worsening. That might expedite matters.” The GP said: “They always say that, but they take no notice. They get these letters all the time. I’ll write, but I can’t promise that it’ll help.”“How much would a private consultation cost?” you asked on Tuesday.Your appointment to see the consultant for as long as you need is on Thursday; letters have been written and are awaiting delivery; you have been given copies of all the relevant test results, neatly packaged, and waiting lists have shrunk to the point of non-existence."},

Gardener’s ribs settled down and so did my heart, fingers crossed! Many of you must have done just that, so thank you, it worked.  For most of you away from the UK summer is when there is this golden ball high in the sky which distributes warmth and light to all, sinners and saints alike, for months on end. Not here. You all know how Brits like to whinge about the weather, well, there is plenty to whinge about.An annual spring task is trying to eradicate Welsh poppies. They’re very pretty, popping up all over the place. Unfortunately, they tend to seed themselves everywhere, even into the centre of other plants, which then have to be dug up, divided and freed from the invader.Gardener is a sensible chap, he stopped after three hours on Saturday and went home. He still managed to make me large quantities of potting compost for tubs and pots, clean out a gutter and repair it, dig up and move a small Japanese acer which was in the wrong place and dig over a couple of small vegetable plots. (The zucchini I planted have already shrivelled a bit. Perhaps the night time temperatures are still too low).Beloved and I had bought a few plants; I potted some up and planted the rest in the borders. This morning I got going on tender geraniums and fuchsias; as it’s raining again today, and the forecast remains gloomy - naturally - I’m hoping that the temperature will stay above frost from now on.As I said, it’s raining again, the day has turned miserably grey and Millie and I got wet; our walk was short, no further than down to the river and round the castle. She’s a good dog, she takes herself for little outings in the garden, there’s plenty for her to explore. She’ll get fat though; every time she comes back in she wants - and often gets - a coming-home-biscuits.The difference between today and yesterday is huge. We sat over our breakfast in the conservatory, doors and windows open, listening to the church bells being rung. First there was the usual test drive of two bells; perhaps the bellringers arrive in an uneven procession and everybody who turns up grabs hold of their rope and starts pulling. Eventually they sort themselves out and the noise begins to make sense; sometimes they even manage a proper peal. Or could that be a recording?As soon as they stopped, somebody rang a coloured dove. At least, that’s what it sounded like, two notes, one repeated. I was woken by bird song at 4am. On first becoming aware of the noise I thought it was some high pitched electrical hum in the house, but when I’d roused myself sufficiently, the hum turned into a thousand battle cries being flung into the glorious dawn. Why are birds so belligerent?  If they don’t have enough room to live why do they have so many babies? You should see the huge sparrow families fighting over the seed tray. Benefit Scroungers!"},

He didn’t mind too much about not working - he is retired, after all - but I missed him. As the weather was reasonable, and the Open Garden deadline is racing towards me, I worked by myself for two days. Two hours’ gardening in the morning, cooking dinner, followed by an hour’s dog walking, a tea break, and another good two hours’ gardening. What could possibly be wrong with that? I didn’t do a lot of digging or lugging, just normal outdoor work.True, I’m not as young as I was, but I didn’t feel overtired at all, just nicely stretched. And very happy. Outdoor work always makes me feel elated, it’s those lovely endorphins that are released by exercise in the fresh air.The walks were lovely too. Millie took her time over all those wonderful smells left expressly for her benefit and she deposited lots of little messages herself. I poked around for wildflowers, like this gorgeous little clump of cuckooflower - aka  Lady’s smock or milkmaids. No stress, no undue effort. I am sure you all know what  'nicely tired and deserving of a lazy evening’ feels like. Both days left me in high good spirits and all round pleased with myself.I should have known what would happen: a rush of adrenaline like I had experienced for two days running causes my stupid heart to go into overdrive. Sure enough, there I was,  ready to drop everything else and start a third gardening day, when sudden flutterings stopped me dead and it was me on the sofa, self-medicating like mad, instead of outdoors. It was okay in the end, four hours later things had settled down and I didn’t even call the doctor. It’s just so very scary every time.Yesterday gardener was back. We only managed a half-hearted couple of hours; it was bitterly cold and raining on and off, with some really hefty showers. We had a tea break though, gardener sitting on the terrace by the broom - he refuses to come and sit inside, preferring to stay out in all weathers. Sniffing the air he said: “ when I’m dead I want one of them on my grave; at least I smell good a few weeks every year.”If the weather is good he’ll be back tomorrow. We’ll have another go at some of the bigger jobs. Keep your fingers crossed for: a) the weather, b) gardener’s ribs, and c) my heart. Personally, I’ll try to be as miserable as I can. But not to excess.PS: prickly gorse (bot. name ulex) is not the same as broom (bot. name genista) which is a garden shrub."},

{"title": "The Extraordinary Dandelion", "date": "Monday 20 May 2013", "text": "\"Has there ever been a year for dandelions like this year?”Standing in the kitchen, after his walk with the dog, he looks wistful, undecided.Gathering and preparing dandelions for wine-making is labour-intensive;dandelion heads must be plucked when in full bloom,preferably late in the morning or early in the afternoon,and always on a dry and sunny day.Leave it too late and the flowers will be half-closed and difficult to handle.Make sure that every trace of stem is removed,and also remove as many as possible of the green sepals that enclose the yellow petals.If you don’t, your wine will be bitter.Kitchen scissors are the tool of choice.He has decided, he will make dandelion wine,the first in many years.Be warned, however.A strong bladder and digestive system are essential if you want to come away unscathed.The dandelion’s other names are:Jack-piss-the-bed,Pissy beds,Pittley beds,Tiddle-beds,Wet-the-bed,Dog’s posy,Old man’s clock,Peasant’s clock,Swine’s snout,the seeds are known as:Fairies,Parachutes,Sugar eaters. Dandelions mean carpets of golden-yellow flowers, jagged green leaves (the dent de lion - lion’s tooth) and clouds of featherweight seeds blowing in the wind. Albrecht Duerer saw the appeal even of the closed and withering flower-heads and included them in his extraordinary close-up portrait, painted in 1503, of a square foot of meadowland, \"Das Grosse Rasenstueck\". Shakespeare included the plant in the elegy in Cymbeline : “Golden girls and lads all must / As chimney sweepers come to dust.” Keats imagined “The soft rustle of a maiden’s gown/ Fanning away the dandelion’s down.”Children still blow dandelion down from the round dandelion clocks - the ‘chimney sweepers’ - to ‘tell the time’. The number of blows needed to remove all the seeds gives the hour. if you can catch one on the wing. you can make a wish.Lastly, dandelions appear more and more on menus; the traditional French dish Pissenlit au Lard has fried bacon scraps (lardons) and croutons served on a bed of dandelion salad; dandelion leaves can be found in ordinary pub salads. There’s dandelion pasta,  pickled dandelions, and stir-fried dandelion.In spite of all the above I have spent a good part of today’s gardening gouging out dandelions in my flower beds. Lesser celandine and dandelions are this gardener’s greatest enemies, no matter how highly tradition values them.Tess Kincaid used Jamie Wyeth’s image`’Lighthouse Dandelions” for her promptMAG 169.This post is loosely connected."},

It’s interesting what comes up; there’s even a kind of template if you want to try it.This is what came to mind when I mulled it over:I am from the banks of a river which travels halfway across a continent, South to North,  starting out fast-flowing and angry in youth, slowing down and settling into a broad expanse before meeting and marrying the waters of the ocean and thereby losing itself.I am from vineyards, craggy castles, black bread and Sauerkraut.I am from a land monotonous in its repetitions of fields of wheat and cabbage, copses of beech and oak, silent bogs and waterlily-strewn ponds, peaceful behind curtains of tall poplars. I am from sleepy villages with low church towers, four-square farms with sturdy gates, and black and white cows under  big-bellied clouds.I am from deep blue cornflowers and red poppies, from hedgerows of hazel and hawthorn and country lanes, dead straight, dissolving into shimmering horizons.I am from a poor people’s kitchen with a large table, a range to one side, and a bed in the attic, heat and ice flowers, summers and winters.I am from weavers and dyers, from men called Peter and women called Katharina and Anna, from hard work and long hours,  from dogged endeavour, leavened by laughter and song.I am from aunt Kathy with the twinkling eyes and warm heart, who fed me and hugged me, when others wouldn’t, from aunts who disapproved and uncles who smiled forgivingly.I am from people who survived hardship and trouble, and stayed true to themselves; people whose determination and courage overcame great danger; afraid, they yet clung to what they believed to be right.I come from people with roots in other countries, whose ancestors were blown across borders by the winds of many wars, who came to rest in the fertile plain by the banks of the great river.I am from the teachings of all religions and none, from black-robed nuns and angry-eyed, loud-voiced firebrands, who took for their religion the well-being of all mankind in the face of greed and injustice.I am from Linden trees lining avenues, mists rising from verdant meadows and pollarded willows stretching out their ghostly arms. I am from windmills, bicycles, chestnuts and herbs gathered in high summer, from apple pancakes and pickled roasted beef, from christmas trees and Silent Nights.From grandfather Peter who buried his young wife and brought up his children by telling them stories of ghosts and goblins, from uncle Gottfried, the black sheep, who fell into the ditch and died of TB, from uncle Johann, club-footed and lame, thrown into prison, again and again, because he wouldn't stay silent, from uncle Peter, POW in Russia, who met his child for the first time when she was seven years old and frightened of him.I am from two sides of a family riven by ideology, war and religion, black and red, the colours of deep conviction.I am from boxes of photographs of people long dead, whose bitter arguments and life-long feuds are like wisps of smoke in the wind, blown about into nothingness.  I am from people who left me a heritage valuable beyond rubies, a mind to question and probe, eyes to observe and ears to hear and dismiss the meaningless bluster of voices calling me to follow the herd and a heart unafraid to stand alone.

{"title": "It’s Equally True", "date": "Sunday 12 May 2013", "text": "that one can never rely on the weather, particularly English weather. Last weekend I was drunk on sunshine and gardening, the whole of this week I have been fending off the black dog. Overflowing with the joys of spring one minute,miserably staring out of the window at grey skies the next. Even a rainbow doesn’t help, it’s so short-lived it’s hardly worth getting excited over. Instead of being able to relax into a pleasantly reliable summer season, we feel that we must rush out and make use of every drop of sunshine there is; you never know, there might not be any more.This business of ‘making the most of it' is really exhausting. It’s like having to work to a deadline, having to cram everything that normally happens over a period of three months into a weekend; at the seaside towels are spread out with inches to spare between tribes, other people’s brats kick sand into your picnic; roads to beauty spots are clogged with day trippers and, unheard of with modern cars, some idiot has managed to break down at the narrowest bit. Motorways have road works going on and witches’ hat cones wait to pounce on the hapless motorist. Even sensible people like us, who stay at home, can’t allow themselves to relax. Tables and chairs have to be brought out, meals have to be taken out-of-doors, and there has to be a constant flow of “what a lovely day” - “look at that sky” - \"isn’t this wonderful”, as if not mentioning your good fortune might make it disappear again.Mention it or don’t, it’ll disappear again before you can get get the chairs back under cover.On a completely unrelated subject: I took Beloved to the eye clinic for another injection. He went in to see the consultant, while I stayed in the waiting area. A short while afterwards a chap from the other end from where I was sitting came up to me, in a hurry, and greatly disturbed. “That gentleman you came in with, well, he came out of the consulting room and marched off, down the corridor.” “Really? I wonder why”, I said.  “Yes, he was actually striding down the corridor”. The chap was obviously inviting me to get up and see where my ‘gentleman’ had disappeared to. Sometimes people have this effect on me, they become earnest and urgent and I feel obliged to fall in with their wishes. I passed a small group of people waiting and they all sped me on my way as I walked by. “Down that corridor”, they said as one man, “he was going really fast.” They had obviously discussed this phenomenon amongst themselves.You know how this resolves itself, don’t you?At the other end of the corridor is a Gents. I opened the door and Beloved was just washing his hands. I told him about having been sent on a mission by a gaggle of excited patients. He laughed. “I asked the consultant if there was time for a pee before the injection,” he said.When you are sitting waiting in any kind of clinic, bored, with nothing to do, you might pass the time by examining fellow patients and it is all too easy to make up a story and come to the wrong conclusion, a kind of mild mass hysteria. The benevolent kind in this instance. I suppose dementia is fairly common now.I should have thrilled them and said “Just managed to get hold of him before he threw himself out of the window”, but one always has the best ideas afterwards."},

{"title": "Throw A Ball And Reap A Rock", "date": "Wednesday 1 May 2013", "text": "People who walk dogs meet dog walkers. Dogs who’ve met before need time to reacquaint themselves and those who haven’t,  need to exchange visiting cards. All this is a roundabout way of saying that dog walkers spend a lot of time gossiping with each other. I  met Dave today. Dave throws a ball for his two collies, over and over, and Murphy and Badger go fetch, over and over. You’d think they’d get the message that this endless throwing and fetching business is never going to get them anywhere. As soon as they have found, collected and returned the ball, their stupid human throws it away again. Some humans don’t deserve such devoted doggie services.However, this story is a sad one, about humans who are even more stupid than Dave, although from a human point of view, Dave isn’t really stupid. Dave’s neighbour, a lady called Maud, died recently. She left behind a husband and four children. I say children, because, to Maud and Bernie they always were and always will be, although the eldest of them is in his mid fifties. The youngest, the twins, are well into their forties. Apart from the eldest, who says of himself  “I’m the one who got away”, the five of them all lived in a very small terraced house.Dave and I said how sad it was that Maud had died, seeing as she was such a rock to her family and the village as a whole.  The sort of thing one says when someone well respected, bossy, yet charitable, and very determined, dies. We also said that her death wouldn’t free up any space in the house, except in Bernie’s bedroom, and the others would still be as cramped as ever. What one calls ‘close-knit family’, if one has learned the English way of saying things without saying them.“Did you know that Stan tried to buy the house next door?” Dave asked. Stan is the male half of the twins, a jobbing builder and painter, who does small jobs around the village. He is bright enough to drive a van and organise his customers, although I wouldn’t exactly recommend him for a job that needs expertise. No, I hadn’t heard. “Good idea”, I said, \"put a bit of farting distance between them, get a bit of room for air.”\"O no,” Dave said, “ Bernie put his foot down, he was absolutely dead against it, and Stan had to give up the idea.” My mouth fell open. “O yes,” Dave said, “Bernie insisted that they all stay together, that at home with him and their mum was were they all belonged.” Bernie is god-fearing and righteous, and like Maud was, a rock.I huffed and puffed a bit, but didn’t really want to say very much, Dave and I are relatively new acquaintances and I wanted to avoid getting it wrong. Dave looked at me,  threw another ball for Murphy and Badger, with Millie waddling along in their wake, and decided to tell me his father’s story.“My dad was in the war, unlike his brother, who was declared unfit for service due to severe and debilitating eczema. When the war was over, and my dad came out of the Army, he didn’t go home to his parents, but decided to try and find work in London. He found a job and fell in love with my mother. They married and had us children. My granddad never really approved of us and we saw very little of him and gran. They got old and dad tried to mend fences but it didn’t work. My dad’s brother, whose eczema got worse over the years until he could barely face going out, and my dad’s sister, who looked after them all, stayed with the old people until they died. Neither of them was ever allowed to form a relationship of any kind, they had no friends at all. After both granddad and gran  died and the will was read, it turned out that granddad had disinherited my dad and divided his meagre leavings between the two children who had stayed with him. His reason was stated as “because he left home.My dad’s sister and brother - whose eczema cleared up within weeks  - overturned the will and divided everything three ways.”Dave finished his tale by saying: “ My uncle spent the rest of his life travelling and taking photographs, thousands of them. We have boxes and boxes of them. Sadly, he never made any notes where or of whom he had taken them.”Dave said his granddad was a rock too, god-fearing and righteous, just like Bernie and Maud."},
{"title": "Drama In Two  Acts", "date": "Saturday 27 April 2013", "text": "Act IWe were off to the theatre. “As You Like It”, one of Shakespeare’s comedies with a silly story and lots of fun.  Our friends were on the doorstep, it was time to go; we had a long drive to Stratford-upon-Avon ahead of us.Kelly was in the house, wielding a noisy vacuum cleaner and all we had left to do was to shoo Millie back inside and set off. Kelly knew that Jay, Millie’s dogsitter, would arrive before she left the house. Jay’s key and pay was on the kitchen counter. Kelly had her own key which she would leave behind when she finished her job.The drive was uneventful. It was a pleasant day and after a good two hours' car journey we enjoyed sitting on the terrace above the river, eating our sandwiches and watching the ducks. Absentmindedly I pulled a sandwich out of the bag on the table.  “Something wrong here,” I said, \"the filling is cheese, I can’t eat cheese.” Sally and Frank had been watching me. “It’s wrong,” Sally said calmly, “because your hand is in our bag.”Standing in the long queue for the Ladies is never a pleasure; I pass the time by watching myself and all the other ladies dying for a pee before the show in the tall mirrors, as we slowly shuffle towards the tiny cubicles and relief. Standing in line seems to drain the life out of you, we all have a vacant look, intent on getting to the promised land before the last bell.Beloved and I had seats in the centre front row, we were close enough to the stage to lean on it and I was sitting directly beside and just under one of the two walkways the actors use for their exits and entrances,often thundering past me but sometimes just standing quietly, alone, or in pairs, silently watching or performing 'off-stage', while the main action takes place in the centre. At a very quiet moment my phone went off, right under the feet of the banished Duke Senior, whose well-turned calf muscle didn’t even twitch.I hate the morons who can’t remember to switch off their phones; I had pressed the off button long and hard before the show started; surely, it couldn’t have been my phone. Besides, it was a brand new phone, never used, and only one person knew the number,  Jay. Why would she ring me? The faint ringing stopped. Ten minutes later it rang again, still faintly and for just a few rings. I shifted in my seat, getting uncomfortable. I was sure I’d switched the phone off. Concentrating on the play became an effort. Sure enough, the damn thing went off again, just three rings this time. Theatre auditoria provide no holes to crawl into, nor could I interrupt the performance by creeping out; the whole theatre’s attention would have been focussed on me. Sitting so close to the stage, I would have created a huge disturbance. I was stuck.When the interval came I shot out, examining the phone. It was on and the display showed a 'locked' symbol. I couldn’t do a thing to it, neither switch it on nor switch it off, check for messages or retrieve missed calls. Apparently, the only thing it would do was to sound the ringtone.  I was desperate now and ready to grind it under my heel, when I had a better idea: I removed the battery, which killed it stone-dead.Act IIAll was calm when we arrived home. Millie was alone, hysterically happy to see us, but fine. Jay had taken only a small part of her pay and left a long, apologetic note to say that there were details she would need to tell us as as soon as possible. Within minutes the landline rang.Jay had been delayed in getting to our house and when she arrived Kelly had gone. Kelly is a very nice woman but she spends more time concentrating on a constant supply of desinfectant and rubber gloves than lubricating thought process mechanisms. Being a brush short of a broom cupboard, she had left the   door locked and shoved the key back in through the letterbox; Millie inside. As well as Jay’s key. The normal arrangement in such cases is for the person leaving to put the key into a hiding place known to all and sundry for the next person. We are nothing if not trusting.Jay tried all doors; all were locked except for the small, integral, garage door, which leads into the house via another (locked) door. This internal door was the first one she tried to force. No luck. Ditto the front  and back doors; the conservatory doors were open but the inner glass doors were locked. No luck.Through the letter box Jay could see Kelly’s key on the mat. She went into the village and borrowed a couple of magnets on a stick, a kind of fishing rod for keys. No luck. Jay is not very strong but she has a friend who is. Jay fetched Linda and took her to the up-and-over garage door to see if Linda could push the inner door open. Linda walked straight into the not-quite-fully-open garage door, hitting her forehead on the metal edge, and briefly knocking herself out. Head wounds bleed profusely, Linda went straight to the surgery where the gash in her forehead was cleaned and glued back together. After that she decided Millie would have to chance her luck without her.Jay hadn’t given up yet, she went to fetch more help, a man this time. A chap’s brute force might succeed where a woman’s feeble efforts had failed. Robyn tried his best, using burglar’s tools on keyholes, but short of actually causing damage he saw no way of getting in.Poor Jay was in despair. “ I need a magic wand”, she wailed. Angry and frustrated, cursing Kelly, and worried about Millie, who had been locked in for hours, she grabbed hold of the handle to the front door and rattled it as hard as she could.And the door sprang open!Perhaps Robyn’s efforts had dislodged the lock, perhaps the combined heaving and pushing had had some effect; whatever the cause, the door opened as freely as a bank’s door when a rich man enters.So Millie had her walk - albeit a short one - and her dinner after all.EpilogueThings rarely work out the way you plan them but All’s Well That Ends Well. We also now have a specific lock in the house which appears to be badly bent out of shape.“But other than that, Mrs. Friko,  how did you like the play?” “Not bad, not bad at all, thank you for asking.\""},

The hawk took off with theplucked remains.Gardener is a pigeon fancier; for years he kept pigeons in his backyard; some of his birds were valuable, successful racers; sparrowhawks took more than one of them. Gardener tells a story of him lying in wait in the open window, shotgun trained on the bird table, which the hawk visited at roughly the same time in late afternoon each day. As if the raptor knew the fate which awaited him, he stayed away on that day. And the next. And the next again. Gardener almost gave up. He was going to give it one more day and, sure enough, the hawk appeared suddenly, at great speed, out of a thorn hedge, making for a bird on the table. Gardener blasted him.I hate this story and killing raptors is now prohibited. But when you see a sparrowhawk stooped over a fresh-plucked songbird, with wings cowling the victim like a vampire’s cape, I defy any one not to be distressed. I have song thrushes nesting in the hedge.This bird is becoming rarer every year. At 5.30 every morning, the male pours his loud, bell-like clarion wake-up call across the garden from the top of the tall conifer; should I not hear this sound one morning before the end of the natural season and  the hawk have killed my thrushes, I’d wish for a shotgun myself. I know that sparrowhawks have every right to survive too but, please, leave my songbirds lone. Take a rook or jackdaw, maybe another collared dove or two, even a pigeon or gamebird. It’s the second time that I’ve seen the hawk linger by the bird table and I’ve seen him pick off a feeding sparrow and bluetit , which gave me an unhappy jolt both times.  Perhaps I’d better move the feeding station or stop feeding altogether.Hawks are not afraid of people, so standing guard won’t help.Thank you very much, Hilary, much appreciated."},
{"title": "St George And The Dragon ", "date": "Tuesday 23 April 2013", "text": "St George is the patron saint of England and each year his death is celebrated on this day. John Aubrey of Brief Lives, 1626-1697,  English antiquary, natural philosopher and writer, composed the following ditty on the matter:To save a Maid, St George the Dragon slewA pretty tale, if all it told be trueMost say, there are no Dragons and tis saidThere was no George, pray God there was a Maid.St George And The DragonPaolo Uccello - 1397-1475“It happened that George once travelled to the city of Silena in the province of Lybia. Near this town there was a pond as large as a lake where a plague-bearing dragon lurked; and many times the dragon had put the populace to flight when they came out armed against him, for he used to come up to the city walls and poison everyone who came within reach of his breath. To appease the fury of this monster the townspeople fed him two sheep every day; otherwise he would invade their city and a great many would perish. But in time they were running out of sheep and could not get any more, so, having held a council, they paid him tribute of one sheep and one man or woman. The name of a youth or maiden was drawn by lot, and no one was exempt from the draft; but soon almost all the young people had been eaten up. Then one day the lot fell upon the only daughter of the king, and she was seized and set aside for the dragon…when, weeping, he had blessed her, she started toward the lake.” (The Golden Legend)At which point the gallant St George, who happened to be passing at the time, decided to intervene.  According to Uccello, he is a knight in slightly shining armour with  the face of a very young insurance agent,  holding an inordinately long lance (very useful for dealing with plague-breathing monsters). He goes straight to the root of the problem and spears the halitotic dragon in the back of its foul-smelling throat. Gouts of blood drip on to the rocky ground.  As the beast ducks away,  the remarkably unruffled heroine, not a hair out of place and not a stain on her royal garments after her ordeal,  snares it with her girdle. She holds the dragon as you would hold a dog on its lead, her hand telling the cornered and fatally wounded beast to ‘sit’.I am not sure what happened afterwards; St George being a hero and a saint, he probably had no time for dalliance, never mind matrimony, and returned the haughty maid unsullied to her father’s protection.If you want to see what the English poet Ursula A. Fanthorpe had to say about the whole thing, painting as well as tale, take a look at Friko’s Poetry and Pictures. Fanthorpe gives each of the three protagonists ample room to voice their innermost thoughts."},
{"title": "A Year In The Life Of A Lady Gardener - April", "date": "Monday 22 April 2013", "text": "Today being Earth Day it is perhaps suitable to bring my gardening year diary up to date. The late spring has caused delays of up to four weeks in everything that grows and only now have gardener and I started to get down to serious work. Here he is weeding between shrubs in the mixed border.Hardly any of the herbaceous perennials filling the gaps between the shrubs are up more than a few inches, but weeds grow fast. The idea of growing lanky perennials among shrubs is so that the lattercan provide a framework for the former and I won’t have to stake them.This was one of my work patches.Gardener is a lot quicker than I am but I am the more thorough of the two of us.I get down on my knees and weed carefully between smaller plants.Gardener uses his mid-sized fork to weed and ‘tickle’ the soil, while I mainly use a narrow hand trowel and fork to ensure that I don’t damage roots of small plants.Allium ursinum – known as ramsons, buckrams, wild garlic, broad-leaved garlic, wood garlic, bear leek or bear's garlic – is a wild relative of chives native to Europe and Asia.The leaves can be used in all sorts of ways, in soups, salads, as a spice, pickled and preserved.They are at their best now, the flavour is fresh and green and less strong than allium sativum, the ordinary garlic.Flowers, which come later, can also be eaten.If you find the plant in dampish woodland or in your garden, make sureyou have allium and not lily-of-the-valley, colchicum or arum, which all have similar leavesbut are poisonous, possibly deadly.Rub a leaf between finger and thumb,if you get a pronounced smell of garlic, you are safe to use it.Anemone or WindflowerThere should be a place for these darling little plants in every garden,from large drifts in the shrubberies of country estatesto tiny patches in front gardens.I am fortunate in that mine were here when we took over,and little clumps have since settled here and there all over the garden.Most don’t mind lightly shaded places, although A. blanda will close its petals on a dull day.This daisy-flowered type has many narrow leavessurrounding a golden disc.If your climate is mild, A. blanda might flower as early as February.I am not very fond of Bergenias,the large-leaved saxifrage,because the large leathery leaves never quite do what they are meant to do.Meant to be bright green  turning to red in autumn, they can often suffer from brown splodges,becoming unsightly. They also spread when growing conditions are favourable.I am for ever on my knees cutting out shrivelled leaves.But in spring they repay the hard labour of the rest the year;hyacinths-like spikes bearing red, white, pink or purple bell-shaped flowersrise above the leaves.Bergenias will grow in many types of soil.I’ve mentioned Chaenomeles before,often known as cydonia, japonica or ornamental quince.It’s a popular shrub, because it will grow practically anywhere.Mine is wall-trained and covering a large section of the red brick wallseparating the courtyard from the drive.The shrub that keeps on giving,it looks rather spectacular at the moment. It’ll loose none of its attractionwhen the yellow fruits, which can be turned into jelly, form in late summer.Easy to grow, quite a stunner.Only the baby tulips are flowering,the full-sized ones will take quite a while yet.Tulips require a whole post, if not a book, all to themselves.I like them, moderately so, butthe mice in my garden adore the bulbs and I’ve lost a large clump of splendid, tall, yellow and red tulips over the winter. to their rapacious appetite.You are meant to take them up once they have finished flowering, and the leaves turn yellow. Keep the dry bulbs in a frost-free place;I haven’t done so and paid the price.I’ve also mentioned Euphorbias, or spurge, before.They really are amongst my favourite garden perennials.No trouble, happy to grow in poor soil in a sunny spot, always reliable,always noticeable. I grow many different varieties.Last, but not least, the humble Primula,  or primrose.I grow a few of the showier kind, but my favourites are primula vulgaris,the bog-standard, cheap little things you can pick up in any nursery.Year after year they return, brightening shady spots under shrubs or trees, requiring only to be divided and replanted when the plants get too dense.If you divide after flowering, you end up with a handful of new plants, happy to be replanted instantly and guaranteed to flower during the next season.Primulas thrive in rich soil, but, as you can see here, they work hard even in a stoney patch.I thought I might mention that this is an English garden, where plants are nurtured from one year to the next. I have very few annuals. When I read posts by American gardeners I always have the impression that they go out and buy trays of seedlings (flats?) every spring, which last for one summer and are then discarded. I may be wrong and would love to learn how my American blog friends tend their plots."},
{"title": "Eyes Bigger Than Your Stomach?", "date": "Thursday 18 April 2013", "text": "Before greed became morally acceptable in the circles of the Haves as well as many of the Have-Not-Quite-As-Muchs, and we all strove to make it into a commendable contribution to society to demand more and more, we made do with ambition, a much nicer word. I leave you to decide how closely ambition and greed are related; I’d say second-cousins-once-removed, but I’ve definitely seen them in bed together.As a small child, having not only heard tell about hunger but experienced a definite feeling of hollow tummy, it was my ambition to sit in front of a well-filled plate of food at every mealtime. Mum dished up and, feeling the large, dark, pleading eyes of her first live-born and only child upon her, she was often more generous than she should have been. “Are you sure you can manage that?”, was her permanent refrain, and “You must eat it up. Dad will be cross if food is wasted.” The food was never wasted; Dad remembered too well a time when shortages were the norm and great inventiveness and imagination were needed to bring it to the table. He always finished my leftovers. But the phrases “eyes too large for your stomach?” and “bitten off more than you can chew?” were a constant reminder that there was something wrong with me and his disapproving tone left me feeling vaguely uneasy and grubby.My table habits have changed since then, and plates piled high put me off altogether. I feel full before I even start eating. I wish I could say the same about books. There’s been a perilously unstable pile of books sitting on top of a large wooden box in my study for weeks, mostly poetry books, I thought. Each new one I took off the shelves to flick through ended up on the pile. Notepads, bookmarks, magazines, folders of notes, all found a ’temporary’ home on the box. With Kelly coming to clean up after us, the pile needed sorting.Besides poetry books, which have all gone back on the shelves, I was surprised to find these which had slipped my mind, all non-fiction, with bookmarks keeping my place between the read and unread chapters.In 'Die Deutsche Seele' the writers survey and research 64 themes of \"Germanness,” from ‘Abendstille, via Bauhaus and Beer,  Doktor Faust, Gemuetlichkeit, Heimat, Music,  Luther, Schadenfreude, Father Rhine, to Weihnachtsmarkt, and the eternal German longing for the abyss.I must not lose this book again, it’s wonderful for dipping into whenever homesickness overwhelms me. It makes the homesickness worse, but in a perverse way that feels good.The American writer Bill Bryson is a lightweight. He had the idea for the 600+ pages of ‘At Home' (and many of his other books) while trawling his own life for copy. He appears to be looking around hisVictorian rectory in Norfolk, and finding each room the inspiration for an amusing - and possibly well-researched - chapter on generations of people going quietly about their business in his house and others like it. This too is a book which can be abandoned and returned to at any chapter. Bryson is never boring, but never truly gripping either. Amusing is the best I can say; I’ll save the rest of it for a rainy day when I have nothing better to do.A.C. Grayling’s ‘Among the Dead Cities’ asks if the targeting of civilians in war is ever justified. Grayling is an English philosopher and Master of  New College of the Humanities, London. It is a book for those interested not only in the Second World War and the destruction of cities in Germany and Japan, but also the ethics of warfare in a world where governments still seek to justify the bombing of civilian targets. Published in 2006, the book is relevant today and examines the lessons we can learn about how people should behave in a world of tension and moral confusion. In spite of the subject matter the book reads well and I have promised myself that I will pick it up again soon and consume great platefuls of it in each sitting.Simon Winder professes to have a ‘crazed love affair’ with Germany, a country he has visited many times over the years. According to the sleeve notes ‘he is mesmerized by its cuisine, its architecture and its fairy tale landscape. He is equally passionate about the region’s history, folklore, monarchs and changing borders'. Winder describes Germany’s past afresh, taking in the story from the shaggy world of the ancient forests right through to the Nazi catastrophy in the 1930s, in an accessible and startlingly vivid account of a tortured but also brilliant country, which has at different times revealed the best and the worst aspects of Europe’s culture.Since I was given Germania nearly a year ago I have picked it up and thrown it down in disgust many times. It lacks gravitas, historical cohesion and rigorous research, and yet . . . . the man has a warped sense of humour which appeals to me.There is nothing funny about Sebald. How ‘Vertigo’ came to be buried at the bottom of the pile is incomprehensible to me. My plate, when I first started to read it, must have been full to overflowing, thus making me turn toa form of entertainment other than reading.I can always read Sebald and my great regret is that he didn’t live to write more of his compelling, deceptively simple, eccentric masterpieces. Part fiction, part travelogue, Sebald pursues his solitary course from England to Italy, combining, along the way, Stendhal, the Great Fire of London, a story by Kafka and a closed-down pizzeria in Verona.I would get back to any one of these books without delay, if it weren’t for the fact that I am in the middle of consuming two others: Richard Russo’s ‘Straight Man’ which makes me want to live among American college professors on a campus somewhere in small-town USA. It’s the only novel I have on the go and I am enjoying it tremendously. I’ll only put it down to pick another chapter of the second book currently on my plate: Oliver Burkeman’s ‘The Antidote’,  self-styled ‘Bracing Detox for the Self-Help Junkie’. Never having been a self-help addict the book shouldn’t make sense to me, but it does. Burkeman gives woolly old ‘positive thinking’ rather than actual thinking a well-aimed kick in the teeth. His ideas on how to stop frantically striving for happiness and actually getting closer to a semblance of it by letting go suit me down to the ground.Bon Appétit."},

{"title": "Those Were The Days ", "date": "Monday 15 April 2013", "text": "Spring, 1935 by Kuzma Petrov-Vodin The MAG 164 provided by Tess Kincaidwhen boys and girls 'walking out'  really did go for walks together.  Do you remember summer days when your heart beat faster because the two of you had escaped from parents and friends and he led you to the quieter parts of the local park? Did you have a favourite park bench for those daring bits of dialogue so embarrassing in retrospect?It was a long walk to the town woods but getting there was definitely worth the effort. My boy and I thought ourselves fortunate if we found the little pavilion overlooking the lake empty. Open on three sides, roofed and with a stone bench running along the rounded back wall, the little ‘temple’ was the perfect place for assignations. Once a pair of lovers was installed inside, nobody else entered while they were there. Sometimes families occupied the space and teenage couples slunk away into the woods, waiting their turn. It was the town’s hardier teenagers' favourite place for a rendezvous. Because of the long walk there, the cold stone bench to sit on and the draughty sides, nobody lingered for very long. The boy, being a gentleman, stretched his arm out behind the girl, so that she  could rest her back on it rather than the unyielding stone wall and if his hand should stray and squeeze her shoulder, well, she was ready for that. Cool lips met in chaste kisses and by and by both his arms encircled her and she lent into him for comfort, heart beating wildly.How sweetly innocent it was.'The Deuss Temple'Would today’s young couples ‘walk’ out together? Could they walk?  There they are, she poured into her skin-tight trousers, tottering on 4” stilettos, holding his hand for safety rather than romance, while he has a job keeping his jeans decent and is barely able to lift his feet in boat-sized, dangly-laced trainers. I always feel I should post a letter in that strip of bumcrack or perhaps stick one of those little plastic flags in it, suitably at half-mast. And I admire her bravery: sitting down in those trousers for more than a few minutes must be hell, not to mention the danger of splitting the seams.image: block couponsherpaYes, I know, I am showing my age. Perhaps these kids are just as tenderly in love as we were all those years ago. Perhaps it’s only ever the fashions which change, not the feelings.  But do pull your jeans up, young man, before I forget myself and do something we might both regret."},

{"title": "It All Depends On What You Mean By Writing", "date": "Thursday 4 April 2013", "text": "Yesterday morning the writers’ group met. I didn’t go.Sent no apologies for absence, sent no explanation, just didn’t go. Not for the first time either.Another failure on my part to stick with something, another instance of short lived enthusiasms? Feeling guilty is what I do well; I was programmed early. Catholicism helped, but my parents had a not inconsiderable hand in it, one of the few areas where they didn’t leave me to bring myself up.Not this time. No way is this my fault.Why are so many people satisfied with mediocrity? I suppose, if you start by expecting nothing, then mediocrity is progress. You could ask: who says something is mediocre, who determines what is a good poem or an interesting piece of writing? Well, excuse me, I do in this case. I am the one who has to listen to these extremely poor efforts.There is the ex film maker who finds it easy to knock off half a dozen lines of verse and, without another look, sends them off via her phone as contributions to the meeting. There is the ex maths and science teacher whose great loves are Italian drama and poetry and whose frequent attempts to emulate them only succeed in murdering the originals. There is the ex surveyor, who is living proof that a talent for strict attention to detail and accuracy, coupled with a complete lack of imagination, may be no barrier to professional advancement but do not make a writer or poet. The leader, a sweetly vague elderly woman who writes whimsical poems and almost no prose, is about to be ousted by the ex film maker, who has enough energy and drive to change the dynamics of the group, were she so inclined; however, she prefers to push full steam ahead with publishing hair-raisingly bad verse in conjunction with the photography group, which means we’ll be running before we have learned to crawl. The embarrassment alone would kill me.I sit on the periphery and fume, cross with myself for having driven into town and used up the best part of the day on another futile mission. It’s not that I haven’t tried. I have suggested that we do what other U3A writing groups do, become more structured and set challenges: 300 words, say, on a first line, a piece of prose, a newspaper article, a poem on a particular subject, even those blogging favourites, Twitter or Flash fiction. “No, I want to be creative and write what I feel like.” This came from the absolute dullest member of the group, the one whose readings have the power to send me into a paroxysm of rage, if he hasn’t sent me to sleep first. When advised “don’t tell, show; you could bring the story to life that way” (ha!) he answered, “ I am not looking for anyone else to read this, only my children when I’m gone.” What! If you don’t want to learn anything, why are you here?I would say that the others in the group have been exposed to similar cultural influences as I have, be they books, plays, poetry, music, all of a reasonable standard. All are educated ex professionals. Yet, as far as I can tell, when it comes to their writing, all critical faculties are set aside. Are we programmed  not to see the faults in our own work? If an amateur dressmaker makes a dress that doesn’t fit over the hips, say, does she give herself 'A for Effort' and leave it at that, or does she go back and alter the dress? And am I allowed to say that the dress doesn’t fit?Criticism in the writers’ group is not wanted, not even the constructive kind. One very timid lady confessed that she would feel hurt if someone criticised her creations and several nodded their heads in sympathy. (Which one of you, who have stayed with this rant so far, is saying: \"If fulsome praise is all they want, why don’t they blog?”)If I sound angry, then yes, I admit to being angry. Angry and disappointed. We started out so well. Only four (incl. me) of the original members are still with the group; the emphasis is no longer on writing for the pleasure of it. We were supposed to encourage each other, praise, but also criticise our work and learn a little about the craft in the process. All we do now is puff ourselves up and although we don’t say “Wow! Brilliant!” we never say “could have done better”.It’s time I wrote my letter of apology."},

More like a double tent now. Two rows of summer and autumn fruiting raspberries grow under the protection of netting, to stop birds getting to them before we do.Fat chance. We stupidly forgot to remove the netting across the uprights. Heavy snow collected on the top and the sheer weight of it bent the poles into V-shapes.I am not pleased. Not at all.And my home-made swing in the beech tree is pretty useless too.As are the table and bench beyond. At last we are free to leave the house again.My friend and neighbour, Frank, whose name should beSir Galahad, Knight in Shining Armour,dragooned his Easter visitors to come and dig us out. Lucky visitors.If they’d known in advance they might not have bothered to come.I promise that the next picture will be the last snow picture of the current winter.My friend Jay, who today very kindly took me shopping in her car for the second time,took this picture on her phone as I pulled the groceries through the fieldon my sledge, with snow shovel in the other hand.Before dusk fell I took a look at the drive and the courtyard.

I fumbled and fussed with the thing, it wouldn’t work. I tried the batteries, dead, and no working ones as back up in the house.  We were just accepting that we’d have to be without heating when I decided to ring my neighbour and good friend Sally for help. “I am sure we have spares”, she said immediately. “I’ll have a look for them and bring them over”. It was after nine pm and pouring with rain, the way from her house to mine goes through a dark field and is 200m or more. I protested that I’d come to her house. “No no”, she said, “I’ll bring them over.” Which she did, within ten minutes, dripping wet in her anorak and armed with her flashlight. With the new batteries I  could re-programme the transmitter and we are once again cosy in a warm house. Thank you very much, Sally. We couldn't ask for a better neighbour.Would many people be as kind as Sally? I don’t know. But I’m learning to expect - and ask for and accept - the help people in this little place at the end of the valley, this tiny town I call My World are willing to give.For more contributions to Our World Tuesday click on the link."},

{"title": "Friko’s solitary Alphabet Game - H is for Halcyon", "date": "Friday 15 March 2013", "text": "KingfisherPhotograph by Charlie FlemingCurrently mired in a period of blogger’s paralysis, and struggling to find anything in the least post-worthy, I remembered that quite a long time ago I started to play a solitary alphabet game, had a look where I’d stopped and found ‘H’ to be the next letter up. ‘H’ is a very common first letter in English; I wanted something impressive and asked Beloved for inspiration. He came up with “ haruspicy, haruspication \"a form of divination from lightning and other natural phenomena, but especially from inspection of the entrails of animal sacrifices.The man is priceless.“Thank you dear, but I think I’ll give that one a miss, delving in entrails is not what I had in mind for the moment.\"But there is a word I’ve always liked, even before I knew what it meant “Halcyon”. Just try it on your tongue: hal-cy-on.  Doesn’t it sound beautifully mellow and promising? It reminds me of those long-ago days of summer when we children went to swim in flooded gravel pits, where the ground water was deep and came up icy cold and the black surface of the artificial lake hardly reflected any sunlight, making it appear opaque enough to walk on. For safety’s sake we had an older sister or brother in attendance but they were usually too busy eyeing up other teenagers to watch over us small fry. One or two dads were sprinkled among the children, spread out on a blanket and in charge of drinks and sweets and ready to bundle a shivering child in a towel before it died of hypothermia. We never had a dad of our own present but other children’s dads served as communal guardians. And not only guardians, but teachers as well. Long before I went to big school and officially learned to speak High German I had no qualms about attempting it anyway. Always willing to show off ‘big words’ and ‘long sentences’ I frequently got it wrong enough for any educated adult present to show signs of distress. One dad clearly couldn’t take any more and rounded on me, correcting my grammar in schoolmasterly tones, thereby embarrassing not only me and himself, but the other children around. “Don’t talk so much”,  the teenaged sister of my little friend said, “what I’m wearing to the dance is not your business.”The 'halcyon days of old' is the expression mostly used. But halcyon is also the Greek name for the Kingfisher, born out of a gentle tale from mythology. Alcyone  was the daughter of Aeolus, either by Enarete or Aegiale. She married Ceyx, son of Eosphorus, the Morning Star.They were very happy together in Trachis, and according to Pseudo-Apollodorus's account, often sacrilegiously called each other \"Zeus\" and “Hera”. This angered Zeus, so while Ceyx was at sea (going to consult an oracle according to Ovid's account), the god threw a thunderbolt at his ship, causing it to founder, with all hands drowned.  Soon after, Morpheus (God of Dreams) disguised as Ceyx appeared to Alcyone as an apparition to tell her of his fate, and she threw herself into the sea in her grief. Out of compassion, the gods changed them both into halcyon birds, named after her.A pair of kingfishers can be seen flitting under the bridge at Valley’s End at certain times of the year. You have to be very quick to follow the blue flash with your eyes. A flash is all I’ve ever caught up to now,  low over the water when the river is fast enough for fish to collect in the basin on the other side of the gravel bank."},
{"title": "Complaints", "date": "Saturday 9 March 2013", "text": "The indomitable L.C. Skupien of Retirement Daze recently announced that she had been inspired by another blogger to try and refrain from complaining for a whole month; an admirable endeavour. If anyone were entitled to the odd moan, it would be L.C. She is patience and courage personified.I loathe people who are habitually dissatisfied and feel entitled to share their dreary monologues with me and if I see someone coming whose conversation is bound to turn into a long moan I cross the road to avoid them. And if I can’t avoid them I plead lack of time to get away from them. But what of those of us who indulge in occasional bouts of complaining? What about me? My first reaction to L.C.'s post was to say :\"Really, no more complaining?O dear, I wonder if I could do that.I love raving and ranting and complaining. It lets off steam and afterwards I can get back to admiring the sunny side of life.If I didn’t complain about politicians, greedy people, unkindness, bigots, the weather,  falling over the dog, I’d have a lot of spare time.”Is this a matter of “my complaints are justified”, while \"yours are misguided” and \"his are plainly ridiculous and a great bore”? Is complaining another instance of ‘in the eye of the beholder’?A long time ago, in another place and life, I was a member of a women’s group. We ostensibly met to keep our brains ticking over while being tied to small children and kitchen sinks but that didn’t stop some of us from spending a lot of time at each meeting complaining about husbands. Not me, I was too embarrassed about my then spouse to hint at his manifold shortcomings in public. But others let their feelings out: inappropriate sex, no sex, too much sex; always out, probably with a floozy; overly finicky and a control freak; mean with money, but spending plenty away from the family.  These regular airings of grievances may have been boring, but the women went home and, for a while, the load had lightened. The letting-off-steam kind of complaining.Then there’s the righteous-anger-kind of complaining. Politicians or anyone in authority; bankers; the idle and sex-mad young; immigrant benefit scroungers; the filthy rich/undeserving poor; unmarried mothers after a council flat; deviant same-sex-couples who want to get married/ have children; that chap in his fancy car who just cut me up; the woman at the charity do who never ever stays behind to do the dishes; the teenagers who hang around on street corners doing God-knows-what, drugs I shouldn’t wonder, I should like to get hold of their parents; and on and on, take your pick and complain to your heart’s content.What about going on protest sit-ins or marches? Is protesting about another road cutting through a water meadow, the Iraq war, banker’s bonuses,  the establishment of a gambling/red light district in a city, littering the countryside with wind farms, the destruction of the rain forest, the same as complaining?I have a lot of experience of the complaining-in-advance method. I was absolutely certain that two meetings last week would prove unbearably dull and irritating. “Why would I want to go to a German conversation group. Nobody there is the least bit fluent and they all look to me to find their words for them.” The other meeting was the writers’ group. “They don’t really want to work at it and that silly little man who annoys me with his desperately dull and lifeless readings will bang on about having to give his creativity free rein instead of being shackled to a theme or challenge.” This kind of complaining-in-advance is also known as complaining-from-a-superior-position. In the event both meetings proved constructive. The German group read - haltingly, but enthusiastically - a piece by an author previously unknown to me and the writers’ group showed willing to try setting themes, while the little man kept quiet - without me having threatened to do him harm!Maybe there are two sides to this complaining business, as with every blessed thing on this earth. Voicing dissatisfaction with the status quo - also known as nagging in the case of a frustrated housewife, is not necessarily to be deplored, whereas watching injustice and destruction and doing nothing definitely is. Rolling over and letting bad things happen without getting passionately involved is a cop out, an excuse designed to shirk responsibility.Personally, I am in favour of moaning a little less and doing a bit more of the protesting, and not just for lent."},

{"title": "A Year in the Life of a Lady Gardener - February", "date": "Tuesday 26 February 2013", "text": "There must be many gardening ladies who have been out and about seeing to the jobs which need doing; I have to admit that I worked for exactly one day this month. There is a list of tasks due in February as long as my arm, I didn’t do any of them.  For a few days I simply wasn’t well enough to do anything, the rest of the time it was too cold. The spring flowers which poked their heads above ground in January shrank back again in February. Cornus should have been cut back by now, they’ll have to wait. Herbaceous perennials like hellebores sit in the midst of their browning leaves; too bad. The beautiful bronze leaves of epimedium have shrivelled to an unsightly mess; tough. Etc. etc.Gardener chose to come and fix the fence on the one sunny day we had this month, which meant that I had to go out too. The fact that he’s taken off his winter jacket in the picture means nothing; he works so furiously hard, that he works himself into a lather. Believe me when I say that I was wearing several fleeces and had my woollen hat pulled well over my ears. And still my nose was dripping steadily in the cold air!January’s and February’s storms had smashed parts of the fence to pieces and my neighbour Clive, a grumpy old man who lives in a large, ancient cottage all by himself, with only Willow, his fat old pony for company, had been giving me dirty looks every time the wind tore down another bit of the wooden panels. He’d been propping it up with large planks, and even a metal pole, more or less all winter. I expect he only just managed to stop himself from adding a large sign with an arrow pointing to the damage.Clive is still not happy because Gardener has replaced the panels with pig mesh. “It’s a bit open, isn’t it?\"  he complained. “We’re going to grow shrubs along the fence” . I had told Gardener to calm Clive down, they are both genuine Shropshire men and know how to deal with each other, not like me and Beloved, who are ‘From Off’. It’s up to me to erect a fence and I have every right to choose the kind I want. “Make sure you plant them a foot off the boundary”. Clive had to have the parting shot. He’s alright really, keeps himself entirely to himself. When we moved in he found a gap in his busy schedule of pottering around in the field with Willow, his garden and cottage, to remind us that his neighbourliness went no further than telling me when any plants in my garden encroached on his. “ I like privacy,” he said. “That’s good, so do we,” I replied in very friendly tones - someone ‘From Off’ needs to be careful in these parts.I know I said earlier that I “worked” for a day; truth to tell : I shirked more than worked. I helped Gardener by telling him how to keep his lines straight, dug up a few weeds and stood around planning what to do where. Millie helped with the latter. We also had several cups of tea. Furthermore, I had a very busy time working out who this little fellow was. There had been a flock of bramblings a few days prior, during one of the storms, but they had all disappeared again. Perhaps this one had lost contact with his mates. He sat for ages under the feeders, all puffed up, occasionally picking at the ground; I expect he was catching his breath and it was my duty to stay within reach to repel predators.However, I have promised to open the garden in aid of charity to paying customers at the end of June; Gardener was full of pity for me and my rash decision and just a tad doubtful that, on current showing,  I would be anywhere near ready by then."},
{"title": "Nightwatch", "date": "Saturday 23 February 2013", "text": "Dulle Griet  (Mad Meg) Brueghel, Pieter the ElderTwo-thirty am, on Ward AMU; as always, when I am here, I have tricked the medics: I have taken 2 mg of smuggled-in diazepam as well as the 10mg of temazepam prescribed for me. I have no idea how bad this combination of tranqilizer and sleeping pill is for me but it has allowed me some hours of uneasy, often interrupted, but nevertheless recognisable sleep, a state of being I would otherwise not achieve. The heart monitor above my bed is bleeping regularly, several short bleeps of sharp, even tone interspersed with a number of higher, more urgent, longer notes. These latter tell me that the rate which fluctuates between anything below one hundred beats per minute to up to one hundred and thirty beats has reached the upper rate. l30/pm is not good but still better than 180/pm, a heart rate I have endured on previous hospital stays. The day before I had gone for a deep tissue massage to Jilly-with-the-healing-hands. She went to work on my back with her usual enthusiasm, thus stimulating my adrenal glands into a frenzy of adrenaline production which caused an electrical malfunction. For 99.9% of people  there would be no ill-effects. Not me. I am awkward, or rather, my obstreperous cardiac system is. I lie quietly, listening to the monitor and the noises around me. I am wearing an eye mask, the sort of thing they give you on long-haul night flights, and have stuffed ear plugs into my ears. They never fit properly, only when I keep my fingers on them, pushing them further into the ear opening, do the noises in the room recede. The eye mask is a little uncomfortable but it does the trick of dulling the already dimmed lights to an acceptable level. The noise from my neighbour has woken me. “Go away”, she shouts, “I don’t want to talk to you. You hear me?” It sounds like a command, not a request. Her voice is guttural, riddled with the cancer destroying her lungs.The self-medication has slowed my thoughts, I am too tired to be angry at the disturbance. Floating in semi-sleep on the lonely island of my hospital bed I am directing a vague prayer towards an unspecified omnipotent deity. “Please, back to normal, back to normal, back to normal”, as if  the rhythmic repetition of the phrase could regulate the wild hammering in my chest. I have experienced this malfunction many times in the last five years, but every time I am afraid that this time it might not stop as suddenly as it started, that it might never go back to normal.My neighbour continues to fight old battles. “How did you get in here? I don’t want you, get away from me.” There is implacable hatred in the sound. There is also fear. “What do you want? Get out”, her voice rises in panic. “It’s mine, mine”. And over and over: \"I don’t want to talk to you, go away, you hear me!” She is so angry that her words become an indistinguishable mishmash of gurgling phlegm, spat out in a fury of demented malice. I had seen the woman earlier in the evening when I passed by her bed. She was calm then, a very old, very ill, heavy-bodied relic, toothless mouth wide open, not long from death. Now, at night, dementia has resurrected her old enemy, somebody surely long-dead, but hated and feared still. The gurgling turns to a rattle, she is falling asleep again.A great wave of pity overcomes me, I am swamped by a feeling of tearfulness, a mourning for what is, and a fear of what is to come. My heart aches for the old woman, whose remaining nights on this beautiful earth are filled with the poison of a festering sore, neither forgiven, nor forgotten, never relieved, never healed. In the dead of this hospital night I promise myself that whatever happens, whatever imagined or real ill is done to me or done by me, I will resolve it; I will not let the demons pursue me into the fog of my dissolution.I drift back into an uneasy sleep.In the morning the orderly brings my breakfast. I sit up, swing my legs over the edge of the bed and pull the table towards me. As I am doing this, I glance up at the monitor at the exact moment when, after 50 hours of non-stop pummelling, my heart rhythm returns to normal."},

{"title": "More Culture for a Country Bumpkin", "date": "Wednesday 13 February 2013", "text": "Do you come here often? If so, you know that I am a bit of a culture freak, with theatre visits high on my list of preferences. Going to Stratford-on-Avon from the South Shropshire Hills is no picnic - two hours’ drive both ways being the minimum journey time - but we have this wonderful friend Frank who is an even greater theatre freak and thinks nothing of spending hours on the road for the sake of a performance he wants to attend and he very kindly lets us tag along.This winter my cup of happiness overflowed with three excursions to the Royal Shakespeare Company in a row, apart from several productions transmitted, via satellite, straight from the stage of the National Theatre in London to a local cinema screen.The RSC decided to assemble an ethnically diverse company to present three world classics in a season they named ‘A World Elsewhere’, to look beyond Shakespeare and discover what else was happening around the globe during his lifetime. We have had ‘The Orphan Of Zhao’, the first Chinese play ever to have been translated in the West. It describes events in the ancient past. The story has existed for about 2.500 years in some form or other,  the current play is based on a version first published in 1616, during Shakespeare’s lifetime.Although watching a performance on a cinema screen is better than missing out, there’s nothing like the real thing. In the intimate auditorium of The Swan you can almost touch the performers and their swishing costumes as they enter and leave.We also had Boris Godunov, Pushkin’s play about murder, mayhem and treachery in high places in Russia in the 17th century, gore and dastardly deeds galore; in the end good triumphedover evil, which is only right and proper.The third play, which I only saw last Saturday, was Brecht’s masterpiece 'A Life of Galileo'. Try as I might, I can say nothing flippant about it. Brecht provides us with a 20th century perspective on the conflict between religious dogmatism and scientific evidence in 17th century Italy. I was totally engrossed.  I wanted to commit to memory each line of Brecht’s text as it was spoken only to find that the next line, and each line after that, was as gripping as the first. In the end I was forced to buy the complete script.The story is roughly, that in the year 1609 the light of science shone in a modest house in Padua as Galileo set out to prove that the sun is fixed and the earth is on the move.Having proved it beyond all doubt,  in June 1633 Galileo was forced to bow to the might of the Inquisition and formally abandoned his opinions of the Copernican theory. An apocryphal story contends that the moment Galileo rose from his abjuration he muttered the phrase “and yet it moves”. Galileo spent the rest of his life under house arrest.PS:—In 2000, Pope John Paul II issued a formal apology for all the mistakes committed by some Catholics in the last 2,000 years of the Catholic Church's history, including the trial of Galileo among others."},

Tops.Let’s look at love and marriage in the cold light of statistics: nearly half of all UK marriages end in divorce. Relationships are difficult, even intelligent, confident people who go into them with their eyes open and the best intentions end up in situations which leave them powerless, heartbroken, asking themselves what went wrong. Again.Science knows very little about love. A key insight is that love has three distinct modes or phases: attraction, lust and attachment. Humans are messy, the attraction, lust and attachment phases get blended together. Every loving relationship can be seen as a unique combination of these three modes. They form a ground on top of which the cultural and individual variants of love are built. This is the simple but rather melancholy observation that, when you knock away thousands of years of ritual, poetry, myth and song, love is just another neurobiological process, like sweating.Long-term relationships are problematic for modern humans because we aren’t built for them. We’ve evolved to successfully procreate, not to enjoy deathless romance. During our long hunter-gatherer existence, life expectancy is thought to have been about 30 years. This means that, assuming we coupled off as teenagers, for the great majority of our species’ history, at least half of all relationships would have ended within 15 years. Today, the median length of a marriage is 11 years, which fits surprisingly well with our human ancestors’ 15 years. As we live ever longer, it seems that we are condemned to outlast the possibilities of love.So, the next time you end up fighting over who gets to keep the Homeland DVD box set, blame human evolution. With grateful thanks to great chunks from an article in theguardian weekend 09.02.13."},

{"title": "Candlemas", "date": "Saturday 2 February 2013", "text": "Giovanni Bellini, 1460-1464, Galleria Querini Stampalia, VeniceFebruary has been the month of purification since Roman times;  Februalia was the Roman festival of ritual purification . The festival, which is basically one of Spring washing or cleaning (associated also with the raininess of this time of year) is old, and possibly of Sabine origin. According to Ovid, Februare as a Latin word which refers to means of purification derives from an earlier Etruscan word referring to purging.The Roman month Februarius (\"of Februa,\" whence the English February) is named for the Februa/Februatio festival.  (Excerpts from Wikipedia)February was also the month when the housewife traditionally started her ‘spring cleaning’ of home and hearth;  the days lengthened and showed up dust and grime which remained invisible during the dark months. German folk wisdom  claims that: come New Year the day has grown by a rooster’s step, at Three Kings (Epiphany) by the leap of a deer and a whole hour by Candlemas. On the 2nd of February the Catholic church celebrates ‘St Mary’s Feast of the Candles’, officially the Feast of the Purification and the Presentation of Christ in the Temple.  The aged Simeon prophesied that Jesus would be ‘a light to lighten the Gentiles’; on this day, therefore, lights and candles are blessed at a candle lit service. There are records which show that the custom of blessing the year’s supply of candles was already in existence in the tenth century in the area of the Lower Rhine. A normally dark church was transformed into a sea of light, surely an awe inspiring sight for the peasants of the time. After the service the candles were carried around the church in procession; great care was taken that the flames remained alight, because that meant the year would be a good one for bees. Sacred and household candles were blessed alike; the beekeeper took his burning candle to his hives to thank the bees for providing him with the necessary wax and ask them for a good harvest of honey for the coming year;  the husband, as head of the household, took his candle and dribbled three drops, in the shape of a triangle, into the clothes of each member of the household, making the sign of the cross. This was to protect them from all evil, particularly witchcraft and magic. Another custom was for the father to dribble three drops on to a piece of bread, which he would give his children to eat and show to the animals in the stables.The candlemas candle continued to be of great importance throughout the year; it was lit whenever danger to life and limb, the home, animals and property threatened. It was lit at the birth of new life and at the end of a life, both of which were natural events happening within the family home in those days.Candlemas, like many saints' days, also provided the countryman with weather adages; farmers and shepherds preferred the day to be cold and rough:If Candlemas Day bring snow and rainWinter is gone, and won’t come again.If Candlemas Day be clear and brightWinter will have another flight.Around 1700 a shepherd on the Lower Rhine was said to watch the weather on Candlemas morning with particular attention;  a proverb said that he’d rather see the wolf than the sun in the sheep pen. At least as early as the 1840s, German immigrants in Pennsylvania had introduced the tradition of weather prediction that was associated with the hedgehog (der Igel) in their homeland. Since there were no hedgehogs in the region, the Pennsylvania Germans adopted the indigenous woodchuck (a name derived from an Indian word), aka the groundhog. The town of Punxsutawney, some 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh, has played up the custom over the years and managed to turn itself into the center of the annual Groundhog Day, particularly after the 1993 movie starring Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell. Each year, people gather to see if a groundhog dubbed \"Punxsutawney Phil\" will see his shadow after he emerges from his burrow. If he does, the tradition says there will be six more weeks of winter. (Phil has a rather dismal 39% rate of accuracy for his predictions.)"},
{"title": "A Year In The Life Of A Lady Gardener - January", "date": "Wednesday 30 January 2013", "text": "The terms January and Gardening do not easily sit on the tongue in the same sentence; the mere thought of going out now to do some work makes me want to curl up under a soft blanket with the lights low and a box of chocolates within reach. Looking out of the window is another matter. I might also go and take a photo on carefully selected days. Yet there are many gardeners - me included - who praise the understated beauty of a garden dressed in muted greens and browns on a sparkling cold day. I believe that grasses, phormiums and sedges rimed in delicate frost patterns achieve the pinnacle of their appeal at such times.This January has been a very mixed bag. We had mild days at the beginning of the month when the Chaenomeles speciosa burst into bloom on its sheltered stretch of wall.  The plant is better known as Japonica,  Cydonia or Ornamental Quince; as is the case with many plants botanists and taxonomists frequently decide to rename them when new scientific details about them emerge. A Jasminum nudiflorum clings to the stretch of wall next to the Quince; the two flower side by side, making a most unsuitably colourful display for late December and through January provided there is no snow and ice. Winter jasmine and ornamental quinces flower on leafless stems - hence nudiflorum. Both plants are fully frost hardy and very popular. The jasmine becomes a bit of a nuisance when it’s left unpruned - in March I remove one third of flowering shoots to keep it in trim. The ornamental quince is better behaved because its stems are thick and woody. Tie in as many branches as you have room for and cut back some of the oldest branches in summer.Then came the snow and for a while the garden was covered in a thick layer of white fleece. There’s a whole different kind beauty then which has little to do with gardening. When the snow started to melt Mahonia Japonica (Oregon Grape) came into its own. I grow one large Mahonia J. which has rich wine-red to purple leaves in winter; when partly covered in snow the large leaves look like German Christmas cookies. Most Mahonias are fully frost hardy too, they grow well in shade. I am looking forward to clusters of yellow, sweetly scented flower spikes in February and March. Mahonias don’t need much pruning, I simply cut out unwanted stems in April.Ligustrum Aureum is a very fancy name for the large hedging shrub we all know as Golden Privet. I inherited this bush from the previous owner of the house. Plants have a lot in common with books, I find it very hard to discard either unless they annoy me or don’t earn their keep; the privet is still here after fifteen years. The poor thing hardly ever gets a chance to flower because Gardener and I prune it back to a medium sized ball shape every spring, before its flowering buds form; in summer it sits in a large bed providing a backdrop for more showy plants.However, in winter it lifts a whole corner of the garden out of darkness with its golden leaves; it also provides shelter for birds. So, as shrubs go, it’ll stay.For the moment snow and ice have gone. To my great surprise I found Beloved’s rhubarb beds showing advanced signs of life. The thing to do now is to mulch the beds generously with manure and put terracotta forcing pots over one or two plants. Pale pink early rhubarb is a prized delicacy in the UK. My relationship with rhubarb is barely luke warm, I can just about be persuaded to make a rhubarb crumble if Beloved asks me nicely.The temporary lull in winter weather has brought forth a variety of welcome early flowering herbaceous plants. I will have to go out very soon and cut the foliage from the hellebores which send out the first flower shoots at Christmas, hence the name Christmas Rose, to give the flowers their time in the limelight. The leaves  often get rusty and become very unsightly. New, deeply lobed leaves sprout quickly and will be fully formed by early spring. Hellebores are delightful plants, the large, saucer shaped flowers may be pink, purple or white, depending on variety. I have some varieties which flower later in spring, called Lenten Rose, whose flowers are speckled pink or brownish on cream. Gorgeous.Any small trees or shrubs which leave space between the ground and branches and/or foliage are perfect for underplanting with spring bulbs. This ornamental weeping pear has a succession of snowdrops, grape hyacinths, daffodils and tulips growing round its small trunk. By the time the weeping pear’s drooping silver branches are fully out the flowers will disappear underground again.Eranthis, better known as winter aconite, is another perennial that brings much needed colour to  shadier areas of the garden in winter. It’s a tiny plant, no more than 10-15 cm tall; like snowdrops, it must be transplanted ‘in the green’, the tubers hate drying out. If it likes your garden (many people say that they have no luck with it) it will return year after year, growing en masse like a carpet under the bare branches of deciduous trees. Just as the canopy restarts casting its shade, winter aconites die back and disappear underground.I  recommend that those of you who garden go out and take a closer look at the small wonders braving winter out there; I was amazed at how much life there is. Writing these monthly posts is teaching me that the cycle of life in the garden never really stops and that not only the seasons, but separate fragments within the seasons have their own small deaths and rebirths.Until February."},
{"title": "Blogger’s Drought", "date": "Monday 28 January 2013", "text": "What a lot of blogging mileage there is in weather. Not only here at Friko’s but  on many blogs I visit. It’s weather all the way; it’s got to stop!We’ve had the remains of the snow, now gone. Whenever I point my camera in the general direction of utterly insane Jay she grabs the opportunity to play the fool. So serve her right that I am actually putting her picture up. After the last of the snow we had the flood. Saturday evening Beloved and I very gingerly picked our way to dinner at Sally and Frank’s; drive and field were lethal with a mixture of deep, softening snow, frozen puddles and slippery mud. I was complaining all the way (all of the 250 metres it takes to get to their house) that I really didn’t want to go, that I’d much rather stay safe and warm at home and that people should show consideration for my advanced years and unsteady pins on a foul night like this.  Beloved didn’t take a blind bit of notice. Neither did Sally and Frank when we arrived at the same time as the other guests. The party turned out to be the best antidote for weather induced miseries; how glad I am, that in spite of being a compulsive moaner, I never let it stop me from going out.This was at seven. When we finally managed to drag ourselves away reluctantly at midnight the snow was practically gone and we paddled home. The next morning the snow had turned into a flood.Many appointments have had to be cancelled over the past weeks, not only because of the weather but also  because people have been poorly with the winter bugs that do the rounds at this time of year. When Helen rang this morning to say she had a slot for me, I dropped everything and drove over the border to Wales for an hour’s pampering. I believe I have my priorities just right. This is me under a mask. I always thought masks were white and chalky, but then I’ve never had my picture taken on the couch, mid-treament, before.Sorry about another weather post, like I said, it has to stop, and it will, just as soon as I can think of something a little more interesting. How do you feel about a list of quotations?"},
{"title": "O Joy !", "date": "Wednesday 23 January 2013", "text": "You might ask what’s changed since yesterday : weatherwise it’s all the same. In fact we’ve had more snow today and the going is getting tougher. But, and it’s a major BUT,  there’s been contact with the outside world. The postman called for the first time since last Thursday, bringing me some of the books I ordered last week. He struggled up the 200 metres of the drive on foot (we’ve never actually measured it, but 200 m seems to be the consensus in this house). The podiatrist came too. we spent more time chatting about weather conditions than anything else. She visits many houses in this very rural area and tells a tale or two about the average English person’s fascination with all things weather related. It seems I am an apt pupil.Comfort food brought pleasure too, mashed potatoes with Cumberland sausages and frozen peas. An excellent lunch, quick and easy to prepare, with enough zing in the sausages to tickle the tastebuds.The groceries were delivered, which is a major worry off my mind; we were down to the last three portions of Millie’s food, not a comfortable thought.The lady driver helped us transport the delivery to the house from the road. She too didn’t want to risk the drive but very kindly took hold of a large and heavy plastic box and pulled it up by means of stout string Beloved had tied round the rim.I was pushing the wheelbarrow and Beloved carried plastic bags filled with lighter stuff.A lot of dissatisfaction with the status quo - any status quo - for me derives from lack of control over daily life. Frustration overwhelms me and suddenly it feels like the world is 'ganging up on me’. Not a rational reaction at all, I know.Beloved was becoming quite depressed himself when he saw me turning listless so we had a rummage in the wine racks and he came up with two very elderly bottles, the remnants of a once proud collection. There are other single examples of the noble vintner’s art left from years gone by, but these two will do to begin with. A Chateau des Graviers, cru artisan Margaux from 1999 and a Hering Gewuerztraminer grand cru Kirchberg de Barr from 2002. Both bottles are covered in dust and cobwebs. When we bought them and their fellows they probably cost only half of what they would go for now. We kept them for a special occasion and more or less forgot about them. I am very glad the weather turned me into a moaning minnie.What I need now is for the snow to settle in for the duration, or at least for as long as there are bottles remaining which need urgent attention. Cheers!"},

Marooned in the house by snow and ice, free to read and write - or as some people might say: do nothing - without let or hindrance, the endless hours of enforced leisure are becoming an irritant. Normally, pleasurable hours of self indulgence are a gift, a time to be treasured. Many of us spend our lives as slaves to clocks,  merciless accountants who drive us on, second by second, taskmasters holding the whip. Who has not wanted to manipulate time, stop it, slow it down or speed it up. We say that time marches on, regardless of our needs. There are many phrases that include ‘time', most of them too clichéd to repeat here, so I won’t. Besides, searching the internet for lists does not fall within this blog’s aim in life. But what to do? What to do? My book has lost its attraction, it’s too dark to watch the birds from the window, I have caught up with telephone and email debts, dinner has been eaten and cleared away, I can’t knit, paint or make music. Only the TV is left as a last resort.But things are bound to get better, because time heals all, and we must take it one day at a time.

{"title": "The End Of Civilisation As We Know It.", "date": "Sunday 20 January 2013", "text": "The reason? It’s winter! Well I never, who’d have thought it. I’d love to blame someone else but I can’t, not really. Individuals as well as the authorities get it wrong. In this country, every year again we are shocked that winter inevitably brings snow and ice. When it dawns on us that that is what’s happened, we talk of nothing else; earthquakes? tsunamis? fires caused by horrendous heat waves? Forget them, we are snowbound! Planes are grounded, airports iced up, the railways come to a shuddering halt because signal boxes freeze and a few inches of snow suffocate the road system, including the motorways.Once again we are well and truly snowed in, the drive is blocked and has become invisible, the car is imprisoned in the garage and neither postman nor delivery vans can get to the house. Every year I plan to get private gritters out to clear the drive and free the courtyard round the house from snow. Then spring comes and I forget. Or how about getting winter tyres for the car, as drivers are obliged to do in Germany. Short of driving a gas guzzling, environment polluting, unnecessary SUV, that would surely solve quite a few transport problems.  £500 for a set of winter tyres? That seems a bit steep when you are splashing through deep puddles the rest of the year.So here we are again, cut off and impatiently awaiting a van load of groceries from the supermarket, a postman’s bag full of pills from the health food suppliers and several parcels of books from amazon uk and amazon de.Millie has appointments for x-rays and  a couple of small operations to remove some unexplained lumps and wartlike protuberances on Tuesday. It would take a miracle to get her to the vets and back again. I am hoping that these lumps are nothing more than common fat lumps and don’t need immediate attention.Millie and her chums love the snow; what is it with dogs and children and extreme weather? While I trudge behind her with a very bad grace, cautiously probing the ground in front of me with aunt Josephine’s spiked walking stick for holes or icy patches, she races down the bank towards children and dogs shrieking and barking for joy, all in a tumble of sleds and arms and legs, dogs' tails wagging madly and children’s faces glowing with healthy exuberance. The din is heard in the next valley. So far nobody has landed in the river.Talking of the river, I wonder if that could be used for transport? It’s back in its bed and running freely,"},

So what could be better than coming home to a hot cup of tea, some left-over Christmas biscuits and a pile of poetry books. Sheer bliss.The above is offered as a not very challenging small stone for the Mindful Writing Challenge which has reminded me to lay something else before you, namely the question of publishing other people’s poetry on a blog. Lots of us do it. Recently two friends, one of whom reads my poetry blog, warned me that I am quite probably in breach of copyright doing so, since when I stopped posting. I love poetry, frequently read it and enjoy introducing new and well-known poets to other bloggers.  Have any of you who reproduce poetry on your blogs ever had any officially adverse reaction? Lots of poetry is freely available on the net but what about poetry taken from anthologies or collected works?I shall start publishing again, in fact, right now. My poetry blog is such a modest affair, hardly read, with very few comments, that I can’t see it causing offence, even if I am breaking copyright laws at times.Any thoughts on the matter?"},
{"title": "Why Can’t (Some) Humans Be More Like A Dog?", "date": "Thursday 10 January 2013", "text": "Some may be, of course; I can only speak for those I know, like me and Beloved.Dogs make friends at a wag of the tail and a sniff at the backside. The result: intimate friendship for life.   Millie climbs up the hill of the castle bailey and plays look-out on all sides of the flat hill top, ears cocked, tail stretched out expectantly and body poised for a run; all for the sake of a friendly romp. She all but gives a shrill whistle of joy when she spies a mate and instantly hurtles down the bank in an ecstasy of anticipation fulfilled.In spite of having mentioned in a recent post that there were few invitations during the festive season, things have changed again; we’ve already had three during the first two weeks of January. You’d think I’d be grateful and feel appreciated. Up to a point  I do but, sadly, it is in my nature to examine a good thing first and put up with it only after an ungracious grumble.Beloved and I have the best conversations over breakfast. After the third invitation plopped on to the mat, this is how we dealt with it.\"Oh dear, another drinks/dinner party; seems everybody is catching up after Christmas.\"\"Really? Who is it?\" Beloved’s reply, non-committal, is slightly less ungracious than my remark.\"I think that the more you meet some people the less you have to say to them, so why bother? Why make the effort; why tire yourself out with aimless small talk? I am sure I’ve said everything I have to say many times already and I could certainly tell you what Joe Bloggs is going to say before he opens his mouth.\"\"That’s a little harsh, don’t you think? Man is surely a gregarious animal by nature who seeks the company of others; there is also comfort in familiarity. Just look at a basket of puppies. They tumble and romp and cuddle up together for warmth and companionship and play, getting to know each other and their reactions intimately. They never get tired of each other.\"A basket full of puppies as an analogy for the behaviour of humans? Sure, why not? I can live with that.\"Of course, I know how you feel,\" Beloved continued, \"I don’t need to tell you that I feel just the same. But just think of all the lovely gossip you’d miss if you never saw anyone.\"The prospect of gossip cheered me up.\"Okay, I’ll accept, shall I?\" Not that I have the option to turn the invitation down. That would not only be  unkind but also extremely rude. Much better to think of a pressing reason for non-attendance nearer the time, if necessary.I have never in all my life had an intimate friend; I wouldn’t know how to go about creating such a relationship. An only child, with parents who miserly, yet proudly “kept themselves to themselves”, I was never properly socialised, much like my darling Benno-boy, who ignored all other dogs after a very cursory sniff. He had spent his formative years (do dogs have formative years?) shut up all day long in a small apartment and was only taken out early mornings and late evenings, until he came to us. It was too late to retrain him, as it was too late to retrain myself after a lonely childhood, a restless and destructive first marriage during which permanent embarrassment precluded close contact with anyone outside the family. And then I go and marry another hermit! Who said, when I bemoaned my lack of a soul mate: “Don’t be silly. What are we, you and me, if not soul mates.” He’s right, of course. He usually is.Sometimes we get together for a meal or a drink with people who are a joy to be with, although we are by no means on close terms. The best occasions are those when stimulating conversations, totally free ranging, natural and uninhibited, involving every member of the group, leave you refreshed and animated and wanting more. I am not so fond of conversations with people whose superior intellect leaves you drained. You’ve paddled so hard to keep up - that is if they take breath long enough for you to add your tuppence' worth; people of superior intellect are fully aware of their superiority and dislike anyone else having an opinion - that, at the end of the evening, you are exhausted from the sheer effort to show yourself equal to the task.Millie and her chums race and play-fight each other until they are breathless and their legs give under them, only to get up and start the whole procedure again after they’ve got their second breath. Social life on a grand scale! They don’t ask questions about pedigree, education, toilet habits or social standing of their owners. They just get on with it and each takes from each what they have to offer and give back in full measure.  Wouldn’t that be great for humans too?books by authors put aside as a special treat. Last book in a series, last book written: Sebald, Sayers, Larsson, etc. (think of a few more) then explain why.Lie specially nice bits on the plate, left to last."},

All it needed to expose them was to brush off last autumn’s leaves. I love their botanical name which is ‘Galanthos’, milk flower, from the Greek ‘gala’ (milk) and anthos (flower). Very soon now they will appear all over the garden and outside it too; I have been spreading the bulbs around for years. Their sweet, small, pure white bell shaped flowers gladden the heart and make me believe that spring must come."},
{"title": "A New Year’s Wish ", "date": "Tuesday 1 January 2013", "text": "Dear Friends,After weeks of rain I woke up this morning, the first of the new year, to a very fierce sun streaming through the curtains, the kind of sun which promises much but rarely lasts. Whether it does or doesn’t shall not be my greatest concern. Here is my first wish: I will enjoy it while it lasts.After weeks of compulsive excess, overeating, drinking more than is advisable, grabbing another chocolate and another biscuit, weeks of large meals, just because ‘tradition’ demands it, the time has come to slow down, taste the small pleasures of an occasional chocolate, savour a glass of wine and stop eating before I feel bloated and uncomfortable. My second wish: I will rediscover moderation.The current festive season brought with it fewer social gatherings than ever before. There was a time when I would have felt slighted, when not being part of the social whirl would have been keenly felt; not this year. Whatever the reason for fewer invitations, I have not missed the overcrowded rooms, the noise and sheer boredom of chitchat and small talk endlessly repeated. For my third wish I hope to remember to appreciate true friendship instead of empty social obligations.These days my life is like a clear and peaceful stream; it wasn’t always like that and there were times when I was in danger of being swept away by troubled waters and the turmoil of battle; I thank providence for the great change in my fortunes and sincerely wish that I remind myself of the hard times whenever I feel tempted to bewail the uniformity of life as it is.Having been a little 'under the weather' both metaphorically and physically, and therefore confined to my four walls for most of the time, with the exception of quick dashes out for Millie’s sake, my mood has been less than sunny; irritation, annoyance and depression have occasionally been part of the general atmosphere. Beloved, being nearest  in the line of fire, bore the brunt of my foul temper. We always made up, of course, but my fifth wish is to learn to curb my temper and certainly not lash out at the one person without whom my life would be a very sad affair.Everyday life is a mixed business, we cannot have everything we want and it behoves us to be satisfied with what we have and accept what we cannot change. I’ve tried moaning and complaining, it made not a jot of difference. Fate turns the wheel whether we laugh or cry; besides, I would get bored with endless sunshine and a permanent full moon in the sky. We none of us know what fate has in store for us, but one thing is certain, the curtain must and will come down. My last wish is therefore to live every day in the full awareness of the finality of existence, take each day’s lesson to the next, take pleasure when and where it’s offered, and accept that even the rain has a rightful place in the scheme of things.Happy New Year"},

{"title": "It’s Bedlam In There,", "date": "Wednesday 12 December 2012", "text": "the dun coloured woman muttered crossly, pointing over her shoulder to the Ludlow Speciality Food Centre. Our paths very briefly crossed in the car park, as I was allowing Millie to stretch her legs on the broad grass verges and the mouselike creature was searching for her car. Everything about her was colourless, from her hair to her shoes, even her canvas shopping bag, which held a small lump of something in the bottom, was grey.  When she stopped at a small red car I was most surprised. Admittedly, the car was covered in mud, but so is mine; it goes with country living. As I was moving off she volunteered the remark: “I don’t go much for Christmas.” Who’d have guessed?We’d already been inside the large and very expensive indoor market and given it up as a bad job. As soon as Millie had done her duty we were going to go on to Ludlow. It was Saturday, the worst shopping day of the week, but a fierce and persistent chest infection had lost us a whole week of preparations and it was high time we caught up. The Aldi parking lot wasn’t too bad, we quickly found a space; however, they are the nasty kind of supermarket who have cameras installed that check you in and out, and as I had already fallen foul of them on a previous occasion, being done for a £40 parking fine, we drove on into the town centre. Bedlam here too. After a ten minute stop in a ‘loading-and-unloading-only-bay’, with Beloved staying in the car while I raced to collect a few pre-ordered items, we saw an actual, honest-to-goodness free parking space for disabled badge holders. Beloved has one of those because of his poor eyesight; that slot was ours, we would grab it or die in the attempt. Beloved got out, rushed - well, tottered - down and across the road, and planted himself in the space, furiously waving his stick at all comers, while I manoeuvred myself into a position from which to access it. We should have tied Millie into the slot; I am certain there are drivers who would gladly kill an elderly man for a parking slot on a Saturday morning before Christmas, whereas surely nobody would run down a defenceless dog. They were selling Christmas trees in the market; another couple was looking at the same time. I saw one I liked and stood it up in its pot. “Actually,” the chap said, “we were just debating whether we should have that one you are holding.” Debating?  Well, wait while I fetch you a chair to make your debate more comfortable. What the man was really saying was 'We’ve had our eye on that tree but we’re still dithering over the purchase and  please do not take it away from us’.  In my thirty years in the UK I’ve learned to decipher the small print in-between the spoken words and although I am often tempted to make an ordinary Englishman (including mine) come to the point, I usually can’t be bothered. I chose the next tree along,  pretty much an exact replica of the first one. Time to get it into the car, not an easy undertaking. All the shopping was repacked and went into the back with poor Millie, who simply budged up and never said a word of complaint. The small tree sat on the back seat, leaning forward, obscuring my view of the rear window. But we had succeeded in getting it into the car, with the help of the stallholder.We were hungry by now and decided to stop off at a roadside eating place on the way home. This too was packed. We asked to join a couple whose table had two spare seats, not something one usually does; Beloved leaves that sort of thing to me, I wanted food and I wanted to sit down and eat it and there were two spare seats - what’s the problem? The couple was friendly enough and even smiled their  willingness to share the table. No sooner had I sat down when there was an almighty crash behind me and cups and saucers, jugs, teapots including contents, came flying past me and shattered immediately to the left of me, hot water and tea forming a puddle around my shoes. Like a pilot who just manages to avoid the village and crash lands his plane in the field outside instead, the young man carrying the tray had the presence of mind to aim for the gap between two tables when he took the flying leap that turned his load into a potential weapon of mass destruction.Did I say it’s bedlam out there? We came home and in the evening, for the first time ever,  I sat down at my computer and ordered a whole month’s worth of groceries from an online supermarket, to be delivered to my door at my convenience. We will still have to go into town for a few special items, but we’ll choose time and place very carefully indeed."},
{"title": "On Black Hill ", "date": "Tuesday 4 December 2012", "text": "Between the rains, the floods and the frosts we had one beautiful day a couple of weeks ago and Millie and I drove up to Black Hill, just above Valley’s End. The Hill itself is nothing much, the usual Forestry Commission plantations of conifers, inhabited only by birds and animals, and otherwise used only by walkers, with or without dogs. On its lower slopes,  farmers in flat caps, on ancient tractors, round up sheep and till their fields. It is a very old landscape, hardly changed over the centuries, with stone-age burial mounds dotted about.This is the landscape where the novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin wrote the first chapters of his book On the Black Hill, a tale about twin brothers, living and farming in the Welsh Marches. It is a wonderful novel, spanning eighty years of hard work and life in a small rural community, far removed from the wonders of towns and cities. On The Black Hill was Chatwin’s deepest and darkest book (he won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for it in 1982), which was made into a film of the same name in 1987.  Chatwin died of AIDS in 1989.Three Scots Pines guard a pre-historic burial mound.Black Hill is surrounded by lonely fields which lose themselves into the blue distance.This is my contribution to Our World Tuesday.If you click on the link you will find wonderful entries from bloggersfrom all over the world."},
{"title": "Not All Charitable Doings Do You Good.", "date": "Sunday 2 December 2012", "text": "‘This month keep thy body and head from cold; let they Kitchen be thy Apothecary, warm clothing thy Nurse, merry company thy Keepers, and good hospitality thine Exercise  -  such is the advice given by Neve’s Almanac of 1633.My advice is:Do not go out on a cold wet evening to attend a supposedly fun event at a village hall, where several people of mixed ages, male and female, who should know better, perform in front of a crowded audience, many of whom have sniffles and snuffles. If the evening’s entertainment is of the home-made variety, i.e, amateur  acts impersonating famous singers, dancers and comedians, it won’t be worth the effort. I promise you, you’d be better off sitting at home, a dog curled up at your feet, a warm husband snoring in his chair by your side. Or vice versa, a snoring dog in the husband’s chair and a husband curled up on the rug at your feet, whichever way you arrange these matters in your household. You may be promised a bowl of tasty soup and a table boasting a huge variety of puddings (English housewives do puddings of the stodgy kind rather well and with great enthusiasm), even that won’t make up for the deficiency of some of the ‘tribute’ acts. ‘A’ for effort, yes, in most cases, and two of them were actually quite good as these things go, although music and performance didn’t always coincide and  one act actually had a crib sheet for the words. “You don’t come to these things for the quality of the entertainment”, somebody said, “you come to support the event, particularly when it’s in a good cause.”  Quite so.But if this support leaves you with a head and chest cold, which lasts for a whole week and makes no effort to leave you, and  stops you from doing things you enjoy, just send the organisers the money you would have spent making yourself ill.And if somebody says “umbrellas are for wimps’ in your hearing, ignore them."},

{"title": "A Year in the Life of a Lady Gardener - November", "date": "Monday 26 November 2012", "text": "Every morning I wake up and the world is a little darker. The view beyond the window is gloomy, not at all likely to entice me to step outside and see to garden chores. In fact, I have done very little since the beginning of the month, when I pruned the rose borders, cutting out scores of sprays in bud, leaving only a very few blooms which were fully out, in sheltered spaces. It always saddens me when I have to cut out hundreds of buds, but there’s no point leaving them. Trying to produce flowers in the cold season weakens the bushes and the harsh winds raking the garden at this time of year rock their roots. I have lost roses because I couldn’t bring myself to prune their luxuriant growth - as I thought at the time - now I know better. These will be finished soon, their leaves are tatty and the flower heads look better in this photo than in real life.I have said before that every garden should have plants which die beautifully, you might say, mortality planned for and designed to please.Structure is very important; a garden without good bones is as unattractive as a human pudding face.There are very few flowers in late autumn and winter; but there are flowering shrubs like the wonderfully scented winter honeysuckle and sweet box. Viburnums are good too, fragrant Viburnum bodnantense flowers throughout winter into spring. No garden of any size should be without at least one.And then there are the evergreens. At any other time of year they can be a little dour and heavy-lidded. They are best added to the garden with a light touch. Many people are not fond of the variegated varieties, but I have elaeagnus, euonymous and junipers, as well as a very few strategically placed conifersBut my favourites are the grasses, tall ones and short ones, golden, red, or purple ones. They all die back beautifully and provide a wonderful rustling sound in the wind.This tall miscanthus sounds like waves on the seashore and I wouldn’t dream of cutting back the stall, swaying stems, which deepen from bright green to metallic grey and pale straw during their life and death.Yellow, red, pink, purple and pale lemon coloured dogwoods also brighten my view from the kitchen window. The leaves take on very attractive colours during autumn but are short-lived, leaving these vibrantly hued stems behind. Come dreary January, I cut  some and bring them into the house; they last for weeks and add colour once the Christmas glitter has been discarded.Upright phormiums from New Zealand add structure to a sodden flower bed. Before the onset of real winter I tie the leaves together low. Phormiums are fairly hardy but rain can get into their centres and when the water freezes it can kill the plant.Some varieties are hardier than others, it helps to find out which are suitable for your climate.There are many other plants which can give life to the garden in winter. Think of berries for the birds, crab apples, coloured and/or peeling  bark on trees, and thick, variegated holly bushes - or hedges - which provide shelter for birds and insects. I have a gigantic stump of a dead sycamore along the drive, totally smothered by ivy, with a huge climbing rose clinging on too, which allows a vast range of life to overwinter and gives me something to look at when all else seems dead."},
{"title": "Poetry, Plagiarists and Literary Truisms.", "date": "Thursday 22 November 2012", "text": "What better occupation on a filthy day like today (Thanksgiving for my US friends, but a very ordinary, very wet, very blowy day here in the Marches) than to sit in my cosy study, surrounded by piles of women’s poetry anthologies, current and from long ago, looking for a couple of poems for tomorrow’s meeting of the poetry group. Although I have four weeks to do so from one meeting to the next, and although I read poetry most days, I always delay the search until the very last minute.So, tomorrow’s subject is women’s poetry, and I have just come across the lines “Laugh and the world laughs with you, Weep and you weep alone.” Having always thought that there were no further lines, that that was it, and that these lines probably originated with some hoary old chap, much given to trite aphorisms (aphorism: a tersely phrased statement of a truth or opinion), I decided to follow my nose and find out.Far from it! Ella Wheeler Wilcox (1850-1919), was neither hoary nor a chap, but a farmer’s daughter from Wisconsin, a bonny lass, who wrote the poem after she had met a women on a train who was dressed in mourning and weeping pitifully. Ella herself was on her way to attend the governor’s inaugural ball in Madison, Wis.,  a highly celebratory affair.She sent the poem to the Sun and received $5 for her effort. In May, 1883, \"Solitude\" appeared in Miss Wheeler's book Poems of Passion. While most of the book was second-rate verse, it received much attention from the press, because readers assumed that Miss Wheeler, a single woman, had herself experienced all that she had written about. Consequently, she and her book were called \"indecent,\" \"shocking,\" and \"disgraceful.”Naturally, this condemnation ensured that the book became a financial  success.Ella Wheeler married Robert Marius Wilcox and prepared to live a blamelessly domestic life, without further notoriety. Had it not been for the audacious theft of her poem by the author John A. Joyce, that’s how it would have ended. Joyce stole her poem, word for word, and passed it off as his own. Ella challenged him to prove that she had not written it, but Joyce refused and even had the first two lines of ‘Solitude’ emblazoned on his tombstone.Whichever one of them wrote it - and I vote for Ella, the story is just too delicious - here it is:SolitudeLaugh, and the world laughs with you;Weep, and you weep alone.For the sad old earth must borrow it's mirth,But has trouble enough of its own.Sing, and the hills will answer;Sigh, it is lost on the air.The echoes bound to a joyful sound,But shrink from voicing care.Rejoice, and men will seek you;Grieve, and they turn and go.They want full measure of all your pleasure,But they do not need your woe.Be glad, and your friends are many;Be sad, and you lose them all.There are none to decline your nectared wine,But alone you must drink life's gall.Feast, and your halls are crowded;Fast, and the world goes by.Succeed and give, and it helps you live,But no man can help you die.There is room in the halls of pleasureFor a long and lordly train,But one by one we must all file onThrough the narrow aisles of pain.The two lines \"There are none to decline your nectared wine,But alone you must drink life's gall” would make an excellent summary of Shakespeare’s Timon of Athens, not the most riveting of the Bard’s plays, which took a lot longer to sit through than a quick read-through of Ella’s, ahem, masterpiece."},
{"title": "Charitable Doings", "date": "Tuesday 20 November 2012", "text": "Valley’s End practises a form of charity which is certainly not cold, and only stone-cold-sober when the Methodists arrange it. Before we came here I used to think of charity in the bleak terms of a Dickens novel, or worse, as described by Albert Camus in 'The Fall’, when he said “too many people have decided to do without generosity in order to practise charity”. Charity in Valley’s End is Fun; harmless Fun (note the capital F), the sort that does nobody any damage except that too much Fun might cause  reputations to get shredded temporarily. Sometimes it’s worthy, sometimes it’s earnest,  sometimes somebody wags a moralistic finger in your face, but basically, when people get together in the name of a good cause, they always remember that laughter, a glass of wine,  a bit of jollity, produce a bigger haul of pennies in the tin than a straight demand for cash.We’ve just had three different fundraisers, thehighlight being the Fiesta Espanola.The Spanish class, which is taught by Jay,a former teacher living in the village,decided to make up for theirso far only middling success in learning thelanguage by exposing their not inconsiderablethespian and musical talents, not to mention chutzpah, to a large assembly in the Church Hall.The money raised was to go towards badlyneeded structural repairs for St George’s Church.My table did its very best to make a realdifference by buying as many bottles of wine asfive of us could safely drink in two-and-a-half hours of entertainment, without ending up under it.Hence the shredded reputation.The evening kicked off with an initialwine-tasting, half a glass each - a craftywheeze if ever there was one -  plenty of tapas,and Spanish songs.Singing in a foreign language allows the singerto gloss over mispronunciations and the moreenthusiastic the singing, the easier it gets.Wine continued to play a major role throughout theevening; considering that this was the Church Hallthe whole thing was quite disgraceful. I can’t think whatthe vicar was doing allowing such levity as a Porron drinking competition. The participants were furnished with a large towel to drape over their shoulders in case of spillage, of which there was plenty. The winner was the one whose towel didn’t need wringing out at the end.Ruth, ever the mainstay of any theatrical event in Valley’sEnd, took over the role of Basil in the Spanishversion of Fawlty Towers, namely ‘Torres Basilianas’which interrupted the singing, probably to stop theaudience getting wholly out of hand. By now we were all singing lustily, even those of us who speak not a word of Spanish.I believe the grand total of £900 was raised.That should stop a few bricks falling on thecongregation’s head."},

The black speck half-way up the left hand side, that’s her, waiting for me to open a field gate.For all of you who expressed admiration for the beautiful English countryside on my doorstep, let me tell you that this is a very familiar scene too.These hills are closer to Valley’s End than yesterday’s, but in fine weather the view would have been very similar to those a mile up the valley. There’s a lot of this throughout the winter. When fog descends, it tends to stay, unless a sharp wind blows it away or a generous helping of rain flushes it down the river."},

The opposite side of the valley was barely visible in the grey drizzle, I’d sent Millie out into the garden and she was back, lying under the kitchen table. Since her advent I have to get up an hour earlier (yes, that’s dedication for you). This gives me an extra dose of reading free magazines and newspaper supplements over my tea and muesli before Beloved shuffles in.“Morning, lovely people”. The dog is always included in the greeting; Beloved gives my shoulder a squeeze or sometimes a quick kiss on the top of my head as he goes past me to his end of the kitchen table. He sits with his back to the window, giving me the view of the garden, like a true gentleman.“Morning darling, did you sleep well?” The dog doesn’t answer, she thumps her tail instead. “Yes, thank you”, or “No, bloody awful”, depending on the night before. “And you?\"For a while we are silent, I continue to leaf through the pages of my magazine. It’s not often that an article grabs my attention. Why am I reading this rubbish? By the time I’ll have closed the thing I’ll have forgotten every word I read. I look up to see Beloved’s head low over his breakfast, eyes vacantly staring into the middle distance. He feels my gaze on him.“For a moment I was wondering whether you were awake or asleep”.“I wonder that myself, sometimes”, he says, thoughtfully. “My old friend Johnny Denman frequently said 'Life is but a waking dream’, which is something that a man called Gurdjieff apparently said. “I don’t think Johnny knew anything else about him. He must have read it somewhere.”Beloved has my attention, this is better than the stupid magazine. ‘Gurdjieff’? I’ve heard the name.”“Yes, me too. I’ve probably read something by him. Wasn’t he some Eastern European mystic in the 20s or 30s? There were quite a few of them around during the early 20th century. I read a lot of stuff as a boy that I didn’t understand. Mysticism, theosophy, spirituality.\"Not to be outdone, I dredge up a name from the long distant past. “Wasn’t there a Mme Blavatsky? I seem to remember having read of her as an esotericist? This sort of stuff was resurrected during the flower-power 60s and 70s, I recall.”We try to unearth a few snippets of information from memory, without success. We could give up and start the day. As I rise to put my bowl and cup away, I idly speculate that it would be more productive to have the sort of conversation that goes somewhere. At least I’d get some blogging fodder that way.“Oh, I don’t know,” Beloved says, “you could say what my old friend Arnold Newnham used to say. He had a lovely turn of phrase.”“Oh yes, what’s that?”‘People open their mouths to emit sound’."},
{"title": "A Family Idyll", "date": "Friday 9 November 2012", "text": "Some weeks are just so good.Unfortunately, they are the weeks when life gets in the way of blogging.Weather doesn’t come into it,  neither do minor concerns like household jobs, a routine visit to the doctor’s surgery, hair appointments or shopping trips, all of which featured in my diary.But theatre visits are most definitely among my reasons for happiness. This is the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-on-Avon. Although The Merry Wives of Windsor is a bit of a potboiler, and we have seen the play before, this was my first visit to the newly rebuilt theatre.   I’ll never tire of Shakespeare and a visit to the RSC is always worth the two+ hour drive, particularly, when someone else is doing the driving.  (Thanks, Frank.)But  must the cafeteria and the bar really charge such extortionate prices for a sandwich and a drink?Walkies to introduce Millie to the scenery were part of the programme too, of course.She’s now had a full week with us, has settled in nicely and shown herself to be a well-behaved and sweet-natured member of the clan. When somebody asks after her breed, we say ‘labradollie’, which is feminine and describes her perfectly. We think she approves of her new outlook on life and the empire to go with it. She has also taken to gardener, which she made clear when she helped him with raking leaves into a crackling heap.She has explored Valley’s End and the hills and woods around us and was not put off from leading me on for hours in spite of drizzle and rain, mist and fog, and squelchy, slippery mud underfoot more or less everywhere we went. Beloved and I must have been insane when we took her on just before the onset of winter. What’s more, my feet are crippled, even my callouses now have callouses. (Come on, Sharla, where are you?) I haven’t walked like this for a year. In spite of her stumpy legs Millie is a tireless rambler.And yet more culture:another theatre treat was a performance of Shakespeare’s ‘Timon of Athens’, this time courtesy of ‘Arts Alive’ bringing the National Theatre to a Village Hall near you and me. We have seen other plays this way; if you are a theatre lover and your local cinema offers you the chance, I would say these screenings are well worth attending. The cameras are focused directly on the stage and the actors, which means that even people with dodgy eyesight won’t miss a twitch, a scowl or a love-lorn sigh. Sitting in the auditorium I don’t always see the expression on the performers’ faces. National Theatre Live is the National Theatre of Great Britain’s groundbreaking project to broadcast the best of British theatre from the stage to local cinemas around the world. Each performance is filmed in high definition and broadcast via satellite to over 500 venues in more than 20 countries. (From the NTL’s website)Today was the first full day at home for over a week; I decided to do some cooking and came up with some smoked salmon mousse made out of off-cuts which had been languishing in the freezer for months and this very tasty chicken casserole with peppers, courgettes, carrots, green beans and celery.I find cooking and spending an hour or two at the kitchen table and the Aga very therapeutic, Beloved helps with the vegetables and he takes care of the dishes; Millie assisted by hoovering up any dropped bits."},
{"title": "Meet Millie, Everybody.", "date": "Saturday 3 November 2012", "text": "She also answers to Mills, Millimena, Belly and Puss.She arrived on November 1st, and has already run me ragged.I am totally exhausted.Millie is a seven-and-a-half year old black labrador/Welsh collie cross,who behaves like a seven-and-a-half months old pup.She has a white chin and neck, bat wing ears, a permanently wagging tail,stumpy legs (compared to Benno)and needs to lose 2-3 kg weight.But not yet.First we must settle in.Did I say bat wing ears?And what about that big belly? Millimena, bless her, will never win ‘Most Beautiful Dog in Show’,but that’s only because judges don’t award points for a big heart and sweet nature,both of which she most definitely has. Millie insists on sleeping in my room.Did I hear somebody say: \"Be firm, start as you mean to go on?”For how long can you listen to pitiful whimpersand delicate scratches on the kitchen door, noises which reach you through closed doors, a stairwelland thick carpets; noises that cut youlike red hot knives.Ah well, Benno slept upstairs for years too.“She fell for it”“Let’s see what else I can get away with”.This picture is rather misleading.She is probably working out where else she would like to walk her new mistress.We have already been out for early morning walks round the castle had romps in the garden which included gardener, who very kindly threw sticks,afternoon walks in the fields,and a wonderful, exhilarating game of tag and run with new four-legged friends.The fact that this adventure happened to be in the middle of a hail stormdidn’t worry Millie at all.You can see her obvious delight at her new freedom, the wide open spaces,the water-logged meadows for splashing in,the river for hunting,the stiles to jump,and the new friends to sniff.She completely disgraced herself at the Vet’s where she was totally out of control; four other dogs were waiting for attention and she needed to greet them all. She also needed to greet all the veterinary nurses, the receptionists, the vets, and the cats in their baskets, dragging me, apologising madly, behind her on the lead. Luckily, everybody made allowances for her great excitement. I told her quite firmly that she was only with me 'on approval’ and that she’d be sent  back to the shelter if she didn’t behave, whereupon a general cry of “oh no, how sad, you can’t possibly” went up and I had to backtrack and promise to keep her. The Vet pronounced her reasonably fit but overweight, with just a little adjustment needed to her general condition. Next Wednesday she is going for a bath and brush up, we’ll see how kindly she takes to that. I have to admit that she is just a bit smelly and her coat could certainly do with some attention.As for the various names she has? Well, Millie is her original name, which we have decided to keep. Belly, because I forget and call her Benno - halfway from Benno to Millie is Belly; this also suits her current shape. And Puss? That’s Beloved’s fault. How he comes to call her that, I have no idea, I hope he realises that he now has another dog in his household and that Millie is absolutely not a cat."},
{"title": "The NHS - Who’s Complaining? Not Me.", "date": "Monday 29 October 2012", "text": "\"It’s not even eight o’clock yet and I’ve already told you the story of my life.” The young woman sitting on the edge of her bed had indeed been chatting about her life for a good long while.Hospital days start early; at five a.m. the night shift comes clattering in to check and record vital signs before they hand over to the early morning shift. If you’ve been able to get any sleep at all you are lucky; most of the time there are night admissions, which means that there is a constant flow of medical staff with their apparatus, their loud voices and question and answer games. This you can forgive, we all want attention when we are poorly; what is far more annoying is that the so-called modern NHS requires reams of form filling which is nothing to do with medical matters. In the middle of the night even Job might lose his rag.“Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?” An assenting grunt is all you are going to get from me, after all, I know the drill. I am here because I feel ill, so bloody well get on with it.“Do you live in a house, a flat, a bungalow?”“Owned or rented?”“Do you live alone?”\"Who lives with you?”“Do you wear dentures, glasses, a hearing aid. Do you walk unaided, do you use a stick or Zimmer frame?”“Can you get to the toilet unaided, do you have trouble with your waterworks, your bowels?\"“Do you smoke, drink?” How much?”“Do you have a religion?\"“Are you happy to look after your valuables while you’re here?”With someone like me, in full possession of their faculties, these questions require asking only once. The majority of emergency admittances are elderly people, deaf, confused, frightened; they often have no idea where they are. Some of the ‘care assistants’ (once upon a time, before we all became customers of the NHS, they were called nurses) are forced to bellow the same question, with variations, over and over, and still get no coherent reply.The afternoon before, we, the four patients in ward six of the Acute Medical Emergency Unit, (one jaundice, one severe headache, one atrial fibrillation and one dehydration due to bowel problems) had congratulated ourselves that we all seemed compos mentis and relatively stable medically. We planned to switch off the overhead lights for the night and shut the door to the corridor, thus creating a barrier between us and the gaggle of noisily caring staff outside. Fat chance. Two of the patients were moved and two new ones arrived; one of these was moved again within a couple of hours and  replaced, at about three a.m., by a very elderly patient, totally deaf and oblivious of the shouting staff.I usually cheat - I know I probably shouldn’t, but can’t be arsed to ask for permission, which wouldn’t be given, in any case - and take an extra dose of sleeping pills. We are meant to hand in all prescriptions but I always sneak a couple of pills into my handbag beforehand. Consequently, I was the only one of the other three who managed to doze for a few hours.I had been seen by a young houseman during the evening. He crouched down on his haunches in front of my bed and asked the usual questions: “When did this start, do you have any idea why, has it happened before, when and for how long”.Do these people have time to read patients' notes at all? Answering his questions, I was fascinated by the sweat pouring off his forehead, he was waving a sheaf of notes like a fan and shifting on his heels.  I can assure you that I was not to blame, I am no Jezebel at any time and in the throes of AFib and in my shabby dressing gown a female less likely to inflame the carnal urges of a young man would be hard to imagine. Eventually he stood up and asked if he could take some blood. It is policy in the modern NHS to ask the patient’s permission before performing any medical procedure. Nurses do it constantly, now doctors do it too. When I pointed out that this was a stupid thing to do, how else would they be able to arrive at a diagnosis, the nurse said,” it’s the rules”.  My veins are thin, the doctor poked about desperately, while I begged him to call a nurse or a phlebotomist. “No, I’ll do it myself,” he boasted, “it’s my job.” Leaving me with a livid bruise, he went off triumphantly, half-filled vial in hand, never to be seen again.There is an instant camaraderie on such a ward. The jaundiced young woman was very friendly and chatty and the older woman in the bed next to hers was only too willing to tell her own story. “I’m meant to be at Bob’s,” she said. Bob was her boyfriend. They had found each other relatively late in life and she was obviously very happy at their joint good fortune. The previous day the elderly man had sat by her bed for many hours, quietly and patiently,  while his girl friend dozed in her dehydrated low level of consciousness.  The young woman was mostly concerned with the hairy state of her legs. “I haven’t been able to shave for four weeks,” she said. Apparently jaundice causes unbearable itching and blood was running down her legs every time she scratched. “Wear gloves,” the nurses advised. Nina, that was the girl’s name, wailed in frustration. “The only time I don’t itch is when I’m asleep, why do you insist on waking me up at five in the morning?” Nina’s doctor was a very handsome young Indian, tall, with a short black beard and a mop of curly hair. The nurses all gawped at him whenever he appeared. Nina too made the most of him. She was a voluptuous young woman with a mane of long, dark, wavy hair, which she brushed assiduously in the way of the siren on the rock luring smitten swains to their death in the floods below. The jaundice gave her skin a golden sheen. She was actually very ill, had been in hospital for weeks, and faced a liver biopsy the next day.  The woman with the headache knew that she had a brain tumour. I was probably the least seriously ill patient on the ward.If I hadn’t been worried enough to ring my GP after 30 hours of AFib, I might not have been admitted at all. She didn’t even bother to make a house call, just said,” we’ve been here before, you know what to do; the ambulance is on its way.” In my book that’s called ‘passing the buck’. There was a time when women doctors had to fight to get into the profession, now they’re happy to shift responsibility away from their surgery.The AFib stopped as suddenly as it had started, after exactly 44 hours. I rushed out of bed to catch a nurse who’d promised me some paracetamol for chest pains, dragging cables behind me and setting the monitor  pinging wildly. Another nurse in the room panicked, shouted “ what are you doing, what do you want?” I stood perfectly still and listened intently, turning all my attention in on myself.“It’s stopped, it’s all over,” I said, finally. I looked up at the monitor. The last time I’d checked it said 198. Now it said 67. I knew that within a few short hours I’d be home again. Safe again."},

It’s not easy to come up with new ideas; writing a purely diary type of blog doesn’t suit me and following weekly me-mes is something I do occasionally, when I am lazy or particularly inspired by the prompt,  but it does rather feel like being a Pavlovian dog. You yank my chain and I bark. Maybe not. So, give up altogether? Let’s see, what would I miss? Rather a lot actually. I would miss this forum; being a woman of many words, opinionated and frequently judgmental, which other outlet could I find?  Deborah of Temptation of Words has decided to write for herself only, cutting out comment; there have been bloggers who have found that the very success they have has become oppressive and they’ve stopped, only to start another blog under another name later on. Others have decided to change tack, change the nature of their posts; I too have played with the idea that that might be the way to go on. Suze of  Subliminal Coffee calls blogging a ‘conflicted forum’; she is right; for those of us for whom this is more than a daily gush, who value the comradeship, the exchange of opinions, the friendliness and connection we have and the way we cause each other to open our eyes to the myriad of ways we act and react in our daily lives as well as interact with each other, this place is a world alive with conflict. You wouldn’t believe the number of times I have had to revise my opinion on some matter or other, just because one of you has shown me, in simple words, by simply recording and therefore explaining an ordinary event in an ordinary life, how ignorance creates prejudice. I have had advice, commiseration, information, and many a congratulatory pat on the back, all by way of this free and easy medium. With some of you I share emails behind the scenes, which gently remind us that we are not alone in times of trouble or confusion. A skyped conversation is as close as I’ll ever get to one or two of you; I am grateful for this possibility, it’s better than no contact. The joy of receiving a postcard from distant lands is a great pleasure every time - here are just a few of the ones I have received. A far greater pile serves as bookmarks or provides a colourful backdrop on my kitchen pinboard.When Benno’s death broke my heart Georgia Little Pea pestered her typist to send me a whole envelope full of Senhor Do Bonfim ribbons to make me feel better. And the terrifically talented Elizabeth Rose of  Penspaper Studio sent me a beautiful card, which I have already displayed with pride and gratitude in a previous post.And then there are the real life visits. When I first saw Susan of Prufrock’s Dilemma bound over the footbridge across the river which leads from the car park to the meadow below the castle at Valley’s End I couldn’t believe my luck. There she was, large as life and twice as jolly and bright.SusanSusan and I  found an instant rapport. We talked as if we’d met a dozen times before. All the same, to be certain that this rapport would last for longer than the first ten minutes, we made a date to meet up in the village pub for a meal that very evening.  After all, you never know with these internet acquaintances, do you? People had warned me not to be too trusting. What fools people are! I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: we, who write about ourselves in this forum for any length of time, give away an awful lot about ourselves, whether we know it or not.Susan and her company came to luncheon and an afternoon at our house later on during the week and Beloved and I took all three of them to our hearts as I hope they did with us.Next came Pondside, the lady who lives by the ponds on beautiful Vancouver Island. She is exactly as I thought she would be, sweet and friendly, calm and utterly capable. It was one of my local bloggers who brought her, the shepherdess at  Snailbeach, who lives just down the road from us in one of the valleys. The two of them found a pair of admirers in Valley’s End very quickly, even before I could take them home for a piece of cake and a cup of tea. Our meeting ended all too soon, I would have loved to spend many hours in their company.Snailbeach Shepherdess and PondsideLast, but by no means least, I met Perpetua, a lady who is Perpetually In Transit, at the house of a non-blogger, Julia, who nevertheless reads blogs. (Should that be allowed?) Julia and her husband had provided scrumptious home baking along with coffee and a comfortable sofa, which left Perpetua and me to chew the fat. Beloved came too, but he found it hard to get a word in edgeways. We were lucky to catch Perpetua between travels, she and her husband were soon going off to the frozen north, leaving us to bask in the relatively milder climate of the Welsh marches. As we said goodbye, I asked Perpetua if  her opinion of me formed solely on the basis of blogging came anywhere near the reality of me. “Oh yes,” she said, “definitely. Oh yes.” She left it at that. I am still wondering. PerpetuaThere’s no doubt at all in my mind, we most certainly give ourselves away in blogland.Two weeks ago I took a blogging break; last week’s blogging break was involuntary, the dreaded AFib came back for a spell. I am still tired but better now; it’s time to blog again."},

{"title": "Gardener’s Tales", "date": "Saturday 20 October 2012", "text": "Before Gardener’s ministrations this week the garden was rather colourful,  ash tree and ornamental cherry had left the ground and small shrubs covered in a layer of gold and red. I felt almost sorry when this glorious carpet disappeared by means of his rake. There are plenty more leaves to come, of course, it’s just that the early drop-outs are particularly pretty. But they need raking and collecting,  otherwise they’d soon turn mushy and slippery. I do, however, leave them lying on the borders for worms and beetles to dispose of during the winter months.When tea break came, Gardener told me a story which is too good to leave unrecorded. In a past life he was  the cowman on one of the oldest estates in the county,  dating back to the twelfth century, which is still owned by the original family, although the current branch can ‘only’ trace its roots back to the 16th century. ©  Gill Cardy ARPS PLOWDEN HALL,    LYDBURY NORTH, SOUTH SHROPSHIRE, Gardener has often told me about his cows; he knew them all and they recognised him as their master. He took care of them,  called the vet when they needed attention,  chased them down the lane when one or two decided to go walkabout and played them loud music. “They loved it”, he said, “well, I did, anyways.”Every morning the Lord came to the milking parlour while Gardener was in the pit between two rows of cows, attaching the cups for milking. The Lord kept a record of the previous day’s yield and while he made notes, he and gardener discussed general matters pertaining to the herd. One morning the Lord was in a hurry. He turned up in his hunting pink, obviously ready to join the hunt as soon as he’d finished in the parlour.“He always came through the dairy”, Gardener said, \"and stood in the entrance to the parlour near the head of the first cow and wrote in his little book. This day he tried to come in past the cows from the other end. He must have pushed the last cow as he tried to squeeze past. They don’t like being disturbed during milking, I never spoke to them loud, just kept quiet and steady.”“So, there he was, all shiny and clean and polished,” Gardener continued, “ and when he pushed the cow, she coughed. Just the once.” Gardener’s face cracked into a wicked grin. He pursed his lips and blew a gigantic raspberry, much as the cow must have done from her southern end. “Oh, he didn’t like it at all,” he said, “ all down his front it was; she was a bit loose too, nice and wet.”“Furious, he was.” Gardener chuckled, and then his face became thoughtful. \"He should have known what would happen, him owning a large herd and a landowner and all. No, I tell you, cows don’t like being disturbed during milking. Nice and steady is what they like.”"},
{"title": "Vacuums Aren't Getting Filled Like They Used To . . . . .", "date": "Friday 12 October 2012", "text": "Jay's painting of BennoOne of these days I'll write a learned essay on vacuums, how nature abhors them and how she fills them as soon as they manifest themselves. Well, for now, let me just say that nature is doing sweet F.A. about filling my particular hollow space, a painful and miserable space; a vacuum that leaves big gaps in my day, my house, my routine, my physical exercise, my cuddling and loving capacity, my maternal instinct, my need to lavish time and love on another creature, preferably an obedient one, most definitely a furry one.I have put our name down with various dog rescue organisation which shelter and rehome unwanted dogs, but have heard nothing so far. I would love another labrador, maybe even two - when one dies there is at least another creature to  alleviate the pain of mourning. ( I'd have to convince Beloved first) Two months on, the memory of Benno's death is still raw, I still find myself crying suddenly, when I find I've automatically performed one of those actions that revolved around his mealtimes, his walks, his trips in the car, even the filling of his water bowl. My heart aches for him. I want him back, or failing that, his predecessor, Boris, who's been dead for ten years. I walk around Valley's End on my own, all the places where he stopped to sniff, roll in dog or sheep shit and even cow dung, which only serves to drive the knife in deeper. I am sadly bereft, there is no other word for it. All his bad habits are forgotten and forgiven. There's nothing left but the memory of his sweet and affectionate nature. As well as his tail, which wagged furiously as soon as anybody clinked the lid of the bread bin. My friend Jay painted a beautiful picture of him and yesterday I took it to be framed.\"On your own, are you? Where's the dog?\" There are still people around who don't know of my bereavement. Yes, bereavement; a beloved dog is as much a friend and family member as any human. \"Ah, I'm sorry,\" they say, \"are you getting another one?\" I've been feeling that a quick replacement would have been disloyal to Benno, after all, there has to be a decent mourning period. It's not as if just any dog could fit his paws marks. We waited for six months before we took in Benno to fill the hole Boris had left.But now we find ourselves approaching every dog we meet, asking their owner if we can have a quick  scratch and a stroke and a cuddle and boring everybody witless with the tale of our recent loss. If I meet any seemingly unaccompanied dog, I speak to it, feed it titbits carried in my pocket and entice it to come home with me. But every time the owner appears my hopes are dashed. Of course, I would not abduct a dog, those of you who might think so, don't know a thing about me. That just won't do. Last night we went to the pub for a pint and a plate of scampi, ham and chips and this gorgeous black labrador walked in. When I stroked and petted him he licked my hand and I burst into tears there and then.This evening I've been googling websites advertising dogs for rehoming. I've seen Benno's exact likeness, unfortunately he is in a kennel the other side of the country; besides he might already have been rehomed. Turnover in dog shelters is either very quick or not at all. Some dogs nobody wants. No doubt, they will eventually be put down. Beloved was in the bathroom, I knocked on the door and he came flying out when I told him about the Benno look-alike; he was all for setting off early in the morning to go and look at him. It would take a lot of effort to go there.  And we'd have to visit the kennels at least twice, possibly three times. But Beloved's eagerness just goes to show how keen he too is.It's 2 am now, I can't sleep for thinking of dogs. Keep your fingers crossed for us. Surely, we will soon find a replacement for our beloved best friend and companion, who left us so suddenly and unexpectedly. If we had any sense and let our heads rule our hearts, we'd forget about adopting another dog. Two decrepit old crocks, one of whom is no longer able to walk very far, would do well to remember their limitations as well as the way a dog ties you down. Heads or hearts, hearts or heads, which is the one to be applied here?The sherry decanter is empty and I've eaten most of the remaining crackers in the pack, leaving nothing but the crumbs; it's time to have another go at sleeping. Wish me luck."},

{"title": "A Year in the Life of a Lady Gardener - October", "date": "Wednesday 10 October 2012", "text": "I must admit that you have been lured here under wholly false pretences this time. I am suffering from an extreme bout of lethargy, all my gardening energy has evaporated. It might be due to the fact that October so far has had few 'golden' days, which would irresistibly draw me to leave my comfortable chair, put on wellies and warm fleece jacket and get working outside. All I have done is to go out with my camera and record the incredible display of autumn colour; I don't think shrubs and trees have ever been as spectacularly brilliantly hued as this year. The overly wet summer might have had something to do with it, as well as the fact that we have had a few rather chilly nights.The above picture of the ornamental cherry was taken in very feeble light, the sun totally obscured by a persistent mist, and yet, the tree itself appeared like a beacon of deep carmine.Waiting to chronicle October in the garden until my zest for gardening returns is not an option, I think; the leaves are falling steadily if silently, and there might be none left to show you in two weeks' time. The golden leaves of the dogwood in the foreground of the photo are rapidly turning orange. This small shrub is a gem, lemon yellow in high season, turning to orange in autumn. The spindle tree in the background is at its best too, glowing with a leaf life soon to be extinguished. But there are compensations: the spindle will have gorgeous little red berries soon, which burst open in early spring to reveal pinky-white blossom. The wood of some species was traditionally used for making spindles for spinning wool; hence its English name. The euonymous europaeus (this spindle tree's botanical name) is the perfect tree for the small garden. And how about this red-stemmed dogwood! The mist accentuates the colours magnificently. It is as if the surrounding greyness provides plants with the perfect impetus to do their very best, almost as if to say \"you can't dampen my spirit, no matter how desperately hard you try\". I love my European dogwoods, they don't flower like the American varieties, but they are very attractive in autumn and winter and form a lovely, dark green background for more showy plants in summer.Here it is the spireas which dominate the colour palette. From green via deep yellow to orange. Who said 'hot' colours in the garden are tasteless! There is an amazing variety of spireas, over 80 different kinds. I grow most of mine for their attractive foliage. Some are very bright in spring and others don't show their true mettle until autumn. There is also a variety which has silver-edged leaves all year round. Most people grow the gold-leaved variety (japonica 'Gold Flame') which bears purple disk-like flowers in spring and early summer. Another favourite is Spirea Arguta, which is covered in white blossom in early spring. All are worth having. They are good work horses in anybody's garden, small or large and very easy to cultivate.Fine, let's cool it down a bit. White is the discerning and sophisticted lady gardener's colour of choice; white and green are the height of good taste, apparently. Japanese anemonies are among the few 'new' herbaceous flowers this late in the season, they and the various kinds of michaelmas daisies and chrysanthemums. My mick daisies aren't flowering yet and I don't currently grow any chrysanthemums. Perhaps this splendid white hydrangea would be allowed to make up for it.The mist has lifted enough to allow the church tower to become visible but the blue remembered hills are still hidden in the murk. I am staying indoors. Where did I put the book I was reading?Into my heart an air that kills   From yon far country blows:What are those blue remembered hills,   What spires, what farms are those?That is the land of lost content,   I see it shining plain,The happy highways where I went   And cannot come again.A.E. Housman Contrary to the rather melancholy Housman I can come again; to appreciate my view of the Shropshire Hills again all I  need is a bit of bright daylight."},
{"title": "Humdrum", "date": "Saturday 6 October 2012", "text": "is quite often oddly satisfying.\"Did you see what I did last week? Did you notice the sparkle?\"It was Kelly's morning for cleaning. As I was about to remove myself, out of her way, and disappear into the garden,  her question arrested my flight. Like many women, I feel guilty about employing another woman to clean up after me, and like to pretend it's not happening by being really busy with something else, but Kelly is totally matter-of-fact about it and cheerfully admits that she needs the money. I hovered, uncertain what it was I should have noticed. On her previous session I had had to take Beloved to the eye clinic for his sixth poke in the eye with a sharp object, and we'd not seen her at all. Kelly knows where the key is and we trust her to get on with the job while we're out.\"Didn't you notice that I cleaned the cooker surround? I took your pottery down and gave it a good scrub and I did the tiles too. It was really greasy everywhere.\"\"Oh, thank you, Kelly, of course I noticed it, you did a grand job. You made such a difference.\"I took a closer look and the tiles really did seem clean. and the pots had lost the fuzziness that comes with sticky dust. A little ashamed that I hadn't even noticed before, I repeated my thanks. Every job well done deserves appreciation and all too often I forget how important this appreciation was to me during my own working life.This time Kelly had to clean up after a pair ofplasterers. The builders finally arrived to attend to thedamp and mouldy patches which we had ignoredfor far too long.The damage under the eaves was due toa leaking roof and has been steadily gettingworse over the past twelve months. We've hadenough rain for the house to float, likeNoah's Ark, down the hill and away withthe river and we were quite relieved to see thatthere was no rot in the timbers.It was Kelly who noticed that thebroom cupboard downstairs was peelingoff the wall. I tend to see such things withonly half a mind; I hate repairmen in thehouse and any job like that will probablycause upheaval, mess and great expenditure.But when the leak seeped all the way into thedownstairs bathroom something had to be done.Considering that it takes even the best regulatedfirm of builders many months to turn up, it mighthave been been more sensible to get on tothem a bit sooner; but now the job is done, there'sonly the painting to come and the pressure is off.We haven't had the bill yet.I told the chap in the first photo that I wastaking his picture for my blog.\"What's a blog \", he asked.\"A kind of online diary. - ok, so mine isn't really,but  it would have taken too long to explain the convoluted nature of this particular example of thegenre -. There'll be people on other continents readingabout you and they'll see your picture\".\"Really\", he said, \"cool\".He might have been humouring me, the client; the 'cool'made me stop and wonder. He was at least in his thirtiesand nobody older than thirteen should use this expression, but he was a nice chap. They both were, and they managed to work all day without a radio blaring pop music. They also cleaned up after themselves, leaving plenty of surface dust but no real mess. If anybody round this end of Shropshire reads this and needs a building contractor, I can recommend them.And finally, humdrum is as humdrum does; it is a quick walk I take on so many afternoons of my life here in the Marches, but no matter how often I retrace my steps around 'my' castle, the pleasure never wanes. But then, you've heard me brag about this many times before."},

{"title": "Of Cabbages And Other Cranky Crinkly Creatures", "date": "Saturday 29 September 2012", "text": "Wirsingkohl - Savoy Cabbage\"You're making some wonderful smells again\", Beloved says, coming into the kitchen from outside.\"What is it?\"They say  'The way to a man's heart goes through his stomach', and Beloved is no exception. Always good and appreciative of food, in spite of being on the thin side, his tummy is very important to him and he likes my cooking.I agree that the aroma of gently frying sliced onions, lardons (bacon cubes) and a squashed clove of garlic or three sets my own gastric juices flowing. I start off nearly every casserole dish this way, adding browned beef or lamb and their requisite herbs and spices as I go along. A generous slug of Beloved's home made fruit wine serves to deglaze and braise the whole thing. I use very heavy black cast iron pots and pans; I now need both hands and a fair bit of hefting to get them out and into position. They have  tightly fitting lids, preventing flavours from escaping during the process of slow-cooking.My mother taught me how to make stews by default. It wasn't that I ever paid any attention at the time or that she made a point of explaining what she was doing, but somehow, in spite of our mutual lack of interest in handing over the few secrets of her culinary expertise, I picked up the odd pointer which stuck. I suppose being in the room in which cooking is done, automatically leaves an impression on the bystander, particularly when the process is repeated time after time during childhood.Mother had had to learn to cook early, her own mother died young - I never knew her -,  which meant her cooking was poor people's cooking. Although grandfather kept geese and chickens and cultivated his own vegetables, mother, as a child, lived through WWI and grew up between the wars; at neither time was food plentiful in rural villages.Girls and women learned to adapt. The area of the left bank of the Lower Rhine is a fertile plain, to this day it is agricultural in character, in spite of the nearness of the industrial Ruhrgebiet on the other side of the river. Main crops were potatoes and cereals like rye, barley and oats as well as the king of local produce, the humble head of cabbage, white and purple and savoy, the absolute staples without which rural populations wouldn't have survived. Cabbage is nourishing, it is full of vitamins and minerals, and filling to boot. An essential vegetable to help poor people to survive lean times. I made its acquaintance after WWII and, although I never thought of it as a delicacy, I got used to it and ate it without complaint.White cabbage was shredded and eventually became Sauerkraut, red cabbage was braised with apples, a small handful of raisins, a few cloves, a dash of vinegar and a teaspoonful of sugar. These would be served with potatoes and some kind of pork produce, like Speck, (bacon), Eisbein, (pickled pork knuckle), or Bratwurst  (German sausage). Savoy cabbage, on the other hand, became a meal in itself. A braised onion and as much bacon or ham as you could afford were the base for the shredded, crinkly, deep green leaves. Mother stirred the pot until the cabbage had wilted and the slivers of meat and onion were evenly mixed. If she had a ladleful of stock - or a dissolved stock cube -, she added it at this point, as well as a diced potato or two layered on top. It took about an hour at the lowest heat to turn these ingredients into a steaming, fragrant mush; if necessary, she'd help it along with a deft twist or two of the masher. There was never any of that nasty, disagreeable stink of cabbage, that is said to hang about for hours, denoting squalor and poverty.Long after I had left home, and after my father had died, it was aunt Josephine's favourite meal. Mother and Josephine didn't really like each other very much, but they lived within easy cycling distance of each other.  Josephine was an invalid - although mother often complained that she was making the utmost use of her disabilities - and my father's sister, tall and thin, with a black-eyed stare that could pin you down and render you immobile as surely as a lepidopterist does to his moths and butterfly specimens. Several times a week mother cooked lunch for Josephine; she'd rush the meal over to her in a basket hanging from the handlebar of her bicycle, then rush home again to eat her own meal, which she'd kept warm in the oven. I never asked, nor was the information ever offered, why the two old ladies didn't simply eat together at Josephine's. In fact, I've only just realised how ludicrous the whole situation was. Aunt Josephine was well off and could easily have ordered in food every day, but she said nobody could cook the old-fashioned dishes like mother. Mother frequently complained that the whole thing was getting too much for her but still she complied.I have never preserved Sauerkraut and rarely cook red cabbage. We eat both, but I prefer to buy the finished article in jars imported all the way from Germany. But, like mother, I cook Savoy cabbage myself in winter. Beloved, who is a true Englishman and therefore dislikes the thought of boiled cabbage, eats this Eintopfgericht  (One-pot-dish) with pleasure, provided I don't present him with it too often during the cold months."},
{"title": "The Sadness and Joy of Autumn", "date": "Monday 24 September 2012", "text": "As imperceptibly as GriefThe Summer lapsed away -Too imperceptible at last,To seem like Perfidy -The thought of dark days to come, of ever decreasing hours of daylight, of chill winds blowing and rattling doors and windows, of trees flinging off their leaves like so much unwanted ballast, and clouds racing under full, black sail, as if the sky itself were mourning the passing of that light-hearted season of  full-bodied warmth, scent and sound which is summer, lay a pall of sadness on my spirit. Winter will follow autumn and spring is a long time away. There is not an autumn when I don't think of the end of things, of shutting down and drawing in, a yearning for what was and never will be again, and feel a shiver  of foreboding for what is to come.It takes an effort of will to go out and look at the splendour autumn can bring. I may have to look a little more closely to find the autumn cyclamen, but they are there, like weightless butterflies of summer settled lightly on the fallen debris, their own leaves mottled and marked like green toads hiding under stones. A Quietness distilledAs Twilight long begunOf Nature spending with herselfSequestered Afternoon -Autumn brings a time for sitting still and thinking quiet thoughts; there is no feeling guilty now for hours spent reading or writing, when at other times of year I must be out, working and walking and doing. There are hearty stews simmering in the oven, and roasting root vegetables spread the delicious scent of well-being around cosy kitchens. Curtains are drawn against the gathering gloom and lamplight creates pools of light around comfortable chairs. Even the TV comes into its own now in our house; in summer it sits in its corner, sulking for lack of use during long, warm evenings spent out of doors.The Dusk drew earlier in - The Morning foreign shone -A courteous, yet harrowing Grace,As Guest, that would be gone -But there are autumn pleasures to be had out of doors as well:  soon it will be time to go and rake up fallen leaves and collect them into their wired enclosure, ready to provide leaf mould for the coming year;  mounds of leaves, twigs and small branches must be piled up in out of the way corners to provide shelter for hedgehogs and other small mammals who hibernate during the harshest months;  insect hotels must be created out of hollow bamboo, tied into bundles and tucked into forks and angles of trees and other nooks and crannies away from the prevailing winds.And who can resist an autumn walk in the woods, shuffling through deep layers of fallen leaves, kicking and scraping delightedly at the musical sound of rustle and crackle and crunch underfoot. And if you are as lucky as I am you may choose to walk alongside a full-throated stream, swollen by early autumn rains. Back in the fields, lambs in their winter woollies, all grown-up now, calmly feed on juicy pastures while  shadows are lengthening; the passing visitor deserves no more than a curious glance from one of their number.And thus, without a WingOr service of a KeelOur Summer made her light escapeinto the Beautiful.As Imperceptible as GriefEmily Dickinson 1830-1886"},
{"title": "A Year in the Life of a Lady Gardener - September Hiatus", "date": "Friday 21 September 2012", "text": ". . . . . . .perhaps the chiefest attraction of a garden is that occupation can always be found there. No idle people are happy, but with mind and fingers busy cares are soonest forgotten.Alicia Amherst, 1902September is  a quiet month in my gardening year. After the frantic efforts of spring, the high maintenance work of summer, the delicious pleasures of a hot August spent entertaining in the garden - ok, rewind that last bit and amend to read: the misery of staring out at a chilly, rain sodden mess from inside the safety of my home - comes September; often drier than the whole of an English summer, this month rewards us with the fruits of nature's labour and our's too; man and beast and birds all profit from the bounty before the onset of winter. There is still plenty of colour in the garden. In September late-flowering clematis come into their own, tumbling over stonework and climbing high into trees left standing particularly for this purpose.Shrubs like fuchsias and the many varieties of smoke bush (cotinus)  are at their best now.I look about me in the garden and see the first signs of decay, leaves on flowers and trees alike are beginning to assume their autumn plumage. Still, the secateurs will have to stay in my pocket for a while longer, and the dividing fork and spade remain hanging on their hooks on the wall in the garage. For now, at least, I must curb my impatience to put the garden to bed, it is too early to snip and prune and tidy up. Once the lavender flowers have been cut back, the rose bushes dead headed for yet another flush of buds opening to the last warming rays of autumn sun, overlooked stems of hosta flowers have finally been removed, I have little to do except study each bed carefully and make decisions about future layout and planting. Clumps of overgrown herbaceous perennials are earmarked for digging up and dividing; plants that have not earned their keep so far this year are given a very last chance to make me change my mind about discarding them altogether. If  we can do nothing about the flower beds, and little about shrubs, we must turn our attention to trees, fruit trees in particular. We only grow apples and Victoria plums. Gardener has been quite brutal about the plum trees, taking out whole canopies and even Beloved is roped in to chop up branches and help us get them ready for the bonfire or chipper.Gardener is, of course, busy turning the compost heaps. We operate a three-bin-system. fresh greenery from the garden (avoiding the roots and seeds of all perennials weeds), shredded newspaper and dampened cardboard, small twigs and kitchen refuse are layered alternately, with a juicy layer of grass clippings added once a week during summer to create the necessary heat to cook the whole stew nicely. It takes anything from six months to a year, depending on the frequency of turning, to earn the final reward of black gold, which is then shovelled into huge builders' bags and left in an out-of-the-way corner to await distribution next spring.Here we have the finished article, ready to be bagged up, barrow load after barrow load of well-rotted compost, crumbly and soft, and absolutely essential to induce our stony soil to produce an abundance of new life next spring. Gardener has two other gardens to look after and he tells each of their owners that nothing compares to the stuff he - and he alone, mind you - manages to coax out of the previous year's leavings at Mrs. Friko's. I am magnanimous enough never to remind him that I taught him everything he knows about compost -  and no, we are not in competition with each other in the matter, Not At All!"},
{"title": "Economies of Effort", "date": "Sunday 16 September 2012", "text": "My friend and neighbour Sally is a hard working lecturer and writer. Due to start a research trip to the Amazon rain forest two days after returning from a holiday in France, she has decided not to return to Shropshire in between trips but to stay in London, meet other members of her expedition, and set off again almost immediately.The problem is her lecture work at a London university for adult students, many of them from overseas. \"Classes start the day after I return from Brazil\", she said. \"I shall be exhausted and jet-lagged; it's going to be very hard to concentrate on the students, who will all be new to me, and to provide a reasonable body of work for their first day. They'll just have to hear all about the trip.\" As this is not a problem I have ever come across I had no solution to offer.\"I know what I'll do\", she said. brightening. \"I've done it before and it has worked before. I shall simply ask each of them to write a short autobiography, ten, fifteen minutes long. It'll get us going and I will learn far more about them than asking them, one after the other, to tell me about their past education and work history\".  I was impressed but doubted that ten or fifteen minutes of scribbled notes would give an accurate picture of a person's history. I'd need at least ten minutes just to collect my thoughts. Sally waved my objections aside. \"They are journalists\", she said, \"I would certainly expect them to be able to write a concise profile of themselves in that time\".Once I'd stopped laughing at the cheek of it and got over the shock of this teaching aid when in need of recovery, I thought it quite a good idea. What if we could all ask new acquaintances to give a short resumée of themselves? When a musician introduces him/herself to another musician, they say : \"John Smith, trumpet\", that being the most important thing about them. At times I have been in long and tortuous conversation with a previously unknown person, desperately trying to work out who or what they are. And sometimes I have been bored out of my mind by people who tell me all about themselves, their aunt Matilda and Uncle Tom Cobbley and all in the first ten minutes.I now need to go away and think what I would write in this fifteen minute autobiography; what do I do, flatter myself and leave out anything embarrassing, even if it is of importance, or tell the bare facts, warts and all. It's not so easy to pick out the most important aspects of one's life and history when there's been such a lot of it."},

{"title": "In Praise Of Settling Down into Comfortable (late) Middle Age", "date": "Monday 10 September 2012", "text": "\"Sir, I am too old to learn\", so Kent tells Cornwall, just before that bitch Regan, one of King Lear's foul daughters, has the stubborn ancient knave clapped in the stocks.I haven't had a birthday and I don't feel particularly decrepit at the moment, but I do need a new battery for my watch. Beloved laughed out loud when I asked if he could think of anything funny to do with middle/old age. \"There's nothing funny about ageing,\" he said, \"except to young people, who think, like Dogberry in Much Ado About Nothing, \"When age is in, the wit is out\".  (Beloved is another old person who quotes Shakespeare without feeling in the least embarrassed). \"Perhaps you could ask to have a new battery fitted yourself\", he suggested, \"to keep you going for another year without stopping\". Have you noticed how watch batteries seem to last for exactly twelve months? How do they do that?Believe me or not, there are advantages to getting older!  Old people are practically expected to ramble and ask pointless questions. Children love them for it, it trains them early on to feel superior. It's such a relief when the straitjacket of what is considered mature good sense is slipped over the back of the chair and one can relax into that comfortable old cardigan with saggy pockets and baggy elbows, which comes with experience and the knowledge that nothing is consumed as hot as it is served. It's a very valuable thing indeed to be able to take the long view - BACKWARDS. Wisdom is accepting that our long cherished views and opinions might just be fallible, something we have surely learned by now - I mean, how many times have you been proved wrong about your dearest convictions in the past? Actually, as I get older, I have come to believe less and less, but what I do believe, I believe more and more.Although, agreeing with  Eleanor Roosevelt 'I could not at any age be content to take my place in a corner by the fireside and simply look on', and taking care of my appearance as well as my brain remaining of some importance, I don't mind not being seen as a sexual being by every stray male. I used to think that becoming invisible was the stuff of science fiction; not so. It's quite comforting and a lot less bother. You can use your energy for the worthwhile stuff, like quoting Shakespeare, blogging and writing bad poetry. True, there are disadvantages too: you can't  throw a tantrum and still be sexy. Clever Eleanor also said 'Beautiful young people are accidents of nature, but beautiful old people are works of art'. A work of art in a strop? No, can't see it, personally.I don't entirely agree with the Duke of Kent about being too old to learn; I am definitely too old to learn the things you want me to learn but there is lots of stuff which interests me. That wonderful writer Gerald Brenan, whose 'The Face Of Spain' I am reading at the moment, (a book one of my gentlemen friends has lent me for the improvement of my mind ),  said  'Middle age snuffs out more talent than even wars or sudden death does', but I am not at all sure that that is still true today. For those of us who have the time, the leisure, the means, the inclination to learn, the north, south, east and west of the world of knowledge have come close enough to grasp with ease. I don't know that a talent one has in youth can shrink, I do, however, accept, that storage and retrieval systems have lost some of their early elasticity.I speak to strangers, male or female, and I am greeted with friendliness; I can look at you, full face, not swivel my head sideways to avoid eye contact. I smile at you without being afraid that you might think me odd. If you do, that's your problem.  I even like being who I am, much of the 'searching for myself' has been done. In the sixties and seventies navel-gazing was a team sport of olympic proportions.  Although we think we were the generation that invented sex, I can still remember films where cameras panned to waves pounding the beach and trains rushed into tunnels, shrilly whistling, at the crucial moment. I am glad that kind of humbug has been done away with. I know what I like and have the courage to admit to it. I am not asking for respect because of my grey hairs, like the generation of my parents, but for being a half-decent human being. I am not afraid to grumble about the state of the world or complain about bad service, but otherwise my days on the barricades are over. It's the next generation's turn. Smiling and shrugging my shoulders may not be doing my civic duty, but it's easier. Seeing that I have free prescriptions, equanimity of mind saves the NHS some money: it keeps my consumption of blood pressure medication low.  You do it, you go out and change the world, you are younger and more energetic than me.'A healthy old fellow, who is not a fool, is the happiest creature living'. said Gerald Brenan.I hope it goes for old girls too.he is a mystic and a nature mystic. He sees God in the plants and leaves and hills and butterflies. And in the beetles too. Nature ought to be loved in many different ways and on several different levels. One should love it immediately with one's eyes and ears and sense of taste and smell; then with one's imagination as the material of poetry, and last of all mystically, as a means of raising one to God.The face of spain Gerald Brenan"},

I had a really big row with this woman yesterday\".\"Did you? Of course, you can. What was it about?\"\"Well this woman always brings her dog to walk in our cul-de-sac, when there are fields all around. I've seen her before. All she needs to do is leave the estate and she could walk for miles.\"\"So what is it you don't like about her?\"\"Well, when it says 'no fouling', what exactly does it mean?\"\"It means that you have to clean up after your dog\".\"I saw that she let him go into next doors front garden and he actually peed on their grass\".\"Kelly, peeing isn't fouling. Fouling is leaving dog poo behind\".\"Well, to be honest, she did pick up the poo. But it just shouldn't be allowed. I had such a row with her. I told her that she should take the dog to the fields. That our kids play in the street and could pick up her dog's germs. She said she cleaned up after him, 'here's the bag', she said. It was disgusting. So I said to her did she have a bottle of disinfectant so she could wash it off, because even if she picks it up there are still germs left behind\".Kelly was working herself up into a state of breathless indignation all over again.I couldn't help myself, I laughed, long and loud. I was tempted to go into a long discourse on 'germs' but came up with nothing but \"Oh Kelly\". There would have been no point. I have noticed how she sploshes disinfectant generously around my house, but I've stopped her using it on kitchen surfaces. Kelly sees the world's salvation in the eradication of 'germs'.She is in her very early forties, her children are still in junior school; I've seen them, they are pale and pasty-faced puddings who instantly fall victim to any bug passing by the school gates. The whole family coughs and splutters and belly-aches its course through winter.Oh Kelly. Is that what young women do? Destroy their children's and the world's immune system?"},
{"title": "A Day Out in My World", "date": "Tuesday 4 September 2012", "text": "On a day of tempestuous weather my  friend Rafe and I set off for a visit to the theatre, facing  a six hour roundtrip of 222 miles in the pouring rain,  between Valley's End in Shropshire and Bath in Somerset. When I told my friend Deborah during a skype chat, she gasped. \"That's hardcore\", she said.   Theatre Royal Bath was doing 'The Tempest', Shakespeare's late, great drama, with Tim Pigott-Smith as Prospero, a production I didn't want to miss. The route crosses the Severn Estuary which forms the boundary between Wales and England in this stretch. We're on the way home in the early evening here; by this time the rain had stopped and I could take a shot through the windscreen.Second Severn Crossing - inaugurated in 1996Ail Groesfan Hafren (Welsh name)The Theatre Royal, BathThe wonky main entrance to the theatre was once part of the house belonging to Beau Nash, the celebrated 18th C dandy and leader of fashion, and master of ceremonies at the spa town. We had lunch in the handsome building on the right, according to a plaque on the wall the former residence of Beau Nash and now an Italian restaurant.The plaque reads \"This was the splendid home of Beau Nash, the 'King of Bath' and his handsome and faithful mistress, Juliana Popjoy. They spent the whole of the latter part of their lives here, until the Beau's death in 1761 at the age of 86. We preserve this building at the high standards Beau Nash set for Bath. We think that Juliana Popjoy approves. Indeed, she is occasionally seen here, dressed in grey, and we suspect she has an eye on whether we are entertaining our guests as well as she entertained the Beau's friends in the same rooms 250 years ago.\"We both loved the production. A very elderly couple in front of us was occasionally shushed by their daughter, who must have been treating them to an unfamiliar outing - the woman's hearing aid whistled like a phone going off (\"turn it off, Mum!\")  and the pair scraped their ice cream tubs rather enthusiastically after the interval, then asking loudly what they should do with the empty containers - but matinees are like that sometimes; the action in the audience can occasionally be as distracting as the action on the stage.We're only half a mile away from Pennsylvania here. Pennsylvania, the small village in South Gloucestershire, between the historic cities of Bath and Bristol, that is. The village was named after the US state by Quakers, and Wikipedia says it has a petrol station and at least one bed and breakfast. So all of you who will, no doubt, flock here now that I've mentioned it, had better book your room well in advance! The countryside off the A46 is very pretty indeed, even if Pennsylvania itself is nothing to write home about.Another shot through the windscreen of the Severn bridge on the way home, driving at motorway speed.Although this outing took us a long way from Valley's End, a theatre visit is very much part of my world, which means that I am offering this contribution to Our World Tuesday  with a clear conscience."},
{"title": "Eye Openers", "date": "Saturday 1 September 2012", "text": "As always, the wait in the eye clinic to be seen by the staff is a long one. The mostly elderly and infirm patients sit and sigh, greeting every new neighbour in the row of seats in the corridor as a long lost  friend, leaning towards each other confidingly and sharing snippets of wisdom. People are called, disappear and return, swapping seats. First comes the eye test to establish how much the patient can currently see ;  then another nurse in an another room administers eye drops, which gradually enlarge the pupils to the extent that the world of the corridor becomes a blur. When this blur has reached the maximum stage, the eye is photographed. Finally, it's time for the big man himself, the consultant, to pronounce judgment, diagnosis and a course of treatment.  It all takes time. Time is what the old people have in abundance.\"Some of these drops can be real torture\". An old lady is being dragged past the row of stretched out feet by her daughter.\"We all have to put up with them\", the lady next to me says behind her hand. Having thus broken the ice she feels entitled to continue the conversation.\"Look at that chap\", she says, pointing to a man who limps badly, painfully lifting his left leg with every step. \"Poor man, walking so slowly. He will have seen better days in his life.\"Her compassionate words get through to my unwilling ears. I am not good at joining in with chance-met strangers in hospital corridors.  I look at her more closely. She is an old lady herself.\"It must be so frustrating for him\", she adds warmly. I nod in agreement. \"At least I can still move\", she says, just before she is called by a nurse and I notice that she has to feel her way along the wall to follow the call.Another  lady, also pulled along by her daughter, stumbles into a door jamb. \"Oops\", she says, \"drunk again\". She picks herself off the door frame and grins conspiratorially. \"It's the drink, and being so cheerful, as keeps me going\". Her daughter's smile is slightly strained. \"Mum\", she says, \"don't\".The chap with the limp is back and makes for the chair next to me. I move over to give him room to manoeuvre and he says, \"Don't move, don't move, I am not going to sit on your lap\". Within minutes he has told me that he is 81, has been a widower for ten years and used to be a train driver. \"That was in the days when trains was trains, with 10, 15 carriages and maybe a thousand people. Up the mountain, down the mountain, through the tunnel and over the viaduct\", he says. \"Now I look at the hills and I think 'how did I manage to do that and never thought about it' \". His Welsh lilt is music, swooping up and down like the mountains. He tells me about his son, who is a treasure, looks after his old dad a treat, even bought him a mobility scooter. \"The scooter is great\", he says, \"I went to the end of the road where I hadn't been for a long time, all the way up the hill and back again.\" His son is selling his house and has had some bad experiences. \"When I was young, you took people's word. You didn't do all this business with solititors. They're the worst, they are\".The old people don't really want me to add anything to their ramblings. A friendly ear is enough. A lady on my other side, who can be no older than sixty five, watches the chap leaving. \"I used to know him, when he was on the trains\", she said. \"Used to do the North Wales from Shrewsbury route.\"I put the book on my lap into my bag. It would probably not be very kind to sit here reading anyway. Most of these people can't see the printed word. Somehow we got to talking about cleaning and dusting. \"I don't know how much longer I can do it\", she says, \"the Hoover has been sitting at the top of the stairs for days\".In spite of her very poor sight she still lives on her small-holding, has 400 sheep, two horses and a donkey and eight or nine dogs. She has a lovely smile, warm and friendly. Dark glasses cover her eyes. Then she starts talking about her son who lives and works in Germany. She visits him a lot and loves Germany. This is not something I hear very often in the UK, so I am surprised. When I tell her that I am German she opens up further and tells me about the many happy holidays she has spent in the country and the friendly welcome she has met. \"I find it all depends on you\", she says, \"if you treat people with respect and friendliness, that's what you get in return. All you have to do is show willing.\"One in the eye for me! My willingness to 'show willing' is too often invisible, hidden by impatience or lack of interest.Beloved is finished with the consultant and he waves to me. We are done for today. As he weaves his way through the corridor, I catch up with him and ask \"Can you see?\" offering my arm. \"Enough\", he says over his shoulder, as he strides towards the sliding doors and out of the clinic.We have a lot to learn.It so happens that I came across a site called Theme Thursday where other bloggers happen to be discussing what eyes mean to them. I've added this story to theirs."},

I'm never going to have biographers clamouring for every word I've ever written or received. No one I know will ever end up in the archives of the British Library, their  literary legacy examined by future historians. 'Get rid of the stuff', I told myself, and Beloved too, of course. Stacks of A4 envelopes crammed with letters in bursting box files, in the drawers of desks and on shelves in various rooms, gathering dust. 'But these are of great interest to me',  my Inner Hoarder whined, 'a chronicle of my life'. 'Sentimental claptrap'. I said. (I can be quite brutal with myself sometimes.)Or how about this: For many years I have kept brochures and throwaways from every place we've ever visited, neatly (I am neat to a fault) filed, again in A4 envelopes, with the name of the country/county written on the outside for easy retrieval. I am not talking here about solid guide books - I have them too, of course, but they have their own shelves in the book cases -, but flimsy, mostly free, local maps, town plans, what-to-see and what-to-do in Upper-Micklemuckle-on-the-Mildew. \"Surely you are not expecting me to throw them away too? They'll come in handy, you'll see'. The Inner Hoarder is still at it. But I am on a roll, the Hoarder doesn't stand a chance. Out with them! Papers, brochures, letters, going, going, gone. And no, I am not going to stop and listen to the ever fainter voice of the Hoarder; 'Just a tiny little peek, there might be something important in that lot'.Next up are the boxes holding recipes ripped out of magazines over many years. I used to kid myself that I would certainly try the stuffed shoulder of lamb and the cream-laden marquise very soon and dazzle dinner guests with my culinary skills. Fat chance. I have my repertoire of tried and tested dishes, the kind of dishes which always work, popular and pleasant to look at; who needs recipes where even the ingredients require a special dictionary and a trip to the most expensive delicatessen in town. Besides, most of our guests have my kind of digestive system, the sort that complains when food is too rich, too spicy, too fussy.Not only have I made a start filling the paper recycling boxes but I've also taken those embarrassing chick-lit novelists off my book shelves - there are more to come, but withdrawal from any drug is meant to happen gradually. Tomorrow the dog lady is coming to collect the ramp we borrowed to help Benno climb into the car during his last six months on this earth. The dog charity runs a shop selling donated gifts, books and household items of good quality. They will be very happy to receive them, as well as more than half of my entire stock of preserving and bottling jars. Time was when I filled them, year after year, with jams, jellies, fruit, vegetables and even preserved meats. No more, Been there, done that; it's time to broaden my horizons and take up hang-gliding instead. Or perhaps I'll join the Women's Institute and learn how to stuff a mushroom.All this new-found desire to de-clutter is not because I've had a sudden rush of blood to the head but because I saw a friend of mine, who had moved house, stand in the middle of an unbelievably chaotic jumble of stuff in her new house. She was quite cheerful, considering; in her place, I'd have been ready to join the Foreign Legion and go to war in the desert."},

{"title": "No Medals For Unsung Skills and Hidden Talents", "date": "Thursday 16 August 2012", "text": "The Olympic Games are over for another four years,  participants and their retinues have long left the Olympic Park, the news programmes once again concern themselves with the dire state of the economy and public life is back to its dreary normality. Most ordinary mortals will never be known for great sporting prowess, nor, come to that, will most of us ever receive recognition for any skills or talents which we might secretly even be quite proud of; on the other hand, they might be so much a part of us that we have long forgotten to appreciate them ourselves.We are all good at something. It might take a bit of head scratching to unearth our particular talents, most of which are neither remarkable nor marketable. But we have them.Here are a few of mine:I remember conversations, more or less word for word; somebody says something, and good or bad, stupid or clever, I will be able to repeat their words for years to come. Don't try it, people hate it when I do that.I remember people's food idiosyncrasies, which is a good thing. Once you have told me that you hate fish, and that strawberries bring you out in hives, I will take careful note, and either feed you nothing else - if I hate you - or never even mention them - if I like you.I am very good at overlooking dust, an acquired talent, more or less in open rebellion against my parents, both of whom kept their glance permanently fixed on the carpet when indoors, in case a stray bit of fluff settled on its pristine expanse.Procrastination presents no problem for me, neither does dithering. I firmly believe that decisions made on the spur of the moment will variously bring nothing but regret, remorse, remonstrations from others, with retribution to follow. No, nice and easy does it, sleep on it, tomorrow is another day and a decision may either no longer be needed or somebody/something may have made it for you already. It is possible that this skill could get you into trouble, so think carefully - for quite a long time, in fact - before you adopt it.Give me a tangled ball of string, shoe laces, washing line or dog lead, anything that's long and windy and complicated to undo, I'll undo it for you, patiently, skilfully, expertly.One of my most noticeable talents is the crossing of bridges before I get to them. Examples for this are too numerous to mention, suffice it to say, that if I can fret today about something that may never happen, something that exists only in my imagination, like a rain free English summer or a motorway being cut through the valley, I will fret, copiously, whole-heartedly, until I make myself sick.I have the ability to make children and dogs obey me, almost without any effort on my part at all. Children have cried at the wonder of it but dogs love me for it, they love knowing what comes next.I can whistle.I can drive a car - forward only - through the narrowest of openings, with only an inch to spare on either side.And finally, I am a master at what I call smaller-vesselling. All who behold me doing it are in awe. Give me any quantity of any substance, liquid, or solid, and a row of any size of suitable containers and I will unfailingly, by pure eye-measure alone and at the first attempt, find the smallest container to hold the whole of the substance. It is an invaluable skill in the kitchen, my fridge is never as crowded as any one else's because all my containers are filled exactly to the brim. Perhaps that skill would be marketable if the right people knew about it?"},

But once these matters have been mentioned, they need to be acted upon, hence the dismantling of the gravestones.The cattle in the field behind saw it happen, ruminated for a little while, then turned their attention back to more pressing matters.  Now that the fuss is over and the 'job's-worths' have been satisfied, it will be a long time before noisy tools return to the cemetery to finish the job.I doubt that the dead are bothered.This post joins the many who have banded together to show the best of their world in Our World Tuesday."},
{"title": "Prejudices, Gaffes and Kindness", "date": "Sunday 12 August 2012", "text": "Since Friday 27th July I have done my best to escape London 2012. It's not that I don't appreciate the youth, beauty, skill and athleticism of the competitors; on the contrary, I am awe-struck and bowled over by the determination and hard work they have so obviously put into their quest for glory. It's the commentary I can't take. I watched an early sailing event, horribly fascinated and repelled at the same time, with a British competitor being the favourite. Throughout the race the Brit's name was repeated, over and over again, hysterically, manically, while two other close rivals were anonymously 'the Dutch and Danish sailors'; during the same race I also tried to count the number of times the two words  'Great Britain' shrieked out at me from the TV screen: I actually lost count.Gardener gave a wonderful example of this mind-set; naturally, the Olympics came up, although he belongs to the school of grouches who think that the money should have been spent on something more worthwhile, he seems to have followed Britain's unexpected success story and was even grudgingly appreciative. During one of his tirades against hype and overspend he mentioned a particular cycle race and a particular British cyclist.\"All that money from the Lottery, a bike that costs thousands of pounds, years of training, it's not worth it\", he said. \"What's the point, it's not as if he did anything important.\"\"But if he won, aren't you proud of him?\" we asked.\"He didn't win, he came third,\" Gardener said.\"Oh, I see\", we said, \"so who came first?\"\"No idea\". Gardener waved the question away dismissively. \"Just some bloke from abroad.\"Looks like the old attitude : Fog in Channel, Europe Isolated still rules okay.I put my foot into somebody's pet intellectual soft tissue the other day too when I wailed that I regret that English literature is peculiarly insular and parochial and that hardly anyone reads Continental European writers or work in translation. I mentioned that I had just finished W.G. Sebald's \"The Rings of Saturn\", in which the writer turns a long, wandering walk through East Anglia into a sequence of visionary meditations, which ultimately becomes an essay for the dispossessed.  My neighbour at the dinner table, up to now a good friend, turned a furious face in my direction and told me that he found my remarks 'deeply offensive' and that I should go and immerse myself in Wordsworth's 'Preludes' or 'Tintern Abbey' where I would certainly find philosophy and meditation. We were all on the cusp of being drunk, which accounted for my outburst as well as his; he repeated the 'deeply offensive' remark twice, which I found, and still find, rather over the top, especially as he hadn't really understood my complaint. At the end of dinner we parted on  good terms but I'm left wondering if I actually want to remain friends. Or if he does.So it is with great pleasure that I can finally get away from gaffes and prejudices and tell you about something very kind which the immensely talented artist/illustrator/writer Elizabeth Rose Stanton of the amazing Pens Paper Studio did: when she heard how sad I am about Benno's death she sent me the card you see here. Elizabeth is a dog lover too and she knows just how I feel.This is a card to keep. It will make me smile every time I look at it."},
{"title": "A Walk On The Sad Side", "date": "Thursday 9 August 2012", "text": "It was a pleasant morning, we'd had breakfast and it would have been time for Beloved to take Benno for a walk round the castle on the way to the paper shop. Beloved sighed. \"I know\", I said, \"I feel just the same.\" There was no need to ask the reason for the sigh. Neither of us had taken that particular walk for several weeks, Benno hadn't been able to manage the slopes lately and grass and pollen count had been high. \"Why don't we both go?\"The castle meadows and slopes were covered in wildflowers; since the sheep have been taken off, the area has begun to revert to scrubland. It doesn't take more than a couple of years for that to happen.The dreaded ragwort is the only one which shouldn't be there. Common Ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) is a specified weed under the Weeds Act 1959. It contains toxins, which can have debilitating or fatal consequences if eaten by horses and other grazing animals.Ragwort may need to be controlled when its presence and the likelihood of it spreading to neighbouring land poses a risk to horses and other grazing animals or land used for the production of forage. We pull it out wherever we see it. I've seen farmers do so in rough patches of harvested woodland, simply because these woodlands were adjacent to pasture.We stopped and talked to several dogs; they and their owners commiserated with us. We also met Harriet, a member of a Valley's End family, none of whom could be considered to belong to the sharper tools in the box. \"Where's the dog,\" she asked. When we told her, she said: \"Aaah, that's sad, so now you have to go out with each other?\" Harriet is one of these people who are said to possess a heart of gold. Perhaps that's why she ends every conversation with a platitude. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"you must feel very sad.\" We agreed. \"Ah well,\" she said, \"never mind.\" We also met Bill. Bill had advice for us. \"Get a new dog, now, right away; don't hang about. That's what I did, when the last one died.\" Bill twitched his neck in a military fashion, causing his toupee to slip a fraction. \"Does Bill have a dead gerbil on his head?\", somebody, who should know better, unkindly asked the other day. I am sure that Bill loves his little cairn terriers, but he only takes them on when their breeder owners are finished with them and the dogs are very old. Bill is a kind man, but at 90 years old his capacity for  lavishing unconditional love on any creature - other than himself, that is - has probably shrunk.We left them to go their way and we went ours. We bid several more people good morning but avoided  getting into conversation. In a small place like Valley's End any kind of news travels fast and although all comments and messages are well-meant and kind, not all are therefore sensitive."},
{"title": "A Year in the Life Of A Lady Gardener -  August", "date": "Saturday 4 August 2012", "text": "It's time to apply a little healing balm in the form of good honest dirt; gardening is a wonderful therapy for a sore spirit. During July's rain, mini heat wave and exhausting sadness the appeal of work out of doors  was greatly diminished. It's true, the  doughty and determined gardener does not let a little thing like inclement weather and a breaking heart get in the way of her obsession; perhaps I'm made of flakier clay. Yesterday, Gardener turned up again after an absence of two full weeks, in the pouring rain, ostensibly to 'find out how Benno is', but also feeling a touch guilty for having let the grass grow to great heights on the lawn.  Looking out of the kitchen window we could see a promising patch of blue sky appear in the West and, sure enough, not long afterwards the rain stopped.Fortunately, times have changed since the days of Elizabeth von Arnim, ladies are allowed to do their own gardening; I believe, even rich and aristocratic ones. Elizabeth wailed, in her hugely successful book \"Elizabeth And Her German Garden\":  \"I sometimes literally ache with envy as I watch the men going about their pleasant work in the sunshine, turning up the luscious damp earth, raking, weeding, watering, planting, cutting the grass, pruning the trees - not a thing that they do from the first uncovering of the roses in the spring to the November bonfires but fills my soul with longing to be up and doing too.\"Doing it yourself means that you have no-one to blame for mistakes or negligence; Elizabeth's garden would not have had paths resplendent in a healthy crop of dandelions or a totally overgrown rose border, where the lavenders, planted at the foot of the roses and meant to complement their delicate colours, had been choked by eager volunteers and the rampant growth of perennials which were supposed to have been cut back many weeks ago.Neither would Elizabeth's gardeners have allowed an unknown creature to make a fine filigree of the leaves of all her hydrangeas bar one, a very tough and leathery leaved specimen.Gardener and I mercilessly ripped and pulled and dug, until all the vegetative miscreants had been removed and taken to the compost bins via the trusty wheelbarrow. Maybe I will be a little less kind to volunteers in future. I am not sure that I can salvage the lavenders. Truth to tell, I had totally forgotten that I had planted some of them as far back as mid-way through the border, a mistake I hope not to repeat.August is the month when many of the early hardy perennials have 'gone over' and it is not quite time for their autumn replacements. In common with many keen gardeners and garden writers I dislike the artificiality of carpet-bedding. Gardening is about thinking, planning ahead, visualising; a deeply creative activity. Gertrude Jekyll said: \"For planting ground is painting a landscape with living things and I hold that good gardening takes rank within the bounds of the fine arts, so I hold that to plant well needs an artist of no mean capacity.\" It is always possible to add a container with bedding plants to fill temporary holes, as I have done here, by filling a large terracotta pot with petunias. This is an experiment, I have never done so before. 'Petunias', even the name sounds sickly and petulant. Now, pelargoniums are a different matter altogether, I love the continental balconies and window sills dripping with great hanging sheets of them, big and bold and eye-catching. As I don't have a balcony my pelargoniums - some of you may know them as 'geraniums' - sit on the terrace, taking pride of place.For all you tender bedding plant lovers out there, I'll admit that this pot of petunias is a cheerful sort of gap-filler; I might reconsider my dislike of them. But I swear they'll never get into my borders.If there's anyone who wants to see more carefully chosen pictures of my garden go and visit Susan at Prufrock's Dilemma. She and Josie were careful to exclude all holes and weeds."},
{"title": "How Muttley Became Benno And Lived Happily Ever After", "date": "Tuesday 31 July 2012", "text": "Once upon a time a boy and a girl fell in love and because Valentine's Day was just around the corner they wanted to give each other a special present. Life together was shiny and bright and promised eternal bliss. What better token of their commitment to each other than to add a new life to their household, a brand-new puppy, a bouncy, furry, bundle of joy, a labrador, just eight weeks old. Their idyll was complete. They forgot that both of them went out to work during the day, but the boy took the pup out early in the morning and late at night and they were happy with this arrangement. Muttley, for that is what they called their new toy, was less happy; being locked up indoors was very bad for his social training. He never learned to play properly and made no friends.A year or so later the boy and girl had a baby, and for a little while things improved. Muttley was taken out during the day, together with the baby, but soon the new mum found it quite difficult to cope. Although his owners didn't ill-treat Muttley, they had little time and even less money available to spend on him; he was an extra mouth to feed and, by now, a large presence in a small flat, for he had grown to his full size.Things got worse, the boy and girl started to fall out of love with each other and there were many rows. Muttley became nervous. The day came when the little family broke up and the girl moved to a room above a Chemist shop in a small town. She took the baby and Muttley with her, which meant that his walking hours became even more restricted; problems multiplied, it was difficult to take dog and baby up and down the stairs, access to green spaces was limited and money got scarcer. Muttley's great size needed feeding, he grew very thin.Just then Muttley's luck changed and a guardian angel in the shape of a dog rescue lady appeared. She decided that enough quite definitely was enough and Muttley needed a new home. She knew that Friko and her Beloved had lost their own, very much loved, Boris, another great hulking black labrador, a few months earlier, and could probably be persuaded to take him on.  She was right, these rescue ladies know exactly how to coax prospective owners into giving up their freedom!At the appointed time Beloved and I, in the company of the rescue lady, knocked on the door to Muttley's home and he appeared, instantly made for the corner opposite the narrow entrance and peed; I tell you, he peed and peed, and peed yet more, until the whole area was flooded. I've never seen a dog, before or since, stand on three legs, at an impossibly slanting angle, for that length of time. Automatically we stepped back to save our shoes. When he was finally done, he stood, uncertain what to do next and stared at us.My first thought was \"He's ugly, what a misshapen object!\" Overlong legs, a long body with the ribs sticking out, with a small head stuck at one end and a thin, wispy tail at the other. The usual, thick labrador ruff, the cuddliest bit of the breed, was entirely missing. Oh dear me, we had already agreed to take him back with us, we couldn't possibly change our minds now. Besides, I have never been able to reject any creature out of hand. The girl, sad-faced and thin herself, handed us a large bedsheet holding a dozen or more dog toys, all of them originally children's toys, but no food. All she said was that he hadn't been fed or taken out 'today'. Luckily, we knew that we had some of Boris' food left in the garage.Muttley jumped into the open back of our car without much fuss, but he whined all the way back to Valley's End. When we got home we found out why: he was desperate to relieve himself further. He made for the nearest green space, one of my prized flower beds, and deposited a large turd, probably half a week's worth.  Only then could we coax him to come into the house.He was very nervous at first, but he soon learned to appreciate the hand that doles out regular meals. Even so, one of his first actions in our house was to steal a loaf of bread. He was absolutely ravenous. Another thing he did was to take up residence under the kitchen table; perhaps that had been the only safe and free space in his previous home.We hated his name and he became Benno on his second day with us. He absconded only once, following a family with children into the village, but, as the rescue lady had prepared a tag with his address and phone number for him, which he sported on his brand new collar, a nice man brought him back to us. He never tried to escape again, although he could easily have done so. His appearance changed, he filled out and tail and ruff became those of a proper labrador within six months. Benno flourished, his coat grew shiny and his eyes bright. Eventually, he lost his nervous habits and he became totally attached to us. He had his own passport and crossed the Channel to Europe in the back of our car. He never made any doggy friends, although he got on with all of them, but he loved people and was happy to be taken for walks by quite a few of them. On the way back, though, he invariably ran off, leaving them way behind in his eagerness to get back to his own home, his mummy and daddy (okay, scoff, you cynics, I don't care), but most of all, his feeding bowl.And so endeth the story of my darling Benno-boy, who died yesterday, Monday, of lung cancer. His end was peaceful. The picture above was taken on Sunday evening.It is purely co-incidental that this post happens to fit into this week's edition of Tess Kincaid's Magpie No. 128"},
{"title": "Interim Report", "date": "Wednesday 25 July 2012", "text": "Eleven-thirty at night and I am just switching on the computer to see what, if anything, has happened in my comment section and to check for emails, prior to getting ready for bed. The house is fairly quiet, I can hear Beloved in the hall downstairs, talking to Benno. I expect they are getting ready to come upstairs.Then a thumping, thudding noise, as if a heavy sack is being dragged on the stairs, bouncing on each step; a yelp of distress and a final bump.\"Are you there? Can you come? Quickly!\" A plaintive call, with a hint of suppressed fear in it, reaches me in my study at the other end of the house upstairs. I rush to the top of the stairs and the wheezing, whistling, choking noises are appalling; it sounds as if Benno is suffocating, each breath harder to force into his lungs than the last. Beloved is crouched on the bottom step, above  Benno, who is in a heap on the floor, trembling and struggling for breath, utterly panic-stricken. In trying to climb the stairs his arthritic hind legs have lost purchase and he tumbled down, on his belly, scrabbling madly for support but unable to stop himself, landing seven steps down, back at the bottom. Mummy Friko instantly springs into action, or rather slips to the floor next to Benno, cradling his head, holding it up, stretching his legs out from under him and murmuring a flood of reassuring, calming, idiot, endearments into his muzzle, stroking and laying on hands. The laying-on-of-hands is not a joke, I've done it many a time when he has been wracked with stomach cramps, it worked, at least until I could send someone for Buscopan tablets.Eventually, Benno calmed down, his breathing, which has been pretty laboured for several weeks now, evened out and he managed to get back into the living room under his own steam. No more stair climbing for Benno. For the past three days I have slept on a hard, narrow sofa, downstairs, with him on the rug in front of me.The vet's tests have been inconclusive. Benno has an enlarged heart chamber and some fuzziness on the lung, neither of which is supposed to be immediately life-threatening. He does not have laryngeal paralysis, so the extreme shortness of breath any time he moves is a puzzle. He eats well again, the diarrhoea has stopped, but now he hardly pees, when before he could pee for England, for minutes at a time. His heart and lung tablets don't seem to be doing a great deal yet.I don't know what to do. I am exhausted, looking after him every minute of the day is wearing me out. I can't settle to anything, all appointments are cancelled. Instead of cheering myself up by reading some light book I chose Anne Enright's Man Booker Prize Winner \"The Gathering\", a dark tale full of miserable people living miserable lives; I don't really like \"Irish\" books, there's too much furtive and unpleasant sex in them, the sleazy, fiddling with kids sort, and the unhealthy, breeding-like-rabbits, marital sort, joyless, passionless. Apart from that, I am keeping busy in a joyless way myself, doing laundry and other mind-numbing tasks around the house. I simply don't know what to do. Benno has another vet appointment on Monday -  vets are like dentists, both are surely filthy rich, I am glad I get my own treatments off the NHS, otherwise we'd be on bread and water. One thing is for sure: Benno is unlikely to get much better; at 12 years and 5 old months he has done well for a labrador. (I even got his age wrong the last time I mentioned him here,  made him one year younger; I daresay the wish was the mother of that statement.)I am also fed up being on this treadmill of misery; at least my own news is good: the urine tests were normal. I knew they would be, I haven't got time to be ill myself. The damp patches have been examined and found to be reparable - at a cost, naturally -  so I will soon be able to be really rude about builders.Could somebody out there please make me laugh? I am so grateful for the wonderful, supportive comments that my misery post called forth, soon I will come and reply and visit again; in the meantime forgive me for being a bad blogger. (I am fighting the urge to feel guilty as hard as I can) Thank you all for being such lovely friends, what would I do without you to open up my heart to. Soon it'll be decision time, but for now I have no idea what to do for the best."},
{"title": "S&P*L$U^TT*E_R)&@^R^A+G=E=@**SIGH", "date": "Wednesday 18 July 2012", "text": "Everything is going wrong.Benevolent gods keeping home and hearth safe, the kindly spirits supposed to look after our animals, and the guardian angels we thought we could personally rely on, all have forsaken us. We have been abandoned and left to fend for ourselves in the teeth of bitter winds blowing through the threadbare fabric of our house, exposing us to the whims and wiles of builders and plumbers, veterinary surgeons and medical practitioners.Where to start? At the beginning, when the dark clouds gathered above us - concentrating most unkindly on my innocent head and sending me into my old familiar black hole - I ignored the signs. Depression does that, it allows you to feel miserable in peace, whatever else is happening around you is of secondary importance next to your own overwhelming melancholia and inertia. But then the dog, who had been breathing hard and coughing for a while, became worse. \"Hayfever\", said I and the vet agreed. But antihistamines didn't work. \"He needs steroids,\" said the vet.The house too had been sending out distress signals for a while. Mainly the aroma of damp and mould. Kelly came, rummaged in the broom cupboard to extricate the vacuum cleaner from the narrow space and asked, \"Have you noticed the wet patch on the wall in here?\" I try to use the broom cupboard as little as I can, that's her job, but yes, there was a large wet patch, and to judge by the marks, it had been growing for a few weeks. \"Talking of wet patches\", Kelly continued, ever keen to be of use, \"the bit in the cupboard under the eaves is growing too. You should have it checked out with all the rain we've had.\"\"Rain damage?\" Beloved's ears pricked up. Although his hearing is not what it was, the possibility of insurance cover miraculously restored it - only temporarily, of course; he still holds an imaginary trumpet to his ear every time I address him with a polite request for a small favour. Alas, the insurance company sent their assessor who turned us down flat. \"This leak is of long-standing\", he said, (or should that be 'long-running'?), not our responsibility\". Builders called and sucked in their breath through their teeth, hard. \"It'll cost you\", they said. \"And have you noticed how rotten the window frames on this side of the house are?\" Nothing if not helpful, these builders. Yes, we had noticed, but we'd been hoping that the problem might go away if we didn't examine it too closely. After all, there's more to life than studying the frames of eight large windows, which might, or might not, need mending or replacing.Benno got sicker. Was it the effect of taking steroids? He is the cleanest dog imaginable, but desperate to get from upstairs to a door to the outside,  he dribbled diarrhoea all down the stairs and finally abandoned all attempts at civilised toilet habits on the oriental rug in the downstairs hall. He was so very ill and unhappy, he broke my heart. The stairs have been cleaned, the rug was hosed off in the garden and is now awaiting the sun gods to dry it. Benno is still very poorly, his breathing is rough and he still has the runs. Even a diet of boiled rice, chicken breast fillet and boiled eggs hasn't had any effect. Tomorrow morning he is off to the vet's for x-rays and tests under anaesthetic. Naturally I've consulted Google for possible ailments, laryngeal paralysis is the most obvious candidate for a labrador of his age. I am not happy. I've already spent an hour howling and it hasn't even happened yet.The good news story is by no means over, my GP (doctor) demanded my presence at the surgery. \"I don't like the result of your kidney tests much\", she said. (SHE doesn't like them, what about me?) Twenty five years ago I had kidney failure, but have been in remission, without any problems, for about twenty years. \"I think we'll keep an eye on the protein in your pee\" (only she said urine, being a doctor); which means, that to supply her with a regular sample, I have to pee into a jug and siphon off a dribble into a tiny vial provided for the purpose. At least I get a short walk in, taking the vial to the surgery. The woman also complained that I wasn't getting enough exercise now, what with the dog being old, Beloved crippled with arthritis and my computer duties having taken the place of regular, healthy, outdoor activity. That is, when I'm not stuck down that black hole ignoring the computer.I tell you, fellow bloggers and dear readers, there's never a dull moment in this house. In all the excitement I've even dragged myself out of that black hole, but I'm only just sitting on the edge and it'll take no more than a slight shifting of the buttocks to slip right back in."},
{"title": "Living Like A Grown Up", "date": "Tuesday 10 July 2012", "text": "wisewebwoman, who really is a wise woman - I can vouch for that, having admired her sensible, as well as entertaining, posts for a number of years now -  set me pondering with her recent post Living Like A Grownup. What does living like a grownup mean? I would hazard a guess that whether one stays in pyjamas for hours, or all day, isn't really very much to do with it, although in my comment I told her that I always get dressed, invariably, every day, unless I'm sick and have to stay in bed. Equally, I always make my bed, comb my hair, feed the dog, take out the rubbish, cook lunch and wipe my feet on the mat coming in after I've been outside. I also stopped wiping my snotty nose on my sleeve long ago. All very boring, predictable, proper. As an adult, I have the freedom to indulge myself - providing I'm not breaking the law of the land - which is what children envy. \"You can watch what you want on TV, why can't I? Why do I always have to go to bed when it gets interesting?\"Being free to do what I want doesn't make me a grownup. So what does? I suppose I could leave aside all the most obvious answers like being responsible for your own laundry, doing your duty by your annoying mother-in-law, eating healthy food, letting your best friend weep on your shoulder when her man dumps her for the third time and not saying \"I told you so\", and never forgetting anybody's birthday.I used to pontificate about young people being responsible for their own actions, i.e. not getting away with saying \"I didn't know I was doing wrong\" when they reached fourteen, but I've mellowed; I now let them get to fourteen-and-a-half before I advocate that the penalty for playing loud music, bunking off from school, ignoring the advice of old ladies like me and uttering unintelligible grunts instead of polite replies, is being taken out and shot at dawn.I once lived in a long and intimate relationship with a man who never even got to fourteen. No crime he ever committed was his own fault, there was always someone else to blame. If he couldn't shift the blame, he staunchly maintained that the crime was no more than a minor misdemeanour, and I shouldn't make a fuss. And his final excuse, to which I really never had an answer, was \"I couldn't help myself, it's who I am\". Years of patiently explaining the difference between right and wrong got me a blank stare and a shrug of the shoulders. He was not a Grown Up.Since then I've never really thought about what could be called living like a grownup. Is it having the courage of my own convictions? Looking after those in my care? Accepting responsibility for my actions? Children can be kind, so kindness is not always a sign of adulthood. Adults can be very unkind, rough and irresponsible. Wisdom is not given to many. Maturity does not always come with age.The fact that I can sit here and type these rather futile and quite probably unanswerable questions into my computer and send them off into the web and that there are those of you who read them and perhaps think about them for a moment and come up with your own questions, does that make us grownups?If only it would stop raining and I could go for a long walk; I'm sure I could come up with an answer.Can You?"},
{"title": "The Crafty Peasant", "date": "Sunday 8 July 2012", "text": "Chilmark Hay, 1951by Thomas Hart BentonTess Kincaid's Magpie Prompt No. 125Once upon a time there was an honest peasant who was also particularly crafty, even more so than most of his kind. He took on, and beat, the devil at his own game, which was no mean feat, I can tell you.One evening, after a hard day's work, just as the church bells rang for vespers, the peasant was making his way home to the village, when he saw a heap of steaming manure in the middle of his field. He went to investigate and, to his utter astonishment, saw a little black devil sitting in the midst of the live heap.\"You sit upon a great treasure there,\" said the peasant.\"Yes, indeed,\" said the devil, \"worth more than all the gold and silver you have ever seen in your life.\"\"It's my field and therefore the treasure belongs to me,\" said the peasant. \"Be off with you this instant.\"\"Not so fast, young man,\" said the devil. \"I'll let you have it under one condition: give me half of everything your field produces for two years, and the treasure shall be yours at the end of it.\"The peasant did some thinking. He didn't want to go telling lies but gaining the treasure was very tempting. \"Wait a minute,\" he said to himself, \"half of everything? Fair enough, there are halves and then there are halves.\"\"You're on\", the peasant said to the devil. \"Let's establish some ground rules first, though. Everything above ground shall be yours and everything below shall be mine.\"The devil was satisfied with that, but when it came to harvest time, the devil was left with a pile of yellowing, useless, leaves, for the crafty peasant had sown turnips. While he made away with a wagon load of them, the devil danced about in fury, swearing he would make sure the rules were reversed the following year. \"I'm willing,\" the peasant said. He had been planning a change from turnips anyway, so he sowed wheat. The grain became ripe and the peasant went into the field and cut the stalks down to the ground until there was nothing left for the devil but the stubble.Realising he had been outwitted by the simple peasant yet again, the devil, in his shame, spontaneously combusted and sizzled and fizzled down into a cleft in the earth and was never seen again. The peasant spread the manure over his field, thus making sure that his harvest would be excellent for years to come.PS:Last night I saw Henry IV. Part I, in which Hotspur says to his cousin:And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devilBy telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.And then there were the Brothers Grimm, elements of whose tale I may have borrowed, not quite accidentally."},

I never feel guilty about neglecting housework, but as that doesn't start with a G, I shall leave that thought aside for now. In fact, I'll do away with guilt for the purposes of this post altogether and stick to gardening.Allium HeadIt's July, the one month in the year when the gardener sits back in a comfortable garden chair in the shade of the old plum tree, enjoying the balmy summer air, glass of Pimm's in hand (or whatever summery drink lights your candle), the sound of a drowsy bumble bee ferrying its heavy load of nectar from blossom to welcoming blossom,  the only discordant note being gardener pushing the mower across the daisy strewn lawn.

When Beloved spies a crack in the clouds and for a few seconds the gloom brightens to let a ray of light through, he shouts for me to come and bear witness. \"Look, sunshine,\" he says, pointing to the apparition in the sky. He is still trying to persuade me that they have sunshine in the UK, \"honest, we do\".Valley's End and fields under their usual cloud coverThe rain makes for a green landscape and abundant growth, but it is rather hard on fruit and crops, as well as flower producing plants in the garden. Even the shrub roses daren't open their buds, those that do, find those beautiful big, heavy, double blooms simply rot away at the end of their stems. Everything is late. Instead of sitting back and enjoying the fruits of my labour, I rush out at every opportunity and cut back, prune, rip out, dig up and eradicate unwanted growth; in other words, I destroy rather than create. That's gardening too - it's not all dead-heading, snipping flowers for the house and picking sun-kissed berries to eat straight from the bush. Gardener and I anxiously watch the weather reports,  hoping for a dry hour or two on our designated working day. The garden police in the shape of Ms Prufrock is coming to inspect things; just my luck (after many a post bragging about the beauties of my garden) that she should appear in a summer as unsuitable for gardening as the current one. Heigh-ho.She'll have to make do with the beauties of the landscape, what she can see of it under the permanent cloud cover.Gardening is never dull, unless you give it up as a bad job. One is constantly battling nature and rarely, if ever, wins. I am going to create a new series of posts, A Year In The Life Of A Lady Gardener, perhaps once or twice a month, where I will tell it like it is, worms and caterpillars and pernicious weeds and all. There might even be the odd pleasant moment.In the meantime, this is what I found written on a coaster sitting under a mug of tea in a friend's house:If you want to be happy for a short time, get drunk,happy for a long time, fall in love,happy for ever, take up gardening."},

Staff gave chase, caught up with him, found that he had stolen a baby alarm for which he could have no earthly use. The police was called.He was arrested. Well known to the cops as a drug user, who had been arrested for possession many times, they searched him and promptly found a package containing heroin. He was charged with theft and the usual possession. One cop, who had dealt with him before, asked why he had stolen the baby alarm when he was well supplied with stuff already.\"This shit's no bloody good, innit, it don't effing work; I been done.\" The young man was highly indignant. \"Can't effing trust nobody no more.\"He was taken into custody and his stash sent to be analysed.The brown stuff turned out to be top grade dog biscuit, ground up."},
{"title": "Musicians -  The Platform Manner", "date": "Thursday 28 June 2012", "text": "Sir Simon Rattle and The Berlin Philharmonic at the Royal Festival HallMud From A ScraperNo. 5 in an Occasional SeriesAside from all considerations of individual and orchestral technique, there is a strict code of behaviour on concert platforms which has evolved through many generations of musicians. Failure to observe it results in the offender being branded as a beginner. The correct attitude of mind assumed by all members of orchestras is one of vague resentment, directed indiscriminately at the programme, which could be shorter, the management, which could be less grasping, the rest of the orchestra, which could be better, and the conductor, who could hardly be worse. No true professional admits to any enjoyment in his work, though the opus in question may be one of the few he really likes; should any aspect of contemporary music be mentioned in conversation, all remarks are of a deprecatory nature.The correct posture, except for front desk players, differs from that which is taught at the schools of music. The left elbow of violin and viola players rests on the left hip or any other convenient object, and the right arm is held as low as possible. Cellists and bass players conform more nearly to the scholastic ideal, as it is not possible for them to hold their instruments any lower; instead, they lean on them in the most relaxed manner.When there is a prolonged pizzicato passage, the violinist, and the violist, puts his bow on his knee, and either turns his instrument so that his chin is resting on its ribs, or lowers it altogether, supporting the scroll on his knee, with the button or end-pin, on the middle of his waistcoat.It is generally understood that if the conductor wants any extra refinements, he will ask for them. Whether or not his requests will be granted is another matter. A professional rarely uses vibrato, save on the longest notes, and when particularly exhorted to do so. Anyone who does so too often is, again, branded as a beginner, because vibrato, besides being useless in many passages, is never specified in any contract, and musicians are specialists in the art of working to rule.No-one normally uses a different style from his neighbour, as there is rarely enough room on a concert platform. Most performers habitually harass their neighbours for a few extra inches. Cellists are especially sensitive to lack of space, and indeed, develop a form of claustrophobia if any other instrumentalist comes within a bow-length of them.  There are similar customs among the pit fraternity in theatres and opera-houses. Apart from never having enough room, the pit musician never has enough light, and constantly complains to management and electricians. In contrast with the symphony-player's preference for a well hidden position on the platform, the opera-player struggles to be placed near the audience, so that he can better watch the stage. Or when he becomes bored, which is his natural state, he amuses himself by fitting tunes of a frivolous nature to the accompaniments of the most impassioned arias.The pit-musician will show interest only in the length of an opera. He may have a hidden preference for Aida, but will enjoy Traviata more. He may not have much sympathy with Puccini, but La Boheme is always popular. The Ring is unspeakable, and Meistersinger is beyond the pale. He only really likes one opera - Salome, which is over by 8.45 pm."},
{"title": "Why Are So Many Of You So Much Better Off Than Me?", "date": "Monday 25 June 2012", "text": "source: articlesbaseEuro 2012 and the 'beautiful game' and now Wimbledon - how is a girl to find time for blogging?  I am fair worn out with all the excitement.  Since England were defeated by Italy on Sunday, I can breathe more freely again; at least Germany won't have to meet England in the semi finals. It wouldn't bother me but for the hysteria in the media; it's the evil Hun and the plucky little Englander all over again. Now it's Germany meeting Italy next Thursday, it should be an exciting match, so exciting, in fact, that I won't be able to watch it.However, let's leave that for the moment. There's something else which is causing me to scratch my head. This is what I'm thinking: why is everybody in blogland having such a fantastic life when I can barely drag myself from day to day?The vast majority of the diary-type blogs I read talk about the splendour and fun of their everyday existence. Nothing ever goes wrong. Depression? Bad days? An unsuccessful attempt using one of your artistic talents? God Forbid. There are  ravishing adventures,  exotic cruises, beach holidays, stays in expensive hotels, marvellous road and boat trips; every wedding in, and out of, the immediate family is perfect, babies are the sweetest, well-behaved ever; jobs come flying out of mid-air, they are satisfying and well-paid;  adult children are successful in their professions, their lives progress according to plan, their marriages are idyllic.  Not only that, but these children cannot do enough for you, they come running selflessly to offer help every time you sneeze. Your leisure hours are filled with deeply enjoyable activities and any voluntary work you do brings rich emotional rewards. You are perfect cooks and homemakers, the teenagers, whether your own children or grandchildren, are like no teenagers before them, they are polite and love their grannies and grandads with true devotion.Crises? Self-doubt? Lack of Confidence? Perish the thought! An off-day? Not at all, remaining positive is the name of the game, even if it kills you.I am fortunate in that I have a few real-life friends and acquaintances who are just as grumpy as me sometimes, whose projects go pear-shaped, whose kids can be a pain, whose husbands/wives are impossible, whose holidays get rained off and for whom  the thought of more of the same is enough to drive them to drink, or at least, to binge themselves sick on chocolate.But those of you, for whom life is one long sequence of joy, won't you tell me how it's done? I'd love to try my hand at perfection. Perhaps I too could become the sort of person who can do more than barely hold things together."},
{"title": "Presents", "date": "Thursday 21 June 2012", "text": "Present: something given or received as a gift. OEDI'm not sure I like gifts, but  I like to receive them more than I like to give them. It's easier. All the same, I am happy to do without them. It was different when I was young; there were few gifts then, other than at Christmas or my birthday; I had wish lists, usually of books, and would have been very disappointed not to receive them. As an adult I no longer think 'presents' are important. By presents, I don't mean tokens of appreciation, they are essential between people in any kind of worthwhile relationship. I suppose we all have different attitudes in such matters. I find present giving difficult; there are few people whom I know well enough to choose a present they will truly value, all other presents are a waste of time and money. It takes me a long time and much searching to find a gift for those I love; I take present-giving rather seriously. Receiving is easier, I can make suitable noises of appreciation and frequently mean them.I was reminded of the whole present-giving business because it was our birthday last week. Beloved's eyesight has been deteriorating for several years now and he finds reading small print difficult. So what is he given for a present? : a book or three, to add to the pile waiting to be picked up. I am lactose intolerant; people know this. When deciding what to give me, they go out and order an expensive handmade cake with lemon curd and handmade chocolate truffles. Beloved is a civilised sort of chap, his reply to the giver of an unwanted present is invariably: \"how very thoughtful of you\". The giver is much moved by this praise and redoubles his/her efforts to give even more of this kind of gift on the next occasion. I view my gift with a slightly less polite expression on my face; putting some heartfelt regret into my voice, I say something like :\"oh dear, how very kind of you, but I am sorry, I can't eat this\".A friend of mine with very little money used to give me 'useful' things, small, inexpensive gadgets. I collected them in a box, where they joined other such items from other people. Recently I was able to pass them on, unused and mainly still in their original wrapping, to a dog charity. The lady was very pleased; \"we'll keep these for Christmas, we should be able to sell them well\", she said. This means that some other poor soul will be given photograph coasters and a set of cheese cutting/slicing knives.If I have no idea what to give but a present must be made, I ask. You may accuse me of being sensible to a fault, but I promise to go out and find the requested present, come what may. Surely that's better than guessing and getting it wrong? Of course, it would be kinder if you didn't ask for anything that takes a lot of effort finding.Having got this rant off my chest there's one thing which remains to be said: I received a very prettily packed parcel from a fellow blogger and friend Renee and inside I found this unusual gift: a calligraphy pen and a small bottle of ink. I have been practising my calligraphy but I have a long way to go before I get anywhere near proficiency in, much less mastery of, the art. The one thing I won't do is put this gift into the waiting-for-a-suitable-recipient-box."},
{"title": "Best Things in Life", "date": "Monday 18 June 2012", "text": "Best MomentBest MealBest EscapeBest bookBest guilty pleasureBest career moveBest bad habitBest life lessonIt was reasonably dry yesterday and Beloved and I took ourselves off for Sunday lunch. We followed a previously admired chef and his wife to their new restaurant in an old pub, the Plough Inn at Wistanstow; whereas their previous hostelry was small and intimate, this pub is large and featureless, modernised out of all recognition. The food was mediocre. Why do English pubs insist on serving 'roast meat and two veg' on Sundays? And if you call yourself a 'dining pub' shouldn't you at least get such simple fare right? Come on, British Pub Lovers, complain! It was Father's Day, the place was busy; perhaps we were the only guests not entirely happy with the food on offer.Continuing the pleasures detailed in the previous post I canreport that invitations to two supper parties last week provided us with food vastly superior to the Plough Inn and many other pubs. Both parties were given by single people and, coincidentally, we were joint guests with the same couple at both.  Contrary to the delightful Jane and Lance Hattat's experience, we here at Valley's End try to provide food which is entirely edible for our guests; in fact, if cooking is a problem for any reason, the host might serve a meal partly prepared by a professional and finished off  in his or her kitchen. We too reassure each other that we get together primarily for the company, rather than the food, but if these dread words are uttered at your party, you know you have failed miserably.Andrew had invited us to dinner 'at 7.30 for 8'. I've overlooked such instructions in the past and gone for 7.45, to be on the (guessed at) safe side. This time I actually looked up Debrett's Guide to Correct Behaviour for Every Sphere of Social And Business Life, which has been sitting, more or less ignored, on my shelves for many years. And lo and behold, I did the right thing all along: 7.45 is a good time to arrive for dinner at 8. No host, including myself, has ever managed to get people away from the pre-dinner drinks sofa and to the table for the exact start of the first course; it is best to allow for another 30 minutes cooking time. Another good thing is to feed people small appetisers to mop up the alcohol, or else the start of dinner might be messier than you anticipated. You can always cut down on quantity of the individual servings later.So what makes a good dinner party? Andrew is an excellent host, one of my favourites; his food is delicious: we had a crusted crown of lamb as a main course.  If all is well, food is actually a topic of conversation and wine labels and vintages are much admired too. \"Who is your merchant?\" is by no means an indiscreet question round here. However, I'd agree with Jane and Lance that the chosen company is the main ingredient for a successful evening.  You need at least one easy talker to start proceedings, in this case our Welsh Professor of History certainly was the one. He was there again at Pauline's party a few nights later, but as there were three great talkers and arguers among her guests, the evening was extremely lively. Beloved threw a concerned glance in my direction once, but I was not the only one who made his eyebrows rise. I believe that Pauline had had help preparing the food; it wasn't mentioned, of course, but we enjoyed it no less than had she cooked all of it herself, possibly more so. A stuffed salmon isn't the easiest dish to cook to perfection.Both Andrew and Pauline are lavish dispensers of good wine, which helps to lighten inhibitions, not that the assembled guests had any to start with. As always, discussion was free and easy, not everyone agreed with everything said and it was wonderful to argue late into the night. At Pauline's, another guest and I re-fought the feminist wars of the 70s. Sue and I can never agree on modern women's attitude to feminism. Sue believes young women today to be as involved as we were, whereas I think that these women have long lost their appetite for the scrum and hanker for a life of docile domesticity. Perhaps we're both wrong and the truth lies somewhere in the middle.Literature never fails to come up, there are too many graduates of Eng. Lit. in this crowd. As Bloomsday was near, James Joyce was mentioned, and it transpired that only one person in six had read the whole of Ulysses or Finnegans Wake, and this person was Beloved, who has no formal higher education other than the study of music at the Guildhall in London. The longer people go to university and the more degrees they amass, the narrower becomes their field of interest. (Yes? Discuss)I expect social life will quieten down for a bit now. Everybody is working towards the Open Gardens weekend at the end of June and holiday season is upon us too. If I get bored, I shall have to get out my cookery bibles and consult my diary."},
{"title": "Rain Did Not Stop Play In Valley's End.", "date": "Friday 15 June 2012", "text": "Rain? What rain? Oh, I see, that rain; the sort that falls incessantly, for a week or more at a time, and leaves the underfoot sodden and causes a growth explosion overground. It also turns every view into a soft-focus chocolate box image; green, oh, so green, in a myriad of variations. Is it possible to get so used to it that you greet every stray shaft of sunlight with astonished delight? I believe that the drought has now officially been called off. All it needed for the heavens to open - and stay open - was for the water companies to impose stringent bans on consumers on all forms of water usage, always excepting their own wastage of vast quantities through burst pipes. I daresay they'll find a way to increase prices shortly due to an over abundance of water.But this is not a post about the weather, although it's hard to get away from it. It's a post about being busy. Like I said in the previous post, lots of nice things happen in summer and the past week has been delightfully busy. There's been gardening, of course, in spite of the weather. Every unexpectedly dry hour, particularly during the long, light evenings, saw me happily ripping out knee high weeds by the barrow load; the compost heap is growing. Gardener's preferred day is Friday, Thursday was predicted to be slightly drier, so we brought our working morning forward - it's no longer a full day, neither of us can now put in an eight hour shift.Just look what the rain has done to my Nevada rosebush. I have never seen it flower as profusely as this. Each bloom is as large as a lady's handkerchief. (You know what I mean by handkerchief,  the sort of delicate piece of material we used to carry before the advent of nasty but efficient paper tissues.) I'll leave a description of some joyous social occasions for another post but there was a wonderful thing that happened to me on a visit to the hospital, of all places. During an eye examination a young and pretty Polish nurse practitioner was taking my details and uploading them into her computer. We chatted a bit about living away from home - we foreigners tend to do that - in between questions, when she stopped, peered closely at the screen, ceased typing and said: \"there's a mistake about your age here.\" When she told me what it said, I assured her that there was no mistake. \"No,\" she said, \"that can't be;\" she shook her head. \"Yes, I can accept that you are over 50, but . . . . . . .\"  I let her flounder. She swivelled her chair round, looked closely at me and said, quite seriously: \"You obviously take very good care of yourself\".There you are folks, it helps not to go back to nature. The reason for my obviously shiny exterior was possibly that I had been for a facial treatment as well as a body massage during the week. They also say that rain keeps the complexion bright. On the other hand, I got a lift to the hospital in a very beautiful car, a £70.000 Audi (when new) by one of the community car drivers - I couldn't drive myself on this occasion because eye drops made my sight extremely blurry. The driver had stopped by our house the previous day to make sure he had the right address. I saw the car and promptly decided to put rubber boots and jeans away for the day and wear a rather smarter outfit. And ear rings!I love it when things come together, don't you? And that was only half the week."},
{"title": "Books And Talking About Them", "date": "Sunday 10 June 2012", "text": "Living in the English countryside, even as far away from easy access to cities, and therefore centres of culture, as we do, is not as bad as one might expect, once the season of summer festivals is upon us. And not only festivals gladden the heart, people also rediscover the joys of entertaining and to those who belong in such circles, invitations to luncheons, tea parties and suppers are issued with as lavish a hand as at Christmas; the only thing missing is the tinsel. Bunting is not usually in evidence, although at present, post-Jubilee, there are still traces of such misguided decoration visible;  ones friends would never indulge in such obvious bad taste. Naturally.The annual two-week, not-for-profit literary festival at Hay-on-Wye is nearing its end. The festival celebrated its 25th year with a grand programme of international writers and thinkers; Hay-onWye is the bibliophile's Mecca, every second house is stuffed full of books for sale, and it's a must-visit little town at any time of year for us.I am not so fond of writers who only come to publicise their new books and spend their allotted hour on reading excerpts. Jeanette Winterson was one who did just that. She is a good speaker and very funny and although \"Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal\", her new memoir,  is certainly a book I shall buy, I didn't need her to read quite so much of it. I loved her first memoir/faction, \"Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit\" and this book promises to be as good.An interview with Mario Vargas Llosa, the Peruvian writer who won the 2010 Nobel Prize for literature was more to my liking; he spoke about his life as well as his latest oeuvre, a book on Roger Casement, the humanitarian campaigner and Irish patriot, revolutionary and nationalist, whom the British executed for treason in 1916. The friend I was with had interviewed Llosa for the BBC when he stood for the presidency in his country. She won't mind me saying how very ineffectual and lack-lustre Llosa had been on that occasion, almost as though he was hardly interested in the job at all.He spoke well, although he kept saying lee-gends instead of legends, which confused me at first. (Okay, I know I'm being petty.) The good thing about these readings, interviews and lectures, is that members of the audience can question the speaker afterwards and Llosa certainly didn't have it all his own way.A.C. Grayling is a less well-known name; I enjoyed his lecture because anyone speaking on reading and thinking, without visible support in the form of lecture notes, has my vote. Grayling is a philosopher, he has probably given this lecture a zillion times before; but it was the first time I heard him and, although he said nothing earth-shatteringly new,  I agreed with every word he said. It probably means that he was one of the few speakers at the festival whom I could follow easily; sometimes I feel such a fool when both the people on the stage and in the audience leave me sitting in dumb ignorance. I should have got used to it by now, it happens a lot.Leaving Hay-on-Wye we took the route back into England via the toll bridge at Whitney-on-Wye, just a few miles down the road. The toll house is a Grade II listed building and the board has the following message:In November 1774 a bill was put before Parliament for the erection of a bridge over the river Wye at Whitney. Between 1774 and 1795 three bridges were built, each with five stone arches. All were in turn washed away by floods.In July 1796 a new bill was put before Parliament proposing a fourth bridge with the three centre arches constructed of timber. The timber specified was Greenheart, noted for its durability.The bridge was a privately funded venture and remained with the same family and its descendants until sold in 1981.The present owner bought it in 2002 and kept the Tolls unchanged at their 1990 levels. The Auto Toll was introduced in 2004 and local charities benefit from surplus funds.Income is tax-free and estimated at £2000 per week. I believe the bridge is back on the market  as of 2012.

{"title": "The TV Diamond Jubilee", "date": "Tuesday 5 June 2012", "text": "Source: The Daily MailWho else is glad that the Jubilee celebrations are done with?Although I've had no hand in any of it, didn't go to any street parties, saw no beacons being lit and didn't get soaked standing around in the rain for hours,  I sat in front of the TV, oddly mesmerised by the whole spectacle, unable to get up and switch off. Let me say that I admire the Queen for her endurance, stoicism, stamina and well-bred patience, and her acceptance, with impeccable grace, of posturing and obsequious nonentities. I saw her crack a genuine smile just a few times, mainly when she was speaking to family or those of her entourage she knew well, she also had a benevolent eye for the young who were singing and playing for her and she truly came alive on the balcony, during the fly-past. Otherwise she looked what she is, an old lady got up for the occasion, standing her ground and doing what she does well, waving a languid, white-gloved hand at the adoring, shrieking crowds.The pageant itself was quite a spectacle, but it could have done without the inane comments by the BBC commentators. I know they have to fill their two minute slots over and over, but I lost count of the number of times they mentioned the weather, each time emphasising, that being British inures one to the drenching rain and 'no British spirit can be dampened by it', then turning round to the poor miserable crowd behind them and asking them to show their enthusiasm, which they duly did,  instantly waving their little banners and screaming. I loved the boats, all valiantly sailing up the river in the pouring rain, the man-powered ones deserving our special appreciation, but the BBC coverage of the event was truly tedious. I like a bit of gravitas and dignity on these occasions, but  most of the commentators were minor celebs and newscasters who didn't have a clue what they were talking about. Some even made bad mistakes, which showed they had done little in the way of preparation.The concert was a bit of a let-down too. It's not only the Queen who has aged over the past sixty years; we had the Sirs, Cliff Richard, the skeletal would be Peter Pan,  the utterly grotesque Elton John - looking more like a queen than the Queen, and Paul McCartney, croaking and squeezing out his notes, rarely hitting the one he was aiming for. The only one of the older bunch who still has it is Tom Jones, but then he actually started out with a powerful voice, whereas the others were always lightweight singers. All of the performers, old and current, with the possible exception of the military bands, were put in the shade by the special effects, which were truly amazing. The front of Buckingham Palace became a magnificent screen for displays of colour, light and shade, endlessly shape-shifting, abstract and realistic in turn. My bottom was turning numb, but I sat through it.A bit of dignity was restored by the thanks-giving service in St Paul's Cathedral and the drive back, in coaches resplendent in gold, to Buckingham Palace, after an intimate lunch for seven hundred at Westminster Hall today. The Royal Family was much reduced, only the Queen, and those immediately next in line, Charles, William and Harry, and their spouses appeared on the balcony. I wonder if that's something to do with protocol or if all the other family members, who had graced the event with their presence, had gone back to their respective homes.After three days of pomp and circumstance, endless renderings of Rule Britannia, Land of Hope and Glory and God Save The Queen, this lot of Panem et Circences is over; Royalist or Republican, the Queen deserves our respect for staying the course, not only during these three days but for the sixty years leading up to the beanfeast. I cannot see her job other than mind-numbingly boring and spirit- sapping. I hope she gets a chance to kick off her shoes, loosen her corsets and take those pearls off. I hope Prince Philip makes it and that they can soon sit back together on the sofa with a nice cup of tea and look at the photos. Perhaps she'll say: \"you had to be there.\""},
{"title": "Man's Best Friend", "date": "Thursday 31 May 2012", "text": "My Benno is getting seriously old. At eleven-and-a-half - the 'half' is very important in a dog's life - he is old for a labrador, and it shows. Summer's heat is doing him no favours, every step, even in the cool of the morning and evening, causes him to pant heavily, deep in his throat, with a harsh, rasping sound. His hind legs are withering with arthritis, and when he forgets that he is old and tries to jump about in greeting or excitement, they give under him, and he falls over. I found him in great trouble yesterday, collapsed on the floor, all four legs sticking out at right angles, unable to get to his feet by his own efforts. I gently arranged his legs so that I could push him over on to his side, from where he eventually managed to get upright again. But he was seriously distressed, issuing soft yelping notes, which broke my heart. We've tried various medications, but nothing seems to make much difference. Apart from that, he appears happy and is terribly keen on his food, like most dogs and certainly all labradors.The bond between human and dog runs deep. It's around 14,000 years since Stone Age hunters domesticated Canis familiaris - humans have had a long time to perfect their relationship with dogs. Today we say that a dog is man's - and woman's - best friend, a buddy for as long as the animal lives and a great sorrow when that life comes to its end.Having a dog keeps us young, they are good for blood pressure and waistline. regular daily walks keep owner and dog in trim. Dog owners are always glad to stop and talk to each other, which is good for mental health too, they rarely suffer the unremitting loneliness of the wholly solitary human; forced to go out, they meet other people. Walking a dog is a fail-safe device for an ad hoc, unthreatening approach to strangers. When, as a woman, I'm out in the fields and woods walking a dog, coming across a man on his own in a lonely spot instantly turns from a potential reason for flight-or-fight syndrome to a no-threat, cosy 'hello, nice day' encounter.There is an unbreakable bond of love, trust and companionship between a dog and its human. In exchange for food, shelter and care, the owner receives lifelong loyalty. Even a dog who is ill-treated is utterly loyal and will protect its owner with every ounce of muscle strength and a full set of snarling teeth. Farmers are known for their lack of sentimentality towards animals - just think of whole flocks of once cute, gambolling little lambs, squeals of piglets and soulful, deep-eyed calves  euphemistically 'going to market' - and they don't always treat their working dogs kindly, but I have yet to see a border collie or gun dog repay its master with disobedience.Dogs don't run off with a new partner. They don't stab you in the back. They don't turn into surly adolescents or become uncaring, neglectful adult children. They don't argue, they never nag, when they hear your footsteps their tails thump the floor in welcome and they turn ecstatic somersaults the minute you walk in the door, after you've left them on their own for a while. You could say that dogs are creeps, but I prefer not to. They love a cuddle and have an unerring instinct for your state of mind. They will fill any emotional vacuum in your life with trusting eyes and unconditional warmth. Sigmund Freud said  his dog gave him 'affection without ambivalence, the simplicity of a life free from the almost unbearable conflicts of civilisation ... a feeling of intimate affinity, of an undisputed solidarity'. I couldn't have said it better myself :-).I'm praying for cooler weather and no thunderstorms. Benno fears all loud, unexpected noises, thunderclaps in particular. If there should be some, you can be sure that two elderly humans will be crouching on the floor, huddled protectively over their even more elderly dog, making soothing noises."},

As always, all photos may be enlarged by clicking on them.Perhaps I've relaxed and/or matured, but I've decided not to worry too much about what Americans so aptly and endearingly call 'volunteers': that is self-seeders in the more prosaic English English. These are Welsh poppies, hugely prolific, they appear everywhere and are well-nigh ineradicable, unless you poison them. I don't want to do that, and in previous years I've gone round, either digging them up, but always necessarily being forced to leave a bit of their fleshy roots behind, or snipping them off above ground and thereby leaving the lemony green. deeply serrated leaves but not the golden flower cups. Leaving them alone I have both leaves and flowers and, no doubt,  twice as many of them next year. Que sera, sera.Laburnums are very hard to photograph in their full splendour. This one is only just out and will turn even more dizzying in a day or two. Their German name is 'Goldregen', (golden rain) and that is exactly what they look like, a shower of dripping, shimmering, golden tassels, gently swinging in even the lightest breeze. For most of the year the tree is boring but for three or four weeks in late spring it is a wonderful sight. Beware, blooms and seeds are toxic.More gold: this time a large leaved hosta and a golden grass, both do well in semi-shade (like most gold-leafed plants) and both bring a darkish corner to life like a golden neon light. Hostas and ferns are my favourite plants; I like shade gardening although dry shade is considered to be among the harder areas to cultivate.Now for a bit of red: my Peppe poppy, my very own cultivar of a poppy which doesn't exist anywhere else - I have given it away to other gardeners. It was developed in this garden in Valley's End. It is a spectacular, tall, blowsy primadonna, which, if left unstaked like here, flounces and spreads its skirts over a large space, smothering everything around it, proclaiming brazenly \"I'm worth it\". Once it's finished flowering, I cut it down, leaving maybe just one seed head for propagation. The plants around the poppy breathe a sigh of relief when Madame has been pruned back to manageable proportions.The long rainy spell in April and the recent heat wave (we have a week of warm sunshine and it's called a 'heat wave') have brought everything on in leaps and bounds. Shrubs and herbaceous plants are occupying every inch of ground, which is good: they swallow up and hide weeds, which saves me a lot of back-breaking work. This sock is not home-grown, it came in the post from a blogger whose Mutti produces such excellent and colourful socks by the dozen, with no effort at all, not something I could claim for myself. I was lucky enough to be one of the winners in Meike, The Librarian's giveaway. The moment the weather goes back to English temperatures that sock and it's companion will be worn. The foot is home-grown, it's mine.And finally, the castle. How could I show you photos of my garden without showing you what is just outside the hedge. I've made it look far away, but it isn't;  that's the wonder of digital photography."},
{"title": "THE BIG TOP", "date": "Wednesday 23 May 2012", "text": "The circus with the yellow clown - 1967 - Marc Chagall This post was inspired by Tess Kincaid's Magpie No. 118The fact that I have two eyes is due in no small measure to my decision, at fifteen and a half, not to run away to the circus. It was my long-haired Dachshund Seppl whose routine daily afternoon walk took me the short distance from the flat where mum and dad and I lived  - that is, if indeed they were my mum and dad, which, in spite of the large nose dad and I shared, I still doubted very much at that time; too often they declared themselves shocked by my outrageous behaviour for me to be able to own them as my parents  - via a tree-lined double avenue to Sproedental Platz, a large open area, where after the war the town's rubble had been deposited, now long cleared away.  During Advent, tree fellers brought christmas trees for sale, but most of the time the Platz was empty.  Twice a year, for three days, the Kirmes came, with its roundabouts and dodgems and Karussels and pickled herring, fried fish and sausage and potato cake stalls. The aroma of the food could make you faint with longing and if your money lasted until you had squealed in delighted horror at the mermaid, the fattest woman in the world or taken a ride through the cob-webby, smelly, dimly lit, cavernous chamber of horrors, happiness was complete. For anybody with a boyfriend the big wheel was an ideal trysting vehicle; when you were stuck at the top - and every one of the gondolas was for a short time -  a brave boy would squeeze your hand and plant a wet kiss somewhere near your mouth. It rarely happened to me, boys were always put off by the gagging noises as I fought off nausea induced by acrophobia. Besides, kissing was sex, and sex was something we giggled over nervously; things were different in those days, we believed that necking could get you pregnant and French kissing was the absolute depth of depravity. Everything was different then, the long summer holidays lasted for an eternity, until school was no more than a fading memory, French and Swedish films were our extra-curricular education, an ice cream for two cost 50 Pfennigs, blue jeans had only just become acceptable wear, and parents never got down with the kids.In spite of the wonderful life to be had with the Kirmes I never felt the slightest desire to elope with any of the boys who jumped on to the back of the dodgem cars to take our money for the ride.The circus was entirely different, it came to town just once a year. Placards appeared on advertising columns weeks before and two days before the big top went up, riders on horseback, and a few tumblers and clowns paraded through the streets on their way to Sproedental Platz, where these foot soldiers soon got to work  preparing the ground for the rest of the caravans, the animals and the performers and artistes, who, after the final bow after the last performance in the previous town themselves got busy dismantling and loading the big top. The Great Orlando told me that everybody at the circus could and would turn their hand to any and all jobs, even the stars of the show, the trapeze artists, the knife thrower and lion tamer, the high-wire dancers, the white faced clown as well as the ring-master were expected to muck in.When I arrived with Seppl on the day the circus came to town, the Platz, normally empty, had become an exotic wonderland, caravans were neatly lined up, vans were being unloaded, animals exercised and fed; there were people carrying water and bales of straw, muscular  men were heaving long poles about and uncoiling vast rolls of rope; I had the impression that here was a body of work being done that had been done hundreds, perhaps thousands of times before, the organisation was perfect, as if everybody was a cog in a well-oiled machine. As I slowly walked by, people briefly looked up and smiled, saying Guten Tag, before they carried on with what they were doing.I noticed The Great Orlando right away, he seemed remote from this controlled ballet of activity. Sitting on the steps of a white caravan he had a large, flat box on his knees, out of which he lifted a number of knives, rubbing each one down with a rag until the blades shimmered like polished silver. I stopped to watch. Looking up, he smiled, like the others, and said Guten Tag. \"What are you doing?\" I asked. \"Ich bin der Messerwerfer,\" I am the knife thrower,\" he said, \"I am taking care of my knives.\" I was talking to The Great Orlando himself, I knew it must be him because I had seen his picture on many of the placards. He took pity on me. \"Is that your dog, he is very handsome,\" he said, \"what's his name?\" I was in at the birth of the circus, in the company of the knife thrower and the man wanted to talk about my dog? Where was the romance in that? I realised he was quite old, at least 30, and that I would have to take the initiative and ask questions. \"Yes,\" he said, \"I ride a horse round and round the ring and throw knives at a target. And then I get off the horse and throw knives at a target disc with a target girl pinned to it; at the end of my act the disc with the girl spins round and I throw knives all around the  body of my partner.\" I was envious of the girl already. \"Do you ever miss\", I asked hopefully. He laughed. \"I hope you will come to the show, and find out\", he said. Ah, yes, that would be a problem. I wasn't allowed to go out at night and I didn't have enough money to pay for a ticket anyway. \"I have to work now\", he said, \"but come back tomorrow and we'll see what can be done.\" Wild horses wouldn't have kept me away even in the ordinary course of events but having been invited to return by The Great Orlando practically made me a member of the troupe.When I returned the next morning the big top was up and all was ready for the afternoon's show,  die Kindervorstellung - the reduced show for children. I wandered about; the smell of wild animals reached me from one end of the camp, following the scent I saw an elephant lifting a beautiful young girl, sitting on his trunk, high up in the air. The lion tamer was feeding his animals large chunks of red meat and two boys were grooming horses. A boy and a girl were working with a group of monkeys.  The lion tamer waved me away. \"The animals need to be quiet, they don't like strangers coming close\", he said in a gruff voice. \"You'll find Harry in the tent.\" Harry? who was Harry?I entered the big top and The Great Orlando waved me over. \"You can call me Harry,\" he said, \"what's your name?\" \"I'm Eva,\" I said, \" and I want to join the circus.\" Harry smiled, he had the most wonderful way of crinkling up his eyes as he did so. I had seriously fallen in love with him overnight.\"What would your parents have to say to that?\"\"My parents wouldn't care, they just don' understand me and I can never get anything right for them anyway.\"\"Still, you'd have to have their permission. Unless you are eighteen?\"Darling, wonderful Harry, who thought I might already be eighteen!Harry decided that I should go home again and think about joining the circus very carefully. To help me make up my mind he invited me to the afternoon show and allowed me to wander about at will, so long as I kept away from the lion tamer, who, according to Harry, was a grumpy old man and not very fond of Harry, because he liked to be jolly and have a drink after work. The others wouldn't mind me being around, provided I didn't get in the way.The afternoon show was dominated by clowns, Pierrot and August being the main characters, surrounded by tumblers and jongleurs, children on horseback and on the high wire as well as a few trapeze acts. The Great Orlando rode his horse and threw knives at the large disc and I saw the pretty girl riding on the trunk of her elephant. It was a fun show but disappointing too, I had seen most of these acts about the camp during the day. The ringmaster in costume, cracking a very long whip, was still the jovial, slightly avuncular, slightly potbellied man he was out of costume; the show needed the romantic shadows of evening and the brilliance of artificial lights to bring the glitter and glamour to life.  Afterwards, I found Harry's caravan, knocked on the door and, when he opened it, I told him so. Harry had a glass in his hand. The sparkly costume made his face look tired.The circus was in town for the whole week, Saturday evening being the final show of the run, a gala performance. I spent every spare minute at the camp; even the lion tamer got used to me. He took me aside once and said \"Be careful, Eva, Harry is not a suitable companion for you, you are far too young and you are not the first girl to hang around and you won't be the last.\" I shrugged my shoulders. This was exactly the same sort of talk I got from my parents, these adults were all out to spoil my fun. Harry had been very kind and friendly, not at all threatening. The more I saw of him and the artistes and the more I was allowed to see of their daily routines, the more I realised how hard they worked, how little romance there was behind the glittering façade. I still wanted to join the circus, be part of the wonderful companionship and camaraderie born out of a need to rely on each other; each member of the troupe being 100% dependent on every other.  But perhaps it would be better if I waited a little, finished school first, as Harry suggested. The children and young people I saw had all been born into the life, had been raised to perform and trained almost from the day they took their first step. Harry gave me an address which would always reach him and promised to reply to any letter I cared to send.When Saturday came I was very sad, Harry and the others would be on their way to the next venue a day later and Sproedental Platz would be cleared as if the big top had never stood there. Harry had a wonderful surprise for me. He had a ticket for the Saturday Gala for me, front row, the best seat in the house, opposite the entrance to the ring, within foot shuffling distance of the sawdust. I begged and pleaded with my parents, who finally gave in and allowed me to go, threatening all sorts of retribution if I didn't get home within ten minutes of the end of the performance. I sat in my seat of honour and all the performers, who could do so without interrupting their act, played to me for seconds, the clowns did a little set right in front of me, the elephant dipped its trunk and the girl winked, the tumblers pretended to fall over the railings and land on me, and the ringmaster cracked his whip almost in my face. Harry's prancing horse did a curtsey and he bowed from the saddle, lifting his hat to me. I loved them all.Harry and I did indeed exchange a few letters. He sent me colourful postcards from places abroad, places I could only dream of; holidays for the masses were still a thing of the future. Gaps between cards became longer and one day I saw a small paragraph in the paper:  In Milano, Italy, during a  performance, a great tragedy had occurred.  The Great Orlando, famous among circus folk all over Europe, had misjudged a throw and accidentally blinded his partner, the girl on the spinning disc, in one eye. If I remember rightly, I sent a letter telling him how very sorry I was. I never heard from Harry again.PS: there have been comments asking if this is a true story. It is."},
{"title": "Beauty Salon Blues", "date": "Friday 18 May 2012", "text": "Image: Hair with ScissorsGood Housekeeping Magazine'Hillary Clinton has gone back to nature',somebody mentioned on a blog.I forget where I saw it.Perhaps it wasn't a blog,perhaps a newspaper said it.After all,a woman's age and her appearance,are always worthy of a snide remark.I don't want to go back to nature,my old face cannot take the weight of it.The girls at the hairdresser's are young,they look the part, beauticians,polished, licked and smooth of face.No beauties, though,their faces emptied of intelligence and humourby artifice;boyfriends and babies, last night's reality tv,are topics of their conversation.My temporary girl,a raven's plumage on her head, pink cheeks,a missing chin and vacant eyes,attempts to turn my rat's tails into a Roman helmet,while what I wanted was a simple, quite old-fashioned 'bob'.Highlights and lowlights she can manage,my grey is nicely hidden,but while she cuts and snips and layers,her blank gaze swivels from my head,as if controlled by magnets,to moving shapes beyond the windows,huddled against the rain,and I resign myself to being made to look likesomeone other than myself.The mirror she holds up confirms my fears,my head is smooth and shiny, the helmet fixed in place.She smiles at me, 'that's better'.  I nod weakly.I pay her, tip her (why, she hardly even tried to please me).'Five weeks' ?, she asks.I gather all my courage, ask 'when will my girl be back'?I feel so mean, I hesitate, not wishing to offend her.'Not for a while', she says, her face fixed on the pages of the diary.'What is a while' I ask, a little braver now.'A long whi-yelle' she says, two syllables, the emphasis on 'yelle'.I slip my card into its slot, and close my diary.'I'll ring you, round about five weeks', I say.A coward to the end.Go back to nature?

{"title": "Why Blog ?  -  Addendum", "date": "Wednesday 16 May 2012", "text": "Thank you, dear readers, for your comments on the previous post. For the first time since I first started blogging, when I had no more than a dozen comments ever, I have replied to each of you  directly following on from your comment. It was a lot of work which took me several hours and I would be grateful if some of you could go and read my replies. It also means that I haven't had the time to visit your blogs as well; I will remedy that as soon as I can.Could those of you who regularly reply to comments (other than the nice pics - thanks for sharing - wow - good post - variety; or the comments which consist of copied and pasted bits of your original post with a couple of additional, complimentary words), tell me if you find readers coming back to 'collect' your replies? I found it interesting to read and think about your comments and reply right away. It leads to further examination of the original reason for the post and engaged me in a - hopefully not entirely one-sided - exchange with you. But it makes the whole blogging experience even more time consuming. I'd be grateful for your thoughts.I would also ask those of you who have decided against replying directly to comments to please explain your reasons, if you have them. Blogger has given us this Reply button now and I wonder how many have newly thought of using it. My inclination is towards a genuine exchange with commenters on the posts which would benefit from it, but others might find it irksome to have to return to a post they are done with. Would a compromise, where only those comments which raise a pertinent point receive a reply, be the way to go? Gardening, photographic, memes and other lightweight posts would be excluded; perhaps a quick sentence at the end of the individual post would be useful? Or is the whole thing too cumbersome and complicated?"},
{"title": "Once More With Feeling : Why Blog?", "date": "Sunday 13 May 2012", "text": "The last post on this blog appeared on April 30th,  14 days ago.  [The one announcing temporary retirement doesn't count.]  After three and a bit years of fairly regular entries,  I needed to sit back, take stock and weigh up the pros and cons of this rather time-consuming pastime. I know I'm not the only blogger who questions their need to impart to a more or less indifferent readership their innermost thoughts - never mind about the outermost trivia of our daily lives. which, surely, even the most dedicated egomaniac cannot imagine to be of interest to others outside the circle of their own families and close friends. Why do we blog? Because we can? Are bloggers the mountaineers who, when asked why they climb Mount Everest, say, 'because it's there'? And when we say that 'we make friends', or that 'we start a conversation', or that 'we exchange views' and that 'we learn from each other', how much of that is true? And if it is true,  does it whet our appetite to pursue these interactions with persons of flesh and blood rather than virtual acquaintances? I fully realise that contact with the outside world is a boon for the house-bound and ill, that those of us who find it difficult to make friends in real life find like-minded souls, who pound their keyboards and send messages, sometimes meaningless, sometimes supportive, informative and interesting, back and forth in the ether. Blogging must answer a need in all of us, otherwise we wouldn't bother. Personally, I like the idea of being connected; the fact that it is at a distance and at a time of my choosing, makes it even better. I certainly have made friends; at least I hope so.During the last 14 days I read far more than I've done for quite a while, gardened, had friends to dinner and went out to them for meals, joined meetings of the writing and poetry groups, actually watched the whole of 'Homeland' series one (please tell me there is another one), and am well into the first series of 'The Bridge' on TV, and had long conversations with Beloved over breakfast and dinner. Even though I have done little serious writing,  I spent a lot of time thinking about my memoir, adding and discarding and sorting out ideas. I could do all that because  I had no blog to 'service'.  That's how it feels to me at times: I have to service my blog, or else I'm lacking in duty, disappointing all those who are breathlessly awaiting my next set of  polished words [yeah, right], and heaven forbid, I might lose followers. Idiot woman - talking to myself here - when did you forget that you can never please all of the people all of the time? And that not pleasing yourself makes you far less likely to genuinely please anyone else. Pious frauds, who sacrifice themselves in the service of others - and make damn sure that these others know about it - are the most loathsome creatures.In part it was Jocelyn's ( O Mighty Crisis ) post entitled How Do You Wander Into That Room Of Your Own' which precipitated both the temporary withdrawal and this rant. Jocelyn isn't actually querying the validity of blogging, she is asking some very reasonable questions, which made me realise that my attitude towards blogging has become slightly obsessive. (Can anything be 'slightly' obsessive? Or is it like being 'slightly' dead ?) Go and read Jocelyn's post; in fact, read her blog, it's good, and for those of you who need to chuckle at all times, it's also mainly funny. Also, it's a touch more demanding than most. I do, however, wish to quibble with the title of the relevant post: Virginia Woolf's Room Of One's Own  was a very private place, exactly the opposite to the open door policy of the web where anyone can enter at the click of a mouse; where lack of privacy is positively virtuous, the first law of the triple w. Staying with Jocelyn, I pondered the following questions:Why do I write blog posts?  Because I have a blog. Why did I start a blog? Because I thought it might amuse me. I also thought I could write a sort of personal history which would be of interest to my children. I was wrong about the latter, my children either never read my blog (too busy - yeah, right), or lost interest and only catch up very occasionally. Fair enough. I also admit that the personal history posts are few and far between these days. That's where the memoir comes in, or will, if I ever get it finished. Anything I write, on the blog or elsewhere, I write for public consumption; I want somebody, anybody, to read it. It's even better when people tell me they like what I write; lots of you who read my blog say they do - very gratifying - and I also get people complimenting me on articles in local publications, and not only those who owe me dinner.When do I write? How do I find the time?  I write anytime, but particularly late at night, in my study, which is upstairs, at one end of the house. Sometimes the dog joins me, but he keeps his opinions to himself and never interrupts a thought process. Ideas float around in my head constantly, if I'm lucky I have a bit of paper handy to jot them down; many are useless on further examination, some are filed for future reference and a very few are outlined. Blogposts appear out of nowhere, although the retrieval bucket has had to be lowered much further recently, scraping the bottom of the well once or twice.Do you choose not to write about certain subjects?  On a blog? You bet! There are events, thoughts, past embarrassments and mistakes lurking in my shadows which I could never air in public. Blogging is   public. I may only know a very few of you by name and will never meet most of you, but even accidental reminders of these crass stupidities cause hot flushes to rise that beat any hormonal sweats; displaying them deliberately would be credibility suicide.  Using the stuff in a story is an entirely different matter. Faction is a miraculous tool for the memoirist; everybody knows that writers adjust their own lives as they go along.I also regret that several people in Valley's End know that I write this blog. There are times when a fellow inhabitant deserves a special mention but I don't want to be unkind, at least not recognisably so. I'll do it if I can get away with it. There's always WordPress, of course.Having had this time off I must admit that I missed sitting bent over the computer, writing posts, checking blogs, reading comments, commenting myself. All things being equal, I'll still be here another three years from now, churning out deathless prose. Perhaps not obsessively, perhaps not as often, perhaps a little more measured. Stay tuned.If anybody is still reading  this, I'd like to point you in the direction of Arlee Bird, a man with oodles of followers, at Tossing It Out,  who asked his many commenters what they did with other bloggers' long, long posts:  read, skim, ignore. I couldn't be bothered to read many of the comments [it's late and I'm not that fussed], but I think a lot of bloggers are scared that they might look off-hand and uninterested, so they're kind about posts like this, which ramble on and on without having much to say for themselves. I would have given up a long time ago. We are far too kind and well-behaved in the blogland I frequent. I'm still looking for the rougher neighbourhoods."},

{"title": "Eat, Drink, and Be Merry . . . . .", "date": "Monday 30 April 2012", "text": ". . . . a conflation of two biblical sayings: ecclesiastes viii. 15 (AV) Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry ‥ and isaiah xxii. 13 (AV) Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we shall die. In Works and Days Ralph Waldo Emerson writes “Just to fill the hour – that is happiness. Fill my hour, ye gods, so that I shall not say whilst I have done this ‘behold an hour of my life is gone,’ but rather ‘I have lived one hour.’”Never have I known anyone to whom both the above maxims apply more thoroughly than Gisela, my one remaining flesh-and-blood [rather than virtual] friend in Germany and her partner Dietmar. When her call came on Sunday morning, it shocked me to the core. Gisela and I have been friends for more than twenty years, although we haven't met for the last eight years and our correspondence has dwindled to no more than two or three letters a year, a very rare email and the occasional phone call. And yet, our friendship remains close and fresh, and any time we reconnect we are instantly back on the best and warmest terms. I've known Gisela for longer than she has been together with Dietmar and I had the great privilege of being someone she confided in when they first fell in love.Gisela is one of my mail-order acquaintances. I have no problem writing to total strangers, answering advertisements from total strangers or getting in touch with official bodies for advice and help. Depending on the tone of your letter, you are likely to get a surprising number of positive replies; I can say that I have never had anything but courteous answers, even the negative ones were invariably polite.When my mother died, I suddenly felt cut-off from all contact with my home town and even Germany. Having been an ex-pat for many years, I had lost touch with all former acquaintances;  I felt dreadfully homesick and full of fear that my past and all connection with it was disappearing. I felt as if the ground had been pulled from under my feet, that I was free-floating in no-man's-land. I did what I always do: I sent an SOS. Not in a bottle but in a letter to the Oberbürgermeister, the highest civic public dignitary of my home town. He read it and very kindly handed it to his secretary, who in turn handed it to the Press Office. I described who I am, what my situation was and that I hoped they'd find a way to publish my letter, which might, in turn, inspire someone to write to me. A kind of superior pen friend, who shared my cultural and leisure tastes. Naturally, I explained what kind of person would most suit my needs. It's always best to be as clear as possible, in order to weed out unnecessary complications. The Press Office put an article in the local paper, including my letter. They also started to send me regular bi-monthly collections of articles which they considered of interest to former inhabitants who now lived abroad. In those days of plenty, towns had a budget for such things; alas, times have changed. But there was one action which proved to be the most fortuitous for me: a bright spark handed my letter to the head of English at the local Volkshochschule - an academy for adult education -, namely, Gisela. She saw the letter, decided she wouldn't mind getting to know this crazy person who wrote unsolicited letters to the highest in the town and kept it for herself, rather than pass it on to her students. I met her a few weeks later and our friendship blossomed.I have been in awe of her boundless energy, enthusiasm, optimism and joie de vivre ever since, and when she teamed up with Dietmar a few years later, those qualities doubled in size and range. The two of them left untried no pleasure, no new experience, no happiness. They travelled and explored the regions of the world together as well as all the delights on offer nearer home. They drew in old friends and new, both their families and children (both were widowed), anyone they touched with their infectious enthusiasm came away richer for the experience and determined to try to emulate them. In every photo I have of them, whether at their cosy fireside at home, in a circle of friends, on skis in the mountains or cycling and walking in all weathers, their wide open smiles are the first thing you notice. Smiles that are unposed and natural, not the usual photographic cheesy grins. Theatre, music, books and sports, they embrace it all, jointly and separately. In her last letter Gisela describes their travels of the previous year, taking in a walking tour on the Rhine, high above the river, with frequent stops for a revivifying glass of local wine, a couple of  trips to visit children and grandchildren in Austria and Liechtenstein, and an exploration of Vietnam and Myanmar in September and October. Their last trip ended just before New Year's Eve. Just reading her letter left me breathless. Compared to the two of them, Beloved and I are dull and lifeless.Yesterday morning Gisela rang. As it happens, I was in the process of answering her last letter, feeling a bit envious. Actually, 'mean' is a good word to describe my mental attitude and I was all for telling her to slow down, remember her age [ 60s], and generally carp and criticise in an underhand but ostensibly concerned way. The way envious people do, I am sure you know what I mean. I was overjoyed to hear her voice and prepared myself for a long and animated chat, instantly ditching the idea of watching a clever Arts Programme on German TV later on. The programme came and went, Gisela was still talking. Dietmar had suddenly and inexplicably lost all contact with the real world, he neither knew where he was nor what he was doing, he was unable to stand or walk, he understood nothing and could hardly speak, all in the space of two weeks. She had called an ambulance which took him to the local hospital. When the doctors there ran out of tests and ideas, Dietmar was transferred to the Charité in Berlin, the foremost hospital for research into neurological conditions in Germany. Tests established that he had brain stem lymphoma, inoperable and terminal. They tried to buy him a little time with chemo and radiotherapy, neither worked. His life expectancy is counted in weeks rather than months, but it hardly matters; although he is out of a coma, all he can do is blink and, on a good day, return a little pressure when somebody holds his hand. Gisela assumes that he can hear because music seems to bring a faint smile to his lips.After the call ended, I told Beloved. I had been unable to find meaningful words of comfort or make promises of help which would make a difference; Gisela was calm and collected, fairly matter-of-fact about the situation. True to her positive outlook she found it in her to speak of some of the lucid moments she shares with Dietmar as intensely beautiful; she will make the days left to them count as deeply as their days together since the beginning. There is to be no miracle.Faced with the inevitability of death for all of us, Beloved and I embraced each other for comfort, and, as we have often done before, we swore again never to sleep on a row, to try kindness in place of harsh words, and  laugh and cry together rather than alone.

I looked around me and saw nothing that could be the source of the low buzz; following my ears, I came upon the scene of murder most foul: a tiny spider was busily circling a still (just) living fly three times its size, the noise came from the fly's vibrating wings. Round and round the spider went, even climbing up on to the fly and spending a long time near it's front end. (Do flies have faces?) The buzzing got fainter and fainter.Eventually, the deed was done, the spider went off, under the rim of the shelf, leaving the dead fly behind. There wasn't a spider's web, there were no silver threads and I could see no nest. But I was curious to find out what would happen to the fly, why it had to be killed.I have no idea how the spider did it, I saw neither pulleys nor strings, nor any kind of mechanical device; nor did he call for his relations to come and help him shift the massive weight of the fly.But the next time I looked, the fly corpse had moved right to the edge of the shelf. There was no draught to shift it. The corpse was still there an hour later, I couldn't bear it any longer. I got rid of it.I hope there are no starving spider babies cursing me.Our World Tuesday(Sorry Folks)"},

They grow in a narrow and steep patch on the edge of the garden; in a tiny patch under a canopy of lilacs and other sprawling shrubs where neither gardener nor I ever clear the undergrowth or take our pruning shears.This concludes my search for joy; if I can find joy in the small things of everyday life, then there's hope for me. It was a useful exercise; the next time I feel disheartened, I'll try to remind myself that joy doesn't come in great fanfares but in the more muted song of the thrush and the hidden treasures lurking in the undergrowth."},
{"title": "Things That Brought Joy  -  Friday and Saturday", "date": "Saturday 21 April 2012", "text": "Dinner Party? What Dinner Party?The dishes are done, glasses have been put away, and a quick shove and push with the vacuum cleaner has made short work of the crumbs. The party was mildly amusing, not the sort where I need to sparkle and impress with my wonderful hostessy skills. Here's a tip you probably won't need: always invite a chatty person/couple to offset the quieter one. They'll do most of your work for you. All you need to do is provide decent food and a lavish pouring hand, and you're home and dry. (For those of you who asked: I gave them lemon and garlic chicken as a main course and stayed with a bought tart for dessert.)The tablecloth is my pride and joy. It is genuine handmade lace, which I bought for the price of an apple and an egg - metaphorically speaking - in an old lady's down-sizing garage sale. It had been in her family for many years and she was glad to see it go to an appreciative home. She said that very few people want to bother with table cloths and even fewer covet lace.Although it rained yesterday morning, Gardener turned up and he tidied and mulched a couple of flower beds while I got last year's dahlias out of hibernation. I put them into damp potting compost in a sheltered spot in the shed, where, I hope, they will soon sprout. I actually left some in the ground last winter and these too are showing signs of life. The tender green shoots need protecting during cold nights, I simply put an upside down plastic flower pot over them.No rain yet today,if you had this view from your upstairs window on an April afternoon, would you feel joy?Yes, me too.Tomorrow is the last day of this week long experiment in finding some occasion for joy every day. I can recommend it, all this self-absorption may be boring for the reader but for me it's been quite salutary. Even a misery-guts can force herself to see the glass half-full."},
{"title": "Things That Brought Joy  -  Thursday", "date": "Thursday 19 April 2012", "text": "courtesy the Guardian websiteToday was short on joy, perhaps I could call it satisfactory. There was lots of rain on and off, for which we ought to be very grateful. The media, the water companies, even the government are telling us that we must preserve water; many areas in the UK already have hosepipe bans in place. This is a country where mild disquiet very quickly turns to panic. On the home front, neither Kelly, my cleaner, whose daughter was poorly, nor Gardener, for whom it was too wet, turned up. I was pleased, due to a poor night I felt far too tired to do much of anything myself. How is it that my knee always knows when the weather turns wet and windy? There I am, snug and cosy in my bed, I've switched off the light and compose myself to sleep when my knee starts aching. The rest of me is fine, it's the bit that connects the thighbone to the shinbone which plays sillybuggers. I stay in bed for an hour before I try a couple of paracetamol and a massage with arnica oil : no difference. I reach for a sleeping pill. Another hour later comes the second sleeping pill. Result: the following day I am a zombie. After lunch I take a nap, what used to be called 'forty winks' is now a power nap. Beloved is very kind, he takes Benno for his walk round the castle. I very briefly watch a pair of camera-shy goldfinches do the bookends theme, but they fly off the minute my camera clicks. How can they hear this through the glass of the kitchen window? The Guardian website has a much clearer picture of the little beauties.The day was fast becoming frazzled, desultory. I tried a spot of editing. Progress on the memoir is painfully slow; I recently wrote a chapter about a very sad event in my early childhood about a stray dog and its short and brutal life and death. It took a lot of courage to take this memory out of its hideyhole and look at it in the sharp and unfeeling light of a computer screen. Writing it made me cry for the sad, lonely little child of long ago and attempting to edit the chapter today was a mistake. I must do this when I'm feeling bright and confident, it'll be hard enough even then. Tomorrow we are having friends to dinner. It is  possible that both Kelly and Gardener turn up and I won't have a lot of time to prepare a meal. I shall probably cheat and serve a bought pudding. I've already made the smoked salmon paté which is part of the starter, which means that I'll only have to cook the main course from scratch. There'll be six of us.Laying out crockery, cutlery and polishing glasses todayalso makes tomorrow less daunting.To recap: Joy? Maybe not. But I have a kind husband who takes my dog out for me. There are sweet birds to watch. I have the time to take a nap to recover from last night and I have a pleasant evening with friends tomorrow night to look forward to.And we finally seem to be getting the much needed rain."},
{"title": "Things That Brought Joy  -  Wednesday", "date": "Wednesday 18 April 2012", "text": "Today wasn't really going to be a joyful day; Beloved was due at Shrewsbury Hospital for the fourth injection into his left eye to halt the progress of wet macular degeneration. He is really brave about it and pretends it's nothing much. But I know he's nervous, so am I.It was a horrible morning with heavy rain and limited visibility and we weren't exactly looking forward to the expedition.  Driving in heavy rain is not a pleasure and I was annoyed when first a Beamer (BMW) and then a van overtook me, the former at traffic lights and the latter just as I was pulling out from behind a lorry. Both manoeuvres were rather dangerous, particularly as I am a fast driver myself. So I have to admit that I felt a frisson of joy - or perhaps Schadenfreude - when neither car got very far ahead of me at all. Why do people overtake when there's no point? The eye thing went well and took no more than an hour altogether. Beloved came out with his eye patch but otherwise in one piece, relieved that it was all over for today. A procedure that costs £900, and could save your sight, such as it is,  is free on the NHS. If that isn't cause for joy, I don't know what is. There was plenty of morning left, so I raced round one of these vast supermarkets, filling two trolleys, while I parked Beloved in the Starbucks concession. Not a lot of joy there, but it got a necessary job done.\"What are we doing for food today?\", Beloved asked when I collected him from the coffee shop.  Note the \"we\".  \"Not a lot, I haven't even thought of it\", I replied, a bit miffed that he should be finding me another job when I was still panting over the current one. \"Would you like to stop off at The Pound for lunch?\" Do dogs fart? Silly question, of course I would.  The Pound is a 15th century country pub on the road home in the village of Leebotwood which serves tasty food reasonably priced at lunch time. Two starters, one of sweet cured herring with orange, a garlic mayonnaise and glazed cucumber and one pork and apricot pate, with pickled, shredded beetroot and a brioche finger. Both came with fresh baked rolls and butter and salad garnish.Our main courses were equally good.Beloved had a chicken leg in a whole-grain mustard sauce,and I chose the whole plaice, which was beautifully cooked. We'd left Benno at home with his baby sitter. It's such a palaver to get him in and out of the car via his ramp;  he is much happier with Jay, whom he loves dearly, than to be bumped around in the boot for hours. It also means that I don't need to worry about his well-being, which gives me a stress-free day, at least as far as the dog is concerned.There you are, I knew I could find something joyful in the course of the day, if I put my mind to it. All's well that ends well."},
{"title": "Things That Brought Joy  -  Tuesday", "date": "Tuesday 17 April 2012", "text": "I hardly dare show the above picture (which I've kept deliberately fuzzy); it's a plate of chocolate which we bought in a shop in Ludlow today. You may consider this  a very poor and certainly greedy kind of joy, but as we had hardly any chocolates for Easter it was about time to restock the larder. We buy chocolates in bulk - yea, yea, I know, stop sneering, and there's no need to feel disgusted either. It's not as bad as it seems, there may be a dozen bars or so, but I shall collect them all and put them away as soon as I have finished this post. They'll go into the treats cupboard and come out over the next month, bit by bit, until there's nothing left. Oh joy!The reason for the chocolate orgy is that I've been to Ludlow for the first time in many weeks, to attend a session of the U3A German Conversation group. I don't go in winter and since March I've always been busy on meeting days. We had a lovely get-together, even the chap who usually monopolises the session with long-winded,  often incoherent ramblings, was less voluble than normal; he had a cold and possibly a sore throat; a pain for him but a boon for me. The members' fluency in German is varied and there are few rules to govern the conversation, but we do tend to stick to literary subjects when we are not having a free-for-all about events that have caught our attention since the previous meeting. I think they were pleased to have me back, I'm the unofficial dictionary, being the only native German speaker.  Obviously, that felt good, and as we also read and discussed several modern German poems I had not read before, the whole occasion proved to be a great pleasure. I shall definitely try to get to the next meeting, which is on  May 1st and I shall take with me the great socialist battle anthem \"The Internationale\" in the German translation. That should prove interesting. More joy! I do love stirring the pot.I could get used to this exercise in awareness, it works. And no, I do not see it as counting my blessings. Counting blessings is something good, even Christian; I find joy in rather more mischievous occupations too."},
{"title": "Things That Brought Joy  -  Monday", "date": "Monday 16 April 2012", "text": "Waiting in the surgery this morning to take someone home after they'd had a blood test, I poked around in my pocket for something to read. I often pick up pamphlets and throw-aways and stuff them into a pocket or bag, intending to look at them later. What I found was a Guardian/Observer leaflet with a few short articles,  issued on behalf of the The School of Life, an organisation which, apparently, gives classes and advice on how to make your life more fulfilling. Etc. etc. It's not a new concept, people have grown rich doing just that for decades. Most of what self-help advisers say is normal good sense; we could work it out for ourselves and spend the money on something more beneficial, like riotous living perhaps.This particular leaflet told you how to make the most of your time, which on any given day could involve you in 'don't check your email straight away', 'step outside of time', 'sleep more peacefully', and 'create a done list'.  As I said, no light-bulb moment here, just common sense, but the last bit of advice appealed to me. 'Set a time to celebrate what you've done each day. It doesn't need to be a list of achievements. It could be things you saw or heard that brought you joy'.  Not only did it appeal, it also gave me an idea for a week's blogposts; I'm rather short on ideas at the moment.In common with lots of people I live routinely; good days and bad slip by more or less unnoticed, time flies without leaving much of an imprint. I can see that marking joyful moments can lift a day and thereby slow down the flow of time.It's not even six pm and already I have three items to go on today's list:A glorious morning for a walk;I opened an email this morning, in which my friend Susan,of Prufrock's Dilemma,told me that she is coming to stay less than five miles away fromValley's End for a whole week in July. Sue, I've put the kettle on.Just now another friend, my neighbour Sally, came with the goodnews that she has been able to get five sets of tickets for us, for five different performances at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon, between Oct 2012 and Feb 2013. I am thrilled to bits."},
{"title": "Time Off", "date": "Friday 13 April 2012", "text": "Ash Tree Buds Bursting OpenSometimes life gets in the way of blogging. I've had a few days away from the computer, and it felt good. The man - or woman ? - who said  'stop and smell the flowers' had the right idea. Not that I've done so - the only plant perfuming the air at the moment is the yellow broom; the smell hits me every time I step outside the back door. It's impossible to take a clear picture of this shimmering, golden confection, you'll have to be satisfied with a fuzzy one. Better still, go out and find a bush yourselves. You can't miss them, they're the ones that are alive with the sound of bumble bees.Genista (yellow broom)There are jewels to be found in the garden. If you get down to their level, tulips bathed in clear April sun become light, delicate, almost diaphanous gems. A lot of  plants are still very tentative around here, April is only the beginning of spring, but bulbs are happy to bloom full steam ahead; their life span is too short for ladylike reticence.Gardener and I have been hard at it. It's now or never if we want to control overabundant new growth of wanted and unwanted inhabitants. Warmer days and a few very welcome showers have stimulated friend and foe alike to stir and stretch and test the air.\"Hey, Mrs. W., come and have a look. Is that a plant you want?\" Gardener has learned to be a little more careful lately.  He also invented a few new words. He decided that the lawn, which is mainly moss now and has very little grass - most un-English - would be a pain to 'scattify'. \"Besides\", he said, \"at least moss is always green and doesn't need cutting all the time.\" He is right. I don't mind at all that I don't have an English lawn.I also found time to go down to the river and watch the randy drakes belabour the long-suffering dilly-ducks. Three of them went after one poor bedraggled female at the same time, quacking and blustering and puffing themselves up, all of them trying to climb on and stay on long enough to make sure that any offspring would carry their DNA. The poor dillies disappeared under the weight, squashed flat and highly indignant when they finally emerged again, making for the safety of the flowing river at speed.This drake kept a beady eye in all directions, he wasn't going to let any rivals steal a march on him.It's April and there are showers. Badly needed showers. I took the time to follow the clouds, from the brightest blue skies to dark storm clouds, turned sulphur yellow by piercing shafts of sun.Figures in chiaroscuro against the late afternoon sky.It was nice to take time off from the computer, I might do it again.PS: For those of you who have mentioned the yellow broom which is colonising your landscapes:that's not broom, it must be gorse, a different shrub; wild and prolifically self-seeding, it could be a pest. Yellow broom (genista) is a garden plant without prickles and well-behaved."},

I know I have this great, unfriendly and stand-offish sign installed in my comments box, which says \"Keep out,  I'm busy\",  when it comes to awards, but sometimes, much against my will, the kinder, friendlier side of my nature takes over; it has done so on this occasion and the credit is all yours, dear Christine from Oz.Nothing comes for nothing, there are, of course,  rules attached to this award, but I am a rule breaker by nature - as well as unfriendly and selfish - so I will choose that part of the honour which allows me to indulge the 'me-me-me' side,  and throw the other rule open to the four winds, namely: anybody of the many blogs I follow with such great pleasure may appropriate the award and do likewise, i.e. inform the blog world of seven things about themselves, which they haven't already shared with the rest of us. If you could make it sensational, that would be good. Go on, I dare you.oneI was expelled from my first grammar school - probably because of my parents' political activities - and accepted by a more academic school, which caused no end of trouble.twoIn any kind of social event (here at Valley's End) I gravitate automatically to groups of men rather than women. I don't choose to do so deliberately, it just happens. Sometimes wives throw a cautious look in my direction. There's absolutely no need for them to do so.threeI am literally terrified of loud noises and men or women fighting. I will never ever stand and gawp in a crowd, but run as fast as I can from any trouble.fourI have a photograph of me standing next to the President of India in his state apartments, and while I'm showing off . . . . . .five. . . . .  I might as well tell you that I have had a very jolly and animated conversation with the Prince of Wales on the lawns at Buckingham Palace.sixI haven't sung for years. When I married Beloved, who got paid for listening to and accompanying the most perfect voices on earth, I felt too embarrassed to sing in his hearing. Before then, I sang anywhere and always.sevenMy favourite books are the kind which describe gloomy, dark and bleak lives. Scandinavians, for preference. And not just the thrillers.Some of these might repay further attention; come to think of it, do I see a blogpost or two coming on? As I said earlier, if any of you whom I follow would like to accept this award for your blogs, please do so. You don't even have to refer back to me.While I'm at it in a sort of general way, I'd like to address several of my commenters who do not leave a forwarding bloglink and also belong to the no-reply-emailers.

{"title": "Adventures during the Age of Aquarius  Part IV", "date": "Wednesday 28 March 2012", "text": "Part I  -  Part II  -  Part IIIWhen I told Lucas that I wouldn't be coming back to his uncle's fish shop he wasn't pleased. He had had great hopes that I'd be available both on and off the job; now he had to renew his efforts to find somebody willing to fall in with his idea of being an employer, while I began to look around the coffee shops of Soho for waitressing work. I lived in the Camden area of London,  a short ride on the No. 24 bus from the Westend. My fares would be low-cost and the coffee would be free, or so I hoped. Perhaps I'd even be given a sandwich as part of my pay.  I knew a lot of the girls working in the area, often spending hours in one café or another, chatting with them and listening to the music. The pay wasn't great and occasionally a customer would become a nuisance, but, on the whole, the environment was pleasant enough.I needed money urgently. My rent was due weekly and I was already a week in arrears.  I had just cashed Mum and Dad's latest postal order and stupidly left the money, all in crisp £1 notes, open on the bedside table while I was out. The house where I lived was sub-divided into rooms, with a cooker and kitchen sink on the half-landing for the five tenants to share. The landlord and his family lived downstairs. The tenants shared one lavatory in the house and a bathroom in a shed in the garden. The bath had a thick streak of verdigris running from the plughole halfway along the bottom of the tub; the landlord provided scouring cream but the discolouration was permanent. It was all very primitive and run-down. We cleaned our own rooms and were supposed to share the cleaning of the stairs and the communal facilities; the only person who made a real effort was an Irish girl who lived on the floor above; she was always complaining that the cooker was covered in grease. I never used it, so I never cleaned it. My room had been part of a first floor drawing room before the house, which was large and had been quite handsome in its day, became a lodging house. Between my room and the room next door were wide double doors, which would have been thrown open to combine the two rooms for parties and family entertainments in the olden days, but which were now provided with an inadequate lock; a hefty shove would open the door. A young couple were my neighbours, as poor as the rest of us; I never found out who they were or how they earned their living. The Irish girl was a factory worker, and there was another ex-student in a smaller room on my floor, also an illegal waitress.I have no idea who broke into my room and stole the small pile of pound notes; when I came home that evening the money was gone. I suspected the couple next door; I knocked on their door and accused the woman, who was alone, there and then. She vehemently denied any such theft and kept asking me how I thought she had got in, as she had a chest of drawers across the doorway connecting our rooms. She made rather a point of that chest of drawers, which made me suspect her even more. There was, however, no way I could prove anything and I soon gave up. I mentioned the theft to the landlord when he brought the week's clean sheets and towels; he questioned my sanity for leaving the money lying around in the first place and otherwise shrugged his shoulders. Finding a job was essential.A lot of the coffee shop owners were foreigners themselves, mainly Italians and some Greeks. Soho was a pretty seedy place, with very few of the elegant restaurants that opened later. It was very mixed, with famous clubs and pubs, as well as Chinese and Italian restaurants, side by side with sex shops and 'working girls' and their protectors. Not so different from today really, except that prices have gone up massively.  The population in the cafés was constantly shifting, proprietors were always looking for new staff willing to work for very low wages; as many of the workers were also illegals, they couldn't complain about the conditions. It didn't take me long to find a job. I think the place was called La Rocca, run by a Greek, a bull of a man, called George. No doubt, both George and La Rocca have long since gone into the great coffee shop in the sky, I cannot be had up for libel. George ran a tight ship when it came to the customers, absolutely no credit and absolutely no hand-outs, but he sometimes forgot to pay the waitresses on time, and always charged us for breakages.  He had his own table in a corner, where other men joined him, some staying for only a few moments, others sitting down with him to discuss business. Sometimes these men became loud, their voices heated; George remained impassive, clicking his worry beads, sipping from a tiny cup of Turkish coffee, an immovable and imperturbable mountain. George had impressed on me, and everybody else he employed, that we were to keep our noses out of the business he conducted in his corner, and that we were to run the coffee shop side of things efficiently and smoothly and only to come to him for help if a customer pestered us.George wasn't a bad employer, he looked after us in a very hands-off way and often allowed guitar players or one of the many small bands around at the time to come in and play for nothing; he'd switch off the music box for them; when he got tired of their noise he threw them out good-naturedly. The boys didn't seem to mind, they had had a chance to perform, and if they pleased the customers they would be given a tip.I was quite sad to leave La Rocca. One day several very fit looking young men in very ordinary clothes came in and took a table. We served them their coffee and thought no more about it. They came back two days later, sat, drank their coffee, observed and left again. This happened a few more times. They were quiet, well behaved and, in spite of behaving unobtrusively, stuck out like a pair of maiden aunts visiting one of the sex shops in the area. George saw them and the flow of men to his table stopped. He came out of his corner and chatted amiably with the customers, including the newcomers. After work that day he handed me and the other waitress, both of us illegal aliens, two weeks' wages - which was quite generous under the circumstances - and said \"sorry to have to let you go, girls, but you know how it is, better safe than sorry. Can't be seen to be breaking the law. Nothing personal and the best of luck to both of you.\" George wasn't going to endanger the lucrative side of his private business for the sake of a couple of waitresses. I was once more unemployed."},

Every year at this time I go to seek it out on a steep and narrow bank between the castle mound and the river, a  secretive place, where the grey heron has sole fishing rights anda rare curlew's mournful call can be heard.Even here, in this almost unspoilt backwater, birds and flowers are disappearing.I am glad that the few people who explore our paradise are walkers and nature lovers, who tread gently and quietly.Nearer the village, garden escapees are colonising old walls. There are people who would like to see them 'tidied' away, but, luckily, there are enough fire breathing dragons like me to persuade them otherwise.Once these delightful rock plants have taken hold, they are almost impossible to get rid of. A little judicious stuffing of crevices, when nobody is looking, helps them along nicely.Who said hooligans are always destructive?Back in the garden, things are progressing nicely,miniature daffodils and tulips are shooting up everywhere under the watchful eye of a red-hatted pipe-smoking old  countryman, my one and only garden gnome, an expensive example of the genus, who was a present from a German friend.He's made of china and has to be kept indoors until after the worst of the weather. He's likely to split his breeches otherwise.He's already done so once and has been lovingly restored by another friend, who mended his broken body and then repainted him.I would hate to part with him. Everybody is entitled to at least one piece of Kitsch in the garden; he is mine, a very much loved member of the household.This is my contribution to the wonderful site Our World Tuesday where people from all over the world show off the beauties of their own regions."},

Perhaps I should have planted it against a different background. But once the yellow fruits have set in the autumn, wall and plant suddenly appear to have been made for each other.The anemonies are hiding in the shade under the plum tree.They are small and delicate; their cheerful little faces always repay a closer look. I like the modesty of the early spring arrivals; Now we come to the reason for my happiness: All week I've been working in the garden on my own, I've been weeding and pruning, potting up and clearing leaves.Today gardener joined me and we got through three times as much work together as I did on my own.He instantly lifted the lids off the compost bins and moved in, shovelling compost from one bin into an other; removing twigs, perennial weeds, and bits of cardboard as yet uncomposted as he went along. The compost heaps are our pride and joy, nobody makes compost like we do.Here gardener mulches a border with a load we made earlier. The stuff is even better than usual because we had to leave it untouched since last June; I made some half-hearted attempts during the winter at turning the heaps but found the work beyond my strength. Leaving it to cook for an extra six months has made all the difference. Just look at that gleaming brown compost gardener has already spread over the bed. It'll make all the difference for the plants, keeps weeds down and moisture in the soil. You may think : \"what's that woman on about, why does she go into raptures over compost?\" Let me tell you once again, I love the stuff. It is entirely organic, made up of garden waste, grass cuttings, prunings and green household waste, as well as newspapers and some cardboard.Mulching is quite hard work, turning one heap and covering one border was enough for two ailing gardeners. I go in first, weeding and  'tickling' the ground with my fork; when I'm done he spreads shovel after shovel of compost.We tell each other constantly \"don't overdo it, have a break or do something else.\" Neither of us pays much attention to the other, gardener makes fun of me when I wave my arms at him in horror, and he teases me by asking \"do you reckon you could stay alive until next week? We could do the rose border.\" So we turned our attention to another border, which is madly overgrown with herbaceous perennials which have spread and coarsened into nasty, untidy and unproductive clumps. We were brutal, they had to come out. I am also keen, for obvious reasons, to make life easier; any perennial thugs, which believe they can dominate a border, need putting in their place,  \"Out with them\", I say, \"into the compost bin\"!We managed to free a small area and took out several wheelbarrow loads. Small pieces were replanted. Another thing is that I usually find the remnants of old favourites, like the stiff golden grass in the foreground, in the overgrown mess, which are carefully separated and replanted in a place of honour. The border will look bare and unloved for a while, but once spring is fully underway, plants have a way of colonising every bare patch they can find. Particularly if they can sink their roots into the cooling and nourishing layers of my home-made compost!Time for a break. Beloved makes the tea at eleven in the morning and three in the afternoon. We stopped work altogether at three.  I was barely able to stand up by then, but I'd have died sooner than admit to gardener that I was done in. I bet he was glad too. I suppose that, if truth be told, we both know that we must not risk going beyond our limit; it would be too sad if we were to be ill again. A wonderful day like today, out in the fresh spring air, grubbing about in honest dirt, creating something beautiful, shouldn't end in disaster.Cheers, I'll drink to that, although my fingers and hands are almost too stiff from battling the weeds to hold my glass."},

{"title": "Milestone Day", "date": "Wednesday 14 March 2012", "text": "Thanks, HilaryEven before I was fully awake this morning I found my thoughts wandering in the mists of a time long gone.  Today was one of those significant milestone days for us, the kind which race towards you with the speed of an express train as you get older, and which will, in the end, overtake you. I wanted to hold on to this reverie and  allowed people and situations to rise up, which happened to someone other than the me of today, not the gloomy, fearful me I have been of late. Once upon a time I was convinced of my ability to overcome any obstacle; whatever happened, I'd find a way out; I did not see myself as invincible, but sturdy and strong and as determined to flourish as the hawthorn bush clinging to an inhospitable, stoney bank.Recently my thoughts have dwelt on the difficulties that lie ahead. It seems that the future is shrouded in a fog of uncertainty; we talk but cannot come to a decision about what to do for the best. Our house is bigger than two people need, and I can manage neither house nor garden without help. Regular, permanent help is both expensive and a nuisance, relying on others has never been easy for either of us. Beloved has had to hand in his driving licence. Although I am glad that he isn't driving, it has come as a shock. We knew that his sight is deteriorating, but now it's official, real.An estate agent has given us a figure for the house and told us that, due to its location, it is eminently saleable. What she doubted was that we'd find anything comparable in a smaller size and a similar situation. We are quiet and secluded and just five minutes away from the centre of the village. Not to mention the castle in the back garden. (The header picture of this blog shows our house and the window on the far right is my study window, where I am sitting at this moment, typing this post). We only bought this house because of its situation.There is, of course, a further problem with moving. Divorce, a death in the family and moving house are the three most common contributory factors towards a heart attack. So, round and round we go on the merry-go-round of what to do, what to do.This morning my reverie brought illumination: we'll do nothing at all for the moment. Every time we look around us, we see how very desirable life here still is and how much we would miss the freedom we have become accustomed to. No noise, no traffic, unlimited access to open spaces, a friendly village and a wonderful landscape to lift the heart. I must learn to accept my limitations  - Beloved already has -, and act accordingly; I must stop fretting; fear of the future won't help, facing up to problems and dealing with them as and when they arise is what the old me would have done, perhaps I can rediscover and reanimate traces of her even now.There, the gloom is beginning to lift already."},
{"title": "Look Who's Back!", "date": "Saturday 10 March 2012", "text": "This is Gardener trying to make sense out of a rambling rose gone completely wild and unmanageable. He ended up with a large heap of razor-sharp prunings, and, true to himself, he piled them up just outside the nearest garden gate, on land which is technically the property of the Duke of Norfolk, leased to English Heritage. True, nobody but us goes there, and we tend to look at this short bank, which goes  down into the moat alongside our holly hedge, as very much an extension to the garden. Being Shropshire born and bred, and a true country labouring man, Gardener is no respecter of persons, and if a plot of land is useful, well then, he uses it.Today was his first day back since last June, when he had a heart attack just after he finished working very hard for our summer garden opening. Since then I haven't felt like doing much myself; without him it just isn't the same, and although I've had other people come in for some of the big jobs, they've just stood there, arms hanging limply, waiting for instructions. I simply don't feel like training anyone else; working with Gardener is a great joy, we bicker and argue, he never listens to a word I say and always does as he sees fit. Secretly, he has taken a lot of my knowledge of gardening to heart, he has learned to treat plants with respect and I can usually trust him to keep any damage he does within acceptable limits. I was so happy to see him this morning I gave him a big hug, which made him feel quite uncomfortable. Although I call him by his first name, I am Mrs. W. to him, and his employer to boot, and hugging is not for the likes of us, according to him.We did three hours; he tamed and tied in the rose, which is looking very sorry and spindly now. He said it didn't matter and that next year (!) we could prune out the rest of the ancient stems. Will we both still be around, and will we both still be working this garden?I am very fond of Gardener and I know that beneath his flippant, sometimes rude and off-hand and anti-authoritarian manner beats a heart of true gold. He can also be quite soppy, particularly when he talks about his little dog, but I've never before seen him come close to crying. His sixty-two year old brother died of Leukaemia two weeks ago and he told us that he missed seeing him off because his sister chose to go on the day he had planned to visit. The brother had been hanging on in the hospice for weeks and weeks and all the siblings, seven sisters and six brothers, had been hoping the end would come. Gardener said: \"He used to lie on his back and just stare at the ceiling. My sister said to him 'close your eyes, Geoffrey, and go and see Mum and Dad.'\" Gardener's face crumpled, he sniffed and brought out his large countryman's handkerchief to wipe his damp eyes. \"So he did\" he said, \" and he just went, there and then.\" And then Gardener finished his mug of tea, got up, and said \"right, let's get on with it.\"We have another date for next week. I might even feel inspired to do a few jobs around the garden by myself before then. No compost turning, mind!"},
{"title": "Nostalgia", "date": "Thursday 8 March 2012", "text": "I made an old-fashioned kind of phone call today, landline to landline, from England to Germany; it lasted for about three quarters of an hour and will therefore probably be quite expensive.  My eldest cousin, and the one remaining member of my family with whom  I am in touch regularly - and even that only once or twice a year,  - was 79 years old today, and I rang to wish Helga many happy returns of the day.Nearly all of the call was about getting old and becoming feeble, being less and less able to work around house and garden, and needing outside help. She told me about her ailments and I told her about mine. She told me about her friends getting old and how her once flourishing and active social circle was shrinking and how they now only met for birthdays. She'd even cancelled her own birthday celebration because she just didn't feel up to it. \"We can't even meet for dinner\", she said, \"because cooking  for a group is a problem, and even if we could, most of us can't eat large meals in the evening now.\" Holidays? Too much effort. Children? Too busy leading their own lives. Friends? In the same boat, getting too old to bother. Outings to restaurants or entertainments? Too expensive, too much effort, too tiring. Might as well stay home, where we're comfortable. To an outsider the whole conversation was one long moan, one long tale of woe about the drawbacks of age. We agreed that everybody wants to get old and nobody wants to be old.You might say 'what a waste of time and money' this call must have been. How depressing. Far from it, I loved every expensive minute of it. We soon swapped High German for Low German, the language of the local area, instantly transporting me back to childhood and visits to aunts and uncles; to the quiet landscape of the Lower Rhine plains, the marshes, meadows, streams and woods; the wide skies with their racing clouds, punctuated by skeins of wild geese, and the white mists rising and turning willows marching along ditches and brooks into ghostly apparitions. In between talk of arthritic knees, sore backs and fluttering hearts I was reminded of the green days when I sat by her, swooning with admiration and envy, as she dressed up to go out with her latest beau, and afterwards pestered her to tell me what it had been like at the dance.Being without family is like being without roots. There was a time when not having family meant very little to me. There was a whole big world to explore, there were people to meet and friends to make. Brothers and sisters? Perhaps it would have been pleasant to have them, but as I didn't, I didn't feel that it mattered much. Most of the time I am quite happy with Beloved in my cosy little English backwater, but today, when cousin Helga's voice brought the past back to me, I would have liked to know that there is somebody close who could share my memories.I'd still say, though, that it was no more than idle curiosity which made me look on the net for flats and houses for sale in my home town. My, they are a lot cheaper than comparative dwellings in the UK."},
{"title": "Thoughts on Rising from a Sick-Bed", "date": "Monday 5 March 2012", "text": "Lenten HelleboreThank you,  all of you,  for your good wishes and kind thoughts. We may not know much about each other, in most cases not even our real names or where we live, but the goodwill we show each other in times of trouble is absolutely amazing. There are about 150 unanswered emails in my inbox; it will take me quite some time to get round to visiting everybody, so you'll have to bide your time. Let me say to all of you, here and now, how much I appreciate this wonderful community of ours.Doesn't time go slow when we are ill and unable to be active? I've had a lot of time to think. These episodes of AFib are often followed by periods of depression and anxiety - as if I didn't already suffer enough of them when I'm well! - and it's a real effort to motivate myself to get off my back and look around me with open eyes. You'd think I'd make use of enforced inactivity by reading: sadly, a thriller or two is all I can manage. Even TV doesn't appeal. I had to stay upstairs for about 60 hours all told; climbing stairs puts extra effort on my feebly, but very fast, fluttering heart. Beloved brought me endless trays of soups, sandwiches and cups of tea, his arthritic joints creaking, and Benno's wheezing following behind each time. It's a wonder they stayed the course. All appointments were cancelled for the week, although I gave Beloved permission to go off on a lunch date, while a friend came to keep me company. The hosts and the other guests all rang up afterwards to say how much they'd missed me, but nobody thought of providing a doggy bag for me.I was very fortunate that my GP wasn't on duty; had she been, I'd have ended up in the hospital again. The locum was a younger doctor, who actually listened to my pleas to let me stay at home until such time as I myself found it necessary to call for more intensive treatment. He was a lovely chap, calm in the face of my irritable complaints at being laid up for the third time since September, who very kindly rang the cardiologist for advice;  between them they concocted a regime of medication and bed rest which worked. Recovery is so much speedier when you haven't had to put up with the hustle and bustle of an NHS hospital. No question, in a real emergency, I'd be the first to advocate them, but I just didn't think it necessary this time.The AFib stopped as suddenly as it had started; I have no idea why I should be afflicted. Unless, unless. . . . . . Perhaps compost heaps and shovelling loads of compost have something to do with it?  No wonder I'm depressed. If this means that my gardening will have to be restricted to a bit of ladylike snipping off of flower heads, I shall feel entitled to becoming even more cross and cantankerous than I already am. Like most people, I am not afraid of dying or being dead, but the idea of a long period of invalidity or painful suffering before death fills me with horror and fear.  And I absolutely hate being the object of anybody's pity. I don't advise anyone to try it; dark mutterings of ingratitude will make them think twice, should there be a next time."},

I keep having all these brilliant ideas; do I put them into practice? Stupid question.I've just had some pasta for lunch - lethal - , and what's even worse, a strip of chocolate for pudding.  It's been a long and boring winter, spent mainly in an easy chair, reading, or in front of my computer, either composing my magnum opus, or doing whatever we think we're doing in the blogoverse.  Even the dog's been in on the conspiracy to fatten me up: he's getting too old and arthritic for long walks and, after half an hour struggling through the mud, he looks at me as if to say, thanks for coming out, but how about going back now? He's very polite that way. There are the ramblers, peramblers and amblers (true, all three groups exist in Valley's End), but I can't see myself stumbling along and remaining civilised and sociable at the same time.I have a large walk-in wardrobe, well, actually it is a long, slopey-ceilinged space under the roof, running along a massive bedroom, with two wide double doors. The lady who built this house was keen on providing her loving sons and daughters and their assorted children with enough space upstairs to keep them there during visits, while she was free to indulge her passion for bossing the village around downstairs. It made a mess of the house, but gave me enough room to keep my vast collection of shoes and clothes, saved for decades, most of it on the off-chance that the time will come, when a) the stuff becomes fashionable again, and b) that I'll actually be able to get into it at such time. Only about 20% of the clothes hanging on the rails fit me easily, all the rest is surplus to current requirements. Five kilos would do it, but where am I going to get the willpower to shed five kilos? The situation is depressing enough to make me reach for another strip of chocolate.Chocolate and wine have been my solace ever since I've allowed myself to be locked away in the depths of inaccessible countryside. For heaven's sake, this is practically Wales! Chocolate is absolutely essential to my survival. As chocolate is also addictive, I cannot be blamed for my cravings. Or so I thought until very recently, when some misguided scientists, in the name of the advancement of human misery, proved conclusively, that chocolate is no more addictive than a cup of tea. It seems that the bit of the brain which lights up when you eat a piece of chocolate, also lights up, in exactly the same way, when you are THINKING about eating a piece of chocolate. If ever there was a research project which should have been stifled at birth, it is this.Yesterday was Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. In my distant catholic past, priests and nuns at school made sure that we didn't indulge ourselves. I was a sickly child, so I was allowed protein in the form of meat, but sweets were forbidden on pain of eternal hell fire and brimstone baths. A lot of people hang their need for a reducing diet on the Lent hook, maybe I could join them. On the other hand, the compost heaps need turning and there's a lot of work coming up in the garden. But I am NOT going to keep anybody informed about my success or otherwise. Should I, however, in some future post, mention that I am looking forward to a clothes-shopping-expedition, you may draw your own conclusions. Either way, of course."},

It remains for me to say that there is need to observe the feet, which are governed by Pisces.The feet short and thick, signifies a person to be weak; slender and short, to be wicked; fleshy and hard, to be a blockhead. The feet small and fair-formed, to be a fornicator; much hairy, to be lecherous and bold; naked of hair, to be weak of strength and courage; the inner part of the sole, not hollow, but filled with flesh, that they make no hollowness in the step, to be beyond measure crafty and cunning.The Shepherd's Prognostication 1729o-o-o-o-o-oWhat people have said to me in the last three weeks:o-oOh, hello, it's you.

I told you (to a third party), she always says what she means.o-oo-o-o-o-o-oThe new, fuzzy and complicated  word verification which Blogger has forced on those of us who use it in their comments, is driving me mad. I simply do not have the time to spend extra minutes each time I make a comment on deciphering illegible phrases. Personally, I have removed it by going back to the old interface, choosing 'settings' -  'comments' - 'show word verification'. Saving the settings and going back to the new interface completed the process.To stop advertising vandals leaving comments long after the posts have disappeared into the netherworld of blogging, I have set comment moderation to start after four days. So far, I have not had any unwanted comments or obnoxious ads.I am very sorry, but I simply will not comment as frequently as before on those blogs which use the new word verification, even comment moderation is better than that. Squinting and decoding take valuable reading and writing time. I use email comment notification, which means that all comments on my posts appear in my email inbox.  If you have email on your blog rather than 'no-reply blogger', I will be able to comment via email.Like I said, I am very sorry, but blogging is meant to be fun, not a chore."},

{"title": "Why I Don't Post About Politics", "date": "Saturday 18 February 2012", "text": "In a recent comment Mr. Charleston of Termites Of Sin said that this blog is never controversial because I stay away from politics and religion. I have been thinking about this comment on and off ever since; it's been bothering me. I like Mr. Charleston very much, his blog is, by turns, funny, acerbic and chatty, and always worth reading. He includes posts on religion and politics, although he keeps their number to an acceptable level.He is quite right, I do stay away from politics. The thing is that many of my readers are American and Canadian, there are those lovely Aussies too, and a few Europeans sprinkled among the mix. My UK readership is relatively small. I don't know why that should be so, but it is. So whose politics would I discuss? Religion and Politics are not subjects for discussion in drawing rooms in the UK. They are shunned by polite society because they easily cause discord, anger, hurt and leave an unpleasant feeling in the atmosphere, unless all participants are of the same opinion, in which case it's hardly necessary to bring the subjects up. I was brought up in a politically highly charged environment, listening to the men in the family dissecting politicians when I was knee-high to a grasshopper. Politics is in my blood. I worked in politics and liked nothing better than to continue the family tradition of riding the politics hobby-horse.But now I am older. I still have opinions, but they have mellowed; I am one of these infuriating people who 'can see both sides of an argument', although that doesn't mean that I will ever get into bed with bigots or fascists or extremists. I'd call myself a left-leaning middle-of-the-roader, I suppose. My firebrand grandfather would disown me, although he, towards the end of life, regretted having risked his life for people who turned out to be \"idiot ingrates, who deserved no better than they got\", in his words.In the blogoverse there are plenty of specialist political bloggers, who address a very particular readership. I don't follow any of them. I am simply not interested. Friko's World is a kind of butterfly blog, touching on this and that, never staying anywhere for long and never getting bogged down in any subject. A bit shallow, you might say, but also inoffensive.This is my point: if I started to discuss politics I'd have to keep my remarks pretty neutral. Even if I watch some American politics, in particular foreign policy, with open-mouthed incredulity, no American citizen would thank me for expressing my opinion. And no American citizen, no Brit or European, no Aussie or South African, no Indian or Asian would thank me for 'interfering' in matters which 'are none of your business'. I see it a bit like a family, which denounces its own black sheep at every gathering, but is instantly ready to rip to shreds the outsider who dares to join in! We may live in a global village, where every action has repercussions for every inhabitant, but we still close ranks if the family next door mentions the stink coming from our kitchen.If ever I feel really brave, I might mention why I don't discuss religion."},

The valley can get awfully depressing at times. Somehow we had got to talking about drink and drinking to excess; not that we do, but one man in the village has just drunk himself to death and another appears to be on the brink of doing the same.\"Talking of gin and orange\", Penny continued, \"I used to enjoy the occasional snifter.\" And then she told a little story.\"Before we had the girls, both mothers came to us for Christmas. My mother was divorced, and Bill's mother was a widow. Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Green didn't like each other at all; not that they had any proper falling out, they never rowed, but it was patently obvious that they couldn't abide each other. They arrived on Christmas Eve and left again on Boxing Day evening, neither leaving the field before the other. On top of it, they were both nearly tee-total, a drink might have livened up proceedings a little. By the time Christmas dinner was served, you could cut the air with a cheese knife.\" Penny took a sip of her tea, unlaced. \"Bill and I were pretty desperate. These two women spoilt every one of our Christmases. We enjoyed a drink, but didn't feel able to drink in front of two grimly disapproving ladies. Then we had an idea: Bill half filled a jug with gin, added orange juice and put it into the fridge. Now and then, he'd ask the ladies to excuse him, he'd have to go and make sure the boiler, which ran on coal, had enough fuel to keep going. I'd follow him, explaining that the oven needed checking, and find Bill in the kitchen, two glasses on the table, pouring gin-and-orange. Mrs Brown and Mrs Green were none the wiser and we had fortified ourselves enough to carry on.\"\"Good for you,\" I said, \"but why do you call them Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Green? One was your mother and the other your mother-in-law. Didn't you use first names?\" \"Oh no, never,\" Penny said. \"Mrs. Brown didn't like me and she would never have permitted me to use her name. And Bill called my mother, with whom he got on extremely well, Mrs. Green, always Mrs. Green.\" I was curious. \"What happened when the girls came along?\" I asked. \"O, then they became Granny and Nana respectively, we all called them Granny and Nana.\""},

A really slow day. I didn't even speak to anyone apart from Beloved,  except to exchange greetings.There is this Thursday Thirteen meme, which I've only done once before.  Kelly is bustling round the house vacuuming this morning, so I've escaped into my study. As I was sitting thinking about a possible blogpost the meme came into my mind and I was wondering if I could find thirteen pleasant things to write about.OneI remembered a cousin's birthday just in time to send her a birthday card. This is not at all to be taken for granted; I forget birthdays and other special days more often than not. Last week I forgot the birthday of a really good friend. If somebody's birthday comes round before I turn the page on my perpetual birthday calendar  - the numbers run consecutively from one to 30 or 31, without days or weeks - that's it,  I have to grovel in abject apology.TwoBenno and I went for a walk in the Nature Reserve. The sunlight on the frozen lake accentuated the reed bed fringe and the reflection of the sky turned the water a deep blue instead of the usual muddy grey.ThreeI watched a duck slide halfway across the lake before giving up. and disappearing in he reeds. She gave me an idea for a poem, most of which I remembered until I got home.FourOn the way out I walked through a willow thicket and saw that the pussy willow buds were beginning to burst into life; against the background of blue sky they looked as if  the stems had small lights attached to them. Cat's eyes, maybe?FiveIn the afternoon I started to write an article for the local paper on how we had come to live in Valley's End. It reminded me of happy times and all the good reasons why we are still here. The article flowed easily and I shall have it finished before the deadline.SixI love the  Sherlock Holmes series filmed in the 1980s, with the inimitable Jeremy Brett as Sherlock and the craggy faced Eric Porter as Prof. Moriarty.  All the actors in the films outdo each other in hamming or camping it up; I can't get enough of Sherlock's twitchy lips or Moriarty's evil eyebrows, not to mention Dr. Watson's sweet and utterly unbelievable devotion to Sherlock. An hour and a bit well-spent and wholly enjoyable, particularly becauseSevenI finished off the remains of last Christmas' marzipan while watching. Germans eat Lübecker Marzipan at Christmas. I can't get it in England at any other time of year so I always buy an extra loaf or two to last throughout winter. It's a very sweet, almondy, confection, not really very good for dental health or my hips. Being good can be so boring!EightI try to read at least one poem every day, usually more. Yesterday I opened a poetry book on the lines \"Dull, dull, hungry cloth-head dullard!Each day I'm dull .......\" (A Pre-Breakfast Rant by Andrew Greig) and realised that, for once, I did not feel like that myself. Not hungry because I'd eaten marzipan loaf and not dull because I'd been for a walk in the bracing cold.NineThe weather is set to remain cold for the weekend; We feed a lot of birds and the supply of bird food was running low. We split up to shop in different shops and both came back to the car with bags of seeds and nuts. The birds will be happy and watching them perform on the bird table makes me happy. Ergo: another tick on the pleasure chart. I want you to believe that there were clouds of birds, but the minute I opened the window to take their photo they all flew off. It was too cold to stand in the open window for long, so you'll have to imagine a dozen and a half of tits, chaffinches, sparrows, bramblings, a pair of nuthatches, some greenfinches and a great bullying blackbird. TenThe sun shone all day, a very rare occurrence in our narrow valley. Clouds and mist hang low and cling to the sides of the hills on both sides of the river, leaving us struggling under a dirty grey blanket for weeks on end.ElevenI finally opened \"The Help\", which one of my gentlemen friends gave me to read. Three very nice gentlemen insist on improving my mind by bringing me books to read, independently of each other. Beloved is not jealous at all, in fact, he feels flattered at the cerebral attention other men pay his wife. I am left with the trouble of reading the books because all three gentlemen like to hear my opinion afterwards. \"The Help\" appears to be a fairly easy read. Although I have only reached page 60, I get the impression that it will be whites who solve the 'colour' question. I hope not.TwelveIt was a great pleasure to open my blog and find sixty lovely people had replied to the post about flattery, leaving very appreciative comments. (It's 64 now) Thank you very much, what would I do without you. (Probably not indulge in spending quite so much of my free time over my blog, that's what). I am very grateful.ThirteenAbsolutely scraping the barrel now, all I can offer at number 13 is that I am very glad to have found 12 reasons to make yesterday pleasant and that I now have some cobbled-together material for this post. It's not as easy as I thought to come up with a list of thirteen anythings; complaining would probably  come more naturally."},

Did it work? No, because I have no current interest in doing any of these things; had I had, however, I might have hesitated for a moment before depositing the material in the recycling bin.Occasionally, I too am guilty of flattery, sincere flattery, of course. Who has not admired their boss for his /her brilliance, has not told a friend how wonderful s/he looks, praised a child to get it to do more of what we want it to do. Manipulation and flattery are closely allied. There is a man I know who likes nothing better than to have his own opinion of himself confirmed; whenever we meet, which is not often, I gladly oblige, if only to save myself a grumpy and difficult conversation. You should see his face light up when I admire his latest opus!All of you reading this blog are, by definition, intelligent, bright, excellent writers, aware of the latest developments in politics and current affairs, and wonderful people. I also know that you lead busy lives, are competent and highly efficient, kind and considerate towards others and paragons of virtue. Would you read me otherwise?Blogging comments are usually complimentary, often excessively so. I had a recent jolt to my easy acceptance of blogging praise: a blog I had not come across before, started a blog-criticism me-me, all reviewers to remain anonymous. Every participant had to review two participating blogs and the comments would then be emailed to the blog-owners. Well, anonymity made a big difference! Both reviewers of my blog found it boring, there were too many subjects and many of the posts were far too long. One said she couldn't even be bothered to read the post because of its length and the other one, slightly kinder, wondered which kind of reader I might be aiming for. The two blogs I was given to review were being written by \"I-am-a-mother-and-wife\" bloggers, had lots of recipes, household tips and pictures of pretty babies. Absolutely nothing wrong with that, so I said only kind things about the appearance and content of the blogs, but also said that I would probably not become a follower. This me-me was quite obviously not aimed at me, but it was an eye-opener at any rate. Anonymity guarantees honesty.Flattery makes us happy, even when we suspect that we are being flattered. We all like to feel better about ourselves and prefer to mix with people who have a flattering opinion of us. As adults, we tend to drop somebody who always criticises our work, our appearance, our tastes, our outlook. The most successful and long-lived TV chat show hosts are those who ask only the most unctuous questions. Celebrities wallow in the stuff and, given half a chance, so do the rest of us.Actually, flattery might be the reason why I spend my time blogging rather than getting on with seriously writing my memoir: not only do I find blogging easier, it also provides complimentary feedback now, instead of at some unspecified time in the future, or more probably, never. Instant gratification for me as a result of your flattery: you're confirming that  \"I'm not too bad, really, am I?\""},

The coloured bark dogwoods provide a brilliantly bright contrast to the green and silver leaves of Euonymous 'Silver Queen' and the dark green of the ivy smothered maple hedge.

All of them have variegated leaves in summer but they really catch the eye on a sunny winter's day. In a dimple in the river bank the dead stems of water plants have adorned themselves with crystal necklaces, smoothed and polished by the leisurely current, which allows them to admire their reflection in the blue shallows.o-o-o-o-oAnd now I want to say a special hello to whoever it was who commented on a previous post on this blog from the Dallas County Jail.

{"title": "Adventures during the Age Of Aquarius  -  Part III", "date": "Tuesday 31 January 2012", "text": "Part I and Part IIFish 'n' Chips is one of Great Britain's towering successes; 'chippies' are everywhere, not only in the UK but, by virtue of empire and tourism, in far-flung places all over the globe. The first fish-and-chip shop in London was opened in 1860. Nowadays there are chippies who sell you a curry or a 'Chinese', and always saveloys, a highly spiced, reddish brown sausage;  the fried fish shop will probably be the last kind of eatery to go out of business. Fish has become expensive, the seas around the British Isles are overfished and supplies are shrinking, but if you want a cheap and nutritious meal, and lots of it, you can hardly do better than visit the chippy.  The fish comes wrapped in a thick coating of batter, adding weight and a lot of calories to the dish. When it leaves its bath of sizzling oil the portions glisten with grease, the batter now mid-brown, crinkly and blistery. When you break the crust with your fork it comes away with a chunk of hard baked batter, while the fish inside remains pallid and soft. If you eat it quickly enough, before your portion cools, it's edible, even tasty, but once the batter has gone cold and soggy, each mouthful tastes of congealed grease. You need a lot of beer to neutralise the taste of cold fish-and-chips. The true aficionado adds  a side of pickled onion or a 'wally' (a pickled gherkin), and always a generous sprinkling of salt and brown vinegar. Although I have not mentioned chips separately (a thicker kind of French fries), they are an integral part of the dish. The only vegetable allowed in the vicinity of fish-and-chips is a lump of mushy peas, bright green and squashed to a thick pulp, a kind of edible glue.Take-away fish-and-chips were wrapped in a small sheet of greaseproof white paper and then newspaper. I believe, because I was told by knowledgeable and enthusiastic worshippers of the institution, that fried fish simply never tasted the same once white paper replaced plain newspaper. Apparently, newsprint on oil added the final, indispensable piquancy. These days newspaper has been done away with altogether.I first came into contact with a fish-and-chip shop by working in one. When I was sacked from the laundry I urgently needed another job. My situation in England remained precarious, I only had permission to stay if I worked in one of the menial jobs foreigners were allowed to take away from the indigenous workers, who didn't want them. I even needed a permit to work in the laundry. My student status had expired and the immigration authorities were always on the look-out for those of us who outstayed our welcome. We made no contribution to the economy and paid no taxes. People were as paranoid about the menace of the foreign worker taking jobs away from the honest British labourer as they are now. Except that the fear of said foreigner scrounging off the Benefits System didn't exist then, because 'illegals' were not registered and therefore unable to make claims.The laundry was situated off the Holloway Road in North London. The chippy was in Moorgate, in a dingy side street near the famous Moorfield's Eye Hospital in the City of London.  It was owned by a Greek Cypriot couple. I had met their nephew, Lucas, in one of the many coffee bars in Soho; you could sit over coffee or a coke for an hour or more, talking to friends and listening to the music provided by some half-starved young man with a guitar. Lucas fancied me; I didn't particularly like him, but I was willing to consider the job he was offering with his uncle and aunt. He was helping them out himself, but keen to leave again. He'd squared it with them, he said; they weren't bothered about my illegal alien status and just wanted a waitress. \"Start on Friday\", they said, \"that's when we are busiest. Come at 11 am and we'll show you the ropes\". Apart from waitressing there were a few light duties like cleaning the tables and helping with the washing up.I presented myself at 11 am. The place was a narrow rectangle, with three stainless steel  deep fryers ranged along part of the wall  opposite the entrance door, and three rows of  tables, a dozen altogether, each table seating four. It was very basic, it had no washroom other than a little cubbyhole for the staff, the tables were formica topped and the chairs plain, a job lot from the cheapest catering furnishers.\"Nothing to it\", I thought. I had never done any waitressing, but how difficult can it be to take an order, have it filled and carry the plate back to the customer.Lucas, who spoke good English, explained the menu. Cod and chips, haddock and chips, plaice and chips, saveloys and chips or plain chips. Wallies and onions. Vinegar, salt and pepper stood on each table. No  fancy extras like mushy peas, no tartare sauce, no ketchup; this was before the regular British palate went adventurous and began to trust such luxuries as beer batter or parsley garnishes. \"You have to be quick\", Lucas said, our customers work shifts and they have a thirty minute dinner break. Take their order as they come in, pass it on to me and uncle; we'll be ready with the first portions by the time they sit down.\"\"I can do that,\" I said; I knew that I was naturally quick on my feet and a fast learner to boot. \"No problem.\"At exactly four minutes past twelve the shop door sprang open and a tsunami of bodies swept into the cafe. \"cod and chips, plaice and chips, chips twice, cod and chips . . . . . . . \" Each of these bodies shouted at me on the way in, rushed past me to a table and sat down. A blur of men in grey or blue overalls, indistinguishable from each other. I stood by the counter, pad and pencil at the ready, and stared, my welcome smile a frozen grimace. Behind me, the counter was filling up with plates, Lucas and his uncle were shovelling fish and chips as fast as they could.The aunt was filling mugs with tea, several trays of them, and shouting at me too. \"Come on, come on,\" she screeched. Her command of English was limited. I came out of my trance and moved.Tea trays first, at least they had all demanded tea, there was no problem sorting out who wanted a mug. I simply plonked four of them on each table. The plates of food presented a problem; there was no chance that I'd serve the men in the order in which they had arrived or that they'd get what they wanted.  I dithered for a second and then grabbed two plates at random, slapping them down on the nearest table. Back to the counter and the same again. And again. There was one chance in four or five that at least one customer at each table would be satisfied.  \"I ordered cod and chips and you've given me . . \". \"Hey, we were first and you've already served that table . . . . .\"  \"I want a double portion of chips.. \" The plates on the counter were piling up and needed shifting. I had no time to worry about correct service etiquette. \"Terribly sorry\", I said, continuing to work my way back and forth along the two rows between the tables. \"Sort it out, can't you.\" Some of them did, hindering my progress by handing plates to other tables, others switched them round at their own. Lucas came out from behind the counter to placate those most aggrieved. \"She's new\", he said, unnecessarily. The men settled down to eat fast and furiously, having to make up for the valuable minutes' eating time which my inefficiency had cost them.Just before twelve thirty the first workers left and were quickly replaced by the next shift, equally undistinguished. We replayed the first sitting, except that Lucas stayed out with me to serve and auntie helped with the frying and shovelling. Had I thought at all what the job might entail, I would have expected concentrated work, a lot of grease and the smell of burning oil, steamed up windows and the odd linguistic misunderstanding; I would also have expected good-natured banter, maybe a flirtatious remark, and, above all, a tip.  I got none of the latter but all of the former. By two o'clock \"dinner time\" was over, all the men were back at work and the cafe closed.Lucas was counting the takings.  \"You would get used to it\",  he said, a question mark in his voice. \"Do you feel like coming back on Tuesday? We could go and have a coffee when I'm finished here. Talk it over.\" He peeled off a couple of pound notes from the wad of cash in his hand. \"Here you are, your pay for today,\" he said. \"Enough to buy a fish dinner.\" He thought it was funny.This job was worse than ironing shirts. At least there had been music-while-you-work at the laundry and I didn't reek of stale grease at the end of the day. The pay was lousy and Lucas might become a problem. Even if I learned to tell the robots who came to the cafe apart, would serving them fish and chips for half an hour several times a week enhance my knowledge of literary English? Hardly. No, this job was a dead end. But waitressing itself could be fun, couldn't it? Perhaps in one of the coffee bars I spent so much time in? I could always ask."},

{"title": "Social Life in Valley's End", "date": "Saturday 28 January 2012", "text": "Helleborus openingWith January nearly over and the days ever so slowly brightening, social life in Valley's End is revving up a notch. On a sunny day like today people stop in the street for a chat, others call out greetings and remarks about the weather to each other across the roadway; January is dreary and dark, and nobody feels much like entertaining. Perhaps the bright social whirl that is December has also depleted energy reserves and we all use the silence of January to recover. Invitations issued now are tentative rather than full-steam-ahead, \"come and have a coffee\", \"come to afternoon tea\", or \"come to Sunday lunch\"; it's almost as if we have had enough of solitude and would like to try and find out what it feels like to be sociable again.The events themselves are more like practice runs than confident performances; one elderly couple treated us to a wonderful display of bickering. Being the only guests, we took full advantage and listened avidly, not even pretending that we were occupied admiring the furnishings, paintings or other absent-minded distractions employed by the well-mannered guest. \"Where is the salt?\" \"Why would you want salt, the food is already salted\". \"I like salt with my food. Anyway, you should always put it on the table\". \"I used it to cook, I can't remember where I left it\". There was the vinaigrette, which was not added to the salad starter, but served by the side, also a cause for lengthy regret. Or a book needed to be fetched to illustrate a point about a play nobody had heard of. \"Why would you need to do this now, the food is getting cold.\" The question of coffee arose before the pudding arrived at the table. \"Do we have any decaf?\" \"Of course, we do, it's in the larder\". An exhaustive hunt for decaf coffee remained unsuccessful. \"Why didn't you get some?\" \" I meant to but it slipped my mind\". You really need to write things down, you know\". \"Why didn't you get it when you went to the shop?\" \"Could you try this drink?\" handing me a bottle. \"I think it might be a dessert wine, somebody gave it to us, I can't remember who\". I tried it.\"This is grappa, not dessert wine\". Oh, that'll be lovely with coffee. Would anyone like some apple pie?\" \"How about the cheese, we still haven't finished the red.\"This is a couple who entertain frequently and elegantly.Then there was the \"come for coffee\" invitation. Lorna's house was freezing. She was wearing several layers of winter woollies, fingerless mittens and fur-lined boots. Indoors. \"Hasn't it turned warm\", she said. The wood burner threw out a feeble heat, having been fed very reluctantly. We nodded politely. When the one log in the burner was reduced to no more than an ashen shadow of its former self, she asked again \"Is anybody else really hot?\" before selecting another log. Nobody answered. Her cats were huddled on a cushion in front of the burner while the guests shivered. Beloved went into the hall and fetched his thick, icelandic scarf, draping it round his neck. Lorna smiled. \"That's the ticket\", she said.I wouldn't want you to think that I don't invite people to our house. Only yesterday we had a delightful elderly lady and her lurcher to tea. They came for the first time and she was very complimentary about house and garden. Mona is a real lady, much more so than me, a writer and poet, with old-school impeccable manners. I wish I could say the same for the dog. Anybody who reads this blog regularly knows that I tolerate well-behaved pets and children happily, I am kind and don't banish them to the scullery. Archie was not well-behaved. He stole a piece of cake which I had left on the kitchen table, and when I lifted the cake plate up onto a freezer, he jumped up, nearly pulling the plate down. I told him off and he went to his mistress who was sitting on the sofa in the sitting room and promptly jumped up to sit beside her. Pets and children are not allowed to sit on the furniture in my house (well, maybe I'd let a well-behaved child sit down), Archie was not pleased when I told him to get down. It took him three attempts before he understood that I'm the pack leader and that my word is law. Benno didn't lift a paw to help me and Mona smiled sweetly. Mona is a dear, vague and wispy, scattering belongings wherever she goes. I thought I had made absolutely sure I had collected every item she dropped during her visit, the dog's coat, her coat, her bag, her stick, the dog's lead, a book, some papers, and her boots. After she'd gone I found her scarf and gloves.We need a lot of practice before we all get back into the swing of social life."},

{"title": "Adventures During the Age Of Aquarius  -  Part II", "date": "Saturday 21 January 2012", "text": "\"What!?\"Dumbfounded, I stared at her.The Nigerians too were rooted to the spot, frozen in mid-movement. Faces of other workers turned to us expectantly.  Lightyears separated hearing the words and grasping their meaning; my face creased with concentration, I repeated \"What?\"The concept of whores was fairly new to me; I had an idea that women who sold sex for money were called 'whores' or 'Huren' in German; there were women being called 'whores' in novels, particularly French and Russian ones. I rather enjoyed reading about their usually tragic fate, and was mildly excited by accounts of what went on in French boudoirs and on wild sleigh rides across the frozen Russian tundra, but I had never come across a live practitioner of the profession.  And what had the Nigerians to do with it?I genuinely wanted her to explain what she meant. I was, even then, a reasonable sort of person, but pretty unlikely to be overly concerned with anyone's opinion of me. I blame my father for that attitude, having inherited his conviction that survival is not only the prerogative of the fittest but also those with impermeable skin. \"Pay your way, my girl,\" he used to say, \"stay true to yourself, and hold your head up. You're the equal of anyone\". He had survived a lot more than name calling.What she had said made no sense; I was puzzled, why would she say that? Gradually, the paralysing effect of her words evaporated inside the steamy atmosphere of the 'greasy spoon'. There would be no drama. Blondie herself seemed to be in shock, she literally shook, her face a livid mask of shame, anger and accusation. I observed the phenomenon closely. She looked past me to the open door of the cafe, grabbed her bag and left. I followed, the Nigerians on my heels.Blondie started to run; so we left her to it. The Nigerians knew what they had had to do with Blondie's outburst. They stopped me at the entrance to the factory and the man who had invited me to the party unsmilingly asked \"Will you come?\". \"No\", I said, \"thank you very much, but I don't think I will\".  \"We are black, is that what it is? You whites are all the same, no matter where you come from. We thought you were different\"; the man spat out the words angrily. One of the girls said she was sorry they had befriended me and she would never trust me again.  I was angry too, \"It's nothing to do with being black,\" I said, \"I have a boyfriend and I can't just go out without him\". But, of course, my initial attraction to this close knit group of Nigerians, in their sober black and white outfits so much more neatly and smartly dressed than any of my white fellow workers, was due to their very 'otherness', they were  so very different from anyone I'd ever met.  No black people lived in my home town and although I was seeing every race on earth represented in the streets of London, these people were the first with whom I'd had direct contact. They left me standing on the steps to the laundry's entrance, confused and possibly a little ashamed, without knowing the reason why.One of the other German girls caught up with me. \"Don't let her get to you\", she said, \"she is very unhappy. Her boyfriend is a nasty brute who knocks her about\". Blondie had met him in Germany where he was serving in the British Army, fallen in love, followed him to the UK and now they were engaged to be married. All her hard work and thriftiness came about because of the pressure he put on her. He forced her to hand over her wages and was given a meagre allowance in return. \"I have never heard this rumour in the factory\", my little German friend said, \"she's probably just jealous\". She smiled endearingly, then clapped her hands over her mouth and blushed. She was missing her two front teeth and was waiting for new ones to be inserted. Was she too being knocked about? I didn't know, but hoped not. She was a sweet little thing, who attached herself to me for the few weeks of slave labour left before I was sent packing from the factory.The works doctor had found nothing wrong with my chest or any other ailments. I was as fit as anyone to work wherever it pleased them to put me. The supervisor gave me no peace, her quota needed filling, or else she herself would be in trouble. \"Idle cow\", she called me. She probably believed the rumour about my second profession, which had now actually spread on the floor. Blondie no longer looked me in the eye, but I couldn't be bothered to challenge her. The only thing that made work at all bearable was the Music-While-You-Work drizzling down on us from the speakers on the ceiling - we were allowed to sing along -  and my new German friend, who came out for lunch with me. She had her new teeth before I left and looked pretty and happy.Two weeks after the incident at the cafe the supervisor came over and told me to present myself at 'the office' half an hour before the end of the working day. It was Friday, I had my pay packet in my pocket. The Personnel Manager was a grey-haired, friendly man, quite handsome; about the same age as my father. He told me to sit on the chair in front of his desk; I put my heavy library book bag and my much lighter handbag down and waited.He looked at the bag. \"Do you enjoy reading?\", he asked. \"What have you got there?\" For the next twenty minutes we discussed books, with particular emphasis on Dickens, whom I was devouring in great chunks. But I also had a couple of thrillers in the bag, Dorothy L. Sayers was my favourite. Mr. Personnel Manager became interested in me and asked me a number of personal questions. \"Where do you come from? What have you done so far? What are you doing in England?\" Finally, he came to the point. Very gently, with an apologetic smile, he said \"Works Doctor has found nothing wrong with you, there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to perform as well as your colleagues, unless it's your attitude to the work. I am sorry, but we can no longer employ you\". He was giving me the sack. He then said, \"You could be my daughter and I would really ask you to consider going home. You don't belong here\". I had lasted for exactly six weeks.

{"title": "Adventures during the Age Of Aquarius  -  Part I", "date": "Thursday 19 January 2012", "text": "When a green girl leaves her rigid and narrow home for the first time, all sorts of things can happen, particularly if this clueless innocent moves from a mid sized provincial town in one country to a vast metropolis in another country, which has recently embraced a new, swinging age of free love, drug experimentation and above all, the birth of counter-culture and social revolution.  For as long as this girl lives in the bosom of a respectable family in the new country, attends her classes at college regularly and only goes out at the weekend, she is safe. But then again, who wants to stay safe when all around the old values are breaking up and the whole world is in turmoil.When the Moon is in the Seventh House, and Jupiter aligns with MarsThen peace shall guide the planets, and love will steer the starsThis is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius ....I am, of course, talking about Friko's adventures in London in the late 60s and early 70s. College finished, a diploma safely tucked into her pocket, the age of Aquarius beckoned. At the time it was all wonderfully exciting, freedom at last. But freedom needed to be paid for: there was rent to find for a single furnished room in  grotty student accommodation and there was also the small matter of keeping body and soul together, as they said then. Before Britain's entry into the EEC in 1973 made travel and moving between Germany and Britain easier, very few occupations were open to foreigners; we could only work as housemaids, cleaners in hospitals, or in other menial jobs, and even that required a permit.My first legal job was at a laundry, ironing shirts. There was a whole floor of a large building devoted to nothing else but washing and pressing men's shirts. There were girls, mostly foreigners and a few poor English and Irish women, standing all day at large presses, with hot steam rising from them constantly, lifting the heavy lids, arranging the shirts on the wide ironing boards by reaching far in and stretching them tightly, then bringing the lids down again on to the shirts for an exact number of seconds.  Most of the new girls had burn marks on arms and hands and if you were really careless you could burn your forehead on the edge of the lid. The current obsession with Health & Safety hadn't been invented yet. The work was piecework, you got paid per item. If you fell below a certain number of items after the initial training period, the supervisor came to speak to you to encourage you to work a bit faster. If you still showed no sign of improvement, you were called to 'the office', the encouragement turning a little more threatening. The company could afford to hire and fire at will, most of the workers were too poor to rebel and foreigners like me, who, for whatever reason, wanted to stay in the country for a while longer, had no other legal option.I hated working at the presses. I'd never really done any physical work at all; this was me being thrown in at the deep end. I lagged far behind the other girls' output and was finally called to 'the office'. As a child I had had asthma; I promptly used my childhood illness as a reason for not being able to work at the presses. \"OK\", they said, \"we'll switch you to the finishing line. But you'll have to have a medical examination. The works doctor will take care of that.\"The finishing line was less hot and steamy. Here shirt collars and cuffs, the band at the top of backs, sleeves and pleats were finished off by hand. This was also the place where dress shirts and the shirts of people, who were paying for a superior service, were pressed. The job was no better paid, in fact, the painstaking work meant that your tally of shirts was lower than at the presses; some of the hand-pressers were really good at their work, but there were others, me among them, who achieved only creased garments, which then had to be dampened and pressed again. The supervisor kept a close eye on the slackers.There was little camaraderie amongst the workers. I tagged along with a small group of other Germans, who, together with a group of Nigerians, men and women who worked in a different part of the factory, went for lunch to the nearest 'greasy spoon'  - small cafeterias which served a very basic lunch, a few sandwiches and tea from a large urn on the counter. There were sticky buns and slices of fruitcake under a fly-blown plastic dome for those with a sweet tooth. These cafeterias were everywhere in London, thousands of them; office workers used them, as did factory and shop workers; they were cheap and cheerful, you got what you paid for, and nothing more.I wasn't quite as dependent on my earnings at the laundry as most of the others. Whenever I was down to my last pound Mum and Dad came to the rescue; they actually still made me a small allowance, although they constantly tried to persuade me to return home. Having these extra pounds in my pocket meant that I still had money at the end of the week to buy my usual lunch, whereas some of the others had to cut back by about Thursday. Payday was Friday. Sometimes I lent a friend a pound or two. But I was by no means well-off, just a little less hard-pressed than some.Being a total innocent, I was usually cheerful and bright and inclined to chat with all and sundry. I was also bookish and having had an education of sorts made me quite self-confident. The Nigerians fascinated me;  several of them were well educated and articulate and I happily sat with them at lunch in the cafe, having the kind of conversation in which my German fellow workers had no interest. One of the Nigerian men invited me to join their group to celebrate a Nigerian national holiday at their home; although I was innocent, I wasn't foolhardy. I asked them to let me think it over. Besides, I had a boyfriend.One of the German girls, a very thin, intense, blonde, with a pointy noise and narrow mouth had overheard this invitation. She was one of the best workers at the laundry, earning unheard of piecework rates. She and her boyfriend saved every last penny towards a home of their own, she spent almost nothing and brought her own sandwiches to work. She came to the cafe to have a cup of tea and because there was nowhere cheaper for her to go during our lunch breaks.The place was busy,  break was nearly over but most of the regulars, including other local workers  were still there. As we were getting ready to leave, this girl stood up, turned to me and said, in English, not German, in a clear voice, designed to penetrate every corner of the small space: \"You really need to be more careful who you mix with. And you need to stop throwing your money around. We all know how you earn it. It's all over the factory that you're the \"One-Pound-Whore.\"to be continued"},

I didn't mind at all being interrupted, it's been a day for 'mopping up' leftover jobs, satisfying when all is done but not very exciting. Here is one of Stephen's takes on 'Seeing'; although there are no larks rising from the fields around Valley's End into the rather misty skies in winter, spring and summer will bring them back to us.SKYLARKCan you see him?

You've proved it.When you think there's a beer in the fridge and you go to the fridge and there isn't one, but you still say there is one, that's esoteric.o-o-o-o-o-o"},
{"title": "An Ordinary Saturday at Valley's End.", "date": "Saturday 14 January 2012", "text": "On this misty, frosty Saturday morning the sun finally came out at about eleven and the twigs on the laburnum and amelanchier were still clothed in their festive winter finery. I'd hate a garden without trees and shrubs, what would I have to look at in winter?I've been trying to do my income tax return online this morning - late as usual - but also as usual, the HMRC website refused me entry, insisting that 'You Have Not Been Granted Access To This Site' when I typed in my own reference numbers. That means that I'll be sitting at the end of a telephone line on Monday, listening to some godawful canned music and waiting for one of their operatives to become free. I shall do my returns on paper again in future, if they let me.I'm feeling a little merry. I have said it before, morning drinking doesn't agree with me. We had an invitation to a pre-lunch drinks party and, although I always go to these things with the firm intention to stick to orange juice, I rarely follow my own instructions. The host greeted me by saying he had a lovely Sancerre for me to try and I was lost. I did the Sancerre fully justice, with only a few bites to mop up the juices. Which meant, that for me at least, the party became very enjoyable. I'd hate you to think that I overdo my appreciation of the grape, but I can tell the difference between plonk and a drink worth having. And if it's worth having, I'll have it.There were several writers of non-fiction present at the party, a historian and a biologist as well as a biographer; feeling uninhibited I button-holed them and asked their opinion on the best process to get the work of writing done. The consensus was \"Concentration\", \"Discipline\", \"Ruthlessness vis-a-vis Distraction\" and \"A Quiet And Private Working Area\". \"Regular Working Hours, No Matter What\", also came up. Considering, that between them, these people, all men and therefore free from  Cyril Connolly's \"pram in the hall\" being a sombre enemy of good art, have a couple of dozen books to their names, I rather trust their method. I may not have a pram in the hall but I do have a household to run. The only fiction writer present, who also writes poetry, is more like me: maybe there's time today or maybe there'll be time tomorrow. But then, the only books he's published were non-fiction English and poetry text books, his literary efforts languish in the drawers of his study.Having had all this stimulation in the morning, I felt like a long sit-down after a very late lunch. To that end I treated myself to a couple of hours with the second part of the Larsson Millennium trilogy. I absolutely love what I've read so far. I've mentioned the books to people whose opinion I respect;  one said he disliked the violence, somebody else said they found the long, descriptive passages off-putting,  another fiction writer couldn't find an explanation for the runaway success the trilogy has had, because it is actually quite a demanding read, meticulously researched, needing concentration and an interest in journalism, big business and corruption in high places. Not the usual thriller fare, in other words. I love thrillers, solving the puzzle along with the writer is a relaxing exercise. Larsson doesn't give much away, his story unfolds in ever greater circles, drawing in more and more characters, increasing the suspense and making me afraid for the safety of threatened protagonists.I'm reading this as if I were listening to the ominous sound of distant drum beats getting closer and closer.The evening shall be rounded off with last week's episode of Sherlock Holmes, with Benedict Cumberbatch. An evening in front of the box. Everybody who has seen it says it's great. I am looking forward to another treat.Absolutely my kind of an ordinary Saturday."},
{"title": "Creative Writing - Progress Report 2", "date": "Wednesday 11 January 2012", "text": "Not easy, this writing lark. In fact, it's downright hard. For years I've translated other people's words, written reports for conferences, political tracts, articles and polemical essays. I've written long letters and journals. But I've never written anything which is entirely about myself. This blog is my first experience of writing in the first person singular.First thing to admit is that I've written several half chapters, but have completed none since Progress Report No. 1. I am floundering. I have several excuses, (I'm very good at excuses): I was unwell before Christmas and hardly able to think straight. Then came the festive season which always throws me. Since then it's been really hard to motivate myself. I have spent a lot of time thinking about the shape this memoir should take, how to get into it; I have drawn up outlines, copied some of the reminiscences posted on this blog to use as a basis for chapters to be fleshed out and mentally paraded the characters I intend to include.I find it hard to stick to a schedule; there's always something else that gets in the way of writing. Should I opt for early mornings, before the day proper begins? But then Benno hears me moving about and wants attention; 'feed me and let me out', he whines. Should I opt for late evenings? I often blog late at night, or read. Reading is, of course, part of writing. Without regular and varied reading there is no writing.After breakfast jobs need doing around the house, there's laundry and tidying up, there are meals to be prepared. After lunch it's dog walking, shopping, etc., you all know the score. Being retired should mean that the days are entirely at my disposal. Fat chance! On at least one or two days a week I am not at home at all.Another problem I've come up against, is that blogging is entirely different from reading or writing seriously. I enjoy blogging, I've made friends I would never otherwise have made, but the blogging and writing mindset are different. I know some of you disagree, but I find writing requires me to concentrate fully, for hours, on the same subject; it requires focus. With blogging I can stop and start, read a few posts, write one, comment here and there; it doesn't matter how often I am interrupted, I can always go back later. Once my writing thread is interrupted, it's hard to get back into the flow. Beloved is a problem here, he thinks I might like a cup of tea, or he comes and asks me what he should do about vegetables for supper, say.Then there's research. As this memoir is set in a different country from the one I live in, research is something I can't do by looking up the local records. Not everything is available on the internet. I may have to employ somebody to dig up names and help me with exactly pinpointing dates and events. Historical facts need checking; although this memoir is about my own memories, they need to be placed in context, otherwise the whole thing makes no sense.Ideas and advice, please, from all you writers and wannabe writers out there who read this blog, and if there are writers amongst those of you who remain in the shadows, who neither comment nor join, but read (I know you are out there, Google has told me), I'd be grateful for your input too.  How do you/did you overcome lack of motivation and discipline?"},

{"title": "E is for Eating  -  Friko's Personal and Private Alphabet Game", "date": "Thursday 5 January 2012", "text": "Dionysos MosaicE is for eating . . . .not food, not nourishment, not survival, but eating; or, as that old devil Ambrose Bierce has it:Eat, v.i.,  to perform successively (and successfully) the functions of mastication, humectation and deglutition. (Chewing, moistening and swallowing)A very suitable subject for examination after a period of almost obligatory excess. On Christmas Day many people eat three to four times more than they eat on a normal day, knocking back up to 4000 calories. I dislike - always have done - very sweet foods, so I don't eat mince pies, Christmas cake or Christmas pudding, which is just as well, because I enjoy an extra glass of wine or two and certainly do justice to my main course and some chocolates for dessert, not to mention spiced cakes and Stollen for tea.Talking of Christmas pudding, or plum pudding, that Dickensian monstrosity full of suet, dried fruits, nuts and alcohol, reminds me of how I once sent one to my mother in Germany as a Christmas present. I hadn't lived in England for long and didn't know that delicacy myself. I was thinking that people here made such a fuss over Christmas pudding that it must be a special treat. After Christmas I received a letter saying \"Thank you very much; we tried it but found it totally inedible and more than two thirds of it have gone to the birds. Do you actually eat it?\" I had forgotten to tell her (mainly because I didn't know it myself) that the pudding needs boiling or, at the very least, steaming, for three hours.In 2008, almost a quarter of adults (24% of men and 25% of women aged 16 or over) in England were classified as obese (BMI 30kg/m2 or over). Although I am not part of these statistics, like most people in the fortunate position of always knowing where their next meal is coming from, I occasionally overeat. I graze, I nibble absent-mindedly, I finish what's on my plate, I pick up a passing apple or a handful of nuts, and have a biscuit with my tea. To my great shame I must admit that I am rarely, if ever, hungry, because I eat before that desirable, pleasantly empty, feeling hits my stomach to any noticeable extent. I have three sit down meals a day, whether I need them or not.That wasn't always so. Although I can't remember actually being hungry myself, my parents certainly could. They knew starvation, particularly my mother, who frequently gave her share of available food to me and sometimes to my father, who was working hard physically to help rebuild his shattered country. He was probably very grateful to her, if he thought about it at all - in hard times people tend to overlook anything that isn't directly related to daily survival -, but I wasn't. In fact, I was a most ungrateful brat, my mother said. She told a story which has me as the villain of the piece:  in a special little saucepan, she'd cook some fresh vegetable like carrots and mash them up with the family's butter ration for the day, on the rare occasion when butter was available;  she'd then follow this toddler, who ran off  into the garden, sat on the path, and stuffed dirt into her mouth, and beg her to eat the carrots instead. Unsuccessfully, on many occasions, apparently.As a teenager I had little interest in food, although it was freely available. We certainly didn't stuff ourselves as so many youngsters do today. I can't picture a single fat girl in my class at school.I don't remember when the habit of eating as an occupation crept up on me. A working mother, my children ate lunch at school and I cooked another meal in the evening for us; we all stayed slim for many years. With increasing affluence, particularly in the last few years before the financial squeeze bit into our savings, food became a deliberate pleasure; we ate out in good restaurants, sampling the dishes famous chefs cooked and spending hours over a meal. That continued well into retirement, a visit to a restaurant became something we expected from life, not a rare treat. We became gourmets and my home-cooked meals became fancier too. We possibly ate a little less but we certainly spent more money on eating. Perhaps the explanation is that more adventurous activities decrease as one gets older but the pleasure principle remains constant.And now we have come full circle.  As a toddler I refused to eat good food, now there are a few good foods I can no longer eat. Butter is a no-no, I have become dairy-intolerant.  I can only glance at all those cream cakes, rich cheeses, succulent , calorie-laden and bad cholesterol-producing dishes with regret; I must leave others to eat them. My digestive system complains if I eat too much roughage, fat or acidic food; when we go out to eat, I need to study the menu very carefully and send special instructions to the chef.The moment when food became a problem, i.e. the danger of overeating became a distinct possibility, my system rebelled. I'd love to eat some nice, mature, crumbly, cheddar or a rich hollandaise sauce;  as I can't I have to make do without. Perhaps it's better for me. But a diet of soya products and other healthy options gets awfully boring."},

{"title": "Joining the Post-Christmas Chorus", "date": "Wednesday 28 December 2011", "text": "Snowdrops in the garden on Christmas Day.Today was the first (almost) ordinary day after the Christmas holidays. Many of you have expressed joy at life returning to normal, may I join you? Here in the UK the holidays aren't quite over, shops are open, of course, but many offices remain closed. Before I retired, my last working day was Dec 23rd and we didn't return to work until Jan 2nd. In fact, it was even better when the official holiday fell on a weekend, like this year, we had an extra day or two added in lieu. In those days I was glad of the extra (paid) holiday, but now I usually just want it over.I shouldn't complain, it was lovely, all of it, really. Beloved and I were left to celebrate Christmas Day in our own fashion, in the end nobody made any demands on us, and the one friend we invited, fell ill. We started very leisurely, revved down to a slow pace during the day and had come to near comatose by evening. It was all most civilised, we didn't even make ourselves sick overeating and drinking.I hand delivered the last cards around the village on the afternoon of the 23rd. I leave it as late as that for two reasons: a) those who don't 'do' cards cannot possibly feel obliged to send us one at this late stage, and b) those who 'do', but have left us off their list for the year, must scrabble around madly to get one into our letterbox before Christmas Day itself. The latter means that we must then keep them on our list for the following year. Such fun!Every year we go to a drinks party on the morning of Christmas Eve. Over the years the guests have become more and more ancient - I don't know why the hosts don't refresh their guest list occasionally - and much of the conversation is concerned with health matters. \"How are you\" invariably elicits an update on the latest health scare during the past year - many of these people we only ever meet on this day. My mother and her cronies used to have conversations like that; I swore then that I would never follow in her footsteps. Strange, how we turn into our parents eventually.At the party, a couple in their early eighties told us they'd like to buy our house, cash buy, if and when we moved. We have, during the past year, vaguely moaned about the difficulties we have managing a house and garden larger than we strictly need. What makes this elderly couple think they can manage better than us, defeats me. Admittedly, they live further up and deeper into the hills; they really should move into the village soon. After their offer, I am, of course, totally convinced that we must struggle on, at least for the moment. Perhaps gardener will come back in the new year, at the moment his wife is making him move house. She'll probably kill him in the process. Apparently, moving house is high on the list of contributing factors to heart attacks.The best part of Christmas was a dinner party on Boxing Day, given by my favourite host. He had a house guest, the same delightful lady writer with whom Beloved is mildly in love (not lust). Actually, I like her almost as much as he does, but I am secretly very fond of the host, a highly sophisticated man about town when he's away from Valley's End. Gushing? Who, me?The conversation flowed as merrily and generously as the wine and the food was excellent. We talked about poetry - even reading some out loud -, the theatre, music, literature, people in the news in the arts, the media and literary circles (the three of them are given to name-dropping; not me, sadly, I don't know anyone worth showing off about), and we even had crackers, the very superior sort, of course, with fillers like tiny tea-filled caddies, a shot glass and one silver earring. The jokes were no better than they should be, here they are:What did the plate say to the other plate?Lunch is on me.What has a bottom on its top?A pair of legs.Why do dragons make bad managers?Because they fire everybody.How do you clean a flute?With a tuba toothpaste.I think we may have fractionally overstayed our welcome. Beloved and I are nightbirds, for us the night is always young, and this was the sort of party I never want to leave. The host and his friend gallantly saw us to the bottom of his drive and the road, the night was starless and we'd probably have fallen into the cattle grid on the way out without their help. There are no policemen in Valley's End, and very few street lights. Both facts helped to get us home safely and with the minimum of fuss. Or disturbance of the peace.Our Christmas Day friend finally came to dinner last night, which rounded off the festivities nicely. Now I've had enough, certainly until next weekend, when a little more celebrating is on the cards. That is, if Im still standing by then.Is anyone else having serious problems posting, commenting, etc?I'm using a different computer from my usual desktop to post this.Problems started soon after the new dashboard became universal.It could be my imac, but that is surely unheard of? An imac going wrong?"},

{"title": "Ludlow Food Centre  -  My World", "date": "Tuesday 20 December 2011", "text": "Ludlow Food Centre  is one of those wonderful places where you can browse for the best and freshest produce, organic meat from beasts reared locally, hand made pies and ready meals actually cooked fresh on the premises, breads, pastries and cakes baked in the ovens at the bakehouse and vegetables from farms in the surrounding areas. There's even honey from the beehives in the back gardens. Shopping here is not cheap, how could it be. Everything is beautifully presented; the quality of the produce is evident; there's nothing that has been mass produced. Attention to detail is of great importance. For the snobs among us, there are connections to earls and ladies, on whose estates some of these goodies are produced. Their noble pedigree doesn't make them any better than the products of good, honest husbandry and crop farming of course, but dropping the provenance into a discussion of shopping habits pleases some. Occasionally, we treat ourselves to a basket of goodies, particularly at this time of year, when many of the goods for sale serve very well as presents for foodies and those with pretensions to foodiedom.I am sure that my home made pickles, chutneys and jams and jellies are as good as the ones on sale; and who in their right mind wants hibiscus flowers in syrup (anybody know what they're used for?). Fancy bottles of vinegars and oils infused with the most outlandish ingredients sit in tidy rows; just to read the labels is a pleasure and an education to boot.A place like the Ludlow Food Centre will never serve the same purpose for us that a good supermarket does; we could neither afford the prices nor find the everyday items one piles into ones basket as a matter of routine; but an occasional browse is a treat. Quite often we find things which are simply not on offer anywhere else, certainly not deep in rural England. And sometimes, just sometimes, there is an offer on something really delicious; either because it's nearing the end of the day and the cake or meat pie hasn't been sold on time, or they want to entice casual shoppers like us to become rather more frequent visitors.Also a part of My World, but absolutely free, are these spears of snowdrops emerging.

Of course, I took a few days off at first, tried to relax and recover my strength, but common sense didn't prevail for long. Living where we do, way out of civilisation, in the hills, and at the back of beyond, shopping trips take most of the day. No popping into town for me, no quick dash to catch the shops before closing; no, everything I do assumes the proportions of an expedition. We were out for most of the day, every day; and not just shopping or socialising; there were visits to the hospital for Beloved's eye injection, and the dog needed to go to the vet for his arthritis medication. In between I made preparations for Christmas. Blogging? Reading, Writing? Forget it!But then it snowed. And when it snows, we can't go anywhere. Which meant that I finally stopped, stood at the window and took time to stare, at the birds scrapping at the bird table, at the dark lines of hedges and tracks, the larches on the horizon and the winter sky.And when it became too dark to see anything outside I looked inside the room, saw the light of the candles and realised what I had been doing. The relief was such that it felt as if a heavy weight had suddenly been lifted from my shoulders. \"It's not my fault if 'things' aren't done, inactivity is not laziness, it's imposed upon me by a force greater than me.\" Thank you, weather gods.There was time to sit and drink tea and eat Stollen, to write Christmas letters and have long phone calls with people we won't be seeing. There was time to appreciate the beauty of the season and the gifts it brings to those who open their hearts to receive it. There was time to think and be grateful for what we have.Thank you, weather gods."},
{"title": "German Shop Windows  -  My World", "date": "Monday 12 December 2011", "text": "My daughter went on a very short weekend trip across the Channel to visit the Christmas Market at one of my favourite German cities, Charles the Great's city of Aachen. Charlemagne, as he is known in French and English, started to build his Imperial Cathedral in the year 792  and Pope Leo III consecrated it in 805. The core of the cathedral is the Palatine Carolingian Chapel; it is small compared to the rest of the building, but every inch of it speaks of over 1200 years of history. It is an absolute jewel and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.From a postcardAachen lies on the borders between Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany. Luxemburg is no more than a stone's throw away.Aachen's Christmas market is set around the cathedral and town hall. This beautifully decorated \"Christmas village\" on the market square has everything your heart could desire. One local speciality you really must try is the Aachen Printen, a kind of gingerbread.You will find a large variety of Printen and other Christmas cakes and biscuits, \"Domino Stones\", gingerbread, \"Spekulatius\" and marzipan bread. These are distributed all over the world by Aachen bakeries.At Aachen Christmas Market they come fresh from the oven.There are many stalls selling traditional folk art; these small china or, more often, beautifully glazed terracotta houses are all copies of existing buildings somewhere in Germany. They are highly prized and rather expensive to buy. I have three, perhaps there'll be another christmas post showing my wooden figures and these houses. I'd love to own more, even adults collect them. Apart from the wish to stroll about a traditional Christmas Market, eat Reibekuchen (potato cakes) and drink Gluehwein, my daughter's visit had a further purpose: to shop in German supermarkets. She goes a bit too far, I reckon, in her mania for buying German foods and specialities at this time of year; as she was willing to take a long list of items I just happened to need myself, I forgive her.I am awaiting the arrival of a large food parcel any day now.This post is part of Our World Tuesday"},

{"title": "Counting My Blessings  -  Help!", "date": "Thursday 8 December 2011", "text": "I saw this heading (without the 'Help')  at Freda's of What's the story in Dalamory, who in turn found it on Dianne's of Schmiddleyscribblins;  as my ideas for blogging seem to have dried up completely, I'll make use of it here. If anybody else finds themselves in the same shoes, feel free to do likewise.Now then,  counting my blessings is anathema to me. I've always railed against it as an occupation I wouldn't even indulge in if I found myself at the bottom of the darkest hole I've ever not looked up out of. It's not that I'm against gratitude, I consider that a definite virtue; but, I ask you, doesn't the mere fact of COUNTING blessings make the counter sound totally pathetic?Yet here I am, not even in a hole, except blog-idea-wise, counting today's blessings. Seven is the number of blessings I'm meant to come up with.:1.   I found myself waking up in my own cosy, warm bed this morning, listening to the filthiest,nastiest morning weather outside;  gusts of rain lashing the windows, gale force winds rattling the gutters, while  climbers, in extremis,  scratched the walls and clung on for dear life.And why was this a blessing? Because I didn't have to go out in it!2.   At 9.30, my wonderful cleaning lady, Kelly, arrived. I hadn't seen her since I came out of hospital last week. She is a caring, warm-hearted women, who listened to my tale of woe with lots of \"Ah, poor you. Bless. Ah, Bless\". She is rather given to lots of Ahs, and 'Bless' is one of her favourite expressions.It has been known to grate on me in the past, when I've come across people whose empathy finds no other verbal outlet.Today, it was a blessing to find a simple, kind soul, who sounded as if she meant every Ah and every Bless. 3.   Kelly cleaned my house, quickly, efficiently and with a minimum of fuss.If that's not a blessing, I don't know what is.4.   While Kelly was working, I had a whole morning to clear my desk. It's been weeks since I tidied up paperwork, bills, receipts; at least two months since I last reconciled bank statements and filed other financial letters. That allowed me to rediscover various pieces of information, previously hidden, from societies in which I have an interest. I was beginning to think I'd been taken off their Christmas lists this year.5.   Lunch was pasta, my favourite. Quick and easy to cook.6.   Beloved offered to take Benno out for me in the afternoon. It was still tipping it down, with hail blown about by the wind fit to poke holes in the back of your neck. I gratefully took him up on the offer. I was doubly grateful when they came back drenched.Bless him.7.   Instead, I managed to write a long letter to a friend in Germany, whom I  have neglected since the summer, when we met by courtesy of Skype. I wrote the last long letter to her at the same time last year; the fact that she hasn't complained  in spite of my cavalier behaviour towards her tells you what a good friend she is. Or is it possible that neither of us is quite as bothered about the other as we were a few years ago? The thing is, I finally wrote, which makes me feel good about myself and gets rid of the niggling guilt feeling I've had for months.8.   Can TV be a blessing? Maybe not, unless it's your favourite cop show transmitted to your own TV, in your own room, via digital, satellite TV, all the way from Germany to the UK. Sitting with my feet up, watching the box this evening I would even call bliss, rather than a blessing.It seems that my blessings are all to do with idleness; others might find that quite embarrassing. But you'll never get me to admit guilt for being idle. I like it. Besides, not only did I come up with eight good things happening today, but I wouldn't even call them blessings as such. So, there's even more reason to feel good about myself. Counting blessings? Pah, who needs it!PS: The picture above is nothing to do with this post. I took it on a foggy day in November in the garden.  What? You didn't really expect me to go out in this weather just to find a suitable picture to head up this post? You did? Dear me."},

{"title": "THE FEAST OF ST. NIKOLAUS", "date": "Friday 2 December 2011", "text": "This is an article I wrote for a local paper.Normal service will be resumed shortly.I've been ill and without a computer. Although back home and feeling much better,I haven't got enough energy to come and visit all my lovely friends; it'll take me a while to get round to all of you.And there I was, hoping to collect enough stories, reminiscences and poems for anotherAdvent calendar for you and maybe reach four hundred followers by the end of this year. Ah well. Maybe next year.Knecht RuprechtAgios Nikolaos , better known as Saint Nicholas, was a fourth century bishop in Myra, now part of modern Turkey. Historically, there is very little more that is known of him, except that he is generally seen as a charitable man with a social conscience.Legends however, abound. Nicolaos saves his home town from famine by miraculously providing grain;  he saves three maidens from shame and ignominy by secretly leaving three pieces of gold in their hovel, while they sleep, thus providing them with a dowry. He saves sailors from a watery grave and leads a young man imprisoned in a distant country back to his homeland. His most famous legendary miracle is that he is said to have revived and reassembled three drunken  students, who had been murdered, chopped up and pickled in a vat by an evil innkeeper. No wonder that Nicolaos became the patron saint of, among others, children, students, sailors, travelling merchants and apothecaries.The feast day of St Nicholas falls on December 6th and is still celebrated in many western and eastern European countries; during  the night of December 5th  he arrives to bring gifts to the children of Germany.These gifts had to have been earned, only ‘good’ children were the lucky recipients of Sankt Nikolaus’ presents.  'Nikolaus' was one of those saints, like St. Martin, whose feast days we children awaited with great excitement, but, in the case of the former, a modicum of uneasiness. No matter how good we may have been, there were always those disturbing memories of having been naughty at some time during the year since he last visited,  which had caused parents or teachers to be displeased. Nikolaus had a golden book in which he carefully noted all our good and bad deeds, and even thoughts. Good children were rewarded with presents on Nikolaus Eve, but bad children were punished. Nikolaus had a special companion for the purpose, his servant Ruprecht; Ruprecht carried Nikolaus' heavy sack filled with presents but he  also carried a switch made of birch twigs, with which he beat the air occasionally, making us hold on to mother if the switch whistled by too close for comfort.During early Advent, father occasionally brought sweets or some biscuits home after work. \"I saw Nikolaus today and he let me take these from his basket\". I thought that was a good sign; we children believed every word adults uttered.We were also busy writing wish lists for Nikolaus. Times were still very hard and presents were not then taken for granted, as they are now. Our requests were modest compared to today’s. A wooden toy, perhaps a rag doll, sweets and biscuits, nuts and fruit and a picture book or two, those are the presents I remember.  I never had to wear wooden clogs, like my father did as a boy, but I had a pair just for Nikolaus Day, because they were the appropriate receptacle for Nikolaus' gifts in the Lower Rhineland.Until we were able to travel again to family living in other villages and celebrate the day with my cousins, Sankt Nikolaus didn’t come to me in person. “He has to visit too many other children to make time to come here, he may not come at all”, mother said.  Obviously, I was very disappointed but also just a little relieved; my conscience was never totally clear. As the evening progressed, the atmosphere in the kitchen, where I was sitting with my back to the large, old-fashioned range, with a picture or colouring book, grew quiet, with a slight tingle of tension in the air. I kept my head down firmly over my book, all the time listening for sounds from outside.The noise, when it came, did not come from outside, but from right behind me. With a great clatter a wooden toy, a tin of hard boiled sweets and toffees, apples and  gingerbread biscuits came flying into the room. Sankt Nikolaus had thrown all these goodies down the chimney for me and they had survived coming down into the kitchen via the big black stove pipe and the fire in the range. It was a wonder mother hadn’t been hit because she was standing right there, in the way. On the other hand, it was good that she was standing there because she said she had heard Sankt Nikolaus  shout down the chimney that he might come again, later in the night, on his way back home and if he had anything left in his sack he’d put it into my clogs, if I left them out for him. Which I did, naturally, just in case.  And Sankt Nikolaus was as good as his word: in the morning I found that he had left me a book and a teddy bear and more sweets and sticky gingerbread and apples than could fit into my clogs!One particular year, before I outgrew my belief in  Nikolaus, we spent the feast day at my aunt Johanna’s house; my cousin Dieter was the same age as me, about six or seven. He and I had been told to get ready for a visit from Nikolaus and that he would expect us to sing a song or recite a poem. That wasn’t a problem, every child knew the traditional songs and poems; the problem was, would our nerve hold? Dieter opted for a song, which meant I had to recite a poem. I remember it well “Von drauss vom Walde komm ich her. . . . . .”  We practiced all afternoon.When male members of the family, disguised with beard and in appropriate costume, i.e., a magnificent coat with a deep hood and boots for Sankt Nikolaus and all enveloping dark rags for the Servant Ruprecht, roughly knocked on the door and demanded entry, many a child’s heart beat furiously, fearfully remembering a small lie, a naughty deed or a hidden shame. December’s early darkness fell, but before the lights in the cold, outer hallway could be lit, my older cousin Helga rushed into the kitchen, shouting “ Nikolaus is on his way, he’s already been next door, he’ll be here any minute.”Both Dieter and I went into hiding. But it wasn’t any good, we had to come out; there was Nikolaus and although he sounded gruff and a little hoarse, he looked quite kindly on us. Dieter croaked a verse of his song and I managed to stumble through the first two lines of the poem which I knew off by heart, before I gave up. Nikolaus then asked “What do you say, have you been good children? Do you think you deserve a present?”Quick as a flash my cousin Dieter said: “I have, but Ursula hasn’t. She always spits at me.”I couldn’t let him get away with that. I said: “ Dieter does it too, he spits first.”Nikolaus appeared to have been overcome with emotion at that, as evidenced by his heaving shoulders; we both got away with it.I am glad to say that the custom of frightening children with the spectre of a vengeful Knecht (Servant) Ruprecht ended during my childhood. It was usually my uncle who dressed up as Nikolaus and it didn't take us children long to work it out for ourselves. Knecht Ruprecht was said to be waiting outside by the sleigh, but the adults gave up the pretence of even that."},

{"title": "Gratitude", "date": "Saturday 26 November 2011", "text": "Painting by Stipan TadicThe Blogosphere has been awash with expressions of gratitude during the past week. To have one day in the year when families,  communities, indeed a whole nation, unite in appreciation of the good things in life, is truly wonderful, and I hope that kind of special awareness does not evaporate as soon as the last farewells have been said and the dishes have been washed and put back into the kitchen cupboards. Genuinely giving thanks is not something we do often enough.Saying 'Thank You' is as ubiquitous in the UK as saying 'Sorry'.  German friends and family always remark on it.  Both phrases are constantly used in the world I inhabit, and probably quite thoughtlessly at times. Still, they oil the grooves of social interaction and who am I to question their usefulness; in fact, I am as guilty of overusing them as the next person. The sweetest and most gratifying 'thank you' I remember, came from two men on two separate occasions; a frail, elderly, man and a strong and healthy looking boy, probably no more than eighteen years old.  I hadn't been in the UK long when I came across the first man. Waiting to cross a busy road, I noticed him hesitating at the kerb;  several times he put a foot out to step into the road, only to pull it back again as cars sped by. I simply took his arm and said \"Let me help you\", no fuss, no introductions, no question. I was very young. He thanked me fulsomely, wheezing as he tried to catch his breath, his voice as frail as his body. I was about to leave him on the pavement opposite and continue on my way when he asked \"where do you come from?\" I told him \"Germany\", and \"why?\" \"You're only young\", he said, you won't know much about the war. A bomb did this to me, I got this weak chest from being buried. And now here you are, helping me, and you are German.\" I was at a loss what to say to him. \"Sorry,\" was all I managed. \"It's not your fault,\" he said, \"it's a long time ago now and we must all try to forgive and not let it happen again.\" And \"Thank you again for your kindness.\"The young man was a beggar on London's Embankment, no doubt one of the thousands of homeless, parentless youngsters who had been 'released' from children's homes into 'Care in the Community' at eighteen. He had a pleasantly cheeky grin on his face, as he held out his hand, which made me dig in my pocket for a coin. As I dropped it into his hand, he looked at it closely, and the grin grew into the sunniest, brightest smile, transforming his whole face. \"Thank you, lady,\" he beamed. I was a little surprised, it hadn't been that big a gift. I was with a friend, we moved on, making for a drink at the nearby pub; the place was crowded and while we were still queueing for service at the bar, the young man came rushing in, one hand in a fist held high above his head, shouting happily \"I have enough money for a pint, I'll have a pint, please.\"  I was as happy as he was to know that I had made such bliss possible and have rarely given a gift that has met with such instant reward.There is one more story where kindness met with the opposite of gratitude. Again, a man and crossing a very busy road were involved. I was making my way to a staggered Pelican crossing, with railings and an island in the middle, outside a major London station, when a blind man waved his white stick at me. \"Help me across, won't you,\" he demanded. \"Of course,\" I said and took his arm. \"The official crossing is no more than five yards this way, I'm just about to use it myself,\" I said, and \"I'll take you there\". \"I know about the crossing\", he said, \" I don't want the crossing, I want to cross in this direction.\" \"Are you sure,\" I said, \"this is a dangerous road  and I'd feel so much safer using the Pelican crossing.\" He pulled his arm out of mine. \"Stupid woman,\" he said, \"I'll go without you then.\" He almost, but not quite, stamped his foot, assuming I'd give in. I didn't. I turned my back and left him to it."},

He was a large man, sitting with arms folded and legs outstretched.Worthy of further attention, I thought.The wife went in to see the nurse, her seat was quickly taken by another patient, a very elderly man on sticks, walking with difficulty and sitting down heavily;  Boomer engaged him in conversation. Ten minutes later,  the wife came back out, she'd obviously  had drops in her eyes and was to wait for them to work before she was called back in. There was no free seat now. Boomer sat immobile. The old man offered the wife his seat and, in spite of her protestations, painfully heaved himself to his feet; it took him quite a while. Boomer remained immobile. He watched the whole procedure unmoved, his face completely passive. Luckily, the old man was called in by the time he was fully upright.I am sure my mouth hung open.oo oo ooThe Sun enters the House of SagittariusThe man born under Sagittarius shall have mercy on every man he sees.

{"title": "Happy Families", "date": "Monday 21 November 2011", "text": "\"Oh dear\", I said.\"What is it?\" Beloved asked.\"Nothing. Everything\"' I replied.\"That's sad\", he said.I was sitting at the kitchen table. We'd finished a simple supper, but there had been a glass of wine. The kitchen was warm and still, the lamp was pulled low over the table and we sat in a cosy pool of light. I had the perpetual birthday calendar in front of me. It's gardener's birthday in the next few days and I was making sure that I wouldn't miss it. At the hairdresser's this morning two women were talking about the imminent arrival of Christmas. \"Less than five weeks to go,\" one of them said. \"I know. Have you got a lot left to do?\" the other one said. \"No, I'm all finished. I've done most of it over the internet. John's girls want money, my sister's kid is six and you can get a six year old anything; my mum and dad were easy, so was my sister, and I've got a few bits and pieces from the shops for hubby and the boys, mainly vouchers and stuff. The boys want to do their own shopping.\"Studying the calendar, this overheard conversation came into my head. I scanned the next two months ahead for birthday dates. \"Do you realise Jack will be eighteen in January?\" \"No, really? Golly, that's amazing.\" \"Will you do something special?\" \"I shouldn't think so.\"When my grandsons turned eighteen I gave them a larger money present than usual. \"I think I'll stop sending them money once they're twenty-one; they're hardly aware of my existence, they rarely say thank you and they've certainly never given me anything.\"We have six children between us, all adults, and no really meaningful contact with any of them. Christmas and birthday cards, a few phone calls, and the odd duty visit from three of them, that's about it. Two of them we haven't seen for years. It's nobody's fault, it just happened. Divorce, moving house, jobs, imagined slights, a grudge having taken hold, even differing attitudes to life, religion, etc., but mainly a general lack of closeness. It never used to bother me, but now it breaks my heart when I think of it.We already have tentative plans for the festive season, we are sure to see friends, we always do. We may  have an email nearer the time from one of the sons announcing a flying visit; on the other hand, we may not.

{"title": "Sleeping Beauty", "date": "Sunday 20 November 2011", "text": "Tess Kincaid's Magpie Tale No. 92For other responses, click on the prompt.Once upon a time, in a far distant kingdom, there lived a beautiful princess. Beautiful princesses live in castles, and Dornröschen,  for that was her name, was no exception. Life was good, Dornröschen was not only very pretty, but also a good girl. As in so many far distant lands of the time, a very wicked witch also lived in the kingdom. It is well known that witches were usually extremely envious of pretty young maidens, who also happen to be princesses, and this one ran true to form. She cast a spell on Dornröschen, which made the girl fall into a deep sleep destined to last for a hundred years. Just so that nobody would notice her evil deed - although quite what she hoped to achieve by turning Dornröschen into a sleeping beauty, is anyone's guess - she caused the thick thorn bushes around the castle to grow to enormous heights, much like my hedges, when they haven't been cut for a year.Time passed, the thorn bushes gradually encroached on the lawns and pleasure gardens, until the long tendrils had almost swallowed up the castle itself. Dornröschen slept the sleep of the just, on and on, blissfully unaware of the world around her. Nobody had set the alarm, lucky girl.And then, one day, out of the blue, a young man happened upon the thicket of thorn bushes. It was summer and the bushes were covered in the sweetest smelling blossom. He decided to investigate. He was a prince, not only handsome but also courageous - they always were, calling a prince cowardly just wouldn't do, would it ? -  so he hacked his way deeper and deeper into the thicket until he came upon the enchanted castle. He made his way inside and found the princess' bedchamber. She had slept so deeply and peacefully, that she had hardly rumpled the sheets, after all this time they still showed the marks where they had been folded after ironing. I wish somebody would do that for my bedlinen.Dornröschen looked so very pretty and inviting, that the prince just couldn't help himself, he kissed her. He was, of course, meant to do just that, that's how you wake a princess.Dornröschen stretched and yawned and stretched again. She opened her eyes.\"Hallo there, you've awakened me, who are you?  And how did you get in here?\"\"I am the handsome prince, come to rescue you from the spell of the wicked witch.\" He must have had a sudden flash of inspiration, or perhaps he remembered a tale which his old nurse used to tell him; anyway he got it right. (If you, dear reader, are not satisfied with this explanation, you may make up your own.)\"Oh, thank you, thank you so much,\" Dornröschen cried. She vaguely remembered seeing the witch approach her with a malicious glint in her eye and cackling something unintelligible - we know it must have been the spell - . She remembered nothing after that.The prince lay down on the bed but, as he had been brought up properly, he tenderly held her head in his hands and kissed her sweet lips. He remembered again the story his old nurse had told him and knew what would happen next. \"We shall be married,\" he said, \"we shall be prince and princess together and live happily ever after.\"The princess quite fancied him and had no objections to the plan. But one thing bothered her, would he turn out to be a fortune hunter? In spite of her innocence she had seen the way of the world before she fell asleep. Her father - where had He been all this time? - had often enough warned her.\"Before we go any further\", she said, \" how about getting the lawyers to draw up a pre-nuptial agreement?\""},
{"title": "Memory Boxes", "date": "Friday 18 November 2011", "text": "Do you do what I do, namely, collect things?Souvenirs, programmes, ticket stubs, magazines, ancient photographs, postcards, thank you notes, wish-you-were-here cards?If you do, how often do you look at any of these?  Take them out of their boxes? Even just dust them or sort them? My enthusiasm for buying a programme at every event we attend, whether concert, play, opera, or anything else, is certainly not matched by any enthusiasm to revisit them. There they sit, in their boxes, on shelves, in closets, in trunks under the eaves, unregarded and unloved. Unwanted? But stored for all eternity, the piles growing in size, fading, collecting dust, yet dragged from one house to another. How could I possibly throw away ten year old gardening magazines? I have old supermarket and vineyard receipts from trips to the continent. We used to fill the backseat and boot of a large estate car with wine from France and Germany,  as well as boxes full of tinned and bottled food, which was then not obtainable in the UK. It made me feel efficient to keep a record of time and place of the purchases, no doubt another sign of mental impairment. I looked at an envelope of receipts the other day, the ink on them had long faded beyond legibility. It really hurt to chuck them out.New lovers collect everything to do with the halcyon days of first infatuation, new parents cannot bear to discard first bootees, a wisp of hair, hospital wristband, and a million baby photos. Every minute of every day is recorded, documented and treasured. I am glad to say that, as new love grows out of the habit of being new and children grow up and become teenagers, this mania lessens, at least for the saner members of the human race.There is a valid case to be made for preserving family documents, letters which give an insight into the time when they were written and the character of the writer, as well as all those documents which officialdom requires us to keep to prove who we are. I have never forgiven my mother for ripping up and binning a box full of  papers pertaining to my father's, uncle's and grandfather's role in the war; I would give anything to have them still. When I first learned what she had done, I was furious with her.She said: \"I don't want to be reminded, it's old history, it's over, times have changed.\" She actually believed that nobody would ever be interested in them. I think she was being particularly stupid and lacking in perception; I still think so, but nowadays I can understand. For her, the time had been hard, the feelings still raw, best forgotten. To her they hadn't been at all heroic, just doing what they needed to do and any official recognition afterwards was superfluous.Old diaries are in the same category, even the silly ones, which run along the lines of \"and then I did, and then I went, and then I said.\" And if they are worth keeping, how much more interesting are the ones which give an accurate picture of the way our forebears lived. Again, my mother did the unforgiveable: she threw my teenage diaries away the first time I left home as a young adult (as well as children's books). No doubt reading those teenage diaries today would make me cringe, but I'd still like to have a chance to see what a silly and pretentious ass I was.This post is turning into an unintentional diatribe against my mother,  I'd best get back to the subject in hand, which is clutter. I have no idea why I keep so much of it. Take photographs, for instance. Last summer, I took an old suitcase full of ancient photographs, many of them holiday snaps, landscapes and badly lit groups of people. Sifting through them, I realised that I hardly remembered the holidays, didn't recognise the landscapes and that most of the people meant nothing to me. Very few of these photographs survived the bonfire and, guess what, I haven't missed them once since that day. Landscape photography is best left to the professionals, who have the equipment and the know-how. Digital photography has done away with boxes full of yellowing snaps, which were never any good in the first place. At least the worst of them can now be deleted instantly.As far as I'm aware, nobody spends many hours pouring over their collection of objects from the past.  What is it that makes me collect train tickets, receipts and theatre programmes?  Is collecting memories less about memories than the action of collecting? The day will come when I will disappear into oblivion; am I trying to delay that moment by creating a barricade of memories around me?  Is writing a memoir part of the same syndrome?Someday, somebody in the family will have the task to sift through my precious memories, all those bits of paper that prove that I was here. Why don't I make it easier on whoever that will be and make a start myself?"},

There are exhibitions and displays and when you've had enough of lectures and a wonderful hot air balloon flight over the awe-inspiring Shropshire Hills in the company of our erstwhile Shropshire Hills neighbour, Pete Postlethwaite, you can refresh yourself with food and drink, all under the same grass-covered roof.The outdoors isn't bad either; miles of wonderful meadows, hills and marshland, with a river running through, are yours for the price of a sturdy pair of boots and a walking stick. And if you have a dog to come with you, so much the better.Nearest to the Discovery Centre is a large nature reserve and here artists are encouraged to display sculptures made from natural, mainly found, materials. The exhibits are left for nature to play with and if nature decides that their lifetime has come to a natural end, then so be it. Two Fingers Up To Art?No, a lot of fingers.A wind harp?I've heard it play. It clatters rather unmelodiously, but the sounds are interesting.Better is the play of light and shadow on the wooden planks, as they move inthe wind. A fish head in the trees.A whole tree of fishes.A colourful arrangement of drum-like shapes.Perhaps the birds play them when they come for the holly berries.I don't know what the last two sculptures represent but I recognise the dog.This is one of nature's own sculptures: I can see a toad with golden pond algae still clinging to him.I think this rock will still be here when all the otherexhibits have long withered away."},

{"title": "November Light and Dark", "date": "Saturday 12 November 2011", "text": "Yesterday was Martinmas, the festival of winter's beginning; the day when German children carry lanterns in procession through the streets following  St Martin, a very good and kind-hearted man, riding a white horse to the church, where they come upon a poor beggar shivering on the church steps. St Martin, with a great flourish, takes off his warm cloak, draws his sword and cuts the cloak in two and throws half to the beggar, who receives it gratefully and wraps himself up. It's a lovely story which I have told elsewhere and quite a profitable one for children. Not only do they learn to be kind to those in need but they are also rewarded handsomely with a bag full of delicious bonbons, chocolates, apples and biscuits.In the UK Armistice Day was commemorated and Valley's End had donned a suitably mournful mantle. the whole day remained grey, with very low visibility, the mist dripping steadily, sadly, as if nature herself wept despairing tears over the endless slaughter which mankind inflicts on itself and will no doubt continue to do, no matter on how many solemn occasions we stand and bow our heads in sorrow.On such a day it is best to gather friends around you and spend a happy evening talking by the fire. A pleasant meal, a bottle of wine, a large dog to lie by your chair, who doesn't mind your stockinged feet warming themselves on his belly, and good-natured conversation, most of it undemanding, and getting more so as the evening progresses and the contents of the bottle sink to the kind of level where it's best to open another one, and perhaps another one after that. The kind of evening where you plan good things for the place you call home, where members of the community depend on each other and where warfare is something brought to you via TV. One of you mentions that the church roof is leaking badly and needs urgent repairs and perhaps you start to discuss means of fundraising. A Safari dinner seemed a good idea,  they always go down well and raise large amounts of money. Somebody else mentioned a christmas party for  children of the local Infants School, to be organised by ladies of 'a certain age' rather than young mums, who are too busy to to do more than buy small presents for Father Christmas to distribute.  A party which children remember as part of their growing-up years and look back on with pleasure.Our plans grew in the certainty of being able to call on the goodwill of others in Valley's End; very little financial outlay and 'many hands making light work' would guarantee success, we were certain of it. Perhaps I promised a little more than I might want to do in the cold light of another misty morning, but a good deed is a good deed and a promise is a promise.Besides, I am sorely in need of blogging material."},

It also can mean that portion of the full day during which a location is illuminated by the light of the sun. The period of time measured from local noon to the following local noon is called a solar day.\" This is how Wikipedia starts the entry for DAY, very prosaically. Wikipedia's soul has no poetry.Not like Philip Larkin, who asks:                                                     What are days for?Days are where we live.They come, they wake usTime and time over.They are to be happy in;Where can we live but day?Ah, solving that questionBrings the priest and the doctorin their long coatsRunning over the field.I've asked the day for an answer, but answer came there none.When Hemera, Greek goddess of the day, daughter of Erebos (Darkness) and Nyx (Night) and sister-wife to Aither (Light) sends the first finger of light to tickle my eyelids and then puts her whole hand on my face to awaken me, my first question is not: 'what will you do for me', but: what do you want me to do for you today'. It is the answer to the next question which will allow me to establish a plan: 'which of the seven days of the week are you?' It's hardly the riddle of the Theban Sphynx and my answer will not condemn me to be eaten by the beast; I know it must be morning and I shall walk on two legs, rather than four,  just as soon as I have thrown off the bed clothes.Days are where we live. Diaries and appointment books are the signposts and the instruction manual allocates tasks for the day. Whether these tasks be pleasant or hard, perform them we must, with grace and diligence. That is the purpose of the day. How else will we deserve the solace of the evening? Mealtimes and playtimes provide sustenance, rest and recreation, if we use them well. If friends and friendly acquaintances play a role in our day then we are to be congratulated. Whether they alone can account for happiness, I couldn't say. Happiness is a rare gift, those of us who are passengers in Phoebus' chariot on his earth-circling journey may catch a glimpse of it, as momentary as the flash of the swallow's silver wing before it rises out of sight. I think Larkin is wrong when he says days are to be happy in, how could we bear unalloyed joy?I need my dull routine, I want my signposts to point to well-trodden and comfortable paths and my mealtimes to be pleasant. To share my bread with friends will be a pleasure, fair-weather friends will find the boat is full. If pleasant conversation, not gossip, is your aim,  please ring the doorbell, or better still, call round the back where you will find an open door. I freely admit, my day is dull, and priest and doctor can do nothing about it. So stay where you are and tend to those who need you more. If I have been fortunate and have been granted a glimpse of the silver wing of happiness out of the corner of my eye, I'll even return your medicine.In the evening, when  Hemera's mother Nyx draws a veil of darkness between the shining atmosphere of the aither and the lower air of earth (aer), bringing night to me, I'll draw my curtain too. If wine, 'God's next best gift to man' makes an appearance at that time, it will be welcome. And furthermore, when the day comes and my answer to the Sphynx's riddle must be 'three legs', I shall be grateful if my days shall have remained as dull as they are now.With Stevie Smith, I'll gladly say:Put out that Light,Put out that bright Light,Let darkness fall.Put out that Day,It is the time for nightfall.Helius, Nyx and Hemera-Heos, Athenianblack-figure  lekythos C5th BC, Metropolitan Museum"},
{"title": "Conversational Riddles At Breakfast", "date": "Monday 7 November 2011", "text": "It was a cold morning today, garden and castle meadow were bedecked with rime, and the tops of the hills having disappeared into a grey mist,  the great outdoors  looked hardly inviting. But we were due for the post-op examination of Beloved's eye at the hospital in Shrewsbury, which meant that we were having our breakfast muesli rather earlier than usual. Benno was lying between kitchen table and Aga and, as he wasn't going to come with us, but was lucky enough to be able to stay at home with his dog sitter, we envied him.Lifting his arthritic hind leg, he started to scratch the area by his right eye. Being rather concerned with eyes at the moment, Beloved said:\"Don't do that, you'll hurt your beautiful eye\" and took hold of the leg.\"Leave him\", I said, \"he has more sense than to hurt his eye. More sense than you anyway.\" Beloved used to be a sun worshipper and some of his skin and eye problems are due to the effects of excessive exposure to sun.\"You don't have more sense than me, do you?\" Beloved said to Benno. \"You can't do your seven times table, but I can!\"Benno scratched again, paying us no attention at all.Beloved moved in his chair and winced.\"Something wrong? I asked. \"Have you found a new place that might cause us to consult the doctors?\"We are really extremely fond of each other and my question sounded a lot more sympathetic than it looks here.'Hm\", he said, \"you may not believe this, but I had a rather sharp twinge of pain in my ankle.\"\"Riddled with arthritis, that's what you are,\" I said.\"Can you say 'riddled' in this sense?\",  Beloved asked.  \"Of course you can\", I said, riddled as in meshed. \"Holey, you know.\"\"Yes, riddled with holes. Or bullets, they'd make holes too. Or how about maggots, or germs,\" he pondered.\"Riddled with germs? No that doesn't work. Germs don't make riddles. Or holes.\"\"There aren't any holes in the Golden Syrup riddle either\", Beloved said. \"Do you know the Tate & Lyle label?  The dead lion and the bees? It's a riddle in the Bible, from Samson ( in Judges 14: 14 - I looked it up) \"Out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness.\" (Answer: bees making a honeycomb in the carcass of a lion he had killed.)Tate & Lyle have used that label since they first made the syrup\".\"Well, fancy that. Hadn't we better get going?\"There is, of course, the Exeter Riddle Book, but as that is medieaval, it has rude bits. Look it up for yourself.We weren't finished with riddles, although the final one was not really a riddle, more of a question: for the first time ever in real life, rather than on tv, we saw a slight young man, with greasy reddish-blond hair and a very pale complexion, as if he hadn't spent much time out of doors lately, being taken to \"Outpatients' in the hospital in handcuffs. He was being led by a male guard and a female guard followed them. He looked weedy and spindly and unsavoury. I have to say, I felt rather sorry for him.Matters on the eye front are unresolved. There have been developments which might be bad. The dry macular degeneration in one eye may have turned into the wet sort. We have another appointment for next Monday; speed is of the essence. Beloved may be a candidate for a new kind of treatment. That's a riddle only the doctors can answer."},
{"title": "Progress Report on Writing  - 1", "date": "Friday 4 November 2011", "text": "Thank you everybody for commenting on the previous post about my intention to write a memoir. I'd like to say right away, that I won't stop blogging,  I am an addict. I will also try and visit my followers' blogs and anybody else who leaves an interesting or constructive comment. Perhaps it would be of general interest if I post an occasional progress report; there are a number of people in the blog world who are delving into their history and writing about it, we might learn from each other. It would also force me to continue writing as I'd find it hard to admit defeat publicly.I am consumed with this idea of writing a memoir at the moment - no half measures for Friko, there's that 'bald-headed' streak coming through again -; I had a dream last night which was a textbook example of the subconscious dealing with daytime thoughts. My very confused and frightening dream told me how hard and strenuous the work will be and that I will have to rely entirely on my own recollections, and do some serious research.I have already learned the difference between my own blogging and serious writing: a bit of waffling does no harm on a blog, facts don't need to be seriously researched, context doesn't matter and a blog post is best kept short, whereas a story will not come alive unless you add colour and detail and get the chronology right. I can write a blog post in twenty minutes flat, whereas the first draft detailing the events of just one day took me the best part of three days.One chapter of Two Thousand Five Hundred Forty Seven words written  -  how many to go?"},

Weeks that feel a bit like pulling a steam engine uphill by a strap over your shoulder.(I had to get a picture in, even though there will be no further mention of steam engines and they have absolutely nothing to do with this post)Then there are weeks that are full of chores and appointments, the dog needs the vet, a doctor's visit is due, the washing machine needs fixing and even the book you're reading is the most boring tome, destined for the charity shop pile.Occasionally, weeks take flight, leaving you breathless and exhilarated; I've just had one of the latter. Not that they happen very often, I probably couldn't stand the pace for more than one week at a time. As it is, I am glad the weather has turned gloomy and cold, giving me the perfect excuse to put my feet up and watch documentaries on tv for the rest of the day.It started with an impromptu dinner party at my house. Some friends are going away for a month and we felt like having a convivial evening before they left. I also invited another guest whose work frequently takes him away from Valley's End. All three are connected with literature, drama and writing and all three are the sort of guests a hostess dreams of: lively, intelligent, without food fads and foibles and happy to drink a glass of wine or two. Okay, you might say, there are lots of people like that. Yes, there are, not lots, but some; what made these people stand out as far as this hostess is concerned is the fact that they all appreciate my writing! A blogger friend said in a comment the other day that I don't seem to be fishing for applause for my posts. Oh, but Mary D., you are wrong, I like applause as much as the next person, and to have these people come right out and say how much they liked my pieces in the local paper  absolutely made my evening.More stimulation followed a day later. I belong to a group of people who get together once a fortnight to speak German. I am the only native German speaker, the others are British and their command of the language is varied.  Sometimes the afternoon is dead boring, people stumble over words and I am constantly translating and explaining. This time we took an easily understandable piece from a German newspaper about warring neighbours; people who fight each other to the death about a parking space outside their homes or chuck dustbins through windows when the volume of late night music becomes more than somebody can bear. And God help you if you let your sheep stray beyond your own land and they trespass and nibble the grass in my meadow!  Human nature is the same the world over, we all have similar stories to tell and we all enjoy a malicious snicker about the misfortune of others occasionally.My special pleasure derives from standing just a fraction of a millimetre on the periphery and watching the show.The writers' group seems to have found a firm base. No doubt, the cast of characters will change as we go along but the ones who were there this week all seemed seriously interested. We had some really good work presented to the group: an Irishman brought a fantastic poem on 'The Troubles', which he read in a broad Irish accent. Once the vague old lady had finally found one of the two poems she wanted to read - she never found the other - she turned in a marvellously lyrical piece of work about a small child growing up by the river Severn; she is obviously still the same, unfocussed, dreamer she was then, living in a world to which few earthlings have access. I asked how long she had been writing poetry and she said:\"I was taken away from home when I was three, when my mother died, and never knew where home had been. My teacher at school allowed me to sit in the library when other children had reading practice and I found the book of poetry. One of the poems said: 'I remember, I remember / The house where I was born / The little window where the sun / came peeping in at morn; (a poem by Thomas Hood). So I thought that poets must be very special people, because they knew where home was and if I became one then maybe I would remember too.\"And finally, as the newsreaders say, all this literature has made my own fingers itch to pick up a discarded piece of work and start again. For one whole day this week I have been sitting at the computer composing a new chapter of a memoir, about just one day. I had planned to read this piece to the writers' group, but it grew and grew and is still not completed. The work flowed easily, I am happy with what I have written so far, and I will continue with it. As I said to my friend Deborah, who is going through similar birth pangs (she won't thank me for saying this out loud), \"If I don't do it now, I never will\".And that might be the reason why you will see a little less of me round here."},

Not long now, and he would be with me. Snug under my covers, I could hear him move about in the room next door, the room where he spent his afternoons and evenings. Sometimes, of course, he left the house altogether, leaving me to snooze, idle and unwanted; without him I had no life, no life at all. It was he who tickled me into being, it was he who could awaken the song in my heart, every fibre of my body vibrating, wave after wave of happiness ringing out in delight, filling my soul with joy, shuddering to an overwhelming feeling of satisfaction when he finally came to a halt many hours later.Yes, I looked forward to our regular meetings, when he concentrated fully on me and my needs. The whole morning belonged to me, I had his undivided attention. Knowing how lucky I was I never stopped being grateful, served him well, taking hardly any time off. Very rarely did I suffer from any kind of illness, but when it happened, he wrapped me up tenderly and carried me to a hospital, where I sat on a bench while somebody else's rough hands poked about in my innards, dripping grease over my sinews and adjusting my muscles. I disliked being touched by anyone but him, but his pleasure at having me all to himself again, back home, after an episode of absence, made up for the indignity.Finally, I heard the door open and he came over to where I sat, still hidden from view. I could feel his hands lifting the covers, folding them back carefully, slowly exposing me to his full gaze. I shivered a little as he ran his fingers delicately over my keys. Contrary to his usual custom, he did not sit down in front of me, but stood poised above me, looking at me with troubled eyes.For the first time in our long and mutually satisfying relationship I had no idea what was coming next.\"Well, old girl,\" he said, \"It'll break my heart. You have seen me through many a difficult birth. Sitting here, stroking you, pounding you for so many years, and releasing my creative energies into you has brought me success and recognition. But let's face it, \" he continued, \"you have grown old in my service, your smooth bodywork and efficient rhythms have become rough and unreliable. It's time to replace you with one of the new-fangled machines, which, I hear, even tell me when I get the spelling wrong. Admit it, you never did that. \"He patted me on the head. \"I'll always appreciate your stalwart nature and true heart and I'll never love anyone as I have loved you. Believe me, and I mean this most sincerely, it's not you, it's me.\"I was shocked rigid. My keys sat stiff and unmoving; a small tinkle, like a funeral bell, rang out when he picked me up with both hands and deposited me unceremoniously on the bottom shelf of his bookcase, and covered me up again.Here I've been sitting for weeks now, drying up and silent. I heard the usurper being lifted into my rightful place. Apparently the upstart needs a lot of juice delivered via electric cables and something called a provider to get him going; he is clearly a lot less accommodating than I was. Heartless, I would say.As for him, my lord and master, the one whom I helped to create deathless prose? I know he is not happy now, not nearly as happy as he was with me. I have heard him shout and swear in frustration. Far be it from me to gloat, but I know for a fact, that the upstart has managed to lose a whole chapter of the new book.I have to admit to a little frisson of Schadenfreude."},

I'm relieved;  I have felt pressured into buying unwanted presents, off-loaded by ungrateful recipients, too many times in the past to feel guilty at spurning them;  rather than buying somebody's unloved cast-offs, with the sole purpose of returning them to an identical stall at the next opportunity, I now just put a few coins in the box.A young girl in a pretty dress, which is rather too old for her, takes my entrance fee and, in return, eagerly sticks a label to my jacket to prove that I've paid. The label is destined to fall off almost instantly.The entrance fee entitles me to eat and drink as much as I want. No further monetary transactions are due.For the sake of formality, an adult stands next to her at the rickety table which holds a tin for the money and a small packet of sticky backed labels.  The child is bossy and self-important, giving me unnecessary directions to the back of the house;  few people have arrived as yet and she hasn't had time to grow bored.There are tables set out in the sheltered courtyard, the forecast has promised a dry afternoon. It is part of the fun to huddle close together under umbrellas in the rain, and, if the weather should turn too inclement, for everybody to grab chairs and tables, teacups and plates and rush them indoors. We hope for the best, but kitchen and barn doors are open.I arrive fairly early; not many tables have been taken and, for the moment, there are more helpers than there are guests.This being Valley's End, everybody knows everybody. Introductions may be ignored but conventions must be observed.'Would you like some tea?  Food is in the barn. Choose a table and I'll bring the tea out to you.'I make my way into the barn; sitting down instantly would make me look stiff and unfriendly. I need to greet everybody first, both in the barn and the kitchen and everybody sitting in the courtyard. Going into the barn first makes me look greedy.'Hi, lovely to see you. Thank you for coming. We have lots of food, far too much, really.'The lady in charge apologises for the great abundance, it's the organisers' fault and she may well be one of them. Waste is bad, we are an old-fashioned lot, we all complain about young people nowadays throwing far too much food away. 'It probably won't get eaten.'  She explains that 'The ramblers are out for a walk, they may get here too late and there's a bowling match on as well. Bad planning, as usual. There's always too much on at the same time, isn't there? I wish people would look at the village diary before they double-book.'  Yes, we have a village diary, printed on the back page of the 'Chronicle', available for a very modest sum once a month.The lady by the food table is slightly breathless and excited. She waves a hand over the table and points: Anyway, we have egg & cress, cheese & pickle, ham & tomato and salmon & cucumber; we have scones & jam, chocolate brownies and we have fruit cake and sponge. And this massive cake here, well, Linda made it. We told her it's much too big but you know about Americans. They only know one size: big!  Linda is present, she hears the remark, and seeing me, she laughs and says 'Well, it's a German recipe, it's a Guglhupf, you can't blame me.'Everything on the platters and cake stands looks inviting. I help myself to a small plate and pile some sandwich triangles on it. The tea lady finds me and tells me that she has put my tea on a table. While I stand chatting to the food lady another lady grabs hold of my arm and whispers urgently:'Pauline has just arrived, she's on her own; would you mind speaking to her and sit with her?'Of course, I wouldn't; Pauline is a good friend, recently widowed, but totally able to take care of herself. She has no need of me or anyone else, but that's how Valley's End functions: people look out for each other, whether you want them to or not. Soon Pauline and I are joined by several other people.Are you exhibiting any paintings this year?Well, of course, it always rains in the Orkneys; we've never yet had good weather.Actually, I'm really busy at the moment; I'm going to stay with my daughter in Birmingham for a few days, before I'm off on my cruise.I have several new paintings ready; the exhibition is previewing on Saturday; are you coming? there'll be wine and nibbles.Oh, I know, the Shetlands are no better. But still, I love the North; never mind the weather. You can't go to Scotland in the summer, the midges . . . Have you been away this year?Abstracts or landscapes?They eat you alive.Did I tell you I saw Jayne the other day? She's finally made up her mind about the new cottage.One after the other, people get up for more food and tea cups are refilled. People change tables.'I've just finished my fourth novel.'This is a one-to-one conversation. My partner is an old gentleman, an ex music and English teacher, who has published a number of text books on poetry and music, but has so far been unable to find a publisher for his novels. I have read the first one, it was rather stiff and learned and showed how thoroughly the writer had done his research. A lifeless read; I have not read the subsequent works. He has, however, written a delightful little collection of children's verse, which I enjoyed very much.'No, you can't even get an agent nowadays.'  He has published his first two novels himself and will no doubt do the same with the next two and any others he writes. I find it difficult to say anything constructive. He has written some very decent poems for adults too, which a composer has set to music.Moving on, I join a larger table, where a discussion on politics is in full flow. Country people are conservative by nature, their politics tend to lean towards the Right. A lot of the newer inhabitants are professionals from the big cities, as well as writers, artists, teachers, with more liberal tendencies. In spite of these differences, everyone here is united in their wish to see the downfall of the Murdoch clan and News Corp. It's safe territory. When the talk turns to Mr. Cameron, whose current posturing in the face of the financial crisis hitting the pockets of ordinary people makes me feel nauseous, the differences become more obvious.We have to live with each other, for the most part we are on friendly terms with each other and agree to disagree. Besides, we've only had tea, alcohol-fuelled pub rants have no place at the tea-table.In the meantime, the ramblers have arrived, hungry and in need of refreshment. There is also a group of people whom nobody knows, a group of cyclists, male and female, who saw the sign advertising afternoon tea and followed it to the back of the house. The organiser beams a welcome smile.It's getting cool and people are beginning to leave. The food lady comes over, bearing a large platter of left-over food, a few sandwich triangles, slices of fruit cake and brownies. Linda's big cake has all been eaten. Anybody who still has a corner to fill in their tummy, takes a piece; there is no embarrassment, that's what we do.The fundraiser has been a success. Amnesty International will be given a decent sum of money.Valley's End is rather good at fundraising, we do a lot of it."},

I'll be sad to see it go into hibernation, but as it will unfold its gorgeous, bronze-red leaves again in March, at the same time as it produces generous clusters of clear pink flowers, I will allow it a well-earned rest. Besides, its chocolatey bark is attractive too. It is a splendid tree for any garden where it can be given a sunny spot. It's fully hardy.The trees here in the Shropshire Hills have given up early this year. Apart from the walnut tree, which didn't start to leaf properly until mid June and is still green now, all trees in the garden have dropped most of their leaves already. The book of The Knowledge of Things Unknown of 1729 states that about this time in the year leaves begin to fall from the trees and that signs of winter increase.'when the leaves will not fall from the trees in October, or else when there are a great number of caterpillars on the trees, then followeth after a cold winter'.Benno and I have been back to our favourite woods this week; it's getting a bit too chilly now to sit here for long. In summer we watch dragonflies and damselflies darting over the same stretch of water, back and forth, picking smaller insects and bugs off the surface of the water and the plants growing in  the muddy pond. They've gone now, the nymphs are possibly already overwintering deep in the mud.We mainly came to see how the sloes are doing; soon it'll be time to pick the fruits to make wine and sloe gin. There is a blackthorn hedge along a field edge, which was absolutely laden with fruit last year. We usually wait with the picking until after a cold spell, but we'd best not leave it too long; some other creature might discover our secret hoard."},
{"title": "Farce Anyone?  Not for me, thanks.", "date": "Friday 21 October 2011", "text": "Farce:A light dramatic work in which highly improbable plot situations, exaggerated characters, and often slapstick elements are used for humorous effect.  (Answers.com) I think I'd better give up, and let yesterday's farce be the last one for me in this lifetime.  I just don't get it. While everyone else was practically rolling in the aisles, wetting themselves, I sat there, like the proverbial wet weekend in November, hard pushed to break into a tentative smile.We went to the Theatre yesterday.\"One Man, Two Guvnors\" has played to full houses and rave reviews at the National Theatre,  has toured the country equally successfully, and is about to open in London's West End.Vaudeville discovered alive and well and living uproariously in  Richard Bean's terrific 1960s revamp of Goldoni's much-loved commedia dell'arte farce \"A Servant Of Two Masters\", directed by Nicholas Hytner. (To paraphrase The Guardian.)Surely, I must be forgiven for giving such a highly praised production of a farce one more go. Surely, I'd get it this time?The play is full of physical comedy which has been painstakingly choreographed and timed. In the opening moments of the show James Corden, star of The History Boys and Gavin and Stacey, somersaults over an armchair and by the final curtain he has punched himself in the face with a dustbin lid and caught his own nose in a mousetrap.There is lots of interaction with the audience, ad-libbing and improvisation. Cordon is a genius at thinking on his feet, although he corpsed and dried up at one point and two fellow actors rushed on stage at the same time in an attempt to rescue him; only one of them was meant to be on, which only increased the general hilarity.While I can appreciate the professionalism of the production, the physical and mental agility and all-round talent of the performers, the intelligently designed and very simple set, the comedy itself leaves me cold. Sorry, slapstick is not for me, a fact of life I will have to accept.Postscript:We went on the Culture Coach from Valley's End, a four hour roundtrip.During the performance two chaps from the audience were dragged on stage to 'help' shift a trunk, one of the two was in clerical garb. It so happened that two of our number came across these two men during the interval and started a conversation with them. They learned that both men work for a catholic charity which helps to feed and house Colombian street children (honestly, no con, they had their credentials and could point to a tv programme about their work). They mentioned that the current financial climate means that donations are drying up and instead of feeding 600 children a week, their reduced means only allow them to care for 300 children. Our kind-hearted village ladies therefore decided to have a whip-round on the coach back to Valley's End. Everybody contributed.Photos from various sources"},
{"title": "In Praise of Getting Dirty", "date": "Wednesday 19 October 2011", "text": "How often are you dirty and sweaty enough to need that shower or bath?After having squeezed the last spongeful of gel out of the bottle for my morning shower, I opened the cupboard to get a replacement. Shampoos, conditioners, tablets of soap, bath foam, all present and correct, but no shower gel. For some reason it had got left off the shopping list.The gel I use is quite ordinary, soap-free, perfume-free stuff, not expensive, but our little local shop doesn't stock it. The nearest supermarket, which is a 9-mile drive away, does.So, on a free Saturday morning, a nice sunny morning I could have used for anything at all, I got the car out and drove the 18 mile roundtrip to buy a bottle of shower gel.It was only afterwards that I realised how very foolish I had been.Yesterday I had one of these conversations with a fellow dog-walker, a male in his early seventies, about the 'old days';  he told me about his life before the days of hot and cold running water; how the tin bath was taken off the nail on the wall once a week, put in front of the open fire and filled with hot water from the kettle. I've heard it said that the same water was used for bathing several children, one after the other. Being an only child I was spared the indignity of shared bath water. (He also told me about the privy at the back of the house, which his family shared with the people who lived upstairs.) In those days children got dirty, coming home muddy was a badge of honour. Mud meant fun.The conversation with my dog-walking companion ended with a phrase elders are extremely fond of:  \"....and it never did us any harm...\"Children don't get dirty nowadays, much less the ordinary adult.  Except on hot summer days I never normally get into a sweat, and the only time I get dirty is when I've spent a day in grimy London or another big city or worked in the garden.I love it when I can see from the state of my arms and legs that I've done some real, honest-to-goodness dirty work, when I've been digging, planting, or on my knees, my face close to the soil and muddy hands  pinning my hair behind my ears.Like today, in fact. Today I needed my shower. Lashings of hot water, a soapy sponge and a warm bathroom, what bliss.If I'm honest, I have to say I'm glad that the days of tin baths are over."},

Gardener is still on sick leave, and there's nobody else whom I would trust with my compost heaps.  He empties them, shovelful after shovelful, takes out all the bits which haven't finished composting;  all the nasty white roots, which are just waiting to pounce and turn into perennial weeds, end up in a special little pile. They are either donated to the Municipal Composter or burnt. The compost is put back into the neighbouring bin for further 'cooking' or, if ready for use, put into bags which can easily be transported from bed to bed.my compost binsLeaving the compost bins undisturbed this autumn, means that they will provide a cosy and warm refuge for mice and rats. I don't mind mice but rats scare me. It is said that you are never more than six feet from a rat in the UK. Some estimates also say that there are 50 to 60 million rats in the country, almost as many as there are people. They are nasty creatures, which carry diseases.In our previous garden the compost heap was much smaller; I wasn't nearly as passionate about the gorgeous, dry, friable, blackish-brown treasure trove then as I am now. We made a pretence of turning it in a very haphazard manner. We'd only just acquired a large garden, had joined the local gardening society and tried to do what the experts advised.On one occasion Beloved found a small cache of little pinky-white, naked creatures, with tiny limbs, about half way down in the heap. \"Oh, how sad,\" said he, \"look, I've disturbed a birds' nest. Shall I put the muck back?\" He has a very kind heart. Anything small and vulnerable immediately brings out his caring and protective side.I took a look. \"A birds' nest? Halfway down a compost heap? Not-bloody-likely.\"All of you who might now think less of me for swearing, let me reassure you: 'not-bloody-likely' is only a mild expletive and always used in this combination, or so I'm told by native English speakers.\"That's a rat's nest. Get rid of it,\" I screeched.Beloved chucked them on the grass, where they squirmed for a second or two, then lay still. I couldn't bear to stay around; we went away and let the birds clear them away. Not a trace remained.A long time ago, a rat took up residence in the pipes running through the cellar of the house where I lived in Germany. A ratcatcher was called to dispose of it, a man with a dog, a large Alsatian. I have no idea if poison was used as freely then as it is now; in those days, in the countryside, the ratcatcher was the proper authority to approach.I remember standing in the cellar silently, hiding behind my Papa whilst not wanting to miss a thing. I had been told to stand absolutely still. For a long time nothing happened. The dog sat quietly, ears pricked, on a very short leash, the man himself frozen, like a statue.After what seemed an eternity, but was probably no more than thirty minutes, the man whispered :\"he's here\". I strained to see what he had seen, shivering in anticipation. I saw nothing. And then, in the blink of an eye, a large black shadow darted along the upper pipe, and appeared to jump straight into the dog's open maw. Dog and rat moved as one, there was the sound of bone crunching, the dog swallowed and silence returned. The actual kill was over in seconds. Even now, so many years later, I can see the rat taking a flying leap and the trajectory somehow ending up in exactly the spot where the dog was waiting.\"He was a big one\", the man said, when my father paid him."},

I know how boring it can be when  bloggers tell each other about mundane trivialities of daily life, but bear with me, this is my excuse for having been absent for a few days and not visiting. All shall be remedied in due course.Beloved had his second skin cancer operation yesterday, which brings us to the end of this current spate of hospital visits. Everything seems to have gone well and we are looking forward to opening a bottle tonight, having something  extraordinarily extravagant for dinner and letting the stresses and strains of enforced contact with the medical profession for both of us dissolve while watching a fluffy, undemanding film.I felt pretty tense yesterday, not an advisable state to be in after my own recent health scare, but Beloved took it all in his stride. What it is to possess a calmly benevolent and imperturbable demeanour.  At times I envy him, but it can also also be utterly infuriating.Finalising the last bits of organising for the day (he had packed his own bag), I called to him,  \"We have about an hour.\" (The hospital is an hour's drive from us and what I meant was \"Get on with it.\") Whereupon he assumed his best bass voice and burst into the phrase the gaoler sings to  Cavaradossi before the latter's execution in TOSCA.Il resta un hora. Un sacerdote i vostre ceni attende . . . . . .I'm not at all sure that I've got the Italian right, having only ever heard the words sung, but \"You have an hour, a priest is here, should you wish to see him . . .\" is roughly what it means in English. Did I say he also has a sense of humour?If I tell you that I very nearly broke into somebody's car yesterday, you get an idea of my own state of mind. After I left Beloved in the Day Surgery Unit I went grocery shopping in the town. The new fridge/freezer - second attempt at getting the size right - only came on Tuesday; the job to fill the appliance awaited; spending a few hours shopping was as good a distraction as any and fulfilled a useful purpose into the bargain.After stowing the final load in the boot, I took the trolley back to its parking space and went for a coffee.When I came back to retrieve the car, I found the aisle without any trouble, I am quite good at remembering where I've parked. I blipped, heard the click of the doors opening and tried the handle. It didn't give. I blipped again, the click came and I pulled once more. Still no luck. I pulled harder, tried to rattle the handle, pulled, pushed, blipped again; nothing doing. I could hear the click each time I blipped but the blasted door just wouldn't budge.Frantic now - this sort of thing would have to happen on the day when my schedule was fairly tight anyway - I looked into the car for help. The bag on the passenger seat was gone! I checked the boot through the back window. No shopping!Something wasn't right, my car had sprouted fancy black seats instead of grubby pale tan ones. Finally, I understood: the blipper click had come from the car next in line, an identical red to the one I was attempting to break into, and therefore mine.Back at the hospital Beloved was still perfectly calm; he allowed himself a slight feeling of irritation at the time it all took, but he was glad when the nurse brought him tea and toast; it had been a long day without food or drink.  I got us home safely (I hate driving on these drizzly dark evenings) and my stiff-upper-lipped man finally cracked. \"Thank you for looking after me\", he said, \"I'm so glad it's all over.\""},

She wanted the paper early in the morning, he wanted to sit over a leisurely cup of coffee mid-morning, and have what the Brits call  'elevenses', while slowly perusing and neatly folding back page after page.She wanted to hear the thud of the paper on the doormat while she was coming out of the shower; she liked slipping into a robe and scanning the headlines while slurping her boiling hot coffee. It didn't take her long, but it helped her to face the day. He wanted to have his shower, shave and get dressed, clear last night's bottle and glasses away, let the dog out and feed the cat, have a quick cup of tea and a piece of toast while checking his messages. He would then stroll down to the shop in the village, to pick up the paper and the latest gossip. When she first moved in, the question of who read the paper when didn't arise. They'd stay in bed for as long as they decently could to savour each other's presence, then get up at the same time and, more often than not, shower together. I'm sure you all get the picture. But they had been together for some time before she even moved in and now, after two years of intimacy, love's first, sweet, careless rapture had worn a little threadbare. It wasn't just the paper, of course, other long established habits had crawled into their relationship; minor irritations had emerged and, as so often happens when goodwill is overtaken by impatience, cracks had appeared which threatened the fabric of their lives together.It was inevitable, they broke up. Everything they had bought together, they split fifty/fifty; when she finally left, his apartment seemed very empty all of a sudden. He was surprised by how sad he felt.I tell you though, not half as sad as me; when she left, she took with her the love of my life, Juliet to my Romeo, Hero to my Leander, Laura to my Petrarch, Isolde to my Tristan, Beatrice to my Dante  -  I could go on, but I think I'll stop here  -  my one and only Queen. We'd sit together on the table, she filled with sweetener, my belly holding the sugar, happy in the knowledge that we were a pair no man could put asunder. How wrong we were."},
{"title": "Writing Group", "date": "Friday 7 October 2011", "text": "New season, new school year, new writing group. Who said I give up easily?After the fiasco with the Creative Writing Class last spring, I thought I'd see who else might have it in for my style of writing, so why not give the newly founded Creative Writing Group of the local  u3a a try?  Most of you will know that U3A stands for University of the Third Age and is open, free of charge, to people of age 50 and over. Whatever you wish to study, whatever your previous level of expertise, there will be a course for you. And if there isn't one, somebody will start one.This CW group is run by members, there is no lecturer, nobody is in charge. Naturally, there will be one member who will dominate the group, talk the most, be the most decisive, the most easily offended and generally let the rest know that her/his word is law. That is as inevitable as one person in the group being the tallest, or the oldest.The inaugural meeting took place in a private bungalow in the bubble end of a cul-de-sac in the rabbit warren of identical streets above the old town. You might have been on any new housing estate on the edge of any erstwhile small market town in the UK. I do wish town planners weren't chosen on the basis of who can produce the nastiest, dullest, most unimaginative and repetitive rows of dwellings; no wonder the families inhabiting them are pretty interchangeable themselves, their highest ambition in life being to own wall-to-wall home entertainment units to watch reality tv.However, the owner of the bungalow where we met, a delightful elderly lady, softly spoken and slightly vague in manner, seemed to have no tv at all; instead the tiny sitting room held a piano, a sofa and easy chairs, a small table and bookshelves. There was barely room for the resident thinly elegant lurcher to weave through, much less for the eight people, plus hostess, assembled to discuss procedure. Everybody seemed very keen, ideas were produced as to frequency of meetings,  possible venues, subjects to tackle; it was decided, for the time being, that members should produce a piece of writing for each meeting, leaving us free to choose poetry, short stories, memoirs, non-fiction, and even chapters of novels; in short, the new group's success was assured. One person went so far as to suggest that we should publish a book containing the best of our writing at the end of the first year.Calling yourself 'a writer' and actually writing something have very little to do with each other. When the next meeting came round, I was the only person present, apart from the hostess, who had attended the inaugural get-together. Only one of the others had sent apologies for absence, all the rest of them had quietly faded away. Luckily, there were three new people who had been unable to come before, two of whom had the good sense to bring their manuscripts.We have now had the third meeting, in a private room in a pub in the old town; a much more suitable venue, where we all fit easily round a large table. One further member dropped away, but another two new participants appeared, with one apology, bringing the group to a possible grand total of between six and nine members. This process of natural elimination will eventually come to an end and I am hopeful that we will soon settle down to a manageable number of people who want to write. Hopeful, because everybody present happily read a poem, a bit of a memoir, a short story; we are getting to know each other and characters are beginning to emerge.We meet for two hours mid-morning. As this is England, a tea break is expected by all; two hours without the obligatory drink is unthinkable. In the pub this is no problem, we simply order before we sit down and a waitress brings a tray. When I mumbled apologetically, that I could manage without refreshment for two hours, my fellow writers pitied me. \" It's nice to have a drink, makes it more comfortable and we can have a little chat.\" I was afraid of that, but I'll be happy if the chat concerns itself with writing.The end of year best-of-writing collection was mentioned again; we'd better get down to it."},
{"title": "Musicians: The Professional Approach", "date": "Wednesday 5 October 2011", "text": "At RehearsalMud From A ScraperNo. 4 in an Occasional Series\"I say 'silver sound', because musicians sound for silver\"ShakespeareThe first rule that must be learnt by those who would understand the character of musicians is that few members of an orchestra are interested in music. Each plays his instrument because that is his trade - because that is the job for which he is physically and mentally suited, and that is the best way he knows of earning a living.His aim is, like the average man or woman, to earn the maximum income with the minimum effort, though this is not so straightforward as it sounds, and even the minimum effort is very strenuous. Owing to the fact that there are a few eccentrics in the profession, who exhibit excessive interest in their work, who are insensitive to the hostility they arouse, and who have relations in the management, an unnecessarily high standard of conduct has come to be expected. It requires a great deal of skill to find the mean between doing as little work as is compatible with an artistic conscience, and doing as much as a conductor demands.The location of this compromise is determined not only by the general pattern of behaviour of the particular orchestra, but by the position of the player in question: The further back in the section the musician is, the less he needs to keep up appearances. Those at the back may need to make a better showing than their immediate superiors in order to remain in the orchestra at all; those at the front, who are heard and watched by all, are expected to look efficient even to laymen, and must behave as though they enjoy playing the same old hackneyed works year after year.All other points of orchestral technique are based on this principle. It governs the posture the player adopts, the energy he expends in playing, the time he arrives at rehearsal and the colour of the socks he wears for concerts.It may be thought that the height of a musician's professional ambition would be membership of one of the top symphony orchestras. It is not so; even members of the top symphony orchestras yearn to be invited to play with the small, light combinations which broadcast so frequently under so many names. A contract job is considered stultifying, and though the financial security is useful, a free-lance player with the right connections can earn in a week as much as a symphony player receives in a month, though he may be unemployed for the two subsequent weeks.Above all, a player must have the attitude of mind which goes with this concept of the profession. The biggest crime one can commit used to be called 'arty-crafty' or 'British West Hampstead'.  This consist of understanding counterpoint, going to concerts, tracing the influence of Stravinsky in the works of Villa-Lobos, and working out unconventional fingerings. Such behaviour may make a good impression on an amateur orchestra or on the lunatic fringes of the profession. It is anathema to the experienced player."},

Those of you for whom snakes in the garden are commonplace will no doubt put me right. As I have never seen a snake here, this pretender will have to do. You can even see the tongue,  unfortunately unforked, testing for whatever snakes test their environment for.The October Bunting is out. Virginia creepers are a magnificent sight at this time of year. The one above grows on an ancient stone wall and the one below has sneaked its tendrils into the welcoming arms of a conifer.October is not only golden, it also decks itself out in the most glorious shades of red. Below is another example:Ripe elderberries have been picked, laboriously removed from every little bit of stem and stalk, left to ferment in a bucket for a few days, and are now sitting in their demijohns, fitted with fermentation locks and bungs, to complete fermentation, before they are bottled and stored for a year or two to mature. The homely sound of  bubbles escaping from the locks will accompany us throughout October.It is such a shame that I simply cannot get my personal wine drinking tastebuds adapted to fruit wines. Beloved drinks his fruit wine with pleasure, whereas I demand the fermented grape. I am more than happy to use his product for cooking, though; it adds the most deliciously fruity tang to many of my stews and casseroles and a meat sauce or hearty gravy is much improved by it.When I opened the back door this morning I walked straight into the gossamer threads of a spider's web.It's a slightly unpleasant feeling and I instinctively swiped at my face and flapped my hands in front of me. Luckily, the centre of the web was higher up, against the doorframe and I damaged very little.I quickly looked for the spider itself; it was hiding a long way from the web, with a fine signal line  leading from its secretive retreat in the angle between doorframe and wall. Araneus diadematus is one of the most common and best known orb weavers. It is easily identified by the distinctive white cross on its back (although in some specimens it is indistinct or missing). This spider is most commonly called the 'garden spider' in England, it is also known as the cross spider. They are common in woodlands, heathlands and gardens. I am not sure if this representative of its kind still has the requisite number of legs.The garden spider is mature from summer to autumn and at its largest in late autumn and often full of eggs.

Firstly, I fell ill quite suddenly and was admitted to hospital as an emergency patient. I was discharged again in the evening, but feeling rather weak and quite unable to take Beloved to the same hospital, which is about an hour's drive from home, the next day, Friday. He had an appointment to see a skin cancer specialist to assess a large and fairly deep squamous cell carcinoma on his back; not an appointment we wanted to postpone. He can no longer drive such distances because of his poor eyesight, so up stepped a Good Samaritan friend and said \"I'll take him, you stay at home and rest\".I spent most of the weekend resting and felt much more myself by Monday, when the large fridge-freezer in the kitchen decided it had had enough and wilted and died. Luckily I noticed early enough that something was wrong and was able to rescue most of the frozen food and stuff it into the scullery freezer. But I don't have another fridge; butter, eggs, milk, yogurts, cheese, and all the stuff you normally never think twice about was disintegrating. \"I'll take it and put it into my fridge for the moment\", said a Good Samaritan, again saving the day.Beloved and I went out and panic-bought a fridge-freezer replacement in an ordinary white goods shop, not one of the massive multiples, but one in the next little town. They delivered the next morning. Once it was sitting in its space and the delivery man had gone, I realised that its domed door made it quite awkward to get at and stick out into the room. I rang the shop and threw myself on their mercy. \"Of course, we'll fetch it back. We'll lend you a small reconditioned fridge out of the shop and perhaps measure the space more carefully and together we'll find a fridge-freezer to suit.\"They were to collect the replacement apparatus, a huge thing, and leave me with a small fridge on Wednesday morning. As this was also the day for Beloved's second, long-awaited, cataract operation at the day surgery clinic, we were rather pushed for time. Benno was also a problem, his arthritic joints make him slow and a liability on a long day out. I felt I had quite enough on my hands already. Good Samaritans all round stepped forward: \"Yes, of course we can come early; what time will you have to leave home at the latest?\" said the delivery man from the white goods shop. And \"yes, I'll take Benno for the day, and I'll see to it that the fridge is switched on in time for it to be cold enough for you to come home to fresh milk for your tea\", said a good friend.And today my cleaning girl stepped up and gave the house an extra going-over so I could look after Beloved,  instead of having to get through a week's worth of household chores.The cataract operation went well, we have a date for the skin cancer operation in three week's time and the white goods shop is exploring the possibilities of supplying me with a replacement fridge-freezer as close to the one I had before as they can."},

{"title": "A Sad Story About A Greedy Child And A Snake", "date": "Monday 19 September 2011", "text": "The Snake Charmer - Henri RousseauTess Kincaid's Magpie No. 83There once was a child whose mother gave her a bowl of milk and bread every afternoon. Each afternoon the mother warned the child not to go too far from the house and to beware of strangers with sweet voices, whose siren song might lure her astray.The child took the bowl into the deepest part of the garden, where she sat down in the shade of an old oak tree and spooned her bread and milk, before she fell asleep, leaning against the broad tree trunk. Sometimes, she didn't finish her treat and left a little milk in the bowl, but when she woke up, the milk had gone.This happened so often that the child became curious. She decided to find out who was drinking her milk. On one particular afternoon she came out as usual with her bowl, but this time she left a much bigger drink, put the bowl down and pretended to fall asleep. Keeping very still, she peeked from under  the very end of her lashes and by and by she saw a beautiful white snake slithering towards the bowl, lifting its sleekly elegant head and dipping a delicate tongue into the milk. \"Ha, caught you, you thief\", cried the child, and grabbed the snake's head. \"Steal my milk, would you? I'll teach you to rob me, my mother warned me against creatures such as you.\" The child was about to smash the snake's head with a stone when it spoke.\"If you grant me life, you shall have all the treasures of the earth you desire\", the snake sang, \"every day I shall return and bring you silver trinkets and golden chains, pearls and bright stones and all the toys my kind can fashion in the halls under the roots of the oak\".The child didn't trust the snake. After all, didn't snakes have a reputation for being false?\"Swear that you will keep your word and I shall let you live\", the child said. The snake did.Every afternoon from then on the child and the snake met at the bottom of the oak tree and exchanged gifts, milk for the snake and ever more precious and wondrous treasures from the halls beneath the roots of the oak for the child. Soon the child had amassed a large hoard, which she kept secret from her mother. Hadn't her mother always warned her against taking gifts from strangers?And once again the child became curious. If the snake could bring her a gift each time and promised to continue to do so for as long as the child would come to meet it by the oak tree, how much more was there hidden under the roots?The next time they met she said to the snake:  \"This is getting very boring, one little gift every time. Bring me more gifts,  many at a time, or I shall stop being kind to you; I'll probably not even bother to come out and you can go and get your milk elsewhere.\"Now the snake had known all along that the child would become greedy. Snakes know these things instinctively. It had a plan all worked out.\"If you want more gifts, why don't you come with me into the halls underneath the roots\",  the snake sang,  \"then you can see for yourself what there is and you may choose whatever you want to take.\"The child hardly hesitated at all. It had got used to the snake, the snake had kept its promise, they had spent many a pleasant afternoon playing and eating bread and milk in the shade of the ancient oak tree. Blinded by the promise of untold riches the child followed the snake where it led.THE END."},

She has a point. For those of you who might have been wondering whether Friko Has Left The Building without even a by-your-leave, I can report on something which appears to be becoming an annual event: a short stay in hospital.  Run any kind of virus or mild indisposition by me and I'll gladly pick it up; what's more, I'll instantly convert it into a bout of atrial fibrillation. Cue: visit to my GP max. 24 hours later, who then calls for an ambulance; and that's me out of the picture, attached to machines that bleep annoyingly, bored, self-loathing, bitter, and most of all, extremely cross.This time I didn't even have a handbag (purse to you lot over there) on me - the GP surgery is just three minutes' drive away -  no phone, no money, not even a bar of chocolate to my name, to sweeten the hours in hospital. Tests and examinations took up some time, of course, but for long periods I was just lying there, doing what I do best, earwigging. (Are you glad you don't live anywhere near me?)This was a Medical Assessment Unit with four-bed-bays, short of stuffing bananas up my ears, it was impossible not to overhear the conversations around me. Besides, they were the only entertainment on offer.Part IMother and Teenage Daughter, with nurse taking notes:How's your appetite?Mother (the patient): fine, I eat well.Daughter (the visitor): Ha, you eat chocolate for breakfast, chocolate for lunch and chocolate for dinner. I'm always trying to get you to eat properly.Mother: I don't just eat chocolate, I eat other things in between.Nurse: Do you smoke?Mother: yes.Nurse: Would you like to stop? I could get you into the programme here. How many cigarettes a day?Mother, quietly: Twenty.Daughter, exploding theatrically: Twenty! in your dreams, Mum!Moral: Do not let your teenage daughter accompany you into hospital!Part IIMother and Teenage Daughter:Daughter (the patient), either asleep, or busy with her Blackberry, mostly silent.Mother (the visitor) to the room at large: She's not well at all, she's had lots of tests already and tomorrow she'll have to have a lumbar puncture. They have no idea what's wrong. But I'm not leaving, I'm going to stay all night. If they try to shift me I'll kick up a fuss. They may act like they're adult but they're still only children. They need their mum to be there, when they wake up.  There should be wards for patients her age, not just for children and adults, and parents should have a place to stay too.Moral: Do not let your overly protective mother accompany you into hospital!Part IIIElderly Daughter and ninety-one year old Mother, tea lady, doctor.Mother, very sweet, very deaf, quietly dozing.: It's not six o'clock already?Daughter: No, that's not a clock, that's a monitor.Mother: If it's six o'clock you'll want to go home and have a rest.Daughter: After sitting all day?Mother: Why are you here? Have you been here long? You'll want a rest, won't you?There go those chimes again, is it six o'clock already?Daughter: No, that's not a clock, that's a monitor.Tea lady: Hello, would you like a drink?  What would you like, tea, coffee,  hot chocolate?Mother: What's that?

It might have had something to do with the promise of a lavish celebration of his life after the service and his interment. In fact, the only flaw in the ointment had been his white suit, made of paper rather than fine silk. Never mind, the day would come when he would be able to take her to task about this omission, he determined to leave her in no doubt that she had badly betrayed his wishes in this respect.Some members of the congregation too had been less than fulsome in their praise of him.  While he had been their shepherd he had spent hours telling them the righteous way, the only way, the way he himself laid out for them. They had not always shown him  gratitude for his selfless actions then, but he certainly would have expected them to see the error of their ways after his death. Again, he made a mental note to remind them of their gross dereliction of duty towards him, as and when they joined him in heaven. \"That is, of course\", he said to himself,  \"if they are given the great mercy to join me here.\"He would enjoy keeping a tally of the people who had accorded him less than the full appreciation and veneration, to which he knew he was entitled.In fact, he'd have a word with St. Peter about it.

{"title": "Crimes And Misdemeanours", "date": "Saturday 10 September 2011", "text": "Dianne's post at schmidleyscribblins showed me a world of experiences, trials and tribulations with criminal elements, vandals and hooligans, even rapists and murderers, which is a million miles removed from the world here at Valley's End, described by the poet A.E. Housman  as \"the quietest under the sun\".The last murder in the valley, or the last murder which was recognised as such, happened a long time ago. It was  a crime of passion, of course; the ditch digger found that his wife was getting more than sausages from the butcher's boy, when the latter visited their cottage on his rounds; he promptly killed them both, his wife and the butcher's boy and the derelict cottage was still called 'murder cottage' when we moved here.  It's since been turned into a very desirable residence, although the new owners were  surprised when they found out by what name the locals know their preposterous manor.There's been a case of arson too; a forester found himself unloved and unwanted by his employers and decided that: \"if I can't have the forest, nobody can,\" and set fire to it. Another crime of passion.Passion is what the locals go in for in a big way. Everybody is related to everybody else, one way or another, whether their conception was blessed by a vicar or minister or not. On whichever side of the blanket the act took place doesn't seem to matter, or who was married to whom at the time. The funny thing is that the participants in the game of musical chairs/beds/sofas/hedgerows all stay living in a very small geographical area, and, as far as an outsider like me can tell, remain on relatively good terms with members of former liaisons. They simply swap houses and/or partners.The drinkers outside the pub are totally law-abiding. Cigarette smoking is no longer allowed in enclosed spaces, which means that they have to do their drinking and smoking outside. Even the landlord joins them.We get our kicks from watching the traffic. I stopped to chat to Linda, our resident Californian, as she was standing on a kitchen chair outside her front door, watering her hanging baskets. The school bus decanted its pupils at the same time as a small bus, two cars and a truck wanted to negotiate the village square, which is very narrow, not a square at all but more a bendy oblong shape. It took them about five minutes to disentangle themselves. It was very exciting to watch.Linda also told me about a crime committed by a horse upon Linda's lurcher, Ghostie. Ghostie suffered grievous bodily harm when Daisy, George's horse, stepped back on to Ghostie's foot,  seriously mangling it in the process. Ghostie is getting over the injury and the leather slipper the vet put on her foot looks very fetching.And then there is the old stone saddle-backed bridge, which was built in the 14th century and is a frequent crime scene. It is constructed of five small arches with angled pedestrian recesses on either side, and no more than 2.5 m wide at its narrowest point. Large lorries are the vandals here, forever ramming  the stone walls and criminally damaging them.Watching hapless foreign lorry driverstrying to ease their vehicles on to and off the bridge round a sharp turning  towards a tiny hamlet called Newcastle, because their satnavs have sent them here instead of to the North of England, brings the locals together in a happy band; a round of applause follows the driver who manages to negotiate the bridge without dislodging stones; woe betide the unfortunate driver whose vehicle makes sufficient contact with the stonework to damage it; rarely will his number plate remain unrecorded.I don't doubt that, human nature being what it is, there are other crimes being committed even here at Valley's End; occasionally there is a spate of thefts from garden sheds, when such high end articles as gardening tools are stolen by organised gangs from the housing estates of nearby Midland towns. The police find it hard to catch the robbers; although we have a policeman or woman who come out to us and hold advice surgeries on specific days of the month in the community room, miscreants insist on doing their foul deeds outside police visiting hours.Traffic offences are not considered offences at all; it is understood that we drive how we like and park where we like and if it is necessary that you have a chat with the driver of an oncoming vehicle, both of you simply stop your cars, wind down your windows and talk. Occasionally, one of you might leave his vehicle to get nearer to the driver of the other car. We don't like to shout at each other,  it's considered rather bad manners round here."},
{"title": "Boiled Eggs", "date": "Wednesday 7 September 2011", "text": "Loriot   Nov 12, 1923-Aug 22, 2011At some dinner parties the most wonderful conversations, clever and witty, erudite and eloquent arise spontaneously, out of nowhere. A host with a lavish hand and an ever ready bottle opener, good food and a company of people who share a positive attitude towards the pleasures in life are essentials; without these as givens no party will ever really take off.Some of these conversations are so brilliant that I forget everything but a rough outline of the subjects discussed almost by the time we get home; I'd love to be clever and able to turn these conversations into equally brilliant blog posts, but short of taking a dictaphone and hiding it on the table during the meal I can think of no way to make that possible. Music, literature, the arts, the theatre, how do you keep track of bon-mots and amusing remarks, intelligent arguments and witticisms on these topics? By their very nature they ebb and flow without leaving a permanent imprint except to tell you about the speakers' preferences.Unless the talk turns to eggs. I can remember eggs. Eggs is easy.My favourite host invited us to meet a friend of his, one of his former students, whose first novel is to be published in the spring. She is busy writing her second novel about a barrister in chambers; she herself trained as a lawyer, the subject is therefore an obvious choice. She has given this barrister an egg to eat in one episode, and mention of this led us to a discussion of what you can judge about the character of a person from the way he or she eats a boiled egg.Quite apart from the Swiftian war between the Lilliputians and Blefuscu, a lengthy conflict between the big-enders and the little-enders, who could not agree on which end to crack to eat a boiled egg, there must be other rules and regulations people hold dear.Mr. Woodhouse, father of the eponymous heroine in Jane Austen's 'Emma', believed that 'an egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome'.Personally, I prefer a softish yolk inside a firm white, but there are many ways to boil an egg. I once watched a fellow guest in a hotel in Cornwall send back his egg three mornings running, because it was not cooked to his exacting specification; he had stipulated the number of minutes and the chef was unable to bring the egg to the required consistency, no matter how closely he watched the boiling point. In the end, another guest came up with the most logical solution: the Cornish egg was simply too fresh compared to the egg the complainant usually used.Once we have established how to boil an egg, how do we then open it?  Which end, big or little? Do we stick our knife into it and swivel it round the whole of the big or little end? Do we upend the egg and hit it on the plate? Do we hit the top of the egg with the knife? Or maybe the egg spoon instead of the knife? Do we peel the opened end or eat the top out of the separated end?Again, speaking for myself only, I use the most merciless method of getting at my egg: I lay it sideways on my plate and behead it with one hard whack, then eat the little end first.But stop, I forgot a very important point: Do we add salt to the opened egg before we eat it? Kipling says 'Being kissed by a man who didn't wax his moustache was like eating an egg without salt', although I think he probably stole the phrase from an old Spanish proverb which says that 'a kiss without a moustache is like eating an egg without salt.'I won't bring up the soldiers and egg question, I am assuming we are all adults on this blog. Or the hard-boiled egg salad, an abomination in my opinion. There may, of course, be those who do not like boiled eggs; you will, no doubt, tell me so. But a Sunday morning without a boiled egg to accompany a thickly buttered slice of hot toast, or, even better, a thickly buttered slice of sweet raisin and cinnamon bread, is not worth getting up for."},

He regretted having come in his new car instead of using his shabby and worn old truck.The track from the main road to what he still called the farm was deeply rutted, heavy machinery and trucks had deepened the old hollows and potholes considerably. Everything was happening so fast, he was running just to keep abreast of developments. The track would have to wait.Still, he was here now; as he took the few steps to the big glass doors he greeted several construction workers busy clearing piles of rubble from the front of the building. The sun reflecting from the plate glass windows stung his eyes; he made a mental note to get himself some of these large sunglasses he saw on the noses of many of his workers.He entered his office. Here too everything was new, his big desk unused and clear, the leather chair plump and smooth. His secretary came in through the connecting door from her own, smaller office, holding a sheaf of papers in her hands. \"Good morning, Mr. Lassiter,\" she said. Something else to get used to, all his life he had been 'Mark', the only Mister he knew was the bank manager. Even he called him \"Mr. Lassiter, sir\", now.His own hands, calloused and sun-damaged, took the papers from her. \"Must do something about these hands too\", he thought. As he sat down, the chair deflated,  a rich sigh emanating from under his backside.\"The board meeting is at 10 sharp\", his secretary advised him, \"perhaps you'd care to read through my notes first?\"Damn the woman, he'd never taken orders from any female in all his years on the farm, and he wasn't going to start now.  He glowered at her.He bent his head over the papers; for six months he had been telling her to use bigger writing, these tiny, faint letters were no use to him; he could barely make them out. That fool of a secretary kept the writing small deliberately, he was sure of it. He persevered, reading and trying to understand the intricacies of a newly established business, a business he apparently owned, although all these people, whose salary he paid, were telling him what to do.Abruptly he pushed his chair back, got up, and left the building. Long strides took him across abandoned fields where he had not long ago  struggled to grow potatoes and corn. Breathing deeply, he came to a halt by the remains of  an old barn waiting to be pulled down. He leant on the shell of a rusty truck, half sunk into the earth, giving the worn tyre an affectionate kick.He knew there was no going back to the old days, but since the day  they'd come and told him that there was oil under his poor fields  he'd been doing his very best to get used to being filthy rich."},
{"title": "HEATH CHAPEL  -  MY WORLD", "date": "Saturday 3 September 2011", "text": "Heath Chapel is arguably the most famous church in Shropshire. Virtually unaltered for 900 years it is perched all alone in a field on the side of Brown Clee Hill.  This impressively simple Norman church, which has no bell-cote, is still open regularly for services, although there are now very few inhabitants living in the parish. Narrow and winding country lanes make access difficult, no signposts lead to it; it is almost hidden away; we took many wrong turnings and went uphill and down dale for seemingly hours before we finally found a man walking a pair of sheep dogs who was able to direct us.Heath Chapel once served the parish of Heath;  remains of this abandoned medieval village are clearly visible in the field to the East of the building. The intact survival of this perfect example of a small Norman church since the early twelfth century is quite miraculous. It may look as if I held my camera slightly at an angle, not so; I assure you that's exactly how the church leans into the soil.The key to the door hangs from a nail on the back of the notice board at the entrance to the field. Apart from an advertisement for 'Age Concern', a charitable organisation which helps elderly people with advice, the notice board was bare. Perhaps that tells us who takes the time to visit this hidden gem, which is definitely worth an afternoon's meander.Apart from the chevron mouldings on the Norman arch over the door the church is totally undecorated. The ironwork on the door also dates from the twelfth century.The Chapel contains a twelfth century font, tub-shaped, its foot decorated with baskets of dried flowers. There are some decorative incised arches  just visible on the rim. Other possible carvings on the body of the font have long disappeared, as have wall paintings and writings.    There are some very faint traces of writing.

{"title": "Any Thoughts on the Matter?", "date": "Tuesday 30 August 2011", "text": "The other day I had a long email from a blogger friend, with whom I have been in contact behind the blogging scenes for several years. She is very worried about her husband who was diagnosed with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) some time ago. There is a possibility that he is suffering from early onset Alzheimer's; it would take further tests to establish the presence of the disease.My friend is a very capable woman, well able to take care of herself and her husband, whatever happens. But she now has to decide between two alternatives: to find out what is wrong and start some form of treatment, the outcome of which is doubtful, or to leave it at the previous diagnosis and hope for the best. Whatever she decides, her husband will accept; he himself is no longer able to make an informed choice.Mary (not her real name) is deeply troubled, as anybody would be in her situation. To know or not to know, that is the question to which she will have to find the answer. She hasn't asked for my advice and I won't be offering it.People rarely ask for advice in such important matters unless they know that the advice they will be given coincides with what they secretly already know is their preferred course of action. We really wish to be given the reassuring green light to go ahead or moral support for our own decision not to face up to things.I have an excellent example of this in my closest family.  My mother was very ill for about a year before her death. All the signs were that she had cancer. She never asked her doctor for a full diagnosis and preferred to ignore his hints. She could have spoken to me at any time, in fact, I frequently encouraged her to do so.My mother never did. When she was hospitalised the doctors told her that any meaningful treatment depended on full knowledge of her condition. During one of my brief absences she telephoned my cousin for advice. My mother absolutely knew what my advice would be and she also knew that my cousin's advice would be the total opposite to that. She knew that I would want to know as much as possible about the situation in order to be able to make an informed decision; as far as I am concerned, it is only the full possession of facts which allow me to face, and deal with, an enemy, which is what cancer is. My cousin, however, is the exact opposite; her way of dealing with things is not to know anything. \"was ich nicht weiss, macht mich nicht heiss\"  (I can't get worked up about something I know nothing about).Mum preferred the second option, which had been her solution all along. My cousin, in effect, gave her permission to stick to it. In the end, it didn't much matter, she had left it too long for effective treatment.Mary's situation is somewhat different, in that there is so far no permanent treatment for Alzheimer's, and certainly no cure; all she could hope for is a slowing down of symptoms, at best.  But somewhere, perhaps only at the back of her mind, she knows what she will do.Would you know?\"Forewarned is forearmed\" or  \"Where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise\"?"},

This shot is taken through the glass of the door and therefore less clear than it might have been.The red geranium leaf in the right-hand corner gives you an idea of the tiny size of the fledgling.Siskins (Carduelis spinus), belong to the finch family; they depend heavily upon the seeds of pines and spruce for food in early summer. Last year we had hardly any in the garden, hard winters take a heavy toll on them; their numbers seem to have recovered a little this summer. This fledgling must have been from a second clutch; the first clutch of pale blue eggs is usually laid in April/May. They hatch within two weeks and stay in the nest for another two.Siskins are delightful little birds, like flashes of the brightest goldleaf thrown up into the air. The male circles the treetops on slow, deliberate wing-beats, with plumage fluffed up and tail fanned. Both partners take part in a fast-moving display flight, in which the male rises to a considerable height with tail spread and wings quivering rapidly, and the female follows close behind.Eduardo De Filippo is not a playwright I know much about. He is not performed very often in this country. My programme notes say that : \"prior to his funeral in 1984, no fewer than 60.000 people filed past his coffin as it lay in state in Rome and the ceremony was screened live on Italian television.\"He was obviously much loved and respected in Italy. \"The bastard son of two actors ended his days as a senator of the Italian Republic, adored by audiences and revered by his fellow professionals.\"\"The Syndicate\" is a play is about \"Tough Love Mafia Style\", with tremendous roles for the three main male characters. I was never quite sure if I was watching a morality play, a comedy with very dark undertones, or a straightforward thriller about  the Mafia underworld.August has been a miserable month weather wise in  my corner of the world. Far too dry for the garden, with an almost permanent cloud cover which never kept what it promised, neither rain nor a break to let the sun through. This has been the third non-summer in a row for us. The Sun may have entered the House of Virgo but it must have missed Friko's Castle at Valley's End.\"The man born under Virgo shall be a good householder, ingenious and solicitous to his work, shamefast and of a great courage, but he will soon be angry. Scarcely shall he be a while with his first wife. He shall be in peril by water, he shall have a wound with iron, and shall live seventy years after nature.\"\"The woman shall be shamefast, ingenious and painstaking. She ought to be wed at twelve years, but she shall not be long with her first husband. Her life shall be sometime in peril; she shall have dolour at ten years, and if she scape shall live seventy years.

{"title": "Dog Training", "date": "Tuesday 23 August 2011", "text": "As sure as eggs is eggs, you can rely on a labrador's greed. I know of no other creature which will do as much for food as a labrador. A banker might come a close second in the greed stakes, but he's not usually after food. By nature a lab is very accommodating, but promise him food and he'll do anything. A ramp? What's that for?You want me to go up a ramp?Benno is getting very old, his arthritic hind legs and back frequently trouble him and, jumping up into the  car he sometimes misses his step and his back legs and belly hit the lip of the boot. It takes a mad and probably painful scramble to get upright. He is too large and heavy for us to lift him in.Let's try putting a few bits of his favourite nibbles on the ramp.Hey, that's cheating!So is this!Next we put the nibbles right at the top of the ramp and stood either side of it, blocking the way up from the sides and forcing him to start walking on the ramp.After many attempts, it finally worked. Benno got the message that if he wanted food, he'd have to climb up the ramp for it.It was hard work for all three of us. Benno was huffing and puffing and we needed a break and a cuddle and lots of reassurance that he was our best boy, our lovely boy, our very good boy, our very clever boy. He took it all in his stride; a labrador can lap up any amount of cuddling and petting. All the same, he was keeping a close eye on the box of treats in his master's hand.There was another lesson yet to come: how to get down again. He would have been able to jump but he jars his joints jumping and negotiating the ramp would be less painful. As he had learned to get up, he'd learn to come down.This looks interesting!There! Made it!It looks easy, but, believe me, it wasn't. This was the third attempt. Twice before we gave up and we were ready to get rid of the ramp altogether. But needs must. If he wants to come with us, he has to get into the boot. Unless we have a dog sitter, I hate leaving him behind for more than two hours. The next attempt will be for real, I'll tell you how we get on. With all these treats, he might grow too fat for the ramp!"},

There's only me now and I have no further interest in them. There won't be room for them in the retirement home\".She rummages around in the shoebox on the table in front of her and picks a photo at random.  Peering at the faded print with her short-sighted eyes, she says to her carer:  \"Pass me my glasses, there's a dear. I might as well have a quick look through, although nothing much will come of it. It's all so long ago\".The picture is clearer now, she recognises faces. \"Why, that's me and Ted and  ........She stops. A sudden flush of shame, hot and unpleasant, rises up in her. She feels her stomach turning over and a wave of nausea hits her.Who'd have thought that after all these years she'd suddenly feel guilty.She stares at the picture. A window into the past opens up and, for the first time in sixty years, she allows herself to come face to face with the way she was.She and Ted and . . . . yes, Shirley, that was her name . . . .Best friends they were, the three of them; together as children and together as teenagers, all adventures, all secrets shared; others called them \"The Three Musketeers\"; there was no separating them.How young they were, how innocent, a world of boundless possibilities awaiting them, the road ahead straight and even. When they were small they had sworn to be friends eternally; whatever happened, they would remain true to each other.And then Ted and Shirley fell in love.Suddenly, they were not three but two plus one; still friends, still close, still spending time together; like here, in the photo. She continued to stare at it, her hand shaking a little. She remembered clearly now, they were all off to the lake for a day's swimming and picnicking;  happy and carefree, Ted and Shirley sitting in the back seat, probably holding hands, while she sat next to the driver, her dad, alone, in the front.The shock of the realisation that her world was collapsing, that she was no longer part of an inseparable unit, hit her hard. She could see it in the eyes looking out at her from the photo; could also see the beginnings of the scheming girl she was about to become. Suddenly, she hated Shirley. She did not, and never could, hate Ted, for she too loved him.She put the photo down.It hadn't been hard to separate Ted and Shirley; she flirted and promised, she flattered and beguiled, until Ted had lost his head one summer's evening and kissed her.No, it hadn't been hard at all.Her eyes clouded over. Her marriage to Ted had been happy and contented for the most part, neither better nor worse than most marriages. She had no regrets.\"Get rid of the box\", she said to the carer, as she slid the photograph back in between the others."},
{"title": "Gardener's Big Adventure", "date": "Saturday 20 August 2011", "text": "Gardener last summer\"Summat wrong here, I thought.\"Gardener came by for a cup of tea yesterday.  A loud knock on the back door, a shout of 'hello\" and \"where's the gardener, canna see her working\" ( meaning me), and he's in the kitchen. Bright and cheerful. When I asked if the doctors had given him permission to drive again, he said \"Didn't ask them\". Of course, what was I thinking. Gardener doesn't ask questions to which he might not like the answer.\"So there I was\" he said, \"sawing logs on the saw bench; I had the tractor with me and the saw box on the back and sometimes I had to use the chainsaw as well; lifting the trunks on the bench and piling the logs in the box. It was a big job and I thought I'd better get it done.\"\"I'd been having this pain in me chest for a couple of weeks but I thought I'd just pulled a muscle or summat. Then I got this pain, and it was bad, so I rested a bit and it eased off, so I started again. Every time the pain came, I stopped and then went at it again. And then I broke into a sweat and was sick\".\"Hallo\", I thought\", he continued, \"this is not good. Summat wrong here. I knew Mr. Beresford was up the field and wouldn't be back for a twenty minute or so, so I lay on the ground. The pain was summat awful\".\"When the amblance come, the chap kept asking how bad the pain was. Nought to Ten, he said. Well,  I didn't know.  Anyway, after he give me the morphine, I didn't have no pain no more\".\"In the air amblance they only put me flat on the stretcher and I couldn't see a thing except the roof\". Gardener seems genuinely aggrieved that he wasn't given a window seat.\"No windows in the roof, see. So I asked  if they could take me home again by amblance; I've never been up in the air before. It would of bin nice to see everything on the ground\".Throughout his tale he interrupts himself now and then to cackle heartily and take a big gulp of tea. Beloved has given him his usual mug which holds close on twice as much as an ordinary mug.\"When we landed there were all these people round the 'elicopter. This woman bends over me and says she's Sister Margaret and how she's in charge of me. Next thing I know they got me on an hoperating table, slapping summat icy cold on my arm and I'm gone. I don't know nothing\".Clearly, he is still totally surprised by how quickly and efficiently they dealt with him. His foxy grin shows how pleased he is to be telling the tale.He goes on: \"And then I'm in the ward, no pain nor nothing, and the nurse comes and asks if I want a cup of tea. Sure, I tell her, and you can tell them amblance drivers they can fly me home again. She says, no, not yet, we'll have to keep you here for a few days\".\"And they've got all these machines on me, and I've got tubes in me arm and me hand and they've got me pinned down. And they keep coming for blood all the time too. So I asks them, what they're gonna do with it all, if they're gonna sell it\".It looks like this part of the tale is coming to an end. He was indeed taken home three days later, by road. But now he goes into medical details.\"So now I've got this stent in me hartery, and they blow it up and it opens the hartery so I get enough hoxigin to me heart. They said that I had a blood clot blocking the hartery and that's where all the pain come from. That Dr. Lambert should have known summat was wrong when I went to see her\".He is right,  his GP did miss the danger signals three weeks earlier; she should have known that Gardener, who never sees a doctor unless he is practically on his death bed, wasn't visiting her from boredom.Anyway, he is feeling well, if a little scared. \"How many lives have I had now\", he asks wistfully. He's fallen out of trees, has had several operations on his back and limbs and isn't always careful when it comes to operating machinery or lifting heavy weights. A little of the cockiness has been knocked out of him this time, I think. Knowing him, it'll probably come back before long.We finished the visit by taking a stroll round the garden. \"I see you've had the 'edge done\", he says. \"Tidy job\", he says. That's praise, coming from him. He's never very complimentary about other people's work. I think he is secretly very glad that he won't have to do it himself. \"They got me doin' these hexercises\", he says. \"I must hexurt myself.\" This is obviously a new word in his vocabulary, he makes several false starts before he trusts himself with it. \"Waste of time, if you ask me. They got me on a bike and a treadmill and when I get going properly, they tell me not so fast, take it easy. Better to start doing little bits of work, maybe an hour or two\". He means it.But he knows as well as I do, that he needs to heal first, to build up his strength and that he must be sensible and take care. He cracked one of his cheeky jokes. \"When I get back, we'll have to swap. You do what I did and I'll do what you did\".I can't wait to have him back, but I'll be keeping a very close eye on him. I am, however, under absolutely no illusion that he'll listen to me."},

A sturdy man brought his sturdy wife and between them they cut and tidied and cleared away overgrown hedges all around the garden. A job well done and off my mind. I too worked outside, until I collapsed, exhausted, into an easy chair to watch the third repeat of a favourite TV show; not exactly stimulating, but soothing and reassuring. \"There, there\", the detective said to me, \"you know the outcome, all will be well tomorrow\".What is this indefinable sense of yearning and loss, that overcomes so many of us; what is it that we long for? This 'it' that  has the power to sadden our hearts and allows us to be aware of only shadows even on  the brightest day: what is 'it'?In retrospect, I wouldn't even call the place that had me confined the pit of depression. On the surface, I functioned perfectly well; hard to believe though it might be,  but on two occasions a different 'me' took over and became the life and soul of two intensely animated dinner parties. The real 'me' stood aside and watched me perform, all the while questioning the purpose of it all.It just so happens that I've read a few blogposts on 'reasons to be grateful' recently. Although I wouldn't go quite as far - the day I am inspired to count my blessings will be a very sad one  for me - perhaps I must remember to open my eyes to the wonders of this world rather than focus on the darkness. Melancholia always has and always will be a part of who I am; from the replies to my previous post it seems that there are many who share this trait.This bloggers' universe we inhabit is a strange and wonderful one. Who'd have thought that a simple apology for absence, due to a temporary disturbance of mind, would bring forth such an outpouring of sympathy.

In fact, some gardens reach their full, spectacular potential not until the second half of summer, when the range of magnificent herbaceous perennials seems endless, from asters and dozens of daisy-like flowers to the stately spikes of salvias; not to mention the summer flowering clematis, like the one above.Sadly, we won't be opening the garden this autumn; I need gardener's help with the hard graft. As it is, I'm having to pay a 'gardener and designer' a small fortune to cut the hedges. While I'm on the subject, I'd like to mention that 'my' gardener is doing fine; he is chirpy and bright and full of hope that he'll eventually be able to do a few days again, although I doubt that he'll work again like he did before his heart attack. It has frightened him into stopping smoking!If you are planning to spend a few hours looking at someone's garden or if you think it might be a nice thing to do next year, let me give you a few handy DOs and DON'Ts, which would certainly make you into my favourite visitor:leave scissors, dampened tissue and plastic bags at home, unless permission to take cuttings has been given.\rkeep dogs and children on leads.\rdo not march through, looking barely to left and right; the owners are proud of their garden and have expressly invited you in; you do not need to feel embarrassed about being there.\rthat doesn't mean, however, that they want you in their house: do not ask to visit the loo, unless you are absolutely desperate; it's best to avoid accidents of an embarrassing nature; never visit if you are unwell, particularly with tummy gripes.\rtalk to the gardener about particular plants or aspects.\rbut do not give unwanted advice.\rdo not criticise; gardens are like children: whatever parents may say about their children, they are proud of them.\rdo not commiserate with the owner about weeds until you are certain they are not prized wild flowers.\rdo not commiserate with the owner about the demise of a plant until you are certain that s/he has noticed.\rform small groups and and discuss pleasing or interesting features. \rsay 'interesting' frequently,\rbut keep your superior knowledge well hidden. \rif the owner has temporarily mislaid the name, age or serial number of a plant and cannot find it in the garden books on display, don't hang around waiting for inspiration to strike; use the books yourself, or take a photo and quietly remove yourself.\rdo not point and laugh at a feature or plant unless you are absolutely certain that it's meant to be amusing; if you are absolutely certain that it is, point, draw others' attention to it and laugh.\radmire particular features, like fountains, specimen trees, statuary old and new.\rnever say : you have enough work here to keep you busy/out of mischief/fit;  it's patronising.\rpraise the garden, and, if you can't, at least say 'thank you'.\renjoy yourself and take home plenty of inspiration."},

The event itself usually makes a loss, which doesn't seem to deter the organisers.We always have a brass band imported from the nearest Welsh town,  The Knighton Town Silver Band, who play tirelessly all afternoon. They are very good too.The big show tent is the main attraction.

{"title": "Three Meals", "date": "Sunday 7 August 2011", "text": "The Dinner TableHenri Matisse - 1896/7 This has been an extraordinarily well-fed few days; there has been expensive restaurant food, free food, and home-cooked food, always in good company.Although we both enjoy good food, we are by no means greedy eaters, but during the second half of the week the focus on food has been marked. Only the restaurant meal was planned; eight of us went to The Checkers at Montgomery over the border in Powys, once a humble coaching inn and pub, now a restaurant serving classic French food.A mini-bus taxi had been booked for us; when you get a group of civilised and dignified adults together, all of them looking forward to a pleasant evening,  and take them on a charabanc outing, no matter how serious they normally are, several layers of restraint melt in the warm feelings of friendship and anticipation. Being driven by a professional, everybody enjoyed their drink; my table neighbour who speaks only English and a few words of Spanish, suddenly became fluent in French, which caused the young man training to become a silver service waiter to giggle helplessly. In spite of a generous supply of wine nobody drank too much, but everybody talked too much. Whenever we get together we talk about music, books, history, and travel; although we know each other's tastes and preferences, we still find plenty to add.There must still be money around, even in these straitened times. The restaurant was full and therefore very noisy. I'd have hated to be at a table for two.The free meal, i.e. dinner at friends's house was different, and a lot quieter, but equally enjoyable. I was introduced to a South American dish,moqueca de peixe; for those of you who are asignorant in such matters as I am, it's a fish stewwith vegetables, and very tasty indeed.Our friends had very carefully excluded all dairyproduce from the menu, which allowed me to eat heartilyand without worrying about after effects.We were six at table, professionally a similar mix as before, but with totally different topics of conversation. We talked about Africa and the need for education as well as assistance. We talked about the destruction of the environment which is making such catastrophes as the one happening in the Horn of Africa at the moment ever  more likely. One of our number is a journalist with a particular interest in Latin America; she had stories to tell about the continuing destruction of the rain forest which made the outlook for our planet appear most unhealthy.There is something almost perverse about the white, professional middle class sitting at table, eating and drinking splendidly, discussing the ills of the world and high-handedly solving the problems of poorer nations, so many of which we have caused in the past, and are still causing today. Think about it!Today we were at home, joined by friends for a somewhat simpler, but still good, Sunday luncheon. We had melon and parma ham, guinea fowl and chocolate and pear upside-down tart, dishes out of my standard repertoire and therefore presenting no difficulties. We could sit back and gossip with our guests.The conversation was as relaxed as the meal.It has been a rather hectic week altogether and I'm looking forward to having beans on toast in front of the TV, with my feet up on a cushion."},

{"title": "Acton Burnell  -  My World - The Beauty of Shropshire", "date": "Monday 1 August 2011", "text": "Acton Burnell is a small and picturesque village some eight miles south east of Shrewsbury. The name seems to have come from Achetune, meaning Oaktown.Robert Burnell was Bishop of Bath and Wells between 1275 and 1292, but he was also politically influential as Chancellor to Edward I. For more than thirty years he was friend, confidant and advisor to the king.  Robert Burnell obtained a licence to build himself a partly-fortified manor house, which was begun in 1283 (he was granted the licence to crenellate in 1284);  its ruins, incorrectly called a castle, still stand in near proximity to the church.In spite of its thick walls and a tower at each end of the rectangular structure, it was a fortified domestic residence rather than a military fortress or castle.The church of St. Mary has been described as one of the most complete 13th century churches in Britain. The monuments include one with alabaster effigies to Sir Richard Lee (1591) and Sir Humphrey Lee (1632) forebears of Robert E. Lee of American Civil War fame.The large house (Acton Burnell Hall) near the church and the castle was the home of the Smythe family for many decades. At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the Sisters of the Order of Sion established their Convent there and formed a girls school which continued until about 1970, when the nuns vacated the Hall.The Hall is now Concord College, a private institute of further education catering mainly for overseas students. Occasionally, visiting chamber music groups perform here, when the Hall is opened to the public to attend concerts.In the parkland belonging to the school, and close to, but only just visible from the church and the castle since a hedge was planted between school grounds and public grounds, are the end walls of a central hall of a very early structure. It must have been a very large hall - the space between the two gables is about 157 feet x 40 feet - and  local people to this day call the two gable ends the 'parliamentary barn'. When Edward I was staying at Acton Burnell in the autumn of 1283, he summoned one of the first   Parliaments to be attended by the Commons as well as the Lords. It passed a law for the protection of creditors, which the king ratified here at the castle, and which is therefore known as the Statute of Acton Burnell.  There is, however,  no direct evidence that the traditional 'parliamentary barn' is the site where  deliberations took place.From a postcard \"Parliamentary Barn' in Acton Burnell - Discover ShropshireIn the 18th century the ruins of Acton Burnell Castle became an ornamental feature in the grounds of Acton Burnell Hall. Today, the historic site is in the care of English heritage. This is my contribution to That's My World for this week."},
{"title": "Thank You, America", "date": "Sunday 31 July 2011", "text": "It grieves me to see so many of my American blogging friends unhappy with the politicians in their own country. I see a good, proud, kind nation tearing itself to pieces and would like to remind you of the big heart and generous spirit you showed towards others less fortunate than you.Let me introduce you to a little girl, called Eva,  growing up in the years immediately after  WW2 in Germany, in a small village on the left bank of the Lower Rhine. Previous adventures can be found under the label 'Eva's Tale' in the side bar. Each story stands on its own. Sometimes Eva writes the story herself, at other times she asks me to do it.This is one of those that I tell for her; she would like me to say thank you to the people of America, who, irrespective of political affiliation, clubbed together like one nation of like-minded people, with one gigantic heart, willing to help her and millions like her to survive the chaos of her time.Dear American reader, you may not know what a CARE Paket is, or recognise the letters GARIOA , neither did Eva at the time, but those letters and what they stood for, meant that she, although often hungry, did not starve to death.Eva went to the village school; she was fortunate in that her school was undamaged, it had a roof and walls and tables and chairs. Like every child, she picked up any kind of firewood she could find on her way to school.  Very occasionally, she had a piece of coal, or a whole briquette to take; without heating, they were in danger of freezing during lessons in winter.Eva knew about hunger too. Everybody was entitled to ration cards, children included, but you can’t eat paper. There was very little food, with or without a ration card. If you had a garden, you might have had some potatoes or cabbage for part of the year; if you had anything left to barter, you might traipse round farms and maybe come away with a couple of eggs, a pound of potatoes, some apples.An American Aid Programme made it possible that children had hot milk soup at school, semolina soup, barley soup, or oat soup. Eva’s favourites were chocolate soup and semolina soup with raisins. Each child had to bring a metal canteen with a lid and a handle, to receive a ladle full of liquid.  Sometimes they had a thick slice of bread, with cream cheese.Food aid for families came in the form of CARE packages. In November 45, twenty two charitable organizations in the US founded the private Aid Organisation CARE (Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe). To begin with, most parcels were sent to relatives of American citizens in Germany; once help was standardized, other families also received food.The parcels contained tinned meat, fat, sugar, chocolate, jam, dried egg, powdered milk and coffee.Distribution was strictly controlled, and Eva’s family never had a full parcel to themselves but it was possible to receive some of the items on ration cards.For years Eva believed that her favourite food in all the world was horse meat. The reason was that one of the tins her mother opened contained a luscious, dark brown meat, in a thick, savoury jelly. Once the contents had been emptied on to a plate, Eva put as much of her little hand inside the tin as she could, wiping it clean. Licking the traces of jelly off her hand was bliss.These tins came with the picture of a horse stuck to the outside and the name on the label was ‘Mustang’Pre-Printed Thank You Cards which recipientsof CARE packages sent to the United States."},

Probably not. Men! The massage proper is starting. Fifteen minutes of sheer bliss. I snuggle deeper into the soft couch. Experienced hands perform a dance of repetitive movements across my face, under my chin, around the eye sockets, circling and stroking and patting and drumming.I drift off.Ah, lovely, more please, more..I wonder if that boy is going to be any good while Gardener is away. He looked a bit like he was borderline Down's. Funny that he should bring his Mum along. Why do they marry their cousins round here? Down's is nothing to do with in-breeding, or is it? Must get started on the Larsson trilogy soon, Damn blogging, I don't read enough since I've started. Lots of my favourite bloggers seem to be away at the moment. Wonder how Suze is getting on with her sister. And Debs, haven't heard from her for ages. At least my favourite Edwardians are still around.Would that Amnesty tea party make a post?Perhaps a bit too fragmented? And personal?Sally hasn't confirmed Andrew's birthday do yet; if she leaves it much longer there'll be something else in the diary. Hope she can arrange for a car and driver for all of us; a party without drink ?

A soothing mask for cheeks and neck, containing aloe vera. This is the part where I usually doze off for 5 minutes. Witchhazel pads on my eyes mean that I couldn't open them even if I wanted. I don't. If I allowed myself to feel embarrassed, now would be the time. I don't.The beautician tells me what she does with each new process, otherwise there is silence; there is the faintest hint of Classics For The Retarded in the background, played on an instrument which sounds like a harp for a web-fingered dwarf; I have no difficulty shutting the sound out altogether.  Perhaps I'm snoring.Five minutes later and the idyll is over. The mask comes off, the beautician rubs at my face, hard. No more 'Miss Nice Guy'. A cleansing cream takes the last bits of plaster off, the big light comes back on,  and the pore police appears on the scene. Any remaining criminal blockage is attacked mercilessly by means of a metal squeezing tool, probably invented during the Spanish Inquisition;  the beautician's face is now so close to mine that I feel claustrophobia coming on.Ouch! That hurt!She slaps witchhazel all over my face, it feels very cold on my warm skin and I wake up fully. She pads me dry and her fingertips follow with a very thin layer of moisturiser to finish the job. The towel comes off. She hands me a mirror and picks up her diary.Lovely. All done.

{"title": "Brief Encounter", "date": "Wednesday 27 July 2011", "text": "On my walks round Valley's End I often meet several people who might be classified as 'simple'. Two of them never speak to me and barely look at me sideways, although one of them always has a careful glance at Benno before dancing a little detour to make sure they don't pass too closely. The other one takes long steps, hands deep in the pockets of his dark, long overcoat, summer and winter, head down; I doubt that he notices anybody, at least, he gives no sign that he does.The other two chatter. If you let them, they'll chatter for as long as they can detain you. Both of them have a strange power over me. I feel bad about leaving them standing in the middle of the road, still talking inconsequentially, while I walk backwards, stumbling away from them, muttering, repeating what they've said, agreeing with whatever I think they've been saying.The four are all middle-aged, only one is a woman.I met her on the footbridge over the river yesterday afternoon. She had me pinned down, while I edged past her;  I was almost across when she changed her mind about letting me go without interrogating me. It is always an interrogation, never a friendly, but non-committal, \"nice day today\" which is the usual currency exchanged with a chance-met fellow walker. Abruptly, with something of an accusation in her tone, she asked:\"Do you live in Valley's End?\"\"Yes, I do\".She smiled a sour smile, not believing me. Not only do I meet her out walking, we have also shared a cup of tea and a biscuit at many charity mornings.\"I don't know you\".I have learned that it's best not to mention previous meetings. They will involve a lot of explanations which I am too impatient to give. I smile, hoping I don't look as shifty and ill-at-ease as I feel.\"Yes, we've been here xx years now. I think I've seen you before. I live in Mrs. Pettigrew's house\".Round here, your house is never your house, it is always the house of the previous owner. It only becomes your house when you leave it.\"No\", long drawn-out, shaking her head. \"No, I don't know you.\"She isn't mellowing. There's a small pause, during which I turn slightly to attempt my escape.\"Have you found a cleaner then?\" this was unexpected. So she knew me after all?\"Yes, thank you, I did\".\"Because you were looking for a cleaner, weren't you?\" How could she possibly know?\"Jolly good, well done, who is she?\"\"A girl from the town\".\"Because I do cleaning as well, you know\".\"Do you, that's kind of you.\" I'm babbling. But I have reached the end of the footbridge,  the open road is two steps away. Up to now I have been shuffling sideways, crab fashion, I am about to turn my back to her and, with luck, say goodbye over my shoulder.\"Yes, I do\", she said, \"I can come and clean for you\".Benno's nose has led him off the bridge and on to the verge up the road on the other side a little way. Excellent dog. I pretend I'm looking for him.\"Excuse me, I must  . . . . . . .\"Nice to meet you\", she calls after me."},

{"title": "Seven Rocks For Seven Maidens", "date": "Friday 22 July 2011", "text": "Jinksy challenged me to write a romantic tale to accompany her computer artwork for her new promptIn Tandem.How could I refuse.Long, long ago, on the banks of the mighty River Rhine, there stood a castle. Well, actually, the banks were positively littered with a multitude of castles  on both sides, all populated by pretty maidens, heroic knights, dragons, robber barons and greedy archbishops, but for now we are concerned with just one of them, Schloss Schönburg.The Castle of Schönburg, now in ruins, was once a place of extraordinary fame, for here dwelt seven sisters of transcendent beauty; the fact that their proud sire, the Graf of Schönburg. was also reputed to be very rich, did them no harm in the marriage stakes. Their father had acquired his enormous wealth  in predatory forays, his exploits on crusades were legendary; and when he wasn't busy cataloguing and registering his ill-gotten gains, he was off robbing and pillaging nearer home. Because he was so good at it, nobody except his victims minded. The nobles of the Rhineland at the time found this all totally in order, in the Graf's shoes, they'd have done much the same.An endless number of knights flitted about the castle, all hoping to catch the eye of one of the beauteous maidens;  the girls, having been spoilt rotten by their doting daddy, made fun of them; egging them on, flirting mercilessly, then dropping them again, one after the other. They simply weren't ready for the constraints of marriage. Suitor after suitor retired in despair; \"what do women want?\" they asked  bitterly.Little by little the girls achieved an unsavoury reputation. Lack of female virtue was a heinous crime and once the tittle-tattle got started it simply couldn't be silenced, no matter how much the Graf threatened and bullied and paid.He called his girls to order. \"It's time you got married\", he said, eyeing them fondly. \"Each of you had better choose the one you like best. Make sure he is of decent breeding stock, that's all I ask. Once you are married, the rumours will stop. There'll still be parties and hunt balls and I'll make sure that you'll never lack a pretty rock or two from my jewel chest\".The girls knew that they'd have to comply with their daddy's wishes but first they'd play one more trick on their suitors.The Graf arranged for a huge party to be held in his Schloss high above the river. Crowds of suitors appeared,  gorgeously dressed  in the finest raiments, in silks and gold brocades, crimson cloth and rich, soft velvet; nearly all of them had fathers and uncles who had followed King Frederick to the Holy Land on crusade and had come home laden with treasure.Assembled in the staterooms,  the suitors waited for the maidens to appear, to choose seven husbands from among them. They waited and waited. No maidens appeared. Then one of them, who had been looking out of the window, gave a great shout.\"There they are, in the river, sailing away\", he cried. Everybody rushed to the windows.The girls looked up at them, waving and shouting, laughing and dancing with pleasure at having outwitted the dim knights yet again.I would love to end this story on a happy note, but alas, a sense of humour was not the most desirable quality for a girl to have in those far off days.  That and their addiction to coquetry and practical jests were to be their undoing.As the knights were watching, their dismay at having been the butt of the girls' jokes quickly turned to consternation. Unheedful of the current the girls' light craft was led into the fast flowing stream; had they sat still, all would have been well. As it was, the craft was overturned, none of the girls could swim and before another boat could be launched the Rhine had claimed its victims, and the perfidious damsels were drowned in the swift tide.Near the place where the tragedy occurred, seven rocks appeared, visible to this day on the rare occasions when the river is low."},

Remember the time he almost burnt the garden down?  Or when he cut back the beauty bush and other shrubs BEFORE flowering?  There was the time when he put great piles of the most pernicious weed in my garden, the blessed lesser celandine, in the compost heap and we had to discard a whole spring's worth of compost, tipping many barrow loads of  it on to the banks of the moat just outside the gate. Admittedly, since then we have had golden carpets of celandine right outside the garden every spring. He has learned quite a lot about gardens and gardening since his days as a cowman, but he'll always need somebody to keep a close eye on him.Gardener has had a heart attack and I miss him dreadfully. Not only because I have to work three times as hard myself now but I also miss the stories he told during our tea breaks and while we were working side by side. Being a real, died in the wool, countryman of the old school, very conservative,  full of mischief,  I often get cross with him. On occasion, his right-wing opinions make me bite my tongue, something I would never do with anyone else.The way he mangles the language is priceless. I love gardener-isms, but I'd never laugh at him. He must have some form of verbal dyslexia.Only a week before he had his heart attack, he went to visit his terminally ill brother in a hostel, (hospice) he said. \"They can't  keep on giving him blood all the time. It's getting too expensive. He has something wrong with his corsuples. What can you expect, he abused himself all his life, being an alocolic.\"\"And as for that worbal gloaming, I don't believe in it. It's nonsense. My chimmuck nearly caught on fire last winter, I had the fire going perament\".I've never found out what a \"compensating nuisance\" is or a \"disaffectened MMR virus\", but I have an idea what he means when he tells me he has been given a bottle of \"sloane gin\" and I definitely know what hides behind \"I let my wife do the dirty\". She is the one who deals with unpleasant telephone messages for him, both ringing clients he doesn't want to work for and fielding their irate phone calls to his house.But gardener and I get on extremely well; we have worked out a relationship which suits us both. I am going to keep his job open for him. I spoke to him today and he told me that he'll give up various clients, but that he'll definitely come and do my 'bit of garden'. If a particular job is too much for him, he'll get me to do it, he giggled. He has a giggle for even the hardest, bleakest tale from his life.I am glad he reckons that I'm worth cultivating. \"We'll just have to have more tea breaks\", he said when I spoke to him today. \"Besides, you pay me cash\"."},
{"title": "The Masked Ball", "date": "Monday 18 July 2011", "text": "WILLOW'S MAGPIE No. 74The keeper of the mask museum had turned off the lights, locked the door and left. Every night, the masks, helplessly pinned to the walls during daylight hours, came alive. They stretched and yawned, smiled and laughed, cried and shouted in relief; the immobility imposed on them by their makers lifted, until the first rays of daylight crept in through the dusty windows in the morning.The keeper arrived late, late enough to allow the masks to shrink back into their rigid grimaces. During the day they slept on their hooks.There were masks from all over the world and from all the ages. There were ritual masks, ceremonial masks, tribal masks, theatrical masks, horror masks, pretty-face masks, witches masks, goblins and gremlins, fearful masks and wise men masks; any kind of mask you can think of, they were all there.Nobody much came to visit the museum, which was a real shame. The old keeper simply had no idea how to attract visitors; he just opened the doors in the morning, shuffled in, and with a feather duster tickled the masks until the dust made him sneeze and sniff; then he sat on his stool in the corner and unwrapped his sandwiches. On rainy days a few people came in for shelter, took a look round and said: “hm, interesting”. But they left again as soon as the rain stopped.One night a jolly carnival mask had had enough of this state of affairs. “We must do something”, she said. “Yes, we must”, the others agreed. “But what?” said a fearsome African mask. “We only come alive after dark, how can we attract visitors at night?”They all thought long and hard. There was no laughing or shrieking that night, all stayed where they were and pondered.“I have an idea”, said a wise man mask. “Nearly all of us have magical powers and although we promised never to use them without humans, perhaps we could make humans use us”.“I don’t know, isn’t it rather dangerous?” asked a timid young-pretty-face mask. “Nonsense”, said an old witch mask, “nothing ventured nothing gained. We all know that our keeper will die of a broken heart soon if we do nothing”.There and then they cast their spells. Lightning flashed inside the room, the rumble of drums shook the walls, a fearful screeching and howling arose, tigers and snakes, monkeys and a whole herd of buffalo raced about the small space between the shelves. The keeper’s stool was knocked over in the mêlée.But the masks knew what they were doing and eventually order returned, the stool righted itself and just before daybreak they assumed their usual places on the walls.The very next week a rich man in the town decided to give a masked ball, using real masks, not those silly little hand-held eye masks, which only pretend to hide your face. He called upon the keeper and requested the loan of all the masks in the museum. He promised to pay handsomely for the privilege.The keeper sighed. “Has it come to this”, he asked himself. “Should my lifetime’s collection be used for sport in a rich man’s house?”Still, the money would be most welcome; he needed a new feather duster and his stool had become strangely rickety lately. So he agreed.The masks were duly packed up and taken away. The little keeper felt quite tearful when he saw his precious collection leave the museum; several times he had to remind himself of the handsome sum he had been promised in return, which made him feel a bit better.When the masks were unpacked at the rich man’s house and each guest chose the one he or she wanted for the evening, something strange happened. They all chose the mask which represented the exact opposite to their real life character and position. The rich man himself chose a beggar mask, the pretty young women chose tired old witches faces, the tired old women chose pretty-face masks, handsome young men became ogres and old men became handsome performance artists. The scientist chose the shaman’s face, the gossip became kind-faced, the apothecary became the wise woman and the old roué suddenly looked innocent. Pretty young women lost their bloom and ugly old women turned into their youthful selves.The masks were hard at work all evening. As the heat rose and the champagne flowed they clung to their faces with all their might; without their hooks they were in danger of slipping off; little by little they melted into their bearers, becoming part of them.The guests, their senses heightened by dancing and laughter, alcohol and a strange euphoria they could not explain and therefore did not question, gradually became aware that a power quite outside their control had taken hold of them. A power which, though not unpleasant, was beginning to seep into their personalities. They felt they were becoming more and more like their masks.Twelve o’clock struck, it was time for the masquerade to end.The unthinkable happened. The masks refused. After years of hanging on a dusty wall in a museum they felt like making a night of it. Although very tired now, they had had so much fun, they were unwilling to give up. They had also become attached to their bearers, separation would mean a painful wrench. They knew that daylight would render them immobile again, see them packed up and sent back to the museum.So they refused to be separated from their faces. In the morning the keeper came and pleaded with them. They had grown rigid in their determination to stay just one day more. They would come off in the evening, after dark, they promised.I don’t know if the masks kept their promise. The little museum has been shut for a long time. Perhaps the keeper has locked his masks away, never to let them out again. On the other hand, perhaps they have become so deeply united with their faces, that they are still out there in the world, causing mayhem and murder, fear and loathing or joy and happiness.Who knows.© USW"},
{"title": "Opportunists", "date": "Saturday 16 July 2011", "text": "Crane's Bill - Herb RobertGeranium Robertianumhas made its home in the crack of a sheer rock face high above the river Teme on Whitcliff Common.In the Middle Ages there was a widespread belief in the 'doctrine of signatures'. This meant that any plant with curative properties would reveal the divine purpose for which it was intended through its shape or colour. In the case of herb-robert, the hairy stems and leaves turn a fiery red in autumn, or when the plant is growing in dry, exposed situations. It followed, according to the logic of medieval times, that herb-robert should be used in the treatment of blood disorders. The 'robert' of the plant's name is believed to be a corruption of the Latin 'ruber', meaning red; but it may also have been derived from the name of Robert, an early Duke of Normandy, for whom a celebrated medieval treatise was written.There's nothing extraordinary about Nasturtiums, Tropaeolum majus,except that once you have it in the garden, or anywhere else, it's yours for life, self-seeding profusely, clothing walls and fences or covering whole banks.

{"title": "Truth and Untruth", "date": "Thursday 14 July 2011", "text": "Diogenes Searching for an Honest ManPainting Attributed to J.H.W. Tischbein (circa 1780) The legend goes that Diogenes of Sinopi (404 or 412 BCE-323BCE) had a habit of strolling about in broad daylight, carrying a lamp. When asked what he was doing he said \"I'm searching for an honest man\".The other night, at a village function,  I told a totally unnecessary lie.  I gained nothing by it, I lost nothing by it. The subject under discussion was a village lady's request for charitable donations of second-hand clothes and shoes, among other items, which are to be transported to an Eastern European country. Without thinking I made a remark boasting of many pairs of barely worn shoes and work suits lurking in my wardrobe which I would have to sort through some day very soon. In my defence I must say that I actually believed them when I uttered the words, but the truth is that I have already given most of the items away to previous collections.  I lied. Although this lie is not going to lose me much sleep, it made me think of truth and deceit and how easy it is to blur the lines between.\"My train was late\"\"The cheque is in the post\", although this lie is less often used since electronic banking has taken over.\"He always tried his best\"\"Every word in my CV is true\"\"Your pensions/National Health Service/jobs are safe with us\"\"Greedy bankers?/Phone Hacking?/War for the sake of Oil?  Never!\"We have the means to cope with nuclear disasters\".\"It's not you, it's me. I still love you, but I need some space\"\"I'd never cheat on you\"At work, at home, in love, in politics, we tell lies and we are lied to. Up to 200 times a day, according to recent statistics. Is ordinary human interaction possible without convenient silences, half truths, the polite little social lie?Is there anyone who can say they never lie?Pretty much all the honest truth telling in the world is done by children.  ~Oliver WendellTruth is such a rare thing, it is delightful to tell it.  ~Emily DickinsonSociety can exist only on the basis that there is some amount of polished lying and that no one says exactly what he thinks.  ~Lin YutangThere are many quotes about truth and deceit, most praise the value of truthfulness, some admit that lies can be expedient and some are downright cynical about our inability and inclination to tell the truth. When a high-ranking Civil Servant coined the phrase 'being economical with the truth' his verbal dexterity and, no doubt, his ability to blend fact and fiction, called forth amusement and applause. Some media organs almost make a point of slanting the news, particularly around election time or when reporting on human frailty. The fantasy shouts at you in the headlines, the subsequent apology or clarification is hidden on page five.Should we be more courageous and tell the truth, no matter what? Sometimes the truth is painful, do we actually want to hear the unvarnished truth? How about being honest to the taxman? Would we buy many goods if advertisers were obliged to describe them truthfully? How about the second-hand car salesman,  and his description of the car he is trying to sell you? When applying for jobs, do we really want to tell our prospective employer that we are no better than the next candidate and that we have embroidered our curriculum vitae?On many occasions I listen to somebody's sales pitch with the inbuilt assumption that I am not being told the whole, unadulterated, truth.During my first ten years in the UK I was appalled by the apparent ease with which people indulge in social lying. \"We must meet soon\", You are looking well today\", They are a delightful couple\", \"The children are doing marvellously well\". All bare-faced lies. or are they? \"It's called 'oiling the wheels' of social intercourse, it's not really lying\", Beloved tells me. Fine, I accept this now. Personally, I can't be bothered to use these phrases.Whenever I catch myself telling a lie - call it fibbing, a white lie, flattery, time-saving, expediency, whatever you wish - I feel bad, guilty, a little ashamed. Whenever I realise that I have just been told a lie, I am greatly annoyed. When people in authority, politicians, the media, lie to me, in common with a large percentage of the population, I feel disinclined to believe them even when they tell the truth. In the age of the internet, we know so much sooner when politicians, the media, scientists as in the case of the Japanese disaster, lie to us; when forced to admit mistakes they may use salami-tactics - i.e. reluctantly feed us the truth slice by slice - , but eventually they have to come clean. Of course, there are times when nothing but the truth will do.Are there times when the choice between truth and untruth is not quite as clear cut and black and white? Or, as so often in our fallible lives, are there times when a shade of grey somewhere in-between will do?Where do you stand? Quick answers on a postcard, please."},
{"title": "Langley Chapel  -  My World", "date": "Monday 11 July 2011", "text": "Langley Chapel,  near Shrewsbury in Shropshire, sits tranquilly all alone in charming countryside. The interior of the chapel is a unique survival of the way Anglican Churches were arranged in the early 17th century, with box pews, a desk for musicians at the back and bench seats around the communion table for use during the sacraments.The Burnells of nearby Acton Burnell were lords of the manor of Langley, and in 1313 Richard Burnell obtained permission to build a chapel here.The structure of the present building dates from this time. In 1377, the manor of Langley passed to the Lee family, who fitted out the chapel in about 1546. In 1591 Sir Humphrey Lee, one of the forbears of  General Robert E. Lee,  moved to Langley. He was probably responsible for re-roofing the chapel in 1601. The last regular service was held here in 1871.Langley Chapel has a simple rectangular plan. It is built of dressed grey sandstone with a stone-tile roof, and has a small weatherboarded bell tower at the west end.It is the perfect set of early 17th century church fittings that makes Langley significant.The focus of worship in medieval churches was a raised stone altar set against the east wall. The central celebration was the ‘sacrifice’ of the Mass at the altar by a robed priest speaking in Latin. After the Reformation, however, the emphasis changed to preaching and reading the scriptures in English. Pulpits loomed large, sometimes literally, though at Langley the pulpit was relatively small and movable.The reading desk on the north side, however, is large, with seats inside and, unusually, a roof. With the replacement in the Church of England of the Catholic mass by the Protestant communion service, a simple communion table replaced the stone altar. (The original communion table at Langley was stolen; the present one is a copy.) Seats were arranged round the table, appropriate for people sharing a meal, as at the Last Supper. The manner of receiving the bread and wine at communion was a matter of theological dispute. At Langley, the furnishings allowed communicants to choose. Puritans could sit, while those who wished to could kneel. The fittings of the chapel were designed to cater for social as well as theological gradations. The largest of the ornate box pews, intended for the Lee family, were placed at the front. Behind these were smaller box pews for farmers and tradespeople, while servants and labourers sat on benches at the back. At the west end is a raised desk for musicians.Glazed and decorated medieval tiles have been reused on the chancel floor.There are two Tudor doorways with flat arches and nail-studded doors. If you wish to visit the interior of the chapel, the key is in the door.The building gradually fell out of church use and was finally abandoned during the nineteenth century.It began to fall into ruin and in 1914 it was one of the first historic buildings in the country to be rescued by being taken into the care of the state.Hello to the people over at That's My WorldPeople of Chilmark.

{"title": "My Garden World  - My World", "date": "Wednesday 6 July 2011", "text": "Come in, come in, welcome to my garden.I hope you don't mind using the back door,most people come in this way.You can just make out the name of the house.Now that the paying visitors have gone,I can take you round and show you some of  my current favourites.Dahlia 'Bishop Of Llandaff'I started out with one tuber of this old favourite,which I won in a raffle at a garden club.Now I have at least a dozen plants in the garden, and I have given away at least another dozen over the years.At this time of year I like plenty of hot colour.Apart from terracotta pots I use half barrels,cut top to bottom or across their bellies.Terracotta pots often crack in winter,  wooden beer or whiskey barrels last a lot longer.This barrel contains mostly pelargoniums and lobelias.I have cut  a few small beds into the mossy lawn in the back garden.Here are two examples,one is a mixed border of small shrubs and herbaceous plantsrunning along the kitchen door terrace.The colours here are mainly blue, fiery pink and purple.A few silver edges tone the whole thing down.Many gardeners have colour preferences, my least favourite colour is pale pink. Too washed out for my taste.This is a small shrub border,with a few tall grasses and some specimen herbaceous plantsto give the whole thing structure.Can you see the 'American Pokeweed' in the back?The dining room window looks out on to this border.Two current seasonal favourites of mine are very common and few fancy gardeners would give them pride of place. They are sun-loving Red Campion and Yellow Loosestrife, which doesn't mind a bit of shade.Of course, they also have botanical names: Lychnis and Lysimachia punctata. Silenus, the drunken, merry god of the woodlands of Greek mythology, gave his name to 'Silene dioica' , the wild form of red campion, which enlivens woods and hedgerows all over Britain with its bright red flowers, and even climbs mountains to establish itself on screes and cliff ledges.The second part of its scientific name 'dioica', means 'two houses' and refers to the fact that each red campion plant has flowers of one sex only, so that two plants are needed to make seed.Yellow Loosestrife or Lysimachia vulgaris,  has not one but two stories dating back to ancient Greece to explain the plant's botanical name.According to one account, bunches of yellow loosestrife tied around the necks of draft animals would make them more docile by repelling insects that might otherwise irritate and unsettle the beasts. Hence people called the plant Lysimachia after two Greek words which together meant 'to loosen strife'.Other sources, such as the Roman writer Pliny the Elder, said that the plant was named after Lysimachus, an ancient king of Thrace, who was reputed to have discovered medicinal uses for the plant.The 17th century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper also thought the plant had healing properties. He recommended it for nose and mouth bleeding and for upset stomachs. Many people followed his advice to burn the plant in their homes, since the smoke drove away troublesome flies and gnats.Late as ever for inclusion in That's My World where lots of clever people have long ago filed their new photos. As none of them ever comes here,  my tardiness won't matter."},

{"title": "Earthbound", "date": "Saturday 2 July 2011", "text": "There was a time when I believed I could fly. Now I am not sure that even my spirit can take off, I have become earthbound.  I am so much older, perhaps wiser, certainly sensible, and sadly, pedestrian.Claire Gneccho's recent post on her blog Daily Epiphanies from Gaithersburg was a sudden, very sharp, reminder of something I had long forgotten:  roots are for trees, fetters that bind are for slaves. Mankind must not be fettered, immobile, spiritless. Here is what Claire said:Sky WalkDo you ever lose yourself in cloud thoughts?Surrender to unfettered imaginingsof floating cities and giant causeways,morphing into what?Vastness of the NowThey transport us into timelessnessDo you ever feel it so?I still fall into day-dreams, 'lose myself in cloud thoughts', but that's as far as I go. The dream ends, the clouds become grey skies and I am aware of terra firma under my feet.I once had a friend, the sort of friend you have because your partners are friends;  we were the same age, from different countries but able to speak each others language and both unhappy for similar reasons; apart from that we had nothing meaningful in common. I don't think we even liked each other very much.One day Claudine said: \"You know, you always seem restless, wanting to leave this place; you say you are tired of being unhappy and that you will try to make a different life for yourself somewhere else. My life is no better, but I have made my bed and  must lie in it.  You should do the same; flitting from one place to another is not what we are meant to do; we must grow roots, strong roots and learn to put up with what is and not hanker for what might be. You will never be at peace that way\".Claudine was wrong. She stayed and I left. I heard later that the strong roots she put down couldn't save her sanity.To choose flight can be risky. There is a story about a father who takes his son to the top of a tall mountain, shows him the vast emptiness below and says:\"My son, behold what is yours to take. You have wings;  take a deep breath,  and fly.\"The son is afraid. \"What if I fail and crash?\"The father reassures him: \"Even if you crash, you will not be hurt for long. You will acquire a few scars but gain courage to try again. You were born with wings, do not let them wither in fear of the unknown\".The boy consults his friends who advise him to practise by launching himself off a low hill.  The boy crashes. When he complains to his father, the man says:\"To fly you need the space to spread your wings wide. There is always risk. If you want security, if flying is not to your taste, you had better stay earthbound\".Nobody needs to take stories like this one seriously, even young people can choose to live a life as free of risk as is humanly possible, where one step leads securely to the next and the next and the one after that. But how will you ever find out if you have wings if you never try to fly?I may be earthbound but I still like to think that strong roots are for trees."},

I can't see it on the shelf.\"It's poetry evening next Thursday and the subject is an easy one: 'Animals'. Ted Hughes has written a series of poems on animals. Beloved is looking for 'his' Hughes.That he can't find it, means nothing.  He can never find anything without asking me for directions first.And no, I am not currently borrowing 'his' Hughes.In close to twenty-five years of marriage the only thing we haven't married are the books. We each still have our own bookshelves, in separate rooms.When we got married, both for the second time, we had supplies of every kind of ordinary household utensil, from pots and pans to linen, porcelain, silverware and glassware. We kept the best and/or most useful of everything and amalgamated it. There were many items resulting from the break-up of previous households neither of us wanted to keep. \"After all\", we said, \"it doesn't do to carry the past into a fresh start\".Everything surplus to requirements went to charity shops or the local dump. We had a wonderful few years scouring antique dealers for large and small pieces of furniture, rugs, pictures, china, all to become part of our 'present and future'.  The future is with us, the results of our collecting frenzy all too visible.  Charity shops are once again the beneficiaries.Books have remained strangely immune from the 'togetherness' bug. We have both continued to buy books, very few of which have been given away. Sometimes we look at the shelves and one of us will suggest that the other could surely very well do without their collection of Lilliput or Gibbons' Decline and Fall. (If you don't know what they are, don't worry, you haven't missed a lot).\"Absolutely not\", is the heated reply. \"I have kept them this long, they haven't bothered you before, why do you want me to shed them now?\" We guard out treasures jealously.We both sigh: \"Well, perhaps not just yet, but if you feel that you really don't need the entire series on 'The Celts in Britain' any more  . . . . . . . .\". That particular edition has long been superseded by a new one based on  modern research but who is to say that modern research is necessarily more accurate.Whichever one of us owns it, doesn't need to be told that their edition is no longer fit for purpose.  Neither of us says it, we are friends, after all; not only that, but we both suffer from the same disease: we both hoard books.As for Collected Hughes? It's exactly where it should be,  on the poetry shelves under 'H'.  I put it back there after I'd borrowed it."},

He shall love women, be merry, humble, good, wise and well-renowned; but he shall have damage by envy, and strife and discord among his neighbours. He shall have often great fear on the water; he shall find hidden money, and labour sore for his wife.

I should be grateful, should not complain. I am, truly I am, farmers and gardens need the rain; but . . . .  OK, so I am complaining, want to make something of it?When the rain stopped after lunch I asked Benno what he wanted me to do. \"Garden or walkies?\" He quite firmly opted for a walk, so I really had no choice in the matter.We left by the side gate which leads from the courtyard to the castle moat, This exit will soon become impassable. The rambling rose over the trellis and gate and a clematis over the path stop us using this gate for weeks and weeks between the end of June and the end of September. Rose tendrils get tangled in hair and clothing and the clematis blocks the path most effectively, daring you to trample it underfoot. Plants can be so uppity.The courtyard is walled on two sides, there's a hedge behind flower beds on the other and the house forms the fourth side of the square. The ground slopes slightly towards the house which means that the sort of rain we had last night provides us with  a refreshing paddle right outside the front door. Luckily, there's a step to the front door and the paths leading round the house allow the water to run off in merrily tinkling rivulets. I love it that so many of you envy me my castle, so here's another picture of it, of the keep this time. That beautifully manicured bit of lawn you can see inside the fence is Valley's End's bowling green. There can't be many bowling greens in the country which have a prettier location.We didn't go very far today, just climbed the hill to the  North of Valley's End, via a field path crossroads where the gallows once stood, aptly named Gallows Corner; then  over the Modems and back down to the sheep pasture. Sheep are stupid creatures and only appealing when newborn and gambolling in the fields. (Our possibly roasted, with garlic and rosemary). This girl had got out and was blocking our path, running dementedly back and forth, eyeing Benno suspiciously. He pays the creatures no attention at all, he is far too busy sniffing out evidence of  friends who may have passed this way and left news of  great importance, to judge by his urgency. Dogs read verges and grassy tussocks like we read newspapers, have you noticed?Two thoughts to leave you with:With Midsummer Eve so close, be sure to keep your house clean. Apparently, the Fairies preferred it that way, according to John Aubrey's  Remains of Gentilism 1688.Damn, I wish I'd known that, I'd have stayed home and done some cleaning.And, if the cuckoo is heard on June 21st, it will be a wet summer.Chance would be a fine thing, I haven't heard a cuckoo for several years."},

Today he defined the edges between the lawn and beds and borders, and  weeded all soft paths as well as between stones and slabs on the hard ones; both these jobs make an instant difference.  He staked tall herbaceous plants securely, weeded a deep border and strimmed the daffodil lawns, a long overdue job, leaving me free to do delicate hand weeding on narrower beds, which I can do kneeling. As it's Saturday he left early but he has promised to come back on Thursday. I shall continue to get out there between showers as often as I can, so I might not be around that much this week either.All I need now is a few days of sunshine to get some colour into the borders which are still quite sad looking.

Nothing terribly extravagant but always given with thought.One long ago birthday present Beloved gave me still ranks amongst my favourites: a swing, an ordinary swing made from a piece of oak with two holes in it and suspended from a beech tree by stout rope.When I was a little girl I always wanted a swing in a cherry tree; a friend had one and I loved to eat cherries. I told Beloved and for my next birthday he took me into the garden and showed me what he had done. He said : \" I can't grow you a cherry tree fast enough but will a swing in a beech tree do?\"I still have the swing, the seat is now covered in lichen and mosses, but it still works.We had an equally wonderful present between the two of us this week. Gardener has been dragging his feet over stripping and repainting an old Singer sowing machine with a sheet of marble on the top, which we use as a table on the terrace by the kitchen, and a municipal park bench we brought back from France many years ago. Both were seriously rusty and in need of attention for some time.I mentioned this to our good friend Jay, who paints pet portraits; \"I'll do it\", she said instantly, \"it can be your birthday present. I love doing intricate, complicated work\".

{"title": "The Birth Of Venus", "date": "Monday 13 June 2011", "text": "WILLOW's MAGPIE No. 69Alessandro Botticelli scratched his head; his visitor, the mighty Lorenzo de Medici had left his workshop only minutes ago.  He should be feeling immensely proud that Lorenzo the Magnificent had commissioned him to paint the lovely Simonetta Cattaneo Vespucci;  to be chosen by the powerful ruler of the Florentine Republic to execute this commission was a great honour indeed; it was an open secret that both Lorenzo and his younger brother Giuliano were in love with the girl and Lorenzo would want the painting to the very best that gold could buy.The commission, however,  came with conditions, which was the reason Botticelli frowned. He was to paint her as the embodiment of Venus. Venus had two aspects: she was an earthly goddess who aroused humans to physical love or she was a heavenly goddess who inspired intellectual love in them. So, looking at Venus, the most beautiful of goddesses, might at first raise a physical response in viewers which then lifted their minds towards the Creator.

The Draper's Hall, a prestigious Restaurant with Rooms has it all:  six centuries of history as well as delicious food and a civilized ambience.By the 1440 the drapers of Shrewsbury had formed their own guild and had become prominent in the town. They had their own chapel in St. Mary's Church. The present Hall was built in 1576 to provide a meeting hall for the Drapers' Company. The Hall, although much altered over the centuries, retains original features of the Shrewsbury School of Carpentry, especially the frontage. The majority of the original Elizabethan fittings and purpose-made Jacobean furniture is still in place.Shrewsbury still has many individual shops, spending money is easy and could be a great pleasure. Keeping your purse closed  is the hard part here. Some of the items I bought are none of your business, after all, a girl needs to replenish certain items of her wardrobe even before they are worn out.But I can tell you that I bought a bag,  larger than the one I usually use, mainly because nowadays I need to carry a camera or two and maybe a notepad too, for the purposes of blogging. (see how seriously I take keeping you entertained and glued to my blog? And hopefully incite one or two more of you to become followers? I'm shameless, I know.)It's a pretty ordinary bag, made of a kind of woven straw,(I'm sure there's a name for it) with leather trim. It really was not expensive, when you consider that handbags have become status items.I also splashed out on three fat volumes of poetry; they come highly recommended by a number of reviewers in various newspapers and, as it's my birthday this month, I felt like giving myself a special treat. For once they are not second-hand, I had some money left over on gift vouchers I hadn't fully cashed in on a previous occasion, so the total outlay was less frightening than it might have been.Soon I will believe that I wasn't extravagant at all and that these books were an essential purchase.Maybe."},

Their frilly knickered glory is also short-lived and I have been rather ruthless with them up to now. But plants are like books to me, I wouldn't deliberately kill one or give it away to any other than a really good home; as peonies don't take kindly to being transplanted I  have had to tolerate them in my borders.But in a vase they look spectacular.

Above all, its scent is gorgeous, sweet and fruity. It is also perfectly happy to be pruned back after flowering and will spend the rest of the year in the shadows, lending its green leaves to the lush background so very necessary to give structure to an English country garden with its emphasis on herbaceous planting.Bob The Flower and his assistant grow annuals, a few easily propagated herbaceous plants and one or two common shrubs and sell them at weekends in summer in a car park in the centre of Craven Arms. Bob started about ten years ago in a small field he rented from a local landowner. He now does a roaring trade. People mainly come for his trays of bedding annuals, hanging basket and container plants, as soon as the danger of night frost is over.  I bought a whole carbootful of annuals and container plants, all garishly coloured, to fill the many gaps left in my borders by the killing frosts of last winter.Bob's plants are cheaper than those from expensive nurseries; he also sells vegetable seedlings. I bought French beans, beetroot, courgette and lettuce (little gem) plants from him. I really couldn't grow vegetables more effortlessly or cheaper.Plenty of arse over elbow action going on at Bob The Flower'sWhen we got home this chap was waiting for lunch. We only seem to have one grey squirrel, although they normally hunt in large packs. He has been with us for years, has made his home in the owl box in the horse chestnut tree, regularly steals the bird food and uses the birds' drinking dish for a bidet. I am not fond of tree rats, which is all grey squirrels are, but one chap, so long as he doesn't bring his missus and expect us to subsidise a large brood of layabout dependants, well, where's the harm."},

{"title": "A Little Bottle of Pills - And A Very Difficult Subject", "date": "Saturday 4 June 2011", "text": "My friend Deborah of The Temptation Of Words wrote a post today, calling it The Ultimate Decision, which deals with a person's wish to have the final say over how  their life ends.  As always, her post is thoughtful and measured and eminently readable. She says her decision to re-publish  an earlier post was prompted by the death of Dr. Jack Kevorkian on Friday in a hospital in Michigan. I am sure that his work as an advocate of assisted suicide is well known to most.I wonder if I might post here my own experience of the subject; before I do so, I'd like to reassure all of you, that it now lies in the past, and is no longer acute. Life is sunny and pleasant, on the whole, and although the black dog of depression occasionally bares his teeth and barks in the night, thoughts of suicide are far from my mind.Once upon a time they were daily companions. Literally. By that I mean that it was somehow wholly reassuring that, if things became unbearable,  a way out was available: a little bottle of pills, barbiturates, which sat in a secret drawer of my night table;  they were just there, my little friends, a crutch to lean on. There was no drama involved, no great moral or religious wrestling; there was  an almost benign and quite calm acceptance of the possibility of taking control. I was not just battling depression but deeply entangled in a very unhappy, destructive relationship; the only way out appeared to be death. Although I was desperately serious about the fact that I might end my life, the physical presence of the means to do so somehow made it less urgent, less immediately imperative. In a strange way I could function normally, at least on the surface. Then a very strange thing happened. At the office where I worked we had a library and this library was catalogued and updated by a professional librarian, a youngish woman like myself; we must have recognised something in each other;  on the days she called at the office, we took to having lunch together. We became friends, and in due course she confided that she was a manic depressive, what is now called bi-polar. Beverley had suffered greatly in the past with bouts of both mania and depression and the treatments had been horrendous.  She was absolutely certain, that she did not want  to undergo another episode of either illness or treatment.  To this end she had, like me, a little bottle of pills; like mine, just in case.For years she and I met in the lounge of a large hotel in Victoria in London for drinks and dinner, both of us having left the company where we met long ago. We sat and talked for hours, exchanging news on many subjects, work, family, lovers, leisure, and the state of the world. We talked like any two friends, who meet occasionally for a catch-up; the only difference between us and  other friends meeting for a meal was that with us there'd always come the point when one or the other would ask : \"do you still have it? \", meaning the little bottle of pills. The answer was always in the affirmative.Eventually, we ran out of time; our friendship had served its purpose. I left London and although I returned for another year of monthly meals for old times' sake, we found our paths following different routes. Beverley remained stuck in her own groove and I wanted to move on. I am ashamed to say I rather deserted her in the end, as so often happens, our friendship fizzled out.I don't know what became of her. Now that she is back in my mind I may ring her and find out.The talisman in my little bottle also ran out of time in the end, the pills had long ago lost their potency.I no longer needed them, I flushed them down the loo."},
{"title": "My World  - The Arbor Tree - Aston-on-Clun", "date": "Wednesday 1 June 2011", "text": "In the village of Aston-on-Clun in the beautiful South Shropshire Hills the very ancient custom of Tree Dressing survives to this day. Where once was the village green, opposite these cottages on the main route through the village, stands the Arbor Tree, which each year on Arbor Day, the 29th May, is dressed with flags; originally these were flags of the Commonwealth, but these days a few other flags are added.A local land-owning family, the Marstons, reinstated the custom in the 18th century, on the occasion of  the marriage on 29th May 1786 of Mary Carter of Sibdon to John Marston of Aston-on-Clun. A large rice pudding also used to be eaten by the villagers, but this ceased in the 19th century.Apart from acquiring things like phone lines the village has probably not changed very much since Mary Carter came here as a young bride.The custom of tree dressing is ancient. The shrine of the Celtic goddess Bride was a tree and trees used to be dressed in her honour. When, in the fifth century, the daughter of a Celtic chief founded a church near a Bride tree at Kildare in Ireland, she became known as Brigid and was later venerated as a saint.  Tree dressing was revived in 1660 when Charles II proclaimed 29th May, the day of his Restoration, as Arbor Day to commemorate his concealment in the oak tree as Boscobel. At first, almost every village had its arbor tree.Aston-on-Clun, referred to as Eston in the Domesday Book and so-called, because it lies east of the Clun, is today thought to be the last place in England to still have an arbor tree.When the Marston Estate was sold in 1951, the tree, a large black poplar reputed to be over 270 years old, was given to the village. The old poplar was felled by a storm in 1995. The current tree, already a good sized one, is from a cutting taken of the old poplar in 1975.My belated contribution to That's My World"},
{"title": "The Case For Indulging In Passions", "date": "Monday 30 May 2011", "text": "I have it on the best authority that being obsessed can be a good thing.Let me explain:Twice in the past twenty odd years I have been close to extinction physically, once with kidney failure and once with cancer; both came out of nowhere, both hit me practically overnight. The first time my immune system got the wrong message and turned on me instead of protecting me, while the cancer sneaked up  while I wasn't paying attention and simply fell out of me one morning.Neither occasion was pleasant. Both had nasty treatments and subsequently caused other problems. It also was not true for me what they say about being seriously ill giving you such a shock that, if you are lucky enough to survive, you change your life and henceforth live each day 'to the max'.  That only lasts for a short period; personally, I  was soon back in my slothful ways.Reader, fear not: this is not going to be a tale of woe about ailments, but rather a short guide on how to get over them.GET PASSIONATE! The more obsessed you are with a healthy pursuit, the better your chances of survival.Beloved and I had not been together for long when nephrotic syndrome hit me. After years of solitary struggle I was madly in love, deliriously happy and high on passion, literally. Stays in hospital were nothing more than annoying interruptions of this wonderful state of being. Doctors and surgeons insisted that I must be hospitalised three times in one year, but they did let me out to get married and have three days off for good behaviour afterwards. I must have bored the nurses and doctors rigid with tales of my good fortune during that time; in the end I became something of a mascot,  their favourite bad penny, in and out like a yo-yo.By the time cancer struck I had got used to being in a twosome; my attention had shifted focus. Among other things, I had become passionate about  gardening; having moved to the countryside and acquired a large patch made that entirely necessary, as well as a great pleasure.I was again extremely fortunate that I hit it off with my oncologist/surgeon and during the full year of treatments and visits we became firm gardening buddies. This continued for as long as I had to see her, every aftercare session turned into a discussion on our progress in the garden, hers and mine.  She was as passionate about gardening as I was, in fact, her narrow and delicate surgeon's hands were rough and calloused from tending potatoes.On both occasions the medical staff congratulated me on my attitude towards being ill. Being positive helps, although there are times when 'being positive' is more than the patient can bear and letting go temporarily is as healthy as being strong. Remission or survival are not always the outcome, death is always on the cards too.But my oncologist actually put it into words for me, she said: \" I find that those of my patients who have a focus away from the cancer, who are passionate about something, something that they find totally absorbing, have the best chance of survival\"."},
{"title": "Musicians On Out-Of-Town Engagements", "date": "Thursday 26 May 2011", "text": "Mud From A ScraperNo. 3 in an occasional series.Musicians on Tour- between rehearsal and performance -One of the least popular features of the orchestral musician's life is the out of town concert, or gig. This usually involves early rising, a long coach or train journey, the expense of buying meals, and a late return as well as the customary rehearsal and performance. For all this, the player receives little extra remuneration.There is invariably great anxiety about catching the return train, and it is accepted that the last movement of the last work in a concert is always played faster than on any previous occasion. The conductor may object to this, but is usually overruled. Experienced musicians have a wide knowledge of the shortest route from every concert hall to the nearest station, via some public house.Touring may consist either of a string of provincial concerts spread around the country, or of a longer period in just one or two towns. The first kind is generally detested, as the player is away from his customary haunts, and is not long enough in any one place to settle into a routine; the second is more easily tolerated and some musicians may even enjoy such a sojourn as it provides an opportunity for making new acquaintances and playing on fresh golf courses. Whatever its effect upon musicians, touring is a long-standing custom, part of their contract. A beneficial side effect of touring is that it boosts sales of recordings.The main problem attached to visiting strange towns is that of finding reasonably priced accommodation. Alas, some musicians welcome tours as a justifiable excuse for getting away from wife and home, and, in common with sailors and commercial travellers, tend to have a sweetheart in many towns. Such players rarely have accommodation problems.Musicians pay one of their few tributes to culture when working out-of-town, for no beauty spot, abbey or historic building in provincial towns is left unvisited. The purpose of this is two-fold: to be able to say they have been there when asked by curious grandchildren and also to help prove to suspicious wives that they have really been away on a job at all. Most take their cameras to add evidence to their stories; some have even been known to hand these to accomplices to take pictures for them, when their motives for going out-of-town were less than professional."},

He was thought to be immensely rich and known for his weakness where young girls were concerned. He had been married many times; nobody knew what had happened to each previous wife; it was said that he had  packed them off to foreign lands with a chestful of gold as compensation for their dismissal from the marital chamber.His name was Count Bluebeard, on account of his very dark and long beard, which he kept tucked into his shirt collar most of the time, because he was apt to trip over it when he was in a hurry.Bluebeard was once again on the look-out for a new wife and his choice fell on one of the pretty daughters of his neighbour;  Marie, the youngest of the girls, agreed to marry him. In spite of her youth, Marie was madly in love with a poor lute player and while the marriage negotiations were going on between Marie's parents and Count Bluebeard, she and her paramour hatched a plan to outwit Bluebeard.  Part of the contract was that Marie would receive her chest of gold before the actual wedding night, to sweeten the sacrifice she was about to make. It was Bluebeard's habit to give a lavish wedding reception for each new wife, with a banquet as the central event, where he usually ate and drank himself senseless.  Music played a part during these celebrations and Marie asked if she could be serenaded by a young lute player of her parents' acquaintance during the banquet. Bluebeard grumbled, but her parents insisted that their daughter's wish be granted, so he gave in. It was all the same to him what the wench did for the few hours before the wedding night, afterwards he would soon teach her to fall in with his wishes.The chest of gold handed over, the wedding ceremony duly took place. Marie kept her fingers crossed in the folds of her dress the whole time. As was his wont, Bluebeard ate and drank until he fell off his chair, Marie watching him all the while. She kept a clear head and the lute player kept his down, in order not to arouse any suspicion. Marie's father also sat at the table, keeping an eye on the room. When Bluebeard lay on the floor, Marie's father, the lute player and Marie herself dragged him out of the hall and ostensibly into the marital chamber, where she was to await her lord's re-awakening and subsequent pleasure. However, they continued to drag him out of a secret door leading from this chamber to a special dungeon beneath it; this dungeon was the horrible place where all Bluebeard's previous wives had ended up, kept prisoner for evermore.They tipped him over the edge into the dungeon, where his wives were waiting to torment him as he had tormented them.Marie and the lute player, however,  left the country and lived happily ever after. They never felt guilty once and the chest of gold came in very handy to augment the salary of a moderately talented lute player."},

In a 'Miscellany of Garden Wisdom', under 'Folk Tales And Fable'  I found the following passage:Sex, Fertility and Plants.Indulging in sexual intercourse among crops was a custom which occurred frequently in many places throughout America and Europe. Ritualistic copulation was so performed to increase the fertility of plants.Sometimes pregnant women were employed to plant seed, the inference being that their own obvious bountifulness would transfer itself to the growing plants. Similarly, pregnant women hugged trees to induce healthy growth.o-o-o-o-oThe Sun enters the House of Gemini.The man born under Gemini shall have many wounds.

Technology helps to save time, but there’s the danger of becoming technology’s slave. We feel we need to do more and more in ever fewer available hours. The demands of employment, family and many other commitments can make us feel like hamsters on a wheel. Round and round we go, never getting anywhere.I once complimented a shopkeeper on how calm he always appeared, in spite of the stressful life he so clearly had and the many demands on his time, including the care of a disabled wife. \"I may look calm to you\", he said, \"but under this counter I'm treading water like mad just to stand still\".I frequently come across people who bemoan this endless pressure and say they want to slow down, and spend more time enjoying themselves. Well, there’s a whole leisure industry dedicated to telling us how to do this, to fill our time most efficiently, to organize our leisure hours, pack in as much as we can and gain the most benefit. We go on holiday and tick off museums, churches, galleries, stately homes; we need to see the sights prescribed for us by others. After work, we pursue leisure activities, all kinds of indoor and outdoor sports, cultural activities, group activities; we must keep going, must keep the grey cells active, must get fit, must achieve, must do, can't let up; mustn't get rusty, if we stop, we might never start again. Hamsters on the wheel of pleasure.What is wrong with being idle, being quiet, being on your own? What is wrong with going for a walk, not with a particular aim in mind, just a walk, leisurely, noticing nature all around you, thinking idle thoughts, however rambling? Sitting in a café and watching the world go by? Spending time over a newspaper or book? Instead of jogging through the park, why not stop, sit on a bench and feel the sun on your face and watch children and dogs; take time out to be kind to someone, chat with a lonely, maybe elderly person. Why not?Since Beloved and I went to live in the country we meet more and more retired people who say they have never been as busy as they are now. They can’t understand how they ever found the time to go to work. Having lost the routine and personal importance of their productive working life they turn into the phenomenon of the hyperactive pensioner. Don’t laugh, I’ve seen them in action.How sad and what nonsense this is.  I don’t believe in the truth of the saying “The devil finds work for idle hands”, or the German equivalent, “Leisure is the root of all vice”. The Protestant work ethic has much to answer for.Time is the most precious gift we have in this life. As we get older, we feel it running through our fingers, we want to hold on to it, slow down the passing of it. Running ourselves ragged isn’t going to do that. The adventure of a new life in retirement demands  careful appreciation. Leisure is important! In Greek philosophy, to have achieved freedom was to have the leisure to do nothing. (For men - not for women and/or slaves, but that is another story).I am not advocating that we become cabbages, couch potatoes; you know me better than that. What I am saying is that for myself I would like to learn how to live my remaining time wisely, meaningfully rather than always on target, to concentrate on the job – or pleasure – in hand.What I'd like to learn is to sit, get off the wheel and dangle my feet instead.To give my soul room to breathe."},

Bishop's Castle is a good example of this development: its settlement pattern, laid down around 1280, remains remarkably intact to the present day.Today this sleepy little town has neither castle - except for a few ruins - nor bishops, although it once had both. The Saxon lord Egwin Shakehead sold the land to the Bishops of Hereford who promptly built themselves a castle, hence the name of the 'modern' town.The pace of the town is as unhurried now as it has ever been, the very steep High Street originally lead from the castle in the upper town to the church at the bottom end. It has a variety of small family-run shops and dwellings, with  many interesting facades, ranging in age and period from a medieval half-timbered cottage with dormer windows, through Elizabethan dwellings, also black and white, to handsome Georgian houses in mellow brick as well as solid Victorian buildings.The House On Crutches, now the Town MuseumYarborough House, stuffed to the rafters with second hand books, old vinyl records and CDs.It also has a coffee shop where you can study your purchases and possibly decide to buy a few more of each. Jock, the owner is an excellent wood turner, I have one of his huge plates crafted from elm wood.The people of Bishop's Castle have a whacky sense of humour. Many houses have 'interestingly' painted facades, like the spotty one next door to the fish and chip shop.Another of the fashionable attractions of Bishop's Castle is a shrine for 'real ale' enthusiasts, the Three Tuns Inn and Brewery at the very top end of the town on Salop Street, a pub with an unpretentious frontage but with its own brewery next door.The Three Tuns Brewery produces excellent ales, the 'Cleric's Cure' among them which is served in the pub, together with a few hearty dishes from the menu. The Three Tuns' brewing licence was first issued in 1642. Part of the present brewery is of 17th Century origin, which would make it the oldest working brewery in Britain.This is just one small town nestling in the South Shropshire Hills.I'm enjoying this series, it gives me an opportunity to appreciate the peaceful rural world I live in.

{"title": "My World  -  A Walk In Muted Colours", "date": "Wednesday 11 May 2011", "text": "Few people, even in the UK,  know about the beauties of the English Border County of Shropshire; I feel privileged to live here and  have decided to sing its praises in these pages. South Shropshire is a particularly quiet, very rural part of the world,  far from busy crowds and the hustle and bustle of modern cities. The Shropshire Hills have been granted the status of AONB (Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty) as well as Area of Tranquility.Today I shall take you on a walk starting from my doorstep, it doesn't take me two minutes to get out into the fields.  Although this is mainly sheep farming country there are also a few arable fields. At this time of year hedgerows, meadows and pastures are bursting with wild flowers, there isn't a path or lane whose edges are not embroidered with frothy Queen Anne's Lace, also known as cow parsley; Here and there patches of stitchwort insist on putting the cow parsley in its place and show off their white stars.  White and yellow are the dominant colours at the moment. A field of buttercups is a wondrous sight, particularly when interspersed with the red seedheads of grasses.At this time of year rape fields predominate, the colour is almost fluorescent seen from a distance.. On a sunny day the smell is quite overpowering, not very pleasant.Even our narrow tarmac-ed lanes are edged with flowers. Here we have golden spurge, Welsh poppies and wallflowers. There are also ladies' mantle and purple columbines, all of them self-sown. Once you have them, they will quickly spread.Whenever I leave the house or return to it, this is the first sight I see: the castle ruins. We have a gate leading directly into the castle meadow and Benno regards the castle grounds as an extension to his garden.Hawthorn, or thorn apple, is used extensively as a hedging shrub or tree round here; the flowers are fully out now, framing fields and country roads in  billowing white clouds. I like the sweet smell of hawthorn,so I snapped off a few twigs to take home and put them in a vase. They won't last long, but I find them no less beautiful for being ephemeral.My walk today says hello to the people at That's My World who all show off places and photos they are particularly proud of and which they want to share with others."},
{"title": "The Birdman", "date": "Monday 9 May 2011", "text": "WILLOW'S  MAGPIE No. 65At the end of the lane, on the edge of the Forest, before you climb into the wilderness of bracken on bare hillsides, with only gorse and bramble thickets here and there covering the land and very few discernible paths crossing it, you come to a clearing. In this clearing, leaning against a rocky overhang, stands a dilapidated, ancient caravan surrounded by the detritus of open-air living: tarpaulins, plastic buckets and basins, wooden bins, a rusty bicycle, an iron wheelbarrow, piles of logs, cooking pots and pans, tools for many purposes, axes and spades and saws and hammers, all of them discarded by civilization and lovingly collected. There is a jeep which hasn’t been on the road for decades, how it got here is anyone’s guess.Strewn all around are rough-hewn benches and chairs and a few tables, in various stages of completion, made of sawn logs nailed together. The sort of furniture that you’d put in a hidden corner of the wilder reaches of your garden, if ‘rustic’ is what you are after. You’d probably not sit on the benches and chairs very often or for very long; genuinely ‘rustic’ and comfort don’t mix.The whole site almost has the air of an abandoned rubbish tip, except that there is also a heap of smouldering ashes in the centre of the clearing, which allows you to realize that this is somebody’s ‘home’.As you stand and stare, you become aware of a tremendous noise all about you, a cacophony of sound, which is difficult to attribute, quite overpowering. As your eyes adjust to the semi-gloom of the clearing amidst tall trees, both coniferous and deciduous, you notice an endless flickering of small bodies hurtling between the trees, landing and disappearing, reappearing and taking off for another perch. Birds,  hundreds and hundreds of birds share the clearing with the occupant of the caravan, a man, shaggy and shabby, dirty and dressed in ragged clothes,  but tall and strong and weather-beaten.Frank the birdman has finally joined you. You simply have to stop and talk to him, he will not let you go, even though you might now want to be on your way.Frank seldom sees people up here and makes good use of them when he does. His nearest neighbours have long given up on him, in fact, he and his encampment have become a thorn in their flesh. His life story is an interesting one. He and his family once owned the farm down the lane, they were prosperous enough to scratch a decent living from the land, sheep farmers, like many round here, with a few arable acres thrown in. He and his brother inherited the farm, but fell out with each other within a few years; the farm was lost and they had to sell. Frank soon enough lost the proceeds from the sale too, he is not very forthcoming about the reason, although there are still people living round here who remember. Frank got into the jeep, towed the farm labourers’ overflow caravan as far as it would go, bought the useless plot of land where the jeep stopped dead and became the birdman of Clun Forest.He lives off the sale of his rustic ‘furniture’ and a state benefit payment; it might even be a pension now. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if there is not also a little left-over nest egg. Frank has no hesitation in asking passers-by for contributions to bird food; summer and winter he feeds his birds. His rusty bicycle takes him round the supermarkets of the area, who let him have stale loaves of bread for pennies. He also buys many pounds of the cheapest lard, dried fruit and anything else at the end of its sell-by date, flour and grain at cost price. Some of the local bird-watchers help him transport the larger quantities, otherwise he struggles on his bicycle to get  supplies in.Frank needs little for himself, the one and only luxury item in his caravan, where he lives summer and winter, is a radio. He likes a bit of music, he says. I am surprised he can hear it over the din the birds  make."},
{"title": "Mother's Day With A Difference", "date": "Saturday 7 May 2011", "text": "Photo via Cheshire Fire and Rescue ServiceIt must be Mother's Day somewhere in the world;  I see that there are many moving tributes to mothers around blogland. I am so happy for all of you who remember your mothers with gratitude and love and whose children remember them equally lovingly. There can never be enough love in the world.When my daughter was small she decided to do something special for me on the day, and bring me breakfast in bed. She was a sweet and dear little thing, an absolute treasure. At the same time she was independent-minded and capable from an early age. She usually spent the long holidays in Germany, with my parents, and I'd hand her over to the stewardess at Heathrow who then handed her over to my parents in Dusseldorf airport.  For the flight she had to wear an official card round her neck, giving all relevant details, like name, address, flight number, etc. 'Unaccompanied Minor' was the official title. This cardboard sign never lasted long. and by the third time she flew across she absolutely refused to wear it. \"I know the way now\", she said, \"and I don't need this sign at all. I am not a refugee child\".  It probably isn't funny now, but it was then.Anyway, on this particular Mother's Day she was going to make me breakfast and bring it up to me in bed. At some ungodly hour I heard her clattering down the stairs. Sunday morning was my only chance ever for a lie-in, I was not best pleased about the early start. Cupboard doors opened and slammed shut,  the kettle clanged against the kitchen tap. I could hear her arguing with her brother, never a good sign. The  smell of burning toast reached me, followed quickly by the lid of the kitchen bin snapping shut. Then there was silence, the arguing had stopped and I heard only sounds of someone being busy in the kitchen. I forced myself to stay in bed.When her footsteps thumped up the stairs I was ready for her. The smell of burnt toast still hung in the air, I was hoping the toast itself had been disposed of. She burst in \"Surprise, surprise, Happy Mother's Day, mummy, I made your breakfast. You can have a nice lie-in\".She was carrying a tray with a plate of burnt toast, a pot of cold tea and a pot of marmalade. \"How lovely, darling, thank you so much\".  She was so pleased with her efforts, beaming all over her face.I sat up and tucked in while she watched.The smell of burning was getting stronger, it was more like cloth burning than just breadcrumbs. I sniffed the air. Something was definitely wrong.By the time I got downstairs and into the kitchen, the towel draped over the grill attachment over the top of the cooker was in flames. It was drying there and neither of the children had thought to remove it before they cooked the toast in the grill pan.Stupidly, I grabbed the burning towel and flung it into the sink, then snatched another towel off the radiator and smacked it on the flaming grill, extinguishing the fire. I was lucky, the grill pan was clean and fat free and the towel quickly burnt itself out in the sink.As a mother's day present we went out and bought a toaster."},

Questions are being asked about the exact course of events, the legality of events, the infringement of Pakistan's sovereignty; the wisdom of  burial at sea, the advisability of withholding pictures of the dead body are being discussed. The first conspiracy theories are emerging, disbelief and doubt are surfacing; the compound where bin Laden apparently lived for the past five years without knowledge of the Pakistani authorities has become a place of gruesome pilgrimage, a tourist attraction.Fears of repercussion are growing, we are told we must be vigilant and aware of the dangers to security.Newton states in his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy:Every action has its equal and opposite reaction.J.R.R. Tolkien said in The Lord Of The Rings, Book Four:Many that live deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fearing for your own safety. Even the wise cannot see all ends.No doubt there will be many more questions and very few answers, there may be tensions between nations, harsh words and sabre rattling; there will always be those for whom nothing that is said or done will be right, but of one thing I am absolutely certain:Osama bin Laden is dead and for the people of New York, the families and friends of his victims, and the vast, overwhelming majority of the people of the United States there has been catharsis."},

Fires didn't frighten you then,  fire was good, as fire had been for the first ancestors of modern man, who learnt to control it. Traces of fire had been found dating back to the earliest stone age, nearly 800.000 years ago.You cried and struggled in my arms when I turned my back on the burning mountain, you wanted to watch the flames and the smoke rising into the yellowing skies; from time immemorial man has been fascinated by fire, you, at the beginning of your own life on earth found a deep well of primitive delight within you at the sight of the burning hillside.The day would come when fire on the mountain would become a noble enemy to be watched closely, to be fought and mastered;  when you would join your father and brothers in that dangerous task, when you would risk your life to keep your home and those you loved, safe.  Your fascination with fire would never cease, you would learn to live with it, make it your willing servant, but you would also learn not to trust it."},

So all the shouting and clashing of wills on the bridge is worth it, although it does seem rather silly at times; but then, that is tradition, they say, like the Morris Dancers, the Mummers' Play, the Maypole Dancing, the Marching Bands and Drummers, the duck races on the river, and the folk music groups. It brings the tourists and there is the fine sound of jingling tills to accompany the festivities.Just for the weekend, sleepy Valley's End is transformed into a lively centre for music, street theatre, tradition, colour and fun. Children love it. The meadow below the Castle becomes a huge playground, with stalls selling everything from food to folk art.Boys having fun tumbling in a small pool in four huge balloons called Ecoplay Waterwalkers,whereas these medieval sword fighters and jousters don't appear to enjoy themselves very much.

For more than a week  every news bulletin has been fanning the flames of wedding frenzy. The same tired old experts have been trotted out, we have had tradition, pomp and circumstance, pageantry and Royalty  rammed down our throats relentlessly, but everything comes to its end. The frenzy is over, the deed has been done, to the delight and dismay, in equal measure, of the population of the UK. An additional instalment has been added to the soap opera that is the House of Windsor. We have seen the dress, the kiss(es), the other dresses and hats, the coaches, the splendid uniforms and the even more splendid vestments of the clergy. We have reminded ourselves of the ancient couple at the helm of the whole edifice.Fevered excitement and annoyed lack of interest were the order of the day. Nobody managed to remain indifferent. Beloved and I sat glued to the TV screen for the whole of the wedding service, I couldn't have switched off for the life of me; these things become compulsive viewing. I adored the interviews with people at street parties in towns and villages and members of the throng lining the streets of London itself;  it was as if the camera crews had combed the crowds for the ugliest people, in the most ridiculous outfits, who promptly repaid selection by spouting enthusiastic tripe. I love finding a reason to feel superior, don't you?St Catherine of Siennafresco by Andrea Vanni, ca, 14th centuryThe Queen created a trio of new titles for Prince William, and Catherine is now the Duchess of Cambridge. I am not a Royalist but I have to admit that she looked very fetching, as did her sister and brother. A handsome family, the Middletons. A few chiselled cheekbones and clearly defined chins should work wonders for the pudding faced Windsors.I don't suppose the fact that the 29th April is also the feast day of Catherine of Sienna had any bearing on the choice of day.Nor this bit of advice for the 29th April which I found in The Anatomy of Abuses 1586, which those of an irreverent disposition might find amusing:Put Taurean bulls to cows now for early calves next year. The bulls must not feed with cows for two months before their leaping time and then let them come together without restraint.  They are a great while in copulation, and some have guessed by certain signs, whether the calf will prove male or female. If the bull leaps down on the right side of the cow, it will be a male, if on the left, a female. If a man then desires a male calf, let him tie up the right stone of the bull at the time of copulation, and for a female, bind up the left."},
{"title": "Royal Wedding, July 29th, 1981", "date": "Wednesday 27 April 2011", "text": "Thirty years ago the world was watching the fairy tale wedding of Prince Charles and the Lady Diana Spencer. 600.000 people filled the streets of London to get a glimpse of the happy couple and all the pomp and circumstance surrounding their big day,The couple were married at St Paul's Cathedral before an invited congregation of 3,500 and an estimated global TV audience of 750 million - making it the most popular programme ever broadcast at the time.A send-off into a fairy tale life to end all fairy tales, the watchers thought. Nobody foresaw the storm clouds gathering quite so quickly or the catastrophic shipwreck ahead.Britons enjoyed a national holiday to mark the occasion, that is, most Britons did, but there were many people working on the day to keep essential services going. Then there were those whose services were only of importance to the organisers of the wedding itself, an army of helpers, official and unofficial, among them the musicians. Court jesters have come and gone, there are no jugglers, tumblers, players any longer, but there must be musicians.Prince Charles was Patron of the Orchestra of The Royal Opera House. Beloved had played for him and the Royal Family many times before then, so playing at St. Paul's Cathedral was no big deal, even though this was a proper State occasion.  For a seasoned professional any gig is just that, a gig.  Or so they would like to make you believe.The musicians entered the Cathedral by the tradesmen's entrance, in this case by the North Crypt doors and had to be at their station in a side chapel before the proceedings began.They were playing a full programme of music long before the ceremony started at 11 o'clock, throughout the many processions, from the Ecclesiastical Procession, via the Procession of Foreign Crowned Heads, The Queen's Procession,The Procession of the Bridegroom,  and the Procession of the Bride.Beloved saw little of the processions and nothing of the actual marriage service. All he has are theofficial programmes, the Order of Service for the Ceremony itself, and the Ceremonial from the moment the Street Liners were in place (these are officials, NOT the populace), and the carriages began to leave  Buckingham Palace, to the moment the carriages returned. The Ceremonial runs to 32 pages and ends with the Bride and Bridegroom leaving the Grand Entrance in a semi-State Landau, accompanied by a Travelling Escort of the Household Cavalry, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Andrew Parker Bowles,  ( we all know what happened to him), Blues and Royals. at 4.00 p.m. (here the programme allows itself the first sign of a slip) \"approximately\".What he did see was Kiri Te Kanawa (now 'Dame') in 'that' outfit, singing \"Let The Bright Seraphim\" from Haendel's \"Samson\". The Band thought she did well but also generally accepted that she could have chosen a less unfortunate outfit.Just in case anyone thinks this must have been a profitable gig for the musicians, they are wrong. Prince Charles decided that all future royalties on the music, every penny coming from film, TV, CDs, and all other Rights worldwide, in perpetuity,  should go to a Charity of his choosing.He didn't even ask them.We met him (and Diana) at a Royal Garden Party years later, neither Beloved nor I remembered to complain."},

She'd been on the look-out for him for hours; impatiently she waited for him to finish greeting the assembled adults, who were his brothers and sisters, Eva's mother among them. She tugged at his hand; why was it that adults needed to have brothers and sisters when she herself didn't have any and still managed perfectly well?Uncle Peter had brought a bag of chocolate eggs to distribute among his many nephews and nieces, who had all come to Eva's parents' house for the day. The children had spent the morning hunting for eggs in the garden, which the Osterhase was supposed to have hidden in bushes and shrubs and behind stones before the crack of dawn. There was even a basket of coloured eggs in the hen house. Except for the two youngest, Hansi and Trudi,  they were old enough to know that the grown-ups had been out to hide the eggs; no bunny would be able to carry a basket with that many eggs on his back, they told each other.They'd be eating hard-boiled eggs for supper for several days, that was clear to all, to their collective disgust. Hunting for eggs was fun but eating them less so. Uncle Peter's eggs were special. He said he got them from the Chocolate Easter Egg wholesalers in Bunnyland and because he bought so many at a time, he had them at a discount. Each egg was wrapped in multicoloured foil, shimmering and shiny and crisp to the touch. Some had patterns on them, some had pretty pictures of rabbits, ribbons and pretty flowers, like daisies and daffodils; when he tipped them into the large basket, lined with moss, provided for the purpose by Eva's mum, they looked like somebody had caught a rainbow, bundled up all the colours, and shone a great yellow sun on them. The children squealed happily.Each egg had a tiny label hidden somewhere in the foil; Uncle Peter, who knew his greedy nephews and nieces well, had gone to the trouble of putting each child's nickname on a label, and, for the poor child without a nickname, he simply invented one; after some wrangling, shoving and hand slapping amongst themselves, each child had its own allocation of eggs and most started to eat one there and then.Except Eva, she wasn't allowed chocolate because the milk in it made her ill. She was used to it, it didn't bother her very much when the others sank their teeth into the chocolate and chewed and licked their fingers; Uncle Peter was bound to have a gift for her too. He always had. In the past he'd given her what he called a Russian egg, which turned out to be four eggs all hidden in one large one, each smaller than the one before; once he'd brought her a beautifully painted, perfectly spherical stone; he'd given her a delicate china egg which opened into two halves, hollow inside, for keeping tiny treasures. Then there had been the glass egg, which had flowers suspended inside it. Eva loved her Uncle Peter very much, he told wonderful stories and brought her very special gifts.Expectantly, she looked at him. What would he have for her this time?Uncle Peter beckoned her away from the chocolate eating frenzy and pulled a small tube out of his pocket. She examined it. It felt like cardboard and although it had stars painted on the outside, it didn't look like much; if this was for keeping things in, she much preferred her china egg. \"Put this end to your eye\", he said, \"just look\".  She looked.What seemed like a million colours and shapes and patterns exploded in her eye. Eva gasped in wonder.\"Turn it a little\", Uncle Peter advised. More shapes in different colour variations formed instantly. Each time she turned it, the patterns changed, over and over again, a glinting, mesmerising, flickering display. Better than all the chocolate eggs in a green moss basket in the world.\"I'm sorry I couldn't find you anything egg-shaped this time\", Uncle Peter said.Eva grinned. \"That's ok, I forgive you,\" she said."},
{"title": "APRIL MISCELLANY", "date": "Saturday 23 April 2011", "text": "Happy Easter !Since the time of the ancient Teutonic world the egg has been regarded as a bringer of luck and symbol of fertility, a joyful gift to celebrate the return of spring.Although egg painting was known in pre-Christian Greece the custom did not reach Northern Europe until the 17th Century when the Turks conquered Byzantium, causing many of the inhabitants to flee northwards, taking their traditions with them, including the custom of painting eggs.Written records show that the Easter Bunny as egg bringer first appeared on German soil in 1682, in the company of cockerels, foxes and donkeys, who were all deemed \"responsible\" for the delivery of eggs. It seems most likely that the rabbit won against the competition because of its high symbolism. Like the egg, the ancient Greeks, Romans and Teutons also revered the rabbit as a symbol of fertility.o-o-o-o-oThe Sun Enters the House of TaurusHe that is born under Taurus shall be strong, hardy, and full of strife.

It's bound to lighten the atmosphere and get the guests talking to each other.\"He gave me this advice because I had cooked chicken breasts, stuffed with blue cheese and olive paste and wrapped in Parma ham, the whole thing tied with butchers' string.I served them in a dish of sauce, decorated with herbs, all of it cooked there and then, while the guests were waiting; a great success and very tasty;  if only I had remembered to snip and remove the string before serving.I can confirm that rushing back to the kitchen for several pairs of scissors, which are then handed round the table,  will break any lingering ice as easily as the largest platter of shellfish you care to serve."},
{"title": "Memory", "date": "Wednesday 20 April 2011", "text": "The Persistence of Memory - Salvador DaliAfter lunch today we waved goodbye to the third of the annual pre-Easter family visiting groups. I have mentioned before that we have a large family between us, three pairs of own, adopted and step children, two of whom now have families of their own. We don't meet any of them very often, having removed ourselves from easy access; so visits are more prolonged and therefore  more intensive than they would be if we could just meet up for the day now and then.All went well; two-night-stays are long enough to catch up on all the news and short enough to avoid those small, pointed, exchanges, which could turn into instant flare-ups, given a drink too many, a child misbehaving,  pmt or hot flushes, sailing too close to the wind on aunt Mary's legacy to one and not another or just being cooped up together 24/7. The sun shone, tempers remained amicable and we all had  a happy time exchanging \"do-you-remember\"s.Except that I noticed this time particularly, how much remembrances of past incidents and situations vary among the people present then and now. Why is it that we all remember the past differently? Or not at all? Occasions which were of huge importance at the time had either been forgotten, or the participants all saw them differently.There was the story about Granny sitting in her favourite chair in the corner of the kitchen,  bossing everybody around and making sure that her son, in her eyes the head of the family, had a meal waiting on the table when he came home. Except that the son knew that he had never come home for this particular meal because of his very irregular time table. Long after Granny's death, family folklore held firm that Granny's bossiness had made life hell for her daughter-in-law. How can it be that two halves of a family see the past so differently?Another story concerned the ex-girlfriend of another son who had invited  him to her parents' house for Christmas dinner;  the parents then promptly asked him to pay for his share of the meal, to his utter amazement. This solecism became a major talking point at the time in his own family, even the girl-friend was mortified and joined in the ridicule of her parents, yet years later, the son now happily married to another woman, had completely forgotten the incident, whereas others in the family remembered it well.Regretting the fact that a young student had recently dropped out of college, for no particular reason, except that he had got bored, another member of the family tactlessly reminded everybody that the boy's dad had done similarly during his own student years, making the unfortunate remark that, \"it obviously runs in the family\".  Nobody else remembered it like she did and quickly corrected her, saying that the boy's father had simply dropped a subject, not dropped out altogether. Still, she was sure she had got it right.Journeys down memory lane can be full of potholes tripping up the unwary traveller. There were many such potholes, I landed in one or two myself. And I had been so certain of my facts, fondly held on to for years and years. I'm still not altogether sure that my memories aren't the only true ones.Hardest to bear are the hurts which arise out of misunderstandings which have never been cleared up and which get aired, in a moment of horribly destructive, so-called 'truth-telling'; these can rip the pleasantest family gatherings to shreds. We know that our memory can play tricks on us, there are too many family histories which are fiercely disputed by the various members and rifts might never be healed.Perhaps we shouldn't be too certain that our own version of the past is the only valid one and simply accept that any situation is subject to a variety of interpretations. After all, somebody very wise said \"it's all a matter of perception\"."},

{"title": "Not Good Enough", "date": "Thursday 14 April 2011", "text": "Poster Campaign for Domestic Abuse Awareness- ScotlandLast night I didn't sleep. I have no explanation why I didn't; at three am I took two sleeping pills, at four am I got up for the third time and fetched a large glass of sherry and a packet of sickly sweet hazelnut cream biscuits upstairs, then sat on the edge of my bed and alternately took a drink of sherry, ate a biscuit, took another drink, and another biscuit, and on and on,  until the drink was finished and the packet of biscuits half empty and I felt sick and sickened at the same time. I had already read a soporific self-help text, checked my emails - at three in the morning, for heaven's sake - and scratched the itchy insect bites on my legs. Nothing helped.I've had a very good week, loaded up on sunshine, saw lots of friendly faces and nourished my soul. I had also had some fantastic comments on several recent posts which did my delicate and slightly bruised ego a lot of good, convincing me that I should continue blogging. I even had emails from people I didn't  know existed, who neither follow nor comment, but still felt called upon to tell me how much they enjoyed reading my blog.Yesterday afternoon, walking past her house with Benno,  I met a neighbour  pruning some dead growth in her front garden. She and her husband read blogs all the time as part of their professional duties, I think. The couple read my blog and have always been very complimentary about it; I can trust them not to gossip about it in Valley's End, and I don't feel obliged to change my veiled comments on village life for their sake.I stopped to chat, and Sally once again praised my blog, she smiled sweetly and sincerely and mentioned several entries and what she thought of them. You'd think I would be pleased.  Unfortunately, I feel inclined to trust her judgment and that is where the problem comes in.You see, she couldn't be right, and neither could the other people who have said that they enjoy my blog; in fact, nobody who has a good word to say about anything I do can possibly be right. They simply don't know what they are talking about.This is where it gets hard, very hard indeed, to continue writing this.  I am convinced, and always have been, because I was told by people who knew about these things, that I was Never Good Enough. Nothing I did deserved appreciation and certainly never praise. There was always somebody who would have done so much better than me, who wouldn't have been the same kind of fool, the same imbecile, incompetent, ridiculous child, who was not only a complete idiot but also disobedient, ungrateful and disloyal. That person was my still-born sister, a fantasy being.So, you see, this is where logic comes into it: if I accept the compliments some people misguidedly insist on paying my efforts, in blogland and elsewhere, if I accept that these compliments are sincere, then it follows that much of what I was told as a child, much of what I have come to believe, my core belief, in other words, is wrong. Lauren (my counsellor) and I go over this ground time and time again. It's a circular argument.If I am Good Enough, then 'They', whom I owe obedience, gratitude and loyalty, were wrong. I would have to accept that, knowingly or unknowingly, 'They' were acting abusively, that I was psychologically abused. If I were to accept that 'They' got it wrong, it would automatically prove 'Them' right, that I am indeed disobedient, ungrateful and disloyal. Q.E.D.Which means that I punish myself by sitting on the edge of my bed at four am, eating a packet of biscuits, which is bad for me, and gives me no pleasure at all.The wheel goes on turning.P.S.  Don't take too much notice of this, I am sure I shall feel better tomorrow, after a good night's sleep."},

Lots of inviting sunshine made for a happy disposition and tempted me to spend lots of time walking and gardening; several pleasant social and cultural occasions  added a little spice to my usually quite humdrum existence and blogging became a pleasure again.It all started with another birthday party, a celebration of 90 years of music and adventure. This is Bert, a bassist and tuba player, who even now, at 90, performs with local amateur groups. Bert's always been a bit of a ladies' man; he still has his groupies who collect him at home, carry his instruments for him and take him to the venue in their cars. Several ladies at the party were having a good-natured discussion about their relative rank in the pecking order of Bert's affections.  If this is what 90 can be like, why would anyone be afraid of getting old?The subject for last week's poetry group meeting was 'Quodlibet',  i.e. bring your favourite poems. I always find it difficult to choose a favourite anything, be it film, poem, music, etc. I'm one of these unimaginative people who need to be 'told', who need instructions, guide-lines; given free rein, I dither and find it very hard to make up my mind.On the gloriously sunny morning of the day of the poetry meeting, Benno and I went up into Sowdley Woods, a wild area full of fallen trees, a brook and the small lake it forms at the bottom of the hill, overgrown rhododendron thickets, and an incongruous plantation of giant redwood in the snowdrop wood, which a long dead owner of the small manor house, where John Osborne used to live and which is now owned by the Arvon Foundation, must have thought a suitable addition to an English wood. The manor is used as a writers' retreat and residential  creative writing centre. I'd still not made up my mind  which poems to take in the evening when I found several of the birches in the same plantation above 'The Hurst' (the name of the house) had white sheets of paper attached to them. Surely not warnings that \"Trespassers will be prosecuted\" ? I thought. Far from it. I had found poems pinned to trees! Answers to my prayers! Could anything have been more serendipitous?Gerald Manley Hopkins' 'Inversnaid'. was one of them:It starts:This darksome burn, horseback brown,His rollrock high road roaring down,In coop and in comb the fleece of his foamFlutes and low to the lake falls home.suitable for the place and suitable for me.A last minute concert added to the week's  stand-out nature. Beloved met a friend on his way to fetch the newspaper who asked if we we were going to the concert given by the Mid Wales Chamber Orchestra Soloists in Newtown, over in Wales. We hadn't even heard of it. Tickets were still available, the friend very kindly gave us a lift and we enjoyed a varied and excellently played performance.All that and a wonderful day's gardening to end the week.  Gardener came yesterday and we dug up, divided and replanted many of the overgrown clumps of herbaceous plants like phlox, campanulas, geraniums and several grasses.This morning I took my second cup of breakfast tea out into the garden and admired the fruits of yesterday's labour.  These neat, small clumps of plants will soon shoot up and fill the tidy brown earth around them, lean into each other and jostle for space. I can't wait.\"Spring's messenger in every spotSmiling on all - Forget-me not\"John ClareThese patches of forget-me-nots appear all over the garden at this time of year. Some people barely tolerate them for being self-seeded and slightly vulgar, but I welcome them. They are such friendly and accommodating little plants, their modest pale blue flowers light up dark and bright corners alike and when their day has gone, they give in very graciously and leave without complaint."},
{"title": "I have never understood . . . . .", "date": "Friday 8 April 2011", "text": "Scrabbling around in my currently moribund brain for a blogging topic I came across my friend  Tabor's post of today, which loosely refers to Thursday 13, a collection of themed items to fill a blank spot on a blog. I may not make it to the full 13, but there are some questions that have been puzzling me for ever:I have never understood, why    the ordinary Tom, Dick and Harriet never connect our need for feverish consumption of goods, our mad   use of oil, gas, food, water, and many other of earth's finite resources, with the destruction of our planet? We complain about fuel prices, we eat imported food, we buy flowers grown on another continent, we travel at the drop of a hat, for leisure, pleasure, business and no particular reason at all,  we live in air-conditioned houses, we use water like it's going out of fashion, we buy, and soon discard, all sorts of consumer goods without a second thought.Yet we all profess to be seriously concerned about the life expectancy of planet earth and the human race with it.o-o-o-o    some people see all the evil in their neighbour's yard but never in their own? What causes these blind spots? Self-righteousness? Why has no one invented spectacles for clear thinking? There'll soon be 3-D TVs, why are there no vision-surround viewfinders for the human conscience?o-o-o-o    Benno wags his tail when I go to the bread bin?o-o-o-o    the British drink while standing up? It's so much less safe to fall down in a drunken heap from a great height than simply to collapse, head first, into the ashtray on the table.o-o-o-o    love and lust disappear after the first three years of togetherness? Love may last, but why does this mad first flush, this glorious, breathless, unsuitably demonstrative state of being, this embarrassing, hand-holding, weak-kneed, (stop it, Friko!) stomach-churning, physical need for the object of one's lust turn into a mild, \"ok then\", \"what, again ?\",  \"I'd rather have a cup of tea\", sort of togetherness?o-o-o-o    Americans think that I must know their cousin Elliot in Edinburgh because I live in the UK?o-o-o-o    some  religions  consider randomly selected foods to be taboo and inherently sinful, and alcoholic drink to be the devil's brew. Pork, beef, shellfish, game, rabbit and many more are forbidden in at least one religion somewhere in the world. Even coffee and tea and other stimulants do not escape prohibition somewhere. Where's the logic in that?o-o-o-o    some people risk their lives and the lives of others in the selfish pursuit of dangerous adventures, like the solo circumnavigation of  the globe in a cockle shell, or climbing hazardous mountains in inclement weather and totally unsuitable clothing. Whoever feels drawn to such heroics should understand that any rescue attempts when things go wrong, as they frequently do, will not be undertaken when others have to risk their life to carry them out. At the very least, the rescued should bear the full costs of the rescue mission which too often depends on voluntary contributions.o-o-o-o    so many plants self-seed profusely but never come true from seed. If it grows out of your seed, it looks like you, right? Wrong.o-o-o-o    there is at least one colourful sock which sneaks into a white wash and turns everything a lurid orange.Why has no one invented a simple tool to detect an alien presence in the laundry basket before the washing machine is loaded.o-o-o-o    there are people for whom home is the last place they want to be. I know them, they spend as little time as possible there. Are they afraid they might meet themselves there?o-o-o-o    politicians, no matter how idealistic and honest they start out - there are some - succumb to the general malaise of subterfuge, evasion, wishful thinking and ignoring the electorate's wishes the moment they become part of the political machine. Very soon expediency becomes the watchword.o-o-o-oand finally,    there are so many people who simply don't see the beauty of the world surrounding us, the kindness and generosity of the average person, the friendliness of our neighbour, the willingness to help, the smiles and the open arms reaching out to us.  Why gratitude for the small gifts we receive daily is usually so far from our thoughts, why complaints and moans come far more easily than simple thankyous; why we don't realise that the pace of modern life, the frantic pursuit of happiness, by which we too often mean worldly goods,  is not conducive to bringing us peace of mind and appreciation of simple pleasures."},

True, it was raining today and the skies were of that unfriendly grey which lowers the spirits and gives rise to grumbling, but we have had some wonderful late March and early April sunshine. Besides, mild rain makes my garden grow!When I saw a recent post at  Ellen's blog  showing pictures of a wisteria already past its prime, roses and a mock orange in full bloom, I felt glad to live in England, where the seasons come in slowly, one after the other, taking their time unfolding, lingering over each new arrival and spreading the glorious riches of nature for all to savour. Each flower has its moment of triumph in the sun, there is room and time to spare; only in high summer do they jostle each other for attention.Even winter has its upside. The intricate patterns of the bare branches of trees and colourful stems of shrubs dramatise a drab world which for several years lately has turned brilliant, sparkling white and glittering, jewel-like ice for weeks on end.Let May and June welcome the spectacular hanging chains of wisteria on house fronts, give the mock orange time in June and July to spray its intoxicating perfume and as for roses, well, give the queen of the garden four  or five months to dazzle the senses, all the time from first flowering in early June to October. In a good year I have had the last roses bloom into December. At the moment spring flowers are the stars of the show, among otherswhite anemoniestiny blue grape hyacinthsand a host of daffodils nodding in the breeze.Give me my English seasons, weather included.

{"title": "Well, you would say that, wouldn't you,", "date": "Sunday 3 April 2011", "text": "all of you being bloggers. You and I could hardly say that blogging is a waste of time, could we?Thank you, everybody, for your generous and intelligent comments to the previous post. I value your opinion;  all of you basically advised me to leave the class, seeing how I felt about it.So why did I not do that earlier? Teacher several times made fun of me and my need for following the rules of grammar,  for wanting prepositions and tenses used correctly.  Ok, this may be slightly outlandish nowadays, but then 'outlandish' is exactly what I am, having learnt English as a foreign language, by rote and by rule, from an early age onwards.  She even called me a 'professional foreigner' once.I think I stuck it out because of conditioning in childhood, which this particular teacher managed to tap into. (She also reminded me of my mother) I went to school at a time when children were expected to behave themselves, to respect their elders and betters, before the time when the freedom of individual expression became the magic formula, the great be-all-and-end-all of education. In my day the omniscience of teachers was not questioned, we did, mostly, as we were told. I believe that my discomfort in the creative writing class arose from the gulf between my upbringing and my distrust of the tuition, apart from teacher's inclination to become personal when she found her view challenged.The days of blind obedience to those in authority are over, I am glad to say, but I still feel that many of us  have  discarded respect for others at the same time. Has the pendulum swung too far? I hear that there are schools where teachers fear children and some parents, where children are not only insolent but physically aggressive.Are there still professions which demand the same automatic respect they once did? Doctors, the clergy, teachers, bank managers, the legal profession, politicians, for instance, do we still see them as people to look up to? Beloved and I belong to the class of rogues and vagabonds; however, when representatives of the previously mentioned professions sit round my dinner table I find they boil their breakfast egg in the same water and for as long as I do.Automatic respect for the sake of one's calling, is it a thing of the past?"},
{"title": "\"Blogging Is Dust\"", "date": "Friday 1 April 2011", "text": "\"it's a waste of time, an exercise in futility, indulged in when the blogger hasn't anything better to do\".Or so my creative writing teacher says. We are not friends.If anyone could do with this wonderfully stimulating community of friends, she could. Living in 'Long-Suffering-in-the-Mud\", a hamlet of a dozen farm cottages and one large farm, with neither pub nor shop,  housebound with three small children, with a neighbour in the immediately attached cottage who makes it her business to measure, to the inch, where cars visiting the teacher's cottage park - on an otherwise completely empty and car-free muddy country lane - you'd think she'd greet the benefits of modern communication with a grateful tear in her eye.Not so. I made the mistake of telling her that I blog and called the wrath of the scorned woman down upon my innocent head. Teacher sees herself as a bit of a poet. Not just a bit, but a published poet, with no less than three publishing contracts. All I needed to do was to check out Amazon or Virago, she said, and I'd find her. I checked, no teacher. That may be entirely due to my lack of tracking expertise; when I asked for enlightenment in the form of an url, I got no reply.Teacher has, in the past, had a blog herself. She tried it for a while and found that she did little else but bitch and moan, she said. She found that friends who had blogs used them to fill in the gaps between 'proper' writing jobs. (Personally, I think trying to keep a blog going with interesting posts, is no mean feat. I should know.)  She also found that criticism was unwanted, that blogging is primarily for 'stroking' egos.  I concede, she may have a point there, but nobody forces anyone to pour lavish praise on blogs they don't really value. Actually, that would indeed be a silly waste of time and pretty pointless.When I tried to defend writing a blog, mentioning some of the interesting people I have 'met' this way, she threw them straight back at me: \"what are you doing here then, if you have access to and communicate with people whose writing you value so highly?\" she asked, thereby making it personal.Now I have to tell you, what \"Here\" in this context means: 'Here' is a kitchen in this small cottage in Long-Suffering-In-The-Mud, a kitchen table big enough for four students - three ladies well into middle-age and an elderly gent, who is also teacher's father - and a cat walking all over the table. This being rural England, you have to have a tea break in the two-hour session; tea breaks and gossip go together, so, taking into consideration a delayed start due to teacher having to finish her make-up, finish kneading bread rolls for dad or finishing off a conversation with a friend, who is not a member of the class, 'Here' means a very unprofessional total of max. one hour twenty minutes concentrated work.I could forgive all that quite easily, we are in the sticks here with few options open; perhaps she was a professional who has fallen on hard times and is trying to make ends meet.  But this was not the only occasion I felt attacked personally - not my work, me - and I had already begun to feel uncomfortable on previous occasions. She was so vehement about blogging being 'dust' that she managed not only to knock my confidence but also make me question the pleasure I get from blogging.For the past two weeks I have spent far less time online than I usually do, have not visited as many blogs and posted fewer posts than before. You may not believe this, but Friko's confidence is a very delicate plant, easily damaged and it has taken me some time to prop it up again.I have decided to keep on blogging for as long as I enjoy it and give up this particular class instead. The Easter holidays are about to start and I shan't go back for the new term."},

Mitchell's Fold is a stone circle, a focus of many legends, set in dramatic moorland on Stapeley Hill; the area is a large and important remnant of common land, where all men had the right to graze their animals; today the stones and the area are maintained and cared for by English Heritage. Even on a misty day in March you can get an idea of the wide open spaces, where  sounds are as important as sights. Prehistoric man probably felt his heart uplifted as much as I do by the trilling of skylarks, the bubbling of curlews and the croak of the ravens. Up here, listening to the silence and the calls of the wild provides solace for the spirit too often and persistently beset by the noise of modern life.It is difficult to photograph the fifteen remaining uprights out of the original thirty, millennia of unfettered wind and rain have worn them down to stumps, with only a few standing proudly erect. The circle measures 23 m in diameter. Why these circles were built, nobody knows for certain, but they were probably of religious and astronomical significance.The site and the surrounding hills are exhilarating walking, with splendid views to the west, and you are never far from ancient history. There are burial sites up here, barrows and tumuli - there are remains of a tumulus no more than 20 m away from the circle itself;  nearby is  Cwm Mawr or Hyssington Axe Factory, where Bronze Age man quarried a distinctive volcanic rock which he worked into axes.Legend has it that a cow was enfolded in the stone circle, destined forever to give a pail of milk to all who asked for it. One day the wicked witch Mitchell milked it into a sieve, whereupon the cow disappeared and the witch was turned into a pillar of stone. The stone remains to this day, much worn, alas, but still imprisoning the spirit of the witch.This is instalment No 3 in an occasional series of posts on the hidden beauties of the South Shropshire Hills on the border between England and Wales in the wider context of That's My World."},

For those of you who live in countries where you can rely on your annual quota of sunshine this probably means nothing, but for the inhabitants of the South Shropshire Hills, where mist, rain and grey skies seemingly hang about forever, it is the difference between slouching from place to place, head down in misery and a spring in the step and a smile for everyone.So, who am I to moan.I live in a part of the world which is not shaken by earthquakes, which suffers no tsunamis, which does not groan under the heel of a tyrant; water and food are plentiful,  I have a house to live in, a roof over my head. My loved ones are safe,  we need not cower and hide from bombs or guns, we can speak our mind freely. If we don't like our government - and who ever does? - we simply say so at an election, where we can freely exercise our civic right, without let or hindrance. Many of us take this right so much for granted that we ignore it, we hardly even bother to go to the polls. We make it a national hobby to complain about the weather, we moan about the rain, we say \"They\" should stop rivers bursting their banks and then we go and build houses on floodplains.All we need to do is look around us and see, really take in, what is happening in so many parts of the world at the moment, the suffering of innocents; read Anne Thomas' blog from Sendai, about the quiet dignity of the people of Japan and the truly inspirational way they are dealing with the greatest catastrophe the country has suffered since WWII; watch the pictures from North Africa and hear the voices of doctors and other medical staff who are working under impossible conditions in shelled and damaged hospitals.We have so much to be thankful for.I am not really one for homilies and wagging forefingers; I do my share of moaning and complaining; but for me the mood of the moment is one of gratitude and humility; I would urge a spirit of compassion on all of us and for all of us to let this spirit guide us to do all we can, be it ever so little, to help alleviate the suffering of the innocents."},

He and  Grane, his horse, had overcome many perils, ridden through desert and swamp, wrestled crocodiles and bears, wild men and loose women. Now the journey was almost over. Fast as a bird, Grane carried the hero towards the distant mountains of Hindar. But still the dangers had not ended. They came to Hindarfjall, a terrifying waterfall cascading from a great wound in the side of the earth. Hero and horse, as one, flew on, riding day and night to overcome the monstrous waters, until the naked rocks of Hindar appeared before them in a mist, red as fire.There, on the highest mountain, atop the bare rock, lay Brunhild, in deep sleep, banished by Odin to this forbidding fastness for disobedience, condemned to sleep until the bravest knight on earth, risking his life in the quest, should wake her.Brunhild lay, in full armour, encircled by gold-shimmering shields, surrounded by a ring of blazing fire; gigantic flames spread a wall of unbreachable heat. The roaring inferno could be heard from mountaintop to mountaintop.Grane  trembled. Man and horse made one last supreme effort, and took a mighty leap through the flames. Exhausted by their heroic struggles and the labours of many hazardous weeks, man and beast came to rest in front of Brunhild.Sigurd saw the sleeping Brunhild and fell in love with her. Her armour encased her like a second skin; Sigurd, unable to free her with his hands, drew his faithful sword, Gram, which cut through plate, leather and chain like a knife through butter.Brunhild awoke, the flames died down and Sigurd tenderly lifted her to her feet. Odin’s spell was broken, Brunhild was free.She raised her head and gazed at the knight who had rescued her from a deep sleep lasting an eternity, a sentence she herself had called down upon her head.“You took your time”, she said, “ what kept you?”"},

Or perhaps her thin body would allow  unhindered passage through. She smiles a watery old woman’s smile, her manners are still intact. “Thank you for coming”, she quavers, “ I’m afraid I can’t get up, I don’t have enough blood to the brain, I get dizzy. I have been told that I must stay in this chair.” First things first, ill-health is a very important topic at these gatherings.I can hardly believe that this is the same woman who, ten years ago, ‘volunteered me’ to serve on a very difficult and unpleasant committee and, even more astounding, that I let her bully me into accepting the office.“Happy Birthday, my dear”, I say, bending over her, receiving and returning a delicate embrace.  “Glad to see you looking so well”, I lie and kiss her papery yellow cheek. Eighty-five is not an extreme age in these parts, but some weather less well than others.As I look around I recognize many other faces, nod to them and exchange “how are yous”. If you can’t see their spouse, you ask after his/her well-being too. Unless you are quick at turning and politely smiling at the next in line you will receive up-to-the-minute information on the reason why the other half couldn’t be here. “He’s had the operation, but his knee is still bothering him, he finds standing very difficult.” I know what she means. “I’m sorry to hear that, do give him my love, won’t you.”Platters and platitudes are being handed round in equal measure. I help myself to a mini meatball and choke on the spiciness. I search the area round my feet for a sign of the small white terrier whom I caught earlier stealing a cocktail sausage, including stick, from a plate left on the lower shelf of a serving table. He is back, his wet black nose exploring other delicacies. Shooing him away, and lifting the plates out of his reach, I surreptitiously drop my spicy meatball. Now it’s his turn to cough and splutter.I‘ve done the required circuit of the room and find a space on the sofa next to two ladies in animated conversation. With a bright smile I interrupt them, they turn to me and very soon we are discussing therapidly ageing population of Valley’s End and the consequences this has for the social life of the village. “Social life used to be so much livelier”, we say; “when we first came here  - most of us at this gathering are incomers - there were parties all the time, we were always entertaining or being entertained; remember those lovely concerts we had in the summer ?” We remember them well.  “Of course, we are all so much older now and, frankly, I don’t have the energy”, my neighbour on the sofa says. We decide there and then that we must do something, that we must organize a party where everyone invited is asked to bring a plate and a bottle. The ladies look to me expectantly. Our house and garden are of generous size and I have had many such parties in the past. “Of course”, I say hastily, “winter has been so awful this year, the roads were so bad, nobody thought to do very much. Besides, these endless grey skies hanging over us these past two weeks have made everybody feel miserable and depressed”. The danger is not over yet, so I excuse myself and make for the dining room. I have two major dinner parties planned during the next two weeks and can’t possibly have a bring-a-plate event as well.I make a mental note to review the situation later on, in April or May maybe.The dining room is witnessing important business, by the look of things. Six or seven men are standing in a circle in the middle of the room, their faces serious, earnestly plotting parish politics. All of them have reached the end of long years of dedicated service; they find it hard to relinquish the reins and let younger men take over. As they are all conservative in outlook and political preference, they might be discussing matters of national concern. The cabal breaks up as I enter; I seem to have a knack today for getting in the way of established conversations. They know that I am one of these wishy-washy liberals, my opinions are definitely the wrong sort here; besides, these are gentlemen of a bygone age, serious talk must be kept away from ‘ladies’. The group breaks up, several leave the room to mingle.  Others turn to me politely. Well-bred, old-world charm takes over until the ensuing flirtatious banter makes my teeth itch and I welcome the attention of a pompous old chap, an ex army colonel, who has heard that I mess about on this internet business and write stuff for other people to read. “What do you want to do that for”, he barks, “and what have you got to say anyway? That you go for walks with the dog?”  “Something like that”, I reply. “Does anybody want to read that sort of thing?” He isn’t finished with me yet. “Oh, one or two”, I say. “Harrumph, what a lot of nonsense, if you ask me”. He is probably too polite to tell me what he really thinks. I beam my brightest smile at him. His eyes narrow and frown, he is clearly cross with me and a little unnerved.I move on into the kitchen where I just catch the hosts’ daughter, granddaughter and niece discussing family matters; another member of the family recently confided to me that problems over an inheritance had caused bad feelings; the slightly forced smiles greeting me tell me that I am interrupting unresolved mild hostilities. Wrong place, wrong moment, again. I am not going to get it right today.I give up, put my empty glass on the kitchen table and leave the room. At any rate, the party is almost over. I thank the hostess, hug her good-bye, wave to everybody else and make for the door. “Eleven to One” means eleven-thirty to one-thirty, it’s one-forty now and we can go. On the way out I see the one person with whom I would have loved to have a longer chat, catch her eye and we stand in the open door, blocking the way, and make a quick date for coffee.If we discuss the party at all, we will say how nice it was to see everybody again and how well the hostess looked, considering."},

When we first came to live here and told people in London that we were moving to the South Shropshire Hills area, most of them asked: \"Where's that near then?\" Although I don't particularly want great hordes of people to come and join us, it would be nice to spread a little envy at our good fortune. I hope that That's My World will help me to do that now and again. Although the new issue appears every Tuesday, there are one or two reasons why my contribution will not appear until Wednesdays. I hope they will let me join them, nevertheless.To whet your appetite, let me show you a few sights of the ancient town of Ludlow, our nearest town of any size, to begin with.The place name Ludlow, then spelt 'Ludelaue', is first recorded in 1138. It means 'hlaw' or 'low', i.e. hill or mound, beside the 'loud waters', i.e. rapids. 'Hill' may refer to the 'hill within a valley' on which Ludlow stands, or to a tumulus or burial ground.Lower Corve StreetBroad StreetThe Castle and Dinham Bridge over the River TemeThe Feathers Hotel (from a postcard)Mill Street - The Wheatsheaf Inn and Town WallThe Market Place with the Tower of St Lawrence's Parish ChurchAnd here is where other people are showing off their world."},

{"title": "Madam, can you cook?", "date": "Friday 11 March 2011", "text": "Butcher's shops are wonderful places to do a spot of people-watching. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, click off now.We buy our meat from a very grand butcher's; the shop itself isn't grand, it looks pretty ordinary, but it sells mainly free-range, outdoor reared, organic and, in the case of pork and beef, many varieties of rare breed  meat. It makes you feel less guilty when you know that the animals had a reasonably happy existence while they were alive. They also taste better after death.The butcher's shop is famous for miles around, many of our local restaurants buy their meat there and are proud to proclaim the fact.We often recognise other customers; people stand in a long line on Fridays and Saturdays waiting to be served and while you wait you exchange comments on cookery, the kind of meat you hope to buy and what you are going to do with it.  It's a water cooler kind of place where people meet to discuss recipes rather than last night's TV.The unusual thing is that many of the customers are men, big burly, red-faced, weather-beaten chaps, farmers and outdoor workers, not at all the  type you would associate with cooking, not a bit like the precious, full-of-and-up-themselves TV chefs, who faff around with fancy ingredients, producing airy-fairy bits of foamy fluff and nonsense.So when this new women customer appeared, driving up in a brand-spanking new Land Rover which had never seen a muddy track let alone driven up one,  we all perked up.\"Yes, madam\", said one of the butchers serving, \"what can I do for you?\"\"Erm, I'd like some meat?\" Not a good start.\"Yes, madam, what would you like.\"\"Well, we are having this party tomorrow, some people are coming down from London and I'd like to give them a Sunday roast\". A bit better already.\"A nice bit of roast beef, Madam, or lamb perhaps?\". The butcher was all friendliness.'Yes, that would be nice\", she said. Back to square one.The butcher has been serving long enough to recognise a duffer. He turned and went into the cold store and came back with a magnificent rolled joint, nearly as long as his arm from shoulder to wrist. We gasped in admiration and envy. She was going to have first choice.\"Oh yes\", she said, \"that looks lovely, I'll have that, please.\"\"Erm, madam, how many people will you be entertaining?\"\"There should be eight of us\", she replied.The butcher laid the joint on the block and proceeded to cut it, ending up with a larger and a smaller piece.  Madam pointed to the large one.\"Are you sure, madam\", butcher is still friendliness and helpfulness personified. \"This piece will feed about fourteen people. I would suggest you have this piece\", pointing to the smaller one.'O, very well, if you think so\".  All this time everybody else stood transfixed; nobody stared directly, sniggers were kept discreetly behind raised hands, eye contact was carefully avoided, but no other transactions took place.Butcher wrapped the meat, handed it over, madam went to pay.She had nearly reached the door on her way out, when she hesitated.\"Erm, excuse me, what do you think ? How does one cook . . . . . . . . . . .?\"A great sigh of joy went up. That was exactly the question we had all been waiting for.Butcher obliged and the rest of us all went back to minding our own business."},
{"title": "Searching for Spring", "date": "Wednesday 9 March 2011", "text": "Friko's Manor end-onLeaving the house to go for a walk in search of signs of Spring the omens are not altogether favourable. Dark clouds have been brewing all day, the river acts as a funnel for the sharp wind, aiming it directly at the garden and pushing tree branches eastwards. The weathermen promised that there will be no rain, perhaps the wind won't allow the heavens to discharge their load over Valley's End.The River from the Bridge by the FordStepping down the bank from the garden I can see the river shivering in its bed, mirroring the slate-grey cloud. Reflections of thin, leafless trees fracture the flow.\"The Bar is Open\". Two opportunistic lambs assess the possibilities.But new life is all around, lambs are bleating in the fields, on the look-out for a free helping from another lamb's mother; the grass still growing sparse. There is need for farmers to augment the feed now that the ewes are grazing for two and three at at a time.A day or two of warmth and these daffodils will split their hoods and open.At this time of year daffodils grow everywhere; we are close to the Welsh border here and the Welsh have a great fondness for them. It won't be long now before the trumpets open and blast their bright yellow song from every verge, lane, hedgerow and roadside. There are so many thousands of them everywhere that eventually they will become an unsightly, aggressive, intrusive spectacle; I will wish them gone, dead, and their rotting leaves out of sight before long, but for now I can't wait for their bright lanterns to lighten the dark days. I will pick great bunches of them and bring them into the house. They grow in my garden too although gardener and I have been digging the spreading clumps up and 'distributing' them to bare areas on banks close to the house, but outside the garden. It is possible to have too much of a good thing. Daffodils have  a lingering, messy death, that's their main drawback. And if you want the bulbs to retain enough strength to flower again next year, do not cut the leaves off before they are fully rotted.Another welcome sign are the golden leaves of the weeping willow which has its feet permanently washed by the flow of the river.  Red and golden dogwoods grow on the bank. Soon the leaves on willow and shrubs will turn green, providing shade for trout and a family of otters who play here very early in the morning. March is the time for White Rock Cress to start flowering in rockeries. It is a very enthusiastic little plant, willing to escape from gardens the minute the gardener takes his eye off. Tumbling over walls and rocks it is a very pretty sight, flowering profusely and with great abandon wherever it can find a foothold. This clump is a garden escapee, flowering in a hedge which has been allowed to choke a beautiful ancient stone wall. Arabis (its botanical name) is welcome to become a permanent resident here, as far as I am concerned.Not a garden escapee, but a plant very firmly kept tethered inside my boundaries: the beautiful Lenten Rose, or Hellebore. This is a particularly pretty specimen. The flowers are delicate and nod downwards, hardly visible from above. Hellebores are amongst  the treasures of the garden which demand close attention and admiration. I have propped this flowerhead up so that I could bring the camera close from above.Hellebores will self-seed profusely and produce many new seedlings. Unfortunately, they rarely come true from seed and even the most unusual plant will rejoin its common, usually pale purple, brethren."},
{"title": "Count Drackie and the Character Forming Qualities of Garlic", "date": "Monday 7 March 2011", "text": "WILLOW'S MAGPIE No. 56Count Dracula of Transylvania, Drackie to his friends, had had great fun tormenting his English visitor, the solicitor John Harker. Harker had given him plenty of legal advice regarding a proposed purchase of land over the border in Bukovina and was becoming a bore. Drackie wanted to visit England but for some reason Harker was totally opposed to the idea. He said it had something to do with Drackie’s best lady friends, also known as the ‘Brides of Dracula’ and Drackie’s habit of spending the night over a flagon or two of wholesome Dragon’s Blood. Drackie had had to lock Harker in his room for his own safety. There was also the question of Harker’s intended, the insipid Mina, who insisted that she should join Harker and fetch him home to England.Drackie took one look at her; usually very fond of the ladies, he shuddered at the thought of nibbling her neck amorously, too bloodless by half, these English women. He much preferred the buxom, lively gypsy girls he employed in his castle. The castle was another reason he wanted to go off on a visit to England; the place was a crumbling ruin, falling to bits while he watched. It was high time he found himself one of these English builders who advertised themselves as specialist renovators and refurbishers of ancient monuments. A spot of interior decorating wouldn’t go amiss either.Harker’s objections notwithstanding, Drackie took passage on the Demeter which was sailing to Whitby. He took a box of his favourite silver sand and earth; both were needed to acquaint English workmen with the kind of material they'd find in Transylvania.Once in England, Drackie made his way to a group of friends of Harker’s and a couple of girls. One of the girls, Lucy, was no better than she should be, if I tell you that she was keeping three men dangling after her, you’ll understand what I’m saying. Drackie had a go too, they soon hit it off and Drackie was up to his old tricks, imbibing merrily. The other chaps were very jealous, as you can imagine and planned to do away with Drackie once and for all.To this end they hired a Dutch chap, Van Helsing, who had form and knew all about assassination. In order to lull Drackie into a false sense of security they invited him to dinner at Quincey’s, an American chap, who was one of the conspirators. Van Helsing suggested the menu and they agreed to feed Drackie on mushrooms in garlic butter, garlic chicken and red onion marmalade, and for dessert a delicious garlic-cranberry-orange ice cream. A very fine old Burgundy was poured with a lavish hand. Candles flickered, a fire burnt in the deep grate and bouquets of flowers, artfully arranged and tied to polished, sharpened stakes stood in tall vases.Drackie ate and drank like never before. He was amazed at the flavours he was experiencing, the ambience of the room knocked him for six. He looked round admiringly, taking it all in avidly. Exactly this is how he saw his castle, he must find out who had been the guiding hand behind this lavish décor. Hang the expense, he must have the finest workmen and take them to Transylvania.He sucked on a garlic clove. As the succulent flesh melted in his mouth, his whole being mellowed. One by one, he gazed at his fellow diners. His throat constricted and his eyes misted over. A single tear ran down his cheek, try as he might to control it.“My dear friends,” he croaked, “ my heart is heavy with remorse. Forgive me for treating you and your hospitality with disdain. Never again will I hurt your feelings, nay, the feelings of any man, woman or child. You have shown me such kindness, such generosity of spirit, that my shame overwhelms me. Henceforth it shall be my one desire to emulate you and do all in my power to take your civilising influence and apply it to every walk of life in my poor, backward country.”When Drackie finished his speech, the conspirators looked at each other.Van Helsing spoke. “Damn”, he said, “now what”."},
{"title": "Loneliness", "date": "Friday 4 March 2011", "text": "Abstract Crowds moblog.netMy life is spent in perpetual alternation between two rhythms, the rhythm of attracting people for fear I may be lonely and the rhythm of trying to get rid of them because I know I am bored.C.E.M. JoadIn the midst of a big crowd, I felt very lonely last night.A coach party left Valley's End at 6.30 pm to attend a performance of the Russian State Ballet of Siberia's Romeo and Juliet. I have mentioned me and coach parties before; this trip was relatively pleasant because I sat next to another woman on her own who was as happy to be silent for most of the journey as I was. We exchanged pleasantries at relaxed intervals, but most of the time were content to think our own thoughts and look out at the gathering gloom.The rather bizarre performance was not one I would highly recommend; I felt no emotion apart from a slight irritation at the overly energetic dancing and the poor playing.But it’s not the ballet itself I want to talk about.Several bloggers have used the oxymoron ‘gregarious loner’ which is what I would say describes me too, although the term doesn’t really exist, of course. The theatre was sold out, there were other coach parties present as well as audience members who still manage to go to such venues under their own steam. The place was heaving, animated groups standing around, queuing three deep at the two bars, a happy bustling hum in the air. All the things I love about theatres.And then there was me.I knew most of my fellow coach party travellers and could easily have joined one of their little groups; except I couldn’t bring myself to do so. I had been listening to the subdued chatter around me on the coach; I lack the gossip gene, I would have been unable to make any contribution or pretend an interest in what was being said. When I am on my own, I adopt the observer mode. Normally, I would have stood somewhere on the fringes of the milling crowd, glass in hand, and watched, picked up a snippet here and there and felt only very mildly conspicuous by my obvious air of being an outsider.Last night I felt decidedly lonely. It was not a good feeling. The crowds were too dense for moving about easily. For a few minutes I joined the husband of a couple both of whom I know well and like; when she returned from the bar they were quickly recognised by former acquaintances, and there I was, alone again. In the end I fled back to my seat.Beloved more and more opts to stay at home. His arthritis makes walking, standing around for a long time or sitting in a cramped seat very painful; to get him to accompany me, the occasion has to be worth the effort. He’s played Romeo and Juliet so many times himself that he’d have been very cross about the ‘squawking and honking’ of the orchestra.For twenty five very happy years we have thrown ourselves into a busy cultural and social life as a couple. Before I knew him, solitude was a reasonably happy state of being; besides, bringing up children and working for a living left little time for anything else.  I enjoy solitude, which means that loneliness should be easily conquerable. But this intense feeling of loneliness is very  different.My social graces are well developed, in spite of difficulty with mundane gossip. I know I am a popular guest and enjoy having people at my house too. So what makes crowds so different?How am I going to overcome this inability to join in? Should I bother? Is it worth it? For weeks now there has been this black cloud of depression hanging over me. It is as if I am mourning something indefinable, something that hasn’t happened yet.Soon I will have to go to many more places on my own, including going on holiday. The prospect is anything but cheering."},

There wasn't much to do, except lie around and argue about which of them was the more useful, more important, more widely travelled, and allround champion. \"You're no better than me\", said the orange, who thought that she'd win easily, being very fruity and full of herself. \"In fact, I think I have the advantage over you because I can be peeled and eaten fresh, straight from the tree, whereas you are a sour, acidy little thing nobody in their right mind would want to eat raw. Ever heard the expression 'sucking on a lemon' ? That tells you all you need to know, doesn't it?\"The lemon was hurt and thought hard and long. True, nobody had ever complimented him on his gorgeous taste, but he was bright and shiny, like sunlight at its most intense. That must count for something.When he mentioned that, the orange laughed. \"My sunlight is hotter than yours, an orange sun burns brighter than a yellow sun\". \"We both come from the Far East, we have both been around since before the Crusades, we are both called citrus, so you can't trump me that way\", the orange continued. \"Besides, I can not only be eaten raw but I also make delicious juice, jelly, conserves, marmalade, syrup and salad\".The lemon cheered up when he heard that.  Not only could he become everything the orange had claimed for herself,  - well, maybe nobody really wanted to eat him in a salad except as part of the vinaigrette, but, hey, when it came to food, he definitely had the necessary zest, and to spare.\"I'll have you know, you pathetic, useless little upstart, that I have been used by the greatest chefs in history\", he bragged, \"let me remind you of chicken with lemon, fresh and preserved, duck with lemon, every kind of fish with lemon, lemon meringue pie, lemon tart, lemon drizzle cake.\" He was on a roll now.\"And how about every bit of me, from zest to juice, top to toe, in marinades, stuffings, sorbets, butters, creams, custards and curds. The orange was silent; there was duck and orange, of course, and orange curd; but she was unlikely to be used in quite as many dishes as the lemon obviously was. Both their skins were turned into candied peel, there was no point mentioning that.The lemon had won the argument. There was nothing for it, the honourable thing to do was to admit defeat, and commit hara-kiri. They'd both be disembowelled soon enough anyway.As  a member of the blood orange family her death stained fruit bowl, the instrument she'd used and the lemon itself the colour of blood."},
{"title": "Fashion", "date": "Monday 28 February 2011", "text": "Marie AntoinetteWhat on earth am I going to wear?Who hasn’t stood in front of a wardrobe bursting with clothes  andexclaimed: “I haven’t got a thing to wear”.It’s Spring, fashion shows in New York, Milan, Paris, London, Berlin make the headlines, shiny magazines and a dazzling array of the latest fashions in the stores tempt us to spend our money. From haute couture on the catwalks topiles of cheap t-shirts in the mass market outlets, clothes are the preoccupation of the moment.Fashion and the drive to adorn ourselves are nothing new. From earliest times mankind has worn jewellery, made up body and face, dressed up. We have records of prehistoric people and tribes in distant jungles, who have never heard of fashion designers, who still felt the need for physical decoration. If fashion were sensible and served purely practical purposes, it wouldn’t be called fashion, it would be called clothing. Actually, I’d even say fashion wouldn’t exist.John Willmot - Earl of RochesterThe way we dress tells us and the world around us who we are. The richer the outfit the heavier the purse that pays for it. You only have to look at paintings of noblemen and –women in history, ostentatious display of fashionable apparel denotes their relative importance; clothes are a status symbol, a visible sign of wealth and position.Fashion is, and always has been, big business. Even Shakespeare advised:Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy ; but not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy, For the apparel oft proclaims the man.In German there is a similar saying: ‘Kleider machen Leute’, ( dress makes the man).Although we have become much less formal about clothes, many of us still spend a lot of time and thought on the way we present ourselves to others. Fashion is like a second skin. Even if we wear nothing but jeans and t-shirt, we still declare our adherence to particular dress codes. Remember punks? Or goths? Tolerance is all, but I still secretly shudder at the sight of them.  I realize that my reaction is silly, all fashion is a kind of theatre, a public display, artificial by definition; we constantly change fashions – I understand new collections come into the shops monthly nowadays.Followers of fashion play with fashions, constantly re-inventing themselves while doing so. There is this wonderful word “fashion victim” for those who must have, and be seen to have, the latest outfits. People suffer for fashion, just think of those heels models and actresses wear. There was a photograph of a group of women of 60 + in the colour magazine of a reputable broadsheet the other day. All the women were wearing the most uncomfortable looking shoes; I cannot imagine that any of them wore those shoes for longer than it took to photograph them. Three hundred years ago it was men who teetered about the courts of Europe on high heels. How sensible of them to give them up.For the life of me I cannot admire and certainly don’t covet those horrendously expensive, huge, bags which are all the rage. Shoes and bag are often worn by the same woman, who constantly reassures us how comfortable she is while tottering precariously on her heels, being weighed down by half a ton of handbag.Personally, I am at  that boring stage of life where comfort is the most pressing concern; I am an out-of-fashion has-been. I enjoy buying clothes, enjoy choosing what I feel suits me and I certainly make an effort not only for special occasions but also for going into town. Living in the country one gets so used to dressing down, throwing on jeans and jumper and gum boots, that getting out of them is a treat which happens not nearly often enough for me. But my special occasion clothes are rarely fashionable, they are more likely to be \"sensible\" and even \"serviceable\", although I much prefer the term \"classic\"."},
{"title": "Introducing The Audience", "date": "Friday 25 February 2011", "text": "Interior of Covent Garden Theater, Londonca. 1808Thomas Rowlandson (1756-1827 British)Mud Gathered From A Scraper  -  Part 2 in an occasional series.Part 1 was an introduction to orchestral MusiciansHow many members of an audience realise that whilst they are looking at and commenting on an orchestra, the players are equally looking at them?  -  and how many people sitting in the front row of the stalls realise just how unintelligent and depressing they appear to those on the platform, or in the pit?If members of the public are dressed informally, they are held to look scruffy, and players resent wearing formal clothes for them. If the audience is immaculate in evening dress, the players blame it for maintaining the convention that makes dinner jackets compulsory.  It is the view of the audience a player has from the impersonal elevation of the platform, before the houselights go down, which determines his opinion that all audiences can be divided into ten categories, regardless of the time, place and programme.The first group, to which of course all readers of this blog belong, is of genuine music-lovers, who listen to the performance, and do their best to understand the music. They do not necessarily sit in the best seats, and may know little about the intricacies of first movement form, but they are the core of the audience, and the only people to whom musicians are always glad to play, however few in number they may be. There is also a type of listener who imagines that he belongs in the first group. He will exchange knowing remarks about the orchestra with his neighbours, and when he recognises a melody, will hum it to himself, in another key. Many members of amateur orchestras belong to this group.Another kind of concert-goer tries to give an impression of being musical by studying the score during the performance. Should he not possess a score, or should he become hopelessly lost, he will shut his eyes, assume an expression of concentrated ecstasy and sway slightly, in time with the music. A fourth category is composed largely of old ladies, who appear to be enjoying a concert intelligently, and who will say, in conversation with a performer, how they love good classical music, like \"In a Monastery Garden\".Soloists are often engaged for concerts on the strength of their following.  The soloist's fans do not bother to hide their boredom during the works preceding the concerto or aria; they are sullen and fidgety and usually leave when their idol has taken his or her last bow. The only point in their favour, from the musicians point of view, is that they make the concert a financial success.Some people buy season tickets for a series of concerts; thus they can hear six programmes for the price of five. They will attend each programme in order to get their money's worth and can easily be recognised by their air of determined enjoyment, which is similar to that seen at a holiday camp during wet weather.Smaller sections of audiences may consist of young lovers who consider the surroundings more conducive to successful courting than the cinema. Then there are school parties, who pay reduced rates; pupils regard the occasion as an outing of much the same sort as a conducted tour of the local gas-works. Parents occasionally bring their families to concerts, hoping to 'do them good'. When the youngest member starts whimpering during the slow movement, they leave their seats in the middle of the row, red-faced, kicking as many shins as they find on their way out.And finally, there is unpunctuality, which is a common failing among all sections of an audience. Although concerts rarely start at the advertised time there is still a core of determined late-comers delaying the performance to the annoyance of players and conductor.In spite of the foregoing, players need their audience, so please come and listen;  they also need to pay the rent."},

Each student was asked to contribute a word, a trigger for a line, twelve in all, the whole to become a poem. We came up with mundane words like time of day, weather, location, an item of clothing, a colour,a feeling,  an allusion to a historical period, a foreign word, a place by water, a relative, a mechanical contrivance, etc. You get the drift.It proved to be quite hard work. I did several drafts, trying to incorporate as many of the set contexts as I could. In the end the class didn't even discuss the poems we had written. For some reason the lecturer didn't find the time. Perhaps she still will, but as I have worked at it, you shall be the beneficiaries of my efforts. This is the second draft:The Visit Mocked by the thin sun of a February morningshe shut the door on the cocoon of her house.She shrugged herself deeper into her coat.Distaste tugged at the corners of her lipsticked mouth.Spiked heels meticulously picking a path,her gleaming car received her, purring pleasure,flattering the tedious road ahead.Bound for the old house by the sea,shrouded in memories of long ago,where faded women kept watch over a pastwhich was hers too,grey clouds overwhelmed the last rays of the morning’s sun.© photo and words USW"},

{"title": "February Miscellany", "date": "Sunday 20 February 2011", "text": "To my mind there is something modest about February, not a month given to ostentatious display of any kind. It is shorter and therefore of lesser stature than other months. February is less cold and dark and forbidding than January and often milder than March in these parts. There are tentative signs of Spring, but these will easily be nipped in the bud by icy March winds. February is a wait-and-see month, even Carnival and Lent don't have their own firmly established place in the order of things, instead they depend on he good graces of Easter.Still, even in-between months have their good points, there are crocuses, hellebores and the first unforced shoots of rhubarb in the garden.Crocuses after rainan almost black hellebore bud openingthe first rhubarb leaf unfurlingIn February the Sun enters the House of Pisces.  The 'Kalendar of Shepheardes' of 1604 has this to say about Pisceans:The man born under Pisces shall be a great goer, a fornicator, a mocker and covetous; he will say one thing and do another. He shall trust in his sapience, he shall have good fortune; he will be a defender of widows and orphans. He shall be fearful on water; he shall soon pass all adversities and live seventy-two years after nature.The woman shall be delicious, familiar in jests, pleasant of courage, fervent, a great drinker.

{"title": "Going Back To The Simple Life  -  Depends What You Mean . .", "date": "Thursday 17 February 2011", "text": "Two of my favourite bloggers, Robert, The Solitary Walker and George at Transit Notes have recently written beautifully about remembering what is really important in life, the joys and pleasures of living a simple life. Whilst I whole-heartedly agree with everything they say, I was reminded just the other day that 'The Simple Life' needs further definition.We were without electricity for a day and night and the mere fact of knowing that we were powerless (no pun intended) to do anything about it threw us into a strange confusion.  When the lights went off at 11.30 at night Beloved was in the shower and I was reading. The sudden transition from what we take for granted, i.e. 'normal life' to pre-industrial age darkness is most discomposing. One really has to make a conscious effort to gather one's wits, before the hunt for torches and candles can begin. There is an immediate feeling of injury, after all, we are 'entitled' to the supply of electricity, 'how dare they cut us off'. Trying to find an explanation for this phenomenon comes next, in our case without success. We went to bed, hoping to wake up to an orderly world, plentiful hot water, light and warmth.In vain, still no power.  Not even the landline telephone worked. Using a mobile phone to ring the power company causes problems, but these can be overcome. You are assured \"Madame, we will do everything in our power to trace the fault\". Luckily, the Aga works on gas and there is a fire in the sitting room. I can heat a pan of water for tea and kitchen and sitting room are warm, the rest of the house turns into a fridge.  Which reminds me, fridge and freezers have been warming up steadily overnight. My freezers are stuffed with garden fruit and vegetables and home-cooked, ready meals, as well as raw food.\"Madame, if you lose the contents of your freezers you will be entitled to compensation\".Compensation? What's the good of that? I do not want to lose the fruits of my labours, my delicious, home-cooked dishes, my garden produce.The sense of dislocation, injustice and injury grows.The day progresses, little gets done, we are engulfed by a strange sense of lethargy.  The men are digging a hole in the village square. \"Sorry, Madame, we are as yet unable to locate the fault\". Four other houses are involved. We commiserate with each other and stand around in the square, shivering in the drizzle, willing the men to find the cause of our misery.When darkness falls, candles are lit. I adore candlelight. When candles are the only source of light,  that pleasure dims. Disconsolately, we sit in the sitting room, nursing a glass of wine and our grievance, paralysed, hopeless, keeping the dog from moving about in case he knocks over a candle and sets the house on fire.You probably think 'what a pair of wimps', but when the TV stand-by click sounded we were suddenly electrified ourselves, jumped up, rushed to freezers and light switches all over the house, blew out the candles, re-set the boiler to get the hot water supply re-started and tested the radiators.Civilisation restored, the relief is great.The simple life is all very well, but as I said at the beginning: \"It all depends on what you mean\"."},

He took me on, although he knew that I might never get better, become an invalid for whatever time I had left, useless and a burden. He took me on and looked after me, bullied me, pampered me, encouraged me, dried my tears,stopped me wallowing in self-pity and made me laugh, held my hand and held me upright.And when the miracle happened and modern medicine and his love took the demon away from me,he stuck to and put up with a cantankerous, selfish, ungrateful, very faulty human being.This poem is for you, Beloved. Thanks for everything.Dear Love, since we might both be dead by nowthrough war, disease, hijack or accidentat least for one day let's not speak of howmuch we have bickered, botched and badly spent.Wouldn't it make much more sense to colludein an affectionate work of camouflage,turning our eyes away from all we've skewed,to the small gains of household bricolage?As our teeth loosen and our faces crag(I shall grow skinnier as you grow paunched,a Laurel to your Hardy, not much brag),I'll think of all our love most sweetly launchedif you will look with favour on these lineswe may still live as tender valentines.Elaine Feinsteinb.

{"title": "B  IS  FOR:  Boyfriends", "date": "Thursday 10 February 2011", "text": "or Beauty, Bliss, Basilisk, Bazaar, Bachelor, Bête Noir,but having got to Bachelor and the black beast,Boyfriendsmight be a suitable theme.For all of her young life, Eva admired boys; they fascinated her, attracted and repulsed her at the same time; she loved their company, the rough games they played, their boastful voices and scabby knees. She followed them like a faithful puppy, always on the margins, never quite allowed to step over the threshold into their disgusting and smelly world. When it suited them, the boys generously invited her to fetch things for them, watch their coats, hold their drinks. There were times when she was called upon to be the referee in a noisy dispute between several boys; usually instigated by a boy who could count on her partiality towards him. She was very happy then.Eva found little girls boring. Standing around in small groups, gossiping, or playing girls' games didn't appeal to her. Girls were, of course,  quite as spiteful and nasty as boys, but she usually failed to grasp the meaning of barbs aimed at her. Where the boys openly ridiculed and bullied her, the girls sneered and whispered amongst themselves. Dimly she sensed the girls' disapproval and envy, because she clearly preferred the boys' company and sheer persistence and dogged determination had gained her a kind of official camp follower status.In spite of that, she belonged in neither camp, and camps they most certainly were. The great gender divide is not a discovery of recent times. Eva was a bit of a lost soul, an outsider, an independent spirit, in her way a fighter for equality before the term and concept were invented.Boys have always liked to throw things. In earliest times, all around the world, 'throwing sticks' or 'throwing clubs' were used to kill animals and maim or kill the enemy. Straight sticks like the stave and javelin and spear, or curved like a boomerang are known to have been used by early humans in all cultures. Plain sticks were followed by slings and catapults, bows and arrows, which were, in essence, the same principle, they just extended the maiming and killing range.Luckily, boys also like to throw a ball, and other less immediately deadly weapons; like a frisbee, for instance.  Eva's disillusionment with boys started because of a frisbee-like missile.The boy she liked best and who occasionally felt flattered enough to accept her homage, i.e., bullied her more than the others did, had invented a throwing game which involved ripping tar paper off a school hut roof and tear it into small pieces. These pieces, a very early frisbee, flew a fair distance. Whoever managed to throw the missile the furthest won the game.Gunther, that was the boy's name, spied Eva loitering, as usual, on the fringes on the end of the boys' part of the playground, looking in his direction.  Foolishly, he threw the fragment of tar paper at her. Perhaps he wanted to frighten her, or show off to the others; it was most probably a totally thoughtless, instinctive action.The tar paper landed smack in the middle of Eva's forehead and stayed there.Eva howled, blood started to flow copiously. Teachers fluttered around helplessly.Nowadays, the fear of litigation would be foremost in a teacher's mind. It wasn't then. One of them took Eva to the first aid box, removed the tar paper, slapped a huge plaster on the large cut,  and sent her home. Alone, without even washing the blood off her face.Eva paid for her early devotion to boys in several ways: because of the teacher's inefficiency, she carried the scar across her forehead for the rest of her life. The Family Doctor could do nothing, the wound should have been cleaned and stitched instantly, he said.But Eva's hurt went far deeper than a mere gash across her forehead; Gunther was so ashamed of himself and, no doubt, frightened by what he had done, that he never again allowed Eva access to any of the boys' games, not even standing on the periphery. The other boys followed his lead.For a short while Eva felt very lonely."},

{"title": "Of Old Labradors, Walkies And Vets.", "date": "Sunday 6 February 2011", "text": "Is nobody going to take me out?Come on, it's not raining. Yet!I am waiting.Benno was 11 years old at Christmas, which is very elderly for a Labrador. His muzzle and chest are sprinkled with grey and the photo shows that he has lost a lower front tooth. Luckily front teeth are not important to him, he never chews his food, just swallows it whole.My dear, sweet, best friend and walking companion is getting old; he still runs and chases sticks and loves long rambles, but jumping stiles and five bar gates is more difficult. In fact, he now graciously waits for me to open gates for him when before he sailed over them, no matter how high.  Walking through gates beside cattle grids was for sissies, he cleared them effortlessly from a standing start. Not anymore. Running up and down the Castle Mound doesn't seem to be as much fun as it used to be, either. When I hurl a stick down the bank, he still gamely fetches it up the very steep slope, but only once or twice; the third time he has a rest half-way up and finds it more interesting to lie down and chew his stick for a while, before he comes up the rest of the hill.Recently, I've noticed several lumps on him, one near a gland in his neck, under the ruff and one on his bottom, which called for visits to the vet. Benno had needles inserted into his neck and fingers poked up his bottom, all very undignified. He is so good that he let it all happen, including a very thorough examination of his spine and legs. The only thing he insists on, on these occasions, is that I stay very close and hold his head and whisper to him.The diagnosis was only mildly disturbing: although he has arthritis in his spine, which is common in old labradors, the lump in his neck is a fat lump and not dangerous. The lump on his bottom hasn't grown any bigger since I first noticed it, which is also good; a definite diagnosis requires a biopsy, which means hospitalisation and anaesthetics. I can't bear the thought of that.I am sticking my head in the sand somewhat here; Benno's predecessor, Boris, had cancer in almost the same place, but he died within a few weeks after I noticed the lump. Benno has survived for much longer already, the lump hasn't grown and he still appears to be a healthy and happy dog.I love that blasted animal.Damn pets, who needs them, they're such a pain."},
{"title": "Frying Pan Moments", "date": "Friday 4 February 2011", "text": "Confession time: Every few weeks I go and talk to a counsellor, who listens and asks questions, mainly \"and how do you feel about that\";  by the end of the session I usually feel that I can face up to another of my skeletons more easily.It all started because I complained to my doctor that my periods of highs and lows,  from great excitement to deep disappointment in four easy steps, were getting more frequent and interfering with my physical health; he suggested that a spot of the 'talking cure' might be better than drastic medical  intervention. He was right. Lauren is an excellent counsellor, she is helping me unearth problems and memories I'd forgotten I'd buried.Frying pan moments came about literally through the use of a frying pan. I am sure that many of you carry around some resentments - if you are like me these fester and become entrenched; every time a similar situation arises, out pops the resentment, poisoning the atmosphere.We have very irregular visitors with whom I have never been on an easy footing, but I cannot get out of the visits. They never stay for more than two or three days, so I should be mature about it and put up with things with a good grace.If only I could.A member of this family likes to eat at his own time; he fries himself some eggs, has some bread with it and makes no fuss about it at all.  There shouldn't be the smallest problem about it. Except that he uses my favourite pan and has no idea that I have been pampering and petting, seasoning and proving this pan for years, it never has the slightest contact with any detergent. He also doesn't know that a pan needs a little grease and a fairly high temperature before you fry anything in it.Weeks before the visit was due I was fretting and muttering and generally getting myself into a state over it. The frying pan became the focus for my resentment: I had managed to get it back to peak condition and now he would come and ruin it again. All you clever clogs out there already know the frying pan was only a symptom of the general malaise, still, it served as the hook to hang my resentment on.So I told Lauren.She didn't laugh. She simply asked a few questions.Do you ever tell them that there are things they do which you resent?Do you ever ask them why they say certain things? (I tend to smile and turn the conversation away from hurtful ground.)As you can't get out of these visits, have you ever laid down ground rules for them?and finally,Have you thought of buying a cheap frying pan just for him and his eggs?So, now I know just how easy it is. Lauren is teaching me, by teasing it out of me, that even when you are resentful of the status quo there are things you can do, quietly, politely but firmly, which make the situation more bearable for you.The funny thing is,  the moment I actually bought that cheap frying pan in the picture above, the problem itself became much less threatening. I was able to remain at ease with myself, if not with the guests.Since then, Lauren's first question when I come for a session is: \"Have there been any frying pan moments since I last saw you?\""},

{"title": "Hansel and Gretel and the Rock Festival", "date": "Tuesday 25 January 2011", "text": "WILLOW'S MAGPIE No. 50Mum and Dad had put their foot down. They were adamant.“You are not going to the disco, and that’s final. I don’t care how many of your friends are allowed to go, you are not going. You are too young, ask us in a year or so and we’ll think again.”Brother and sister were crushed. They’d told their friends that they’d all go together to the rave to be held in a large barn on the outskirts of the local town, just four miles away from their village.The place was called ‘Escape’ and that’s what it appeared to be to the village kids, a place where you could get away from boring adults and their restrictions.Gretel stamped her foot. “I hate them”, she wailed, “they never let us do anything. I bet Hannah’s Mum lets her go.”Hansel scowled. “Serve them right if we just went without their stupid permission.”The seed was sown.The Saturday of the rave was bright and cold. There’d been snow overnight, the countryside looked cheerful and inviting in the sunshine.Still sore, Hansel and Gretel kept to their rooms after lunch. Mum was busy in the kitchen and Dad was tinkering in the garage.  The party was to start at four pm and last till seven, when the kids who’d been allowed to go would be picked up and ferried home again.Hansel burst into Gretel’s room. “Come on, get your coat on, we’re going,” he commanded. Gretel was ready for him, she’d already got her sparkly silver top on under her jumper and her black leggins under her jeans. “If we go now, by the path through the wood and across Farmer Giles’ field, we’ll get there by four. We’ll cadge a lift home and Mum and Dad will never know that we’ve been out.”They sneaked out by the French doors into the garden and ran. As planned they got to the barn in good time, the music had only just started and not many of their friends had arrived as early as they had. But a group of much older boys and girls from the town were there, standing at one end of the barn in private huddles, with a skinny, tall boy going from group to group, handing them something.Gretel stared. “They’re not meant to be here.” she said curiously. “They’re a bit old, aren’t they,” she added. Hannah agreed. “Keep away from them, they’re bad news. Some of them are druggies.”Gretel shuddered. She soon forgot all about them as she started dancing with the other girls, all of them in a circle, with the boys doing their own thing somewhere else. She felt a little guilty at having come without permission, but where was the harm; she and Hansel would be home again soon, with Mum and Dad none the wiser.The music got louder, the barn heated up and the girls stopped for a drink of water. The tall boy was loitering by the improvised bar. He eyed Gretel, who was tall and looked older than her fourteen years, appreciatively. “Fancy a little booster?” he asked. “Ever tried it?” Gretel found it hard to get away from him in the crush. “Here you are, have a bit, just a quarter won’t do you any harm. Try it, it’s free.”He took her by the arm and manhandled her out of the crush by the bar. and out by the barn door. “Get off me, let go of my arm, I don’t want your booster.” She was alarmed now. He gripped her a little harder. “Come on, be nice, have a little fun.”  Suddenly, Hansel appeared. He was only thirteen and much smaller than the tall boy. “Hey, leave my sister alone”, he shouted; the tall boy turned and laughed. “Says who?”  Hansel threw a feeble punch at him. The boy side-stepped him and laughed louder, letting go of Gretel’s arm.  Furiously, Hansel picked up a thick broomstick leaning against the barn wall. He swung it, hitting the tall boy on the side of his head. At the same time Gretel shoved him hard and the boy staggered and fell back into the snow, momentarily winded.“Come on, let’s get out of here,” Gretel said, “home, Hansel.” They ran to pick up their coats and legged it, back through Farmer Giles’ field and into the woods that would lead them home.Gretel could have sworn that she saw a large pale arrow pointing them homewards, back on the right path."},
{"title": "From Hags To (Not Quite) Bitches", "date": "Sunday 23 January 2011", "text": "Celtic Hags - KorrigansThis has been a week for parties, two lunches and a dinner party. And before you think that my life is a series of brilliant social occasions, let me quickly put you right, this was very unusual. The social scene in January is normally as dull and dreary and grey as the January sky.Still having Beloved’s seemingly innocent but very appreciative exclamation ringing in my ears:  “Aren’t Italian women beautifully groomed!”  while watching a TV show set in Rome, I decided to do something for my outer woman – internally, I am extremely well-groomed, it just doesn’t show up on the outside.Three parties in one week called for a visit to the hairdresser. I know what I owe myself, after all. That these well-groomed, beautiful women were all twenty years younger than me and more than thirty years younger than Beloved didn’t seem to matter. Nothing ventured nothing gained.While I was getting my coat and bag upstairs an ominous clunking and thudding sound reached me.A few moments later a voice hailed me:“Dearest (!), are you there?”The ‘are you there’ is part of the ritual on these occasions.“Just a mo, I’m coming”.“Dearest (!), I’ve done something.”This very gently, an apology and a hint of fear already in the tone.“I’ve got the car out of the garage for you. The rake fell over, hit the window and smashed it. I’ve smashed the side window.”Our garage is not one of these tidy places you see on TV or in ads, it’s full of junk, gardening tools, two thirds empty cans of paint, shelves with bottles of home-made wine, sacks of dog food and bird food, large terracotta pots and tubs that would crack if left outside in winter, yard brooms, etc. It all works. Everything is stacked and shoe-horned  in and secured, and there is enough room for the car too, provided you snap back the wing mirrors and stop when you hit the tennis ball hanging from the ceiling on a string at one end  and line up the front right hand car door exactly with the door leading into the workroom. It’s easy. A child could do it.The window was smashed to pieces; there was no chance that I’d be able to use our one and only car. I am a picture of restraint at these times. I promise I stopped cursing after five minutes and asked politely: “what happened?”“Well, ‘somebody’ must have shifted the bird seed bucket which shifted the spade which pushed the rake and loosened it from its holder. The wing mirror must have accidentally nudged it which made it fall forward at exactly the moment the window was in its path downwards.”We never established who the ‘somebody’ was, presumably some unknown intruder in the dead of night; the explanation itself couldn’t have been more logical. And detailed. And well thought out.I went to all three parties well-groomed only on the inside; nobody seemed to mind.Beloved and I are speaking again."},

{"title": "The Three Spinners or How To Profit From Idleness And Deceit", "date": "Tuesday 18 January 2011", "text": "WILLOW's MAGPIE No. 49A long time ago, a poor hard-working mother was cursed with an idle daughter who simply refused to bolster the household finances by helping her mother at the spinning wheel.Finally mother lost all patience and smacked her daughter until she cried. The Queen happened to be riding by at that exact moment. She heard the girl cry and, being soft-hearted, came to inquire the reason for the racket.Mother was ashamed of her lazy daughter. Instead of owning up, she said that her daughter wanted to spin all day but that she didn’t have the money to provide the flax.“Poor girl”, said the Queen. “Come with me to the palace, I have plenty of flax and you’ll be able to spin to your heart’s content”.At the palace the Queen showed the girl three rooms filled with flax.“Spin me this flax”, she said, “ and when you have done so, you shall have my eldest son for a husband. You may be a poor peasant girl, but you are wonderfully industrious; that’s dowry enough”.Left to get on with it, the girl burst into tears. She was even worse off here than at home. She went to the window, weeping desperately.Three old women were standing outside, gossiping. One had a broad, flat foot, the second had a long, drooping underlip and the third had a huge thumb. “Why are you crying such bitter tears, pretty girl”, they asked.The girl sobbed out her story.“Well, here’s what we’ll do for you”, said the ugly women, “we’ll do the spinning for you if you invite us to your wedding to the Queen’s son. You’ll have to promise, mind”.Instantly, the girl’s tears dried up. “Come in, come now”, she said, “don’t delay, you could start right away. I promise to do as you ask and invite you to the wedding.No sooner said than done. The women came in and began their spinning. One drew the thread and trod the wheel, the next wetted the thread, the third twisted it and struck the table with her finger, and as often as she spun it a skein of thread fell to the ground, spun in the finest manner possible. When they were not working the girl hid the women in her own chamber where nobody else was allowed to enter.One after the other the rooms were emptied of flax. Every time the Queen came to check on progress, the girl showed her the great quantity of thread spun. When all the work had been done, the three women left. “Don’t forget your promise and invite us to the wedding. It will make your fortune.The Queen was delighted, mightily she praised the girl for her industriousness. “It shall be as I promised, you shall marry the crown prince. We will prepare for the wedding immediately”.“May I ask a favour”, the girl said. “I have three dear old aunts who have been very kind to me. May I invite them to the wedding?”The Queen consulted her son. “We don’t see why not”, they said.In due course the wedding feast began and three old women entered, dressed in strange apparel; the girl embraced them and said “welcome, dear aunts”.The Prince saw them, saw how ugly they were and looked at his new bride.  Could they really be closely related? His pretty girl and these ugly old crones?“Hello there, ladies,” he said politely, not wanting them to see that he was in shock. “Welcome and all that, but do tell me how you came by the massive foot, the lip hanging down to your chest and the malformed hand”, looking at each of them in turn.“By treading the spinning wheel”, the first one said.“By licking the thread”, the second one said.“By twisting the thread”, the third one said.Hearing that, the Prince instantly decided that he’d be the man in his household, to put his foot down and forbid his pretty new bride ever to touch a spinning wheel again, no matter how much she cried and pined for it."},
{"title": "The Alphabet Game  -  'A' is for . . . . .", "date": "Saturday 15 January 2011", "text": "ThymeRecently I have noticed that two bloggers, Madame Butterfly, of A New Start, and Ellen, of Stuff From Ellen's Head,  both of whose blogs I enjoy reading, have started to post Alphabet posts without being members of a meme group. The meme groups all have many members already, so I thought I’d copy Madame Butterfly and Ellen and do a set of my own. A further reason is, of course, that I can simply stop doing them if I lose interest.Here goes:A is for AromatherapyWhat could be sweeter than to be welcomed by your gentle practitioner with an indulgent smile and a warm hug and be sent to a fragrant little room pervaded by the scent of essential oils, some wiffly-waffly music barely perceptible in the background. Ranged around the walls are some bookshelves holding books on complementary therapies, a small desk, a pair of comfortable chairs and a pile of thick, clean towels on a stool in the corner. In the centre  stands the couch, a contraption already covered in towels,  two small cushions and a headrest at one end, which can be removed.The whole set-up speaks of luxurious relaxation without being in the least luxuriously appointed, or horrendously expensive.My friend Jilly has been a complementary health practitioner for two decades and she is very good at it; she is less good at making a good living at it.When I rang her for an appointment after we first came here, I wanted a facial, a beauty treatment. “I don’t do beauty treatments”, she said, “I work with the whole body, not just the outer layer”.I didn’t know people like her existed then. Deeply involved in what were then called ‘Alternative Treatments’, and the whole philosophy surrounding them, I found her remarkably sensible in spite of her other-worldly kindness and spiritual warmth. I had had some very unfortunate experiences in London and paid a lot of money for treatments which had had no effect at all.I have been addicted to Jilly and her healing hands ever since my first treatment. She has helped me through some very rough patches. Jilly practices several therapies but my favourite is Aromatherapy Deep Tissue Massage.  BUPA  provides a clear and unflowery, detailed, article on Aromatherapy for those who are interested to learn more.This is what Jilly herself has to say:The ancient Egyptians were probably the first to discover the healing power of natural plant oil. The aromas emanating from flowers, herbs and trees are due to potent, volatile essences found within tiny glands in the plant. Once extracted and distilled hey are called essential oils.The aromatherapist skillfully selects the right combination of oils for each individual. These essential oils are then massaged into the body, producing a feeling of blissful relaxation.Essential oils penetrate through the skin, taking their healing properties deep down into the system, thus ensuring good blood and lymph circulation through the body.Aromatherapy treats a whole range of disorders including back pain, stress, tension, sciatica, sinusitis, allergies, eczema, asthma, migraine, insomnia, arthritis, and many more.With Jilly I know I am in very good hands. This time, after a prolonged spell without any treatment and a stressful few weeks, the massage is very painful. The knots in my back, my shoulders, my neck, arms and legs need a lot of manipulation before they yield and loosen; but Jilly gets to them. I squeal and she says “sorry”, but she doesn’t give up.When I leave her, I ache all over, but I also walk tall again, with my neck rising from my shoulders, not sunk into them.Not a miracle, just a good aromatherapy massage and a good practitioner."},

{"title": "Introducing Musicians", "date": "Tuesday 11 January 2011", "text": "WILLOW'S MAGPIE TALES No. 48Every orchestral player, so scenario-writers would have you believe, carries a conductor's baton in his case. This is not true: open any instrument case in any bandroom at any time, and you will find a near-black bow-tie or flimsy scarf, seven old assorted programmes, an outdated lottery ticket, a sandwich and a dirty duster.There may also be an instrument of some sort, but there will be no more sign of a conductor's baton than of a poached egg. Probably less.There is a great deal of romantic nonsense written about musicians. Novelists endeavour to convince the public that members of the profession wear an air of glory, and manage to infuse them with a spirit of romance and adventure, that is denied other mortals. A musician's life is, in reality, as prosaic as any; there is no more glory attached to it than to the lot of a shop assistant, and no more adventure than to the life of a travelling salesman.The concert goer is, perhaps, more deluded than one who knows less about music. After weeks of happy anticipation he listens, entranced, whilst sixty black-clad performers play his favourite symphony. It is only natural that he should place these beings on a mental pedestal, and imagine that if they do have the same sordid necessities and vices as the rest of the species, they at least forget about them whilst they are playing for his benefit.The concert goer also holds the idea that musicians play chamber music in all their leisure moments. The opposite view is also widely held: that musicians play poker whenever they are off duty, and are too sharp to admit that they are on an easy racket. The two opinions, in a nutshell, are that musicians are either long-haired or bald. Some of them are, of course, but never at the same time.The first thing a player does when he comes on to a stage, having made sure that he has the best available chair and sufficient room to play, is to study the audience. Very attractive members of the audience, male or female, will occasion an appreciative titter. Critics will cause mournful glances in the direction of the conductor, blaming him in advance for the performance's shortcomings.  Any player spying a fixer - these exalted beings rarely attend concerts - will keep the sighting to him/herself and play like they've never played before. Getting on to the A-list of a well-known fixer is what every musician aspires to; fixers have such sought-after money-spinners as light music sessions, film sessions and TV jingles in their gift. Jingles pay the most for the least effort.Musicians develop, very early in their careers, a fine technique of conversation with the public. They will size a layman up from his first sentence, and adapt their remarks to suit his taste, on the principle that every member of an audience is a potential employer, or at least a possible supper. There is no propaganda for musicians, only for music, and it is incumbent on every player to convince as many people as he can that he is a fine artist and a nice chap and that the orchestra to which he belongs is the finest in the country.During their career, most players adopt a fatalistic attitude, and have difficulty in keeping up the attitudes that are expected of them. They would really much rather be at home painting the bathroom or sorting their stamp collection."},
{"title": "BLOGGING - Anonymously ?", "date": "Monday 10 January 2011", "text": "Quite recently it has become known to some here at Valley’s End that I am a blogger. It’s my own fault, I foolishly let the cat out of the bag myself to the local news and information journal who published some of my reminiscences and they are wanting a few more.Then there’s family. Apart from Beloved very few knew; neither did local friends. Those few who knew didn’t care and rarely read, so I was quite safe.All this may be about to change; it’s amazing how these things spread; one person knows – all know. I don’t care how many people in cyberspace read my blogs, the more the merrier; but once your cover is blown amongst your nearest and not so dearest, you need to watch your step.I very rarely write about family – they might not like it; besides, we aren’t close enough for them to be in the forefront of my daily thoughts. (Let me reassure all of you who have just gasped in horror at my callous words: it would be different if anything catastrophic happened to any of them).The past is different, you can’t hurt the feelings of the dead.I have written about Valley’s End, of course, and will continue to do so; although I never mention real names, I sincerely hope nobody recognizes themselves. I am also hoping that it is true what they say, that a character in a book, a biography, or even a blog, never sees themselves as others see them. And if they do, they usually see themselves as the person who is described favourably, sympathetically, never as the unpleasant character, or worse, the butt of everybody’s jokes.I believe that an ordinary blog post, depending on reading time, has a shelf life of about, say, five minutes? Maybe less. One reads, one digests, one comments, one moves on. In time, one gets to know more about one’s favourite fellow bloggers, you might even correspond outside blogland; you get to like people with whom you have something in common. A steady drip feed about personal stuff begins to make an impression.There’s problem number one: your blogging pals know stuff about the people you mention in your blog.Problem number two is when those whom you mention in your blog, however obliquely, feel that you are discussing private matters which are nobody’s business.Problem number three is when it’s family you talk about and you are not one hundred percent complimentary. Family might just resent you talking about them, full stop.So what to do?I know several bloggers who blogged under their own names, who had to close blogs and start new, anonymous, ones because family members objected to what they had written; family members felt their privacy had been invaded. I can understand that, I too would like to choose what is known about me and my life.There are many of you who revel in reporting on family matters, usually because family life is so idyllic that you simply have to share it. I love some of these blogs, they give me an idea of what I’m missing. You are allowing me to stand at a window looking in on a fairy tale. “Mrs. Cynic Saboteur” that I am – a phrase coined for me by a dear friend and confidante – doesn’t quite believe in the fairy tale, of course; nobody’s life is perfect all the time. No children are permanently sweetness and light, no husbands, wives, siblings never overstep boundaries.Those bits mercifully remain hidden from view, which is only right and proper.I don’t know how many of you who write about work, the office, colleagues, school, etc., or friends and social contacts, are known as bloggers; most of the ones I read, with pleasure, appear to be anonymous. If you are unfailingly kind and deeply understanding as well as unobservant about your fellow man and woman, I probably give up reading your blog. Not that that need worry you, of course, we all do what we like doing best.There is one group for whom it seems not to matter if anyone knows who they are: the dreamers, poets, artists, writers of prose rather than personal blog posts, who never put a foot wrong. If you have nobody who resents you, nobody who actively wants you to stop blogging because they fear an indiscretion, well, you have only yourselves to blame.Finally, it gives me great pleasure to be a member of this wonderful community for as long as you’ll have me; I love you all. (well, most of you)."},

{"title": "Will It End Soon?", "date": "Wednesday 29 December 2010", "text": "Look, no crowds.Andrew's Fireplace.I am more and more aware of how much I prefer silence and quietude to social chatting nowadays. Not that I’ve ever been a chatterbox; an only child growing up in a small family rarely is. They do say that people living on their own feel the need to talk at length when they get together with others and I have frequently been the victim of such unfortunates myself. It’s almost as if such people need to pin you down with a flood of verbal diarrhoea whenever they get the chance.At three different parties  in the last two weeks have I been reminded of this dislike of crowds. Moving from room to room, standing and shouting to make yourself heard above the din, balancing a glass and a small plate, at any time of the day, has not been a pleasure.Conversations are pretty dull on these occasions. As you are moving from person to person and group to group you ask and are asked a pre-ordained series of questions. It’s like ticking multiple choice boxes:Will you be at home for Christmas?Are you going away for Christmas?Do you have family coming?When, who and for how long?Answers are equally predictable, a variation on the same theme.Frankly, I don’t care. I am glad if you are happy but, for a while now, I am going to try and avoid you because the sole topic of conversation would surely be :Did you have a nice holiday? With all the details repeated.So how wonderful to have received one final invitation ‘to an informal lunch’. When we got there we were delighted to find that we were the only guests and that the very civilized host had provided a small but delicious meal to be eaten at a very civilized table. No mention of Christmas, families, travel arrangements, not even the weather; idle chatter to be sure, but about books and music, food and art and gardening.Bliss.Beloved and I are so used to living in our quiet bubble that major disturbances are almost an affront.  Right at this moment I am escaping from family; lovely people, intelligent, sweet and friendly, all four of them but I simply needed time and space to myself.

{"title": "Christmas Eve At Home  -  23rd Window", "date": "Thursday 23 December 2010", "text": "Most years, there were only the three of us for Christmas Eve, mum, dad and me.All day long an electric tickle crackled in the atmosphere, starting in the morning, straight after I got out of bed. A quietly subdued sense of anticipation made me feel like I was holding my breath and stepping more lightly than on any other day of the year.Breakfast over, dad and I went to the market to collect the tree we had chosen the day before; we carried it home, me holding on to the thin, top end and dad holding the trunk.  Getting the tree to fit into the holder was always a complicated job; the trunk never quite fit and had to be sawn off a bit, planed a bit, cut some more, filed a bit, until dad was satisfied. By now the trunk had lost some of its length, dad was not the most handy of men.Neither was he very patient, in spite of the festiveness a mild curse or two accompanied his labours.If mum was finished ‘doing’ the little Christmas room we were allowed to carry the tree into its place, the same place as every year, in the corner by the window.By now it was time for lunch, which was a hasty meal; there was much left to do before the magic hour of six o’clock when our family celebrations would begin.  By three in the afternoon things calmed down, jobs were done and it was time for a bath. Christmas Eve was the only day in the year when we had a bath in the middle of the afternoon; mum decreed it and dad and I obeyed.The winter’s day’s early dusk fell and it was time to dress the tree. This was a job for mum and me, while dad sat smoking his pipe and giving advice:“There’s a hole here, a red bauble would fit in over there, this branch needs gold, that one needs silver, that candle is too close to the branch above”. Finally, lametta thrown over the tree haphazardly, “naturally”, to cling where it would, all three of us declared ourselves satisfied.“A beautiful tree, it’ll be spectacular when we light the candles”.All the while the radio played festive music, a request programme for the more discerning taste; I can’t remember any discordant jingles, although I may be wrong.Six o’clock and the magic hour had arrived.Mum had prepared supper earlier; when we were on our own, the meal was simple, yet festive, the traditional potato salad, a green salad, smoked fish, smoked meats, black bread; I was allowed a small glass of wine, probably watered down, although I didn’t know it then.In large families, after the meal, one person would go into the Christmas room and light the candles, before the rest of the family was called in, but in our house all three of us went in together and dad and I watched mum carefully light the candles. We had already brought our presents from where they had been hidden and put them under the tree after dressing it.“Ah, Oh, it is the most beautiful tree we’ve ever had, don’t you agree?”We did.It was time to unwrap the presents; this never took very long, there were never very many in those days, mine were most often books I had asked for; presents were certainly important but there was so much else to Christmas Eve that they were simply a small part of the ritual.Dad was waiting for his treat. “Will you sing for me? Please, do sing now”.The radio had fallen silent at six o’clock.Mum had a lovely mezzo voice. When I had become confident enough to let my childish treble ring out she began to harmonise and we sang all dad’s favourite songs.I too had a request for mum. She had a wonderful way with a harmonica; she owned several of these simple, folksy instruments and she could make them break into such hauntingly soulful, yearning melancholy that the hairs on my arms stood on end. She always ended her repertoire with Silent Night, Holy Night, with dad and me singing full out.This usually finished dad off; there’d be tears in his eyes, and to get him (and ourselves too) back on an even keel, Mum or I fetched dad’s mandolin. It didn’t take much pleading before dad plucked a few chords, mum took up her harmonica and I sang along, happier, jollier songs now.Wine, even my watered down cup, music, many “do you remember” reminiscences, a table laden with my books, dad’s cigars and mum’s small trinkets, plates of delicacies to nibble, the warmth and glow of the candles and a genuine feeling of contentment and goodwill all served to make Christmas Eve truly memorable.For several years mum and I went to Midnight Mass. We’d bundle ourselves up, often wearing new scarves, gloves and hats and go to the largest of the churches in the town, the deep bells from all churches ringing us on our way.  I seem to remember that we always sank into deep snow. The church was packed with worshippers and others like us, who had come for the music. We slipped in at the back; a thousand candles lit up every stone, and the sound of the massive organ filled the vast edifice.In common with every one there we lifted our voices and sang our hearts out.Going home, mum and I stayed silent. There was nothing left to say."},
{"title": "The Twelve Days of Christmas -  22nd Window", "date": "Wednesday 22 December 2010", "text": "\"Twelfth Night\" by David Teniers the Younger (1634-40)The Twelve Days of Christmas begin on  December 25 and end on Epiphany, January 6. In the Middle Ages this period was one of continuous feasting and merrymaking, which climaxed on Twelfth Night, the traditional end of the Christmas season.During the twelve days of Christmas, traditional roles were often relaxed, masters waited on their servants, men were allowed to dress as women, and women as men. Often a Lord of Misrule was chosen to lead the Christmas revels. Some of these traditions were adapted from older, pagan customs, including the Roman Saturnalia. Some also have an echo in modern day pantomime where traditionally authority is mocked and the principal male lead is played by a woman, while the leading older female character, or 'Dame' is played by a man.Everybody knows the hardy perennial\"The Twelve Days Of Christmas'.Here is a rather different version in the form ofA Correspondence25th DecemberMy dearest darlingThat partridge, in that lovely little pear tree!

Do they reallycome all the way from France? It's a pity that we have nochicken coops, but I expect we'll find some. Thank you,anyway, they're lovely.Your loving Emily28th DecemberDearest EdwardWhat a surprise - four calling birds arrived this morning.They are very sweet, even if they do call rather loudly -they make telephoning impossible. But I expect they'll calmdown when they get used to their new home. Anyway, I'm verygrateful - of course I am.Love from Emily29th DecemberDearest EdwardThe postman has just delivered five most beautiful goldrings, one for each finger, and all fitting perfectly. Areally lovely present -lovelier in a way than birds, which dotake rather a lot of looking after. The four that arrivedyesterday are still making a terrible row, and I'm afraidnone of us got much sleep last night. Mummy says she wantsus to use the rings to 'wring' their necks - she's onlyjoking, I think; though I know what she means. But I lovethe rings. Bless youLove, Emily30th DecemberDear EdwardWhatever I expected to find when I opened the front doorthis morning, it certainly wasn't six socking great geeselaying eggs all over the doorstep. Frankly, I rather hopedyou had stopped sending me birds - we have no room for themand they have already ruined the croquet lawn. I know youmeant well, but - let's call a halt, shall we?Love, Emily31st DecemberEdwardI thought I said no more birds; but this morning I woke upto find no less than seven swans all trying to get into ourtiny goldfish pond. I'd rather not think what happened tothe goldfish. The whole house seems to be full of birds - tosay nothing of what they leave behind them. Please, pleaseSTOPYour Emily1st JanuaryFrankly, I think I prefer the birds. What am I to do witheight milkmaids - AND their cows? Is this some kind of ajoke? If so, I'm afraid I don't find it very amusing.Emily2nd JanuaryLook here Edward, this has gone far enough. You say you'resending me nine ladies dancing; all I can say is that judgingfrom the way they dance, they're certainly not ladies.

If you value our friendship - which I do less andless - kindly stop this ridiculous behaviour at once.Emily3rd JanuaryAs I write this letter, ten disgusting old men areprancing abour all over what used to be the garden -beforethe geese and the swans and the cows got at it; and severalof them, I notice, are taking inexcusable liberties with themilkmaids.

{"title": "The Spirit of Giving -  21st Window", "date": "Tuesday 21 December 2010", "text": "The other day there was a news item about people getting into debt to buy Christmas presents, particularly people borrowing from loan sharks and  finding that they have somehow committed themselves to repaying vast amounts of interest, a £100 loan turning into a £1000 debt.One mother was actually shown saying: \"the kids want their presents as much as other kids do, I don't want them to go without just because I don't have the money\". It is sad, of course, and I can understand the mother's feelings but I can't understand her acting on them. I can't understand the logic. I've been very hard up during some periods in my life; my attitude was and is, 'if I don't have the money for it, it doesn't get bought'. I don't think I'm mean, just sensible.Since then I've been thinking what presents mean to me.I wish giving nowadays didn't have to be on such a noisy, spectacular scale. People my age tend to go on a bit about the 'good old days', how we were satisfied with a cardboard box and a dustbin lid and a quarter share of a mince pie; perhaps we weren't, not really, but I think we were more modest in our requests.In our family presents have always been modest. When my father, who was a very kind man, was asked what he wanted for Christmas (or his birthday), he invariably said : \"don't make a fuss, I already have everything I want. It would be nice to receive a small token of appreciation, just some little thing to show you care, but really, don't make a fuss\".  In other words \"It's the thought that counts\".We made fun of him, this little speech was so predictable, we mouthed the words while he was uttering them. He usually ended up with a box of cigars, a bottle, something sensible to wear, like a cardigan.I enjoy presents, both giving and receiving, but they have to be well-chosen and thoughtful. The best present I ever had as a child was  a pile of books, which included every single book I'd asked for that year. I was so proud, I told everybody, whether they'd asked me or not, what I'd got for Christmas. With my grandchildren books would just be a stocking filler.A present has to mean something, it has to be a sign of love, appreciation, goodwill; dare I say, it has to come from the heart. A smile, a kind word, a helping hand can be presents. The worst giver is the calculated giver, the one who 'throws a sausage to gain a chop\", as they say where I come from. That person may be good at adding up his sums but has no idea of giving."},

{"title": "Christmas Eve At Aunt Johanna's  -  Fourth Sunday in Advent", "date": "Sunday 19 December 2010", "text": "Aunt Johanna was the pretty one, the dainty and delicate one, the one with the nicest house, the smartest clothes and the best taste in Christmas decorations. She also cried a lot. “She’s built her house too close to water”, the others used to say. When I was little I didn’t understand what they meant by that, but I often saw her cry.Aunt Johanna’s house was different from the other aunts’ houses.  There wasn’t as much joy as at aunt Little Kate’s, who was my favourite, it was a lot less smelly than at aunt Maria’s, who lived with my other grandfather, the holy one, and a little less tidy than mum’s, but more grown-up, somehow. It was bigger too, that’s why we sometimes went there for Christmas. Mum and dad and I went there by train the day before and mum used to make fun, in a mean sort of way, of the way aunt Johanna fussed over her tree. Mum and aunt Johanna were sisters.The most festive part of Christmas in Germany is Christmas Eve, the Silent Night, Holy Night of the carol.  In those days everything stopped after three o’clock in the afternoon; no shops, no trains, no anything at all, except for essential services. And the sailors at sea, I remember them in particular, because people would ask for music to be played for them on the radio.I was always very excited to go to aunt Johanna’s, it was so different from anywhere else I went. Cousin Dieter and I were the same age but his two sisters were big girls, older than me, much superior in looks and understanding. Dieter was superior too, he made fun of me, but because we were the same age I could punch him. Besides, I was cleverer than him. Aunt Johanna really didn’t like that.Most of the afternoon we spent in the kitchen. We’d missed lunch, but aunt Johanna made us wait a long time before she offered us anything to eat. I remember being quite hungry sometimes; she gave us a cup of coffee and a biscuit to tide us over but there were no other concessions to our traveling day. The last time we went there for Christmas mum had brought sandwiches for us, which we ate in aunt Johanna’s kitchen. I remember being glad of them but there did seem to be an atmosphere while mum and dad and I were eating them.Only at Christmas was dinner served in the dining room. The living room was next to the kitchen, it was shabby and warm and uncle Hans’ big desk was in an alcove. We couldn’t go in  because he was still working and spent a lot of time in there, shouting on the telephone, which made aunt Johanna cry. “Does he have to work even today”, she sobbed.We couldn’t go into the dining room because that was also the best parlour,  a large room running along one side of the house, the room where the Christmas tree stood. The door was firmly shut. Only over aunt Johanna’s dead body would anyone go in there before she was ready to display her annual masterpiece, her Christmas tree.Finally, uncle Hans relented and joined us. He brought out a bottle or two and dad and he smoked and drank, mum had a glass too, but aunt Johanna refused. She had been wronged, she wasn’t ready to forgive.We children had been amusing ourselves, staying in the kitchen or using the scullery; everywhere else in the house it was cold; it was an old house, unheated for the main part. I already dreaded the thought of the freezing bedrooms.Little by little the atmosphere thawed and at long last it was time to open the dining room doors and pay homage to ‘the tree’. Aunt Johanna had disappeared into the room about fifteen minutes earlier, alone, but now she threw open the modest doors with a flourish. “Do come and look at the tree”, she called. We obediently obliged, we were well trained. We stood awkwardly halfway inside the dark room, which was lit only by the wax candles on the tree.It has to be said, her tree was magnificent, a magical vision in green and silver, reaching from floor to  ceiling. Aunt Johanna only ever used silver ornaments. But what made her tree stand out from all others was the tinsel, thousand of strands of silver tinsel, the sort that is called 'lametta', each one hung on the tree separately, long and smooth and unimpeded. She must have spent hours getting it just right, adjusting and tweaking and smoothing each strand.In the light of the white wax candles in their silver holders the whole tree came to shimmering, trembling, other-worldly life. “It’s not a very good one this year”, Aunt Johanna said proudly.It took a long time before I could look away from the tree and notice that the long dining table was laid  for the Christmas Eve meal. Aunt Johanna had done herself proud, she had brought out the family china and silver and the best glasses which were rarely used and never normally when there were children around.I hardly dared touch anything. By now I wasn’t even very hungry anymore. Mum looked cross; by rights, at least half of the splendour displayed on the table should have been hers, she’d said it often enough to dad and me at home.  I am not sure that she would ever have used any of it if it had been hers.In spite of the setting the meal was a nervous one. Every so often Aunt Johanna rushed up to extinguish another candle burning too close to its holder. Gradually, the tree lost its lustre and Christmas Eve came to an end."},

One of my favourites is the chocolatier. We can't afford to go in very often, every chocolate, hand-made from the finest ingredients, is priced in the region of a king's ransom, but at Christmas we do; we buy chocolates as presents for others, as gifts to take to dinner parties and even for ourselves. I'd almost be willing to commit a minor crime if you promised to pay me in dark chocolate coated orange peel strips;  whoever invented them has my undying gratitude. However, they are very expensive.It is only a small shop but when you go in your nose is assailed by the aroma of real chocolate, spices, sugar and marzipan confections and standing at the glass topped counter, below which are several  shelves of tray upon tray filled with delectable and delicious truffles,  many of them laced with alcohol, Isalivate in anticipation.If I were a dog, I'd slobber and drool.\"Two of this one and two of that and two of those at the back,\" is how I buy them; Slowly the girl fills a small bag for me. When I get them home they are put at the back of the fridge, well out of the way of any searching fingers. They are exclusively for us, we do not share the ones we buy for ourselves (and don't feel guilty at all) and we don't start eating them until Christmas Eve; not from the bag, mind you, but from a pretty dish. The Japanese tea ceremony has nothing on me and my chocolates!WARNING - Be careful how much Christmas chocolate you eat!Chocolate's reputation as an Aphrodisiac originated in South America over one thousand five hundred years ago, where it is known that it was thought to have mystical and aphrodisiac qualities by both the Mayan and Aztec cultures - the Aztec emperor, Monteczuma drank fifty golden goblets of chocolate a day to enhance his sexual prowess, it is said.  However, I recently came across this snippet of warning originating in 17th century England:\"The confection made of Cacao called Chocolate or Chocoletto, which may be had in divers places in London at reasonable rates, is of wonderful efficacy for the procreation of children: for it not only vehemently incites to Venus, but causes conception in women  . . . . . . and besides that, it preserves health, for it makes such as take it often to become fat and corpulent, fair and amiable.\"William Coles Adam in Eden 1657"},

I almost bought him these Santas but they were part of the shop display only.They played and sang non-stop Christmas carols. We didn't stay for long.Don't you all hate supermarkets at this time of year? In spite of trying my hardest to avoid them the need for a visit could no longer be ignored. Cleaning materials, bog roll, every day groceries, potatoes, dog food and such boring stuff I buy there; the cold weather is forecast to return and my stores have to be replenished. So off we went to the supermarket.Twenty minutes into the experience I was ready to commit murder. At this time of year they change their stock around; I normally try to get in and out as fast and efficiently as I can, but some very inconsiderate person had messed up my familiar aisles just to confuse me. Where there had been juice there were spirits, where there had been rubber gloves there were Christmas crackers. All I wanted were some food bags and clingfilm for leftovers.  And while I was stomping through the aisles, backwards and forwards, I was forced to listen to an endless loop of Christmas jingles, a tinny, badly arranged, flat, featureless cacophony of sound.The more I resented it the more obtrusive it became. I went through those aisles like a thing possessed, hissing 'ssshhhut-up-ssshhhut-up-ssshhhut-up' with every step I took. I actually came across several people singing along to the atrocities on the sound system! Morons! I have no idea why they stared at me and gave me and my trolley a wide berth. I was still fizzing with nervous tension driving home.How much more civilised it was to sit after dinner and write Christmas cards. A few chocolates, a glass of mulled wine and a CD by the The Sixteen playing quietly. Sublime. My rage melted like snow in the sun.Today, on the 16th December, is traditionally the beginning of mince pie season, according to some ancient household books. Originally rectangular in shape and said to represent Christ's manger, mince pies were abominated as 'Popish and Superstitious' by Puritans, and described thus in 1656:Idolatry in Crust! Babylon's whoreDefiled with superstition, like the Gentiles Of Old, that worshipped onions, roots and lentils.Later however, the 'solid, substantial, Protestant mince pie' became the champion of the English Christmas against ' imported foreign kickshaws'.Eat mince pies made by as many different cooks as possible: for every cook's pie, you will have a lucky month in the coming year.Don't blame me, I'm only the messenger."},
{"title": "The Kindness Of Joseph - A Legend  -  15th Window", "date": "Wednesday 15 December 2010", "text": "While I was researching items for this Advent Calendar I came across a legend which people in the lowlands of Northwest Europe, between the two big rivers, the Meuse and the Rhine, told about St. Joseph, that unassuming, almost invisible figure, who was the husband of the Virgin Mary.  Hundreds of years ago, during long, dark winter nights, when they sat by the flickering light of peat fires creating restless shadows on the walls of their huts they told stories; stories which had been handed down through the generations and were accepted as truth.One of these was a rather endearing story about Joseph's kind heart and presence of mind. We know that he was a carpenter and must therefore have a been a practical man, a man who knew how to solve practical problems; or so my forebears, the earthbound, simple peasants of the wide lands between the two big rivers believed.The story they told was about the Nativity and the baby Jesus in his crib in the cold and draughty stable. They lived in a land which was bitterly cold at this time of year, the days were short; life was hard in the unforgiving icy winds which blew unhindered over the plains and they therefore assumed that the conditions in Bethlehem must have been similar. When babies feel the cold, they cry. It was the most natural thing for them to see the child's discomfort as something to wring the heart of a kind man like Joseph and for him to do something to alleviate the suffering.The legend says that Joseph took off his long woollen stockings. He unrolled them and carefully cut them into lengths that would serve as swaddling clothes for the baby crying with cold and the discomfort it must feel sleeping in a crib lined with nothing but straw and hay.This story must have made a deep impression on the poor, put-upon peasants whose own hardship was so great. They knew deprivation and poverty too well not to be touched by a story telling of kindness.The legend was widely held to be true in the 14th and 15th Century not only by the common people but also by painters and poets of the time. The two most famous representations showing Joseph cutting up 'his hose' are by two Flemish painters, in particular Rogier van der Weyden (ca. 1460) and Melchior Broederlam (ca. 1390). Both show Joseph in the left hand corner of the painting holding the long woollen stockings. There are several poems referring to Joseph's act of kindness in old German,  one by Bruder Hans (15th Century) still exists in its entirety.During the Reformation the legend lost its potency; perhaps the story wasn't 'holy' enough or too un-biblical. But it couldn't do away with it completely: among the items kept in the sacred shrines at  Aachen Cathedral pilgrims still come to visit 'Joseph's Hose' today."},
{"title": "Punch 'n'  Pies  -  14th Window", "date": "Tuesday 14 December 2010", "text": "Christmas is a time for charitable giving.Here at Valley's End this giving is usually combined with a jolly occasion for meeting villagers,  drinking mulled wine, eating mince pies and buying home-made cakes, jams and chutneys, 2nd hand books and useless recycled gifts. Most of us have a box under the stairs or in the attic labelled \"items to be donated to charity\", also known as 'white elephants'. I admit that I no longer buy recycled knick-knacks, but I am happy to splurge on cakes and jars of jam. Unfortunately the best have usually gone by the time I get there.These events can take place indoors and outdoors. \"Punch 'n' Pies\", in aid of Arthritis Research,  one of the earliest in December, is held at a private house, generously opened by a village couple for the occasion. Believe me, on a day in December when there is gritty, salty snow about and everybody turns up in rubber boots and large wet coats, that is truly generous. Boots and coats are deposited in a heap on the bottom part of the stairs, making it impossible to climb up or down them. At least fifty people come and go throughout the morning,  fishing for sticks, boots and coats. It's all very jolly and impromptu.And like everything as jolly and impromptu as this it requires a lot of hard work and preparation.First stop when you get in is the table where you pay your entrance fee and buy raffle tickets. A  charitable event at Valley's End without a raffle is unheard of, be the event a coffee morning, a church bazaar, a bring-and-buy; in fact, wherever more than five people get together at any one time, you can be sure there's a raffle. It's one of the reasons Valley's End is so good at raising money; that, and the kind hearts of its inhabitants.  The prizes are set out on the table, all of them donated, of course; apart from the obligatory bottle of wine, the hastily potted up plant and the box of chocolates, prizes are of the recycled kind, albeit rather more expensive in the first place than the ones on the white elephant table.A wine glass full of mulled wine comes included in the entrance fee, as does the mince pie. A large saucepan sits on the cooker warming the drink. As Punch 'n' Pies happens in the morning the term 'mulled wine' is a touch optimistic; wine only plays a very minor role in this concoction. it's more likely to be fruit punch with one bottle of wine to three bottles of fruit juice. Even so there are good Methodist ladies and gentlemen who will forego this refreshment and opt for pure juice instead. As you can see the cup bearer dips his measuring jug into the saucepan and pours a measure into the glass, no standing on ceremony here.Mince pies galore, wherever you look; on the sales table, as well as being offered round and eaten by everyone while they are standing talking. Mince pies are obligatory during the whole of the season. Personally, I can't stand them. Mince pies, Christmas cake, Christmas pudding, can't stand any of them. too sticky and sickly sweet for my pickled herring palate. To each his own.But I do like the book table which is the last stop. I often get lucky. This time I found Richard Russo's Straight Man, a hardback copy of  Scribbling Women, a compilation of Short Stories by 19th Century American Women and a thin book of mostly 19th Century English Naive Paintings. Perhaps the book is thin because not many naive paintings were good enough to be published. After all, they didn't have Blogs in those days.Charitable giving can be such a cold, soulless, from 'high on low' affair. This way you come away warmed by the general good spirits, a lovely gossip,  and the satisfying feeling of having done good, while enjoying yourself.Congratulations all round!"},

Mischief and mayhem?

{"title": "The Christmas Truce  -  Third Sunday in Advent", "date": "Sunday 12 December 2010", "text": "The unofficial Truce in No-Man's-Land on the Western front on Christmas Eve 1914 still haunts the collective imagination. It formed one of the most effective scenes in the film Oh What A Lovely War, which was based on the stage musical of the same name. The 2005 film Joyeux Noël, which was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 78th Academy Awards is based on the same stories.An excellent book by Malcolm Brown and Shirley Seaton has collated all the evidence and proved beyond question that the truce certainly happened, all along the line. The famed football match really did take place, with the Fritzes beating the Tommies 3-2. The Germans rolled barrels of beer across and swapped them for plum-puddings. A German juggler entertained and a Tommy had his hair cut by his pre-war German barber.Nor were officers immune from the festivities: the following letter was written to his wife by a regular officer of the 1/North Staffs. who hurried to set down the extraordinary scene while it was fresh in his memory.I have just been through one of the most extraordinary scenes imaginable. Tonight is Christmas Eve, I was in my dugout reading a paper and the mail was being dished out. The firing had stopped at about seven.It was reported that the Germans had lighted their trenches up all along our front. We had been calling to one another for some time Christmas wishes and other things. I went out and they shouted 'no shooting' and then somehow the scene became a peaceful one. All our men got out of the trenches and sat on the parapet, the Germans did the same, and they talked to one another in English and broken English.I got on top of the trench and spoke German and asked them to sing a German folk song, which they did, then our men sang. Each side clapped and cheered the other. I asked a German who sang a solo to sing one of Schumann's songs, so he sang 'The Two Grenadiers' splendidly. Our men were a good audience and really enjoyed his singing.Then P. and I walked across and held a conversation with the German officer in command. I gave the latter permission to bury some German dead who were lying between us and we agreed to have no shooting until 12 midnight tomorrow.We talked together, ten or more Germans gathered round, I was almost in their lines.Then we wished one another good night and a happy Christmas and parted with a salute. The Germans sang and so did our men. It sounded so well. With a goodnight we all got back into our trenches. It was a curious scene, a lovely moonlight night, the German trenches with small lights on them, and the men on both sides gathered in groups on the parapets.I allowed one or or two men to go out and meet a German or two halfway. They exchanged cigars and talked. The officer I spoke to hopes we shall do the same on New Year's Day. I said 'yes, if I am here'.It is weird to think that tomorrow night we shall be hard at it again. If one gets through this show it will be a Christmas time to live in one's memory. The German who sang had a really fine voice.Am just off for a walk round the trenches to see all is well. Good Night."},

He seems to have had a love-hate relationship with the celebrations. He too hated the 'commercial orgy\", but it didn't stop him from itemising presents he had received in his diary for Christmas 1955.On Christmas Eve 1954 he wrote:\"how nice it would be to be a little boy of five again instead of an ageing playwright of fifty-five, and look forward to all the high jinks. However, it is no use repining.\"And again, in 1960:This is the day of goodwill to all men and the giving and receiving of presents which nobody particularly wants. . . . . . . a commercialised orgy of love without heart. I fear I am becoming cynical, but how nice it would be if it were an ordinary day on which I could get on with my work.Christmas in Beverley Hills in 1955 was  different. He wrote:\"In the middle of it all again. The house is really very nice and I have a dusky Jamaican lady to look after me who is lackadaisical and hums constantly. There have been a series of parties as usual, each one indistinguishable from the other, culminating last night in the Bogart's Christmas Eve revel which was great fun and highly glamorous to the eye.I have acquired some nice Christmas loot. Exquisite gold and ebony monogrammed links from Frank Sinatra, and a lovely black dressing gown and pyjamas to match from Marlene Dietrich and hand-worked bedroom slippers from Merle Oberon which are charming. A lot of other gifts too. But I do wish Christmas hadn't co-incided with 'Blithe Spirit'.  There is so much to be done and so little time to do it.\"It is almost as if Christmas 'forced' people to act in a way not of their choosing. There are parties at Valley's End too each year during December; far too many, to my mind. You meet the same people at most of them and exchange the same gossip. Why not get together during the long, dull days of January?Then there are family visits. Families 'have' to visit at Christmas. Why? These are the shortest days of the year, you sit on top of each other confined to one or two rooms, without being able to go outside. Children can't play outside, it's too cold, too wet, or too something. We have family who visit only during the Christmas period, never in the summer. And they don't even like Christmas!The snow and ice here at the moment are driving me insane; we have been unable to get the car out of the garage for  two weeks. I could be having a really peaceful, relaxed time, doing lots of lovely things for which I don't normally have the time. So what happens? Instead of enjoying the enforced leisure I am fretting about all the shopping I am not doing! Just food and drink for the main part - we hardly buy presents at all nowadays -  but there are people coming, they need feeding and watering, I need to get to the shops!How else are we going to stuff our faces until we're sick?It is high time I concentrated on the more pleasant aspects of the season again for a while, the weather over which I have no control, and these grumpy men are getting me down."},

We must be gluttonous because it is Christmas. We must be insincerely generous; we must buy things that nobody wants, and give them to people we don't like; we must go to absurd entertainments that make even our little children satirical; we must writhe under venal officiousness from legions of freebooters, all because it is Christmas - that is, because the mass of the population, including the all-powerful middle-class tradesman, depends on a week of licence and brigandage, waste and intemperance, to clear off its outstanding liabilities at the end of the year.As for me, I shall fly from it all tomorrow or next day, to some remote spot miles from a shop, where nothing worse can befall me than a serenade from a few peasants, or some equally harmless survival of medieval mummery, shyly offered, not advertised, moderate in its expectations, and soon over.In town there is, for the moment, nothing for me or any honest man to do.Friko's comment:Oh dear, oh dear, secretly - and now not so secretly - and with the exception of his first and last sentence, I agree with much of what the old grump is saying here. Who has not moaned about Christmas being a bore, a chore, an expensive waste of time, a Kitschfest, an occasion for old family rows being warmed up once again, for uncle Geronimo getting so sozzled that he falls off the chair,  for auntie Geronomina bursting into tears at the injustice of it all, at TV programmes being nothing but ancient repeats warmed up for the -nth year,  at the kids breaking their expensive toys within hours of getting them, and everybody feeling sick  because they've been eating and drinking for most of the day.Christmas doesn't have to be like that.  It doesn't have to be the corrupt, plasticised, saccharine, artificial creation that has been allowed to smother the real Christmas to which we all reach in our imaginations.The wonderful Christmas we used to know."},

Nikolaus had a golden book in which he carefully noted all our  good and bad deeds (and thoughts). Good children were rewarded with presents on Nikolaus Eve, but bad children were punished. Nikolaus had a special companion for the purpose, the servant Ruprecht; Ruprecht carried Nikolaus' sack that held the presents but he he also carried a switch, with which he beat the air occasionally, making us hold on to mother if the switch whistled by too close for comfort.In the week before Nikolaus' Day father occasionally brought  sweets or cookies home from work. \"I've passed Nikolaus in the street and he let me take these from his basket\". Children believed every word adults uttered.We were also busy writing wish lists for Nikolaus. Times were still very hard and abundant presents not taken for granted as they are today. Our requests were more modest than those of today's children. Wooden toys, a doll, sweets and biscuits, nuts and fruit and a picture book or two; anyway, you couldn't fit a lot into a wooden clog. I never wore them but I had a pair just for Nikolaus Day, because they were the appropriate receptacle for Nikolaus' gifts on the Lower Rhine.I am glad to say that the custom of frightening children with the spectre of a vengeful Knecht Ruprecht ended during my childhood. It was usually my uncle who dressed up as Nikolaus and it didn't take us children long to work it out for ourselves. Knecht Ruprecht was said to be waiting outside by the sleigh, but the adults gave up the pretence of even that.  Historically, St Nicholas was a fourth-century bishop of Myra in Asia Minor. Legend says he was so pious even as a baby that he would only suckle once on feast days. He is said to have saved three maidens from prostitution by covertly throwing three golden balls for their dowries through their window by night; and to have miraculously revived three murdered boys pickled in a brine-tub. He is thus the special patron of children (as well as of pawnbrokers, who use his three golden balls as a sign).The story of how St. Nikolaus brought me gifts when I was a little girl is told in anearlier post"},
{"title": "The Wax Angel  -  2nd Sunday in Advent", "date": "Sunday 5 December 2010", "text": "Michael GeussA STORYafter Leonid Andrejewfrom the RussianThere were times when Sascha was a stubborn little boy, wilful and disobedient. He didn’t want to get up in the morning, he didn’t want to wash in cold water, he didn’t want to go to school. Being only eight years old, he wasn’t sure how to go about getting his own way, he therefore did as he was told but he did it badly, lazily. When it came to  Christmas and the end of year school report, his was not good at all.Sascha went to his father, whom he loved very much. He hoped that father would not be so very angry with him.“Sascha”, father said, “why ever are you such a stubborn boy? And look, the Sweschnikows have sent you an invitation to the gift giving ceremony under their Christmas tree.The Sweschnikows were rich people who paid for Sascha’s schooling. Before Sascha’s father fell ill and had been retired on a pitiful pension he had worked for them.Sascha really didn’t want to go, they were sure to ask how he was getting on at school. But his mother insisted and his father said “do go, Sascha, perhaps they will give you a small present for me, it has been a week since I last had tobacco for my pipe”. Sascha went.The children were shouting with excitement and running about madly before they were allowed into the hall where the gifts were to be distributed. Then the doors opened and, holding their breath in anticipation, eyes wide open, they ran in and came to where a wonderfully tall Christmas tree stood, gleaming with decorations and blazing candles.The children circled the tree, admiring the many beautiful things hanging from its branches. Suddenly, Sascha stopped. High up, near the top, he had seen a wax angel, transparent wings trembling a little in the warmth of the burning candles. The angel looked as if it would fly off at any time.Sascha stared for a long time.  He wanted the angel, wanted it for his own.In spite of being a shy boy in such splendid surroundings, he ran to the lady of the house.“Please, let me have the angel, O, please do”, he pleaded.“Dear boy, that is not possible, everything has to remain on the tree until New Year’s Day. Only then will the decorations be taken down and given to the children”.Sascha’s heart sank. “O please”, he begged, “ I promise to be good from now on, I will do my work and I will never be disobedient again”.The lady smiled but remained firm.Sascha changed tack. He fell on his knees. “I must have the angel”, he sobbed.The lady grew disturbed. “You silly boy”, she said, “it is only  God to whom you pray on your knees; get up and you shall have the angel”.When Sascha held the angel in his hands, he looked up at her, smiling blissfully through his tears. He ran from the hall, found his coat and made for home.His mother had gone to bed, tired out by the hard cleaning work she did.His father was waiting for him in the kitchen.“Look how beautiful the angel is”, he said to his father.“Yes”, his father replied, “there is something very special about him; watch out, or he might fly away”.They took the angel and put its string over a nail by the stove.As they sat and looked, the angel seemed to change, grow larger and more luminous; it’s wings trembled more than ever. . . . . . . . . the room and everything in it sank into the background, the smoking lamp, the rough furniture, the grimy wallpaper, all vanished. The old man once again inhabited a world where he was strong and able to work, a time when life was good, bright and full of hope . . . . . . .  the angel  had come to him and sent a ray of light into his grey, monotonous existence. Next to the old man sat the boy at the beginning of life, his eyes shining, as happily lost in dreams as the old man. Presence and future disappeared. The angel absorbed Sascha’s nebulous dreams of beauty, hope and the yearning he carried in his soul, absorbed them and gave them back, radiating light and warmth. The wings trembled mysteriously.Sascha and the old man slept.The angel hung on his nail. Gradually the heat of the stove softened the wax and the first heavy drops fell. Thick rivulets of wax ran down his legs and feet, and, finally, the whole angel quivered as if he were really about to fly, and fell on to the hot plate of the stove. A cockroach came to investigate the shapeless mass and hastily withdrew.Morning entered the room, the milkman clattered his cans in the street – the angel had gone.The angel had gone, but it did not matter. His brief existence had given great happiness to two human beings for this one night.translation USW"},
{"title": "The Fourth Window Opens On  St. Barbara's Day", "date": "Saturday 4 December 2010", "text": "St Barbara's MartyriumLucas Cranach the Elder 1510-15Metropolitan Museum of ArtSo many of the legends about the Catholic Saints  are bloodthirsty affairs and the life St Barbara is no exception. She is said to have lived at the end of the 3rd Century in Nikomedia, now Izmit in Turkey. Her father imprisoned her in a high tower, to discourage her many suitors. He liked it even less when she became a Christian and he had her tortured and, finally, beheaded her himself, whereupon he was instantly struck by lightning and killed. Historically, she appears a rather unlikely figure, but she is, nevertheless, one of the best known Catholic Saints.In Germany she is mainly the patron saint of miners. Woodcarvers in the Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge) in Saxony always carve her as a companion piece to the figure of the miner. In mining villages even now miners dress in traditional uniforms on St Barbara's Day and go in procession to receive \"St Barbara's Light\", to protect them from danger underground.Ore mine Konrad (left) and Salt Mine Asse (right)There are a number of customs  connected with St Barbara.A very pleasant one is that of the \"Barbara Branch\". Cut a twig of apple or cherry tree and place it in water. Leave it in a cool room and by Christmas the twigs should  blossom,  an omen for good luck in the new year. Even if the blossoms drop quickly, the flowering branch in the middle of a North European winter is a little miracle in itself. If you want to make absolutely sure of success, use a few forsythia twigs; a small cheat perhaps, but guaranteed to work.Traditionally, women would cut the name of the man they hoped to marry into the wood. If the branch blossomed that meant that the chosen one loved you back. We have more direct ways today, of course, but simply asking the chap takes away the frisson of uncertainty.This custom of bringing bare branches of apple and cherry wood into the house might even be one of the precursors  to the Christmas tree. In Franconia, in the 18th Century, the flowering branches were decorated with sweet stuffs, nuts and fruit for children, a kind of poor man's Christmas tree perhaps."},

You think you have it bad?That's nothing. Just read what the Rev Francis Kilvert wrote in his diary for Christmas Day 1870:As I lay awake praying in the early morning, I thought I heard a sound of distant bells.It was an intense frost. I sat down in my bath upon a sheet of thick ice which broke in the middle into large pieces whilst sharp points and jagged edges stuck all around the sides of the tub like chevaux de frise, not particularly comforting to the naked thighs and loins, for the keen ice cut like broken glass.The ice water stung and scorched like fire. I had to collect the floating pieces of ice and pile them on a chair before I could use the sponge and then I had to thaw the sponge in my hands for it was a mass of ice.The morning is most brilliant. Walked to the Sunday School with Gibbins and the road sparkled with millions of rainbows, the seven colours gleaming in every glittering point of hoar frost.

He began to keep a diary in 1870 in which he described the people he met and the places he visited in fascinating detail. Many of his journals were destroyed, but some were later published and became famous as Kilvert's Diaries because they gave a rare picture of country life in the late Victorian years."},

It included old churches, old railways, old gas-lit streets, old country towns, old dons and old invalids; it also gave him a distaste for much of what was considered to represent progress.

Snow has dressed lanes and fields, streams and woods in white garments, and fence posts wear top hats.  The slate-grey blanket of snow-filled sky hangs low over the hills, if you look to it for warmth you will be disappointed. A biting wind drives snowflakes like the shepherd herds his sheep. all is white confusion, silent cold rattles my bones.Carefully, I climb the icy stile into the lane.As I leave the track that leads me from the wood on the hill into the valley, early dusk settles on hedges and hangs in the trees lining the lane. Below me lights appear in the gloaming, it is teatime and the little houses prepare for families to gather round the glow of the fire.I reach my house and, as I enter, the warmth of the range in the kitchen greets me.  I’ve already changed from boots into shoes and dumped my sweet smelling, green  burden on the table in the  shed.I’ve been out to cut a large pile of pine branches and twigs, up in the woods, some with their cones still on them. In the next few days they will be distributed all over the house, bundled into vases and other receptacles. Soon the whole house will smell of Christmas.Woolly gloves and hat come off, I shrug myself out of my coat and hang it from the ceiling dryer to let the last snowflakes melt. I unwind the scarf from around my neck and lean against the Aga to warm my hands. In spite of wearing gloves the tips of my fingers are numb with cold.Benno’s eyes watch what I do. It is feeding time and he is letting me know. He’s been a very good boy, patiently waiting for me to choose what I want, instead of running off after rabbits.Soon Beloved and I are settled comfortably, Benno at our feet, drinking tea and eating spiced biscuits and Stollen. It is the season of Advent and the little light on the table burns brightly and steadily.It’s been a good day, there’s an equally pleasant evening ahead. A long drawn out evening, supper is to come and perhaps we’ll linger over a glass of wine, but for now I am happy to let the hot tea and cosy temperature of the room seep into my chilled bones; I lean back in my chair and rest.Soft music, again seasonal, plainsong, Gregorian chant, medieval and renaissance music plays in the background.A pile of books sits on the floor by my chair, all of them containing stories based on the season, which I will pick up, one by one, and study for possible items for Friko's Advent Calendar. Normally, I just read them at this time of year, every year over again, I never tire of them. Some are tales for children, some classical literature from all over the world, some are fables and fairy tales, there’s poetry too.This year I will read them differently, choose some of the shorter ones, translate them where necessary and share them with you, dear friends, hoping that you too will derive some pleasure from them.Happy Advent!Sincerely,Friko"},

{"title": "I Did It! I Wrote a Sonnet!", "date": "Monday 22 November 2010", "text": "Some of you know that I have very recently started to attend a Creative Writing class. Last week's homework was to write a sonnet. A proper, Shakespearean sonnet.' 4-4-4-2'. abab, cdcd, efef, gg.So,  \"Go away and write a sonnet\", she said.She gave us exactly twenty minutes' worth of explanation, a few pointers where to find examples and one of her own, which she admitted, was not perfect.  One line was not a perfect pentameter!I ask you! How could she!Ever since I left class last week I have been in a tremendous tizzy. Firstly, I lacked an idea. Write a sonnet about what? Love, a philosophical question,  a special object ? You have to start with an idea for a subject, otherwise you're stuck from the off.I tried roses, love and philosophy not growing so well on my compost. I got as far as a first line for the first quatrain.  Then I tried out various techniques, like a whole lot of words that rhyme with roses or rosebushes, petal, scent and blushing brides, mildew, mulch and manure.No mileage in that. I can grow roses, but not their poetic equivalent.I read reams of sonnets. The more I read the more I knew I could never write one.I asked Jinksy for help - you know the annoying blogger whose blog is riddled with poems, all her own. She sent me one of hers, a perfect example of the art, telling me how easy it is. I can tell you I was sorely tempted to pinch it and pass it off as my own. I could always feign illness and miss the class, hoping that teacher would have moved on to a nice, easy, short story, or maybe the definitive novel of the 21st century by the next lesson. I might have stood a chance with them.It was that clever blighter, good old Stephen Fry, national treasure and avuncular polymath, and The Ode Less Travelled, who unlocked the poet within and helped me to give birth to my very own first sonnet. I imagined his fruity tones reading the chapter on sonnets and setting me an exercise, very kindly supplying the subject too. Apathy.And would you believe, it worked. It is a dreadfully bad sonnet, a lot of rubbish, actually, (no, you do not get to say it isn't), but although it is definitely rubbish, it is rubbish in sonnet form. To choose our rulers we have won the right,To stand up and be counted, one by one,To fight against oppression with our might,And brothers all, we did what must be done.In modern times, the voters do not careTo vote, electoral apathy wins,We moan and rail against our rulers’ fareBut we do not use the polls, for our sins.I too am one of those who do not useThe polls, my right was taken from me whenI chose to live among an alien muse,Her law being mightier than my pen.But what’s the point, why should we vote, (for shame!)Nothing would change, rulers are all the same."},
{"title": "A Country Man", "date": "Saturday 20 November 2010", "text": "It is gardener's 65th birthday tomorrow. It's been a thoroughly cold and dank day, the mist hardly lifted at all across the valley; still, we succeeded in pruning all the rose bushes.Some needed staking too, the storms last week loosened the roots of several bushes. They suffer tremendously from wind rock and could even die over winter if they are not secured. After pruning they got a good dressing of mulch to soak into the roots. All that cosseting means that we'll have a good show of blooms again next year.Gardener told us that his missis will take him out for a meal tomorrow, in honour of his birthday. Seeing that she's paying, he plans to go for the best steak they have on the menu.  She'll be choosing the pub, if it were left to him, he'd probably go for a 'all-you-can-eat' meal. He remembered a very memorable meal, he said, where he piled his plate so high that he couldn't fit everything he wanted on it. He asked the serving staff  \"either give me another plate or a bigger one\". \"When they call it 'all-you-can-eat' then they'll have to give you as much as you can eat\".  He has a point.He also likes Sunday Carvery meals, when the choice is limited to one or two roasts, plenty of vegetables and one of these large, stodgy puddings like spotted dick or treacle tart.\"The turkey was massive\", he said, \" the chap gave me seconds once. I went back and said that I hadn't any meat left to go with my vegetables\". He added, for good measure, \" I likes a big dinner\".Gardener is one of fifteen children, seven brothers and seven sisters. I asked \"one every year?\"\"No, he said, \"they left proper gaps, eighteen months for the first eight or nine, more later\". Poor Woman. There was also at least one still birth. Gardener then went into a monologue on how suckling mothers don't fall pregnant, \"she should have kept us all on the tittie for longer\", he giggled. Gardener is a great one for laughing, there is humour in every kind of situation for him.As a small child he suffered with serious migraines. \"I was teacher's pet\" he said, \"I remember that I sat on her lap in class when she was reading stories\". He continued, \"she could tell when I was feeling poorly and she'd sit me on the floor in a corner, because I was bound to be very sick in a bucket before I felt better again. Then she let me sit on her lap and I'd go to sleep\".He and his brothers used to run the first 1 1/2 miles to school across the fields. They then picked up a mini school bus which took them to the nearest town. The driver was a lady whose little daughter sat on the single seat right in front, nearest her mother.\"She was a nasty little girl\", he said, \"Priscilla, her name was. Stuck-up she was. She used to turn round and poke her tongue out at us. So, when we got off the bus, we always gave her a little tap\".Then, with one of his laughs, \"she only went and married my eldest brother\", he said, \" she was fifteen years younger than him. He divorced her again \", he said,  gleefully, \"we could have told him it wouldn't work\". Gardener left school at fourteen and went \"on the land\". From the stories he tells, his life must have been very hard. He doesn't see it that way. He agrees that he has always worked very hard, from when he was a small boy, even before he left school. Country children work with livestock and in the fields almost from the day they learn to walk.Gardener is tough and weather beaten, he does the work of two men, although he has lately taken to sit over his tea breaks for a little longer than he used to.  I am happy that he should do so, under strict supervision and with a tight rein on his bonfire sessions,  he is still worth his weight in gold and a mine of information on genuine country life. He is also willing to put up with us in spite of being townies from 'off'."},

Fallen leaves rot on sodden paths. Grey day follows grey day.The feast of All Hallows on the first of the month is followed by the day we remember our dead, the feast of All Souls. It is the day when the whole family gets together to meet at the graveside of those they have lost.In my childhood we travelled to my mother’s home village. Early in the morning we stood on a draughty station platform, stamping our feet and clapping our hands together to keep warm, waiting for the local train to transport us from the smoky town to the sleepy little village crouching among streams, mist shrouded fields, and an occasional avenue of poplars marching into the distance. Farm houses, surrounded by barns on three sides, lay low, broad and solid among them, sheltered by a stand of oak or beech trees from the prevailing East winds.Photo thomas mayer archiveIt was a homely, comfortable landscape.Inside the stuffy carriage with its wooden seats you could smell the smoke snaking back from the engine. It was a short journey, with half a dozen stops at villages and a small market town along the way, but the regular rat-tat-tat of the wheels induced a light doze in the fug inside the carriage.It was hard to alight into the cold, damp, air at our destination. We still had a long way to walk tograndfather’s house, where we thawed out with a steaming mug of coffee. Aunt Little Kate gave us lunch, usually a hearty soup and good country bread, before the whole family got ready to walk to the cemetery, which was about 2 miles out of the village. We passed the forbidding reddish brown brick structure of the nunnery and convent school, looming out of the mist, and walked along an avenue of horse chestnut trees, the candle decked branches a picture in spring but now dark and bare, shiny brown conkers freed from their prickly wrappers sprinkled in the dead leaves underfoot.The cemetery itself was enclosed by low stone walls, with large wrought iron gates in the side nearest the road. There were no other buildings there, no houses, no trees, just bare open fields, leaving the East wind to whistle through you to the bone.At the graveside, the men fussed over positions for the wreaths and bouquets they had been carrying, the women lit everlasting candles in red plastic holders and set them on the flat stones, each of which denoted the final resting place of one of their ancestors or siblings.  Great grandparents lay there, grandmother too, and uncles and aunts who had died young. There was room for grandfather and a few more, who had yet to die.“The grave is looking good, the cemetery gardener has made a good job of it this year.”  And  a mumbled “wonder who’ll be next, will we all still be here next year?”The mourners for the day stood around in the biting wind, murmuring platitudes and wishing themselves out of it and back in Aunt Little Kate’s warm kitchen but not quite daring to suggest retreat for as long as grandfather stood his ground.“The old man is going to catch his death of cold”, his daughters whispered, “somebody should get him to move.”Grandfather was a stubborn old man, he knew the family had had enough but he would be the one to decide the time to leave, even if it killed him.Finally, they all set off again, the short day was ending and various family members had trains to catch. Only uncle Hans, who owned a small transport business, had a car. It was too soon after the war, before the economic miracle took hold, a very few owned private cars.Aunt Little Kate provided more coffee and cake; the talk was loud and free now, the relief at having escaped for another year palpable. They were alive, they had survived, things were looking up.“See you at Christmas”, they said jovially, and “get home safely”.“Gute Reise”.By six we were stumbling back through the dark night to the station; no street lighting in those days to show you the potholes waiting to trip you up.Walking home from the station in town was purgatory for the aching legs of a small child. It had been a long day, I was ready to fall into a dark and dreamless sleep."},
{"title": "Lunch With A Difference", "date": "Sunday 14 November 2010", "text": "We had a lunch party yesterday, where the combined age of the four guests was 335 years.Is that a record in blogland?It was not a duty party and I gave it not primarily out of kindness, although that did play a role.Two of the guests had recently lost their partners, a widow and a widower, and I know that bereaved people like to be provided with a safe place to talk about the person they lost. A simple lunch where the others knew the deceased is just such a place. I was certainly not trying to matchmake.An interesting point came up. The guests complimented me on the food and in the course of a discussion of TV chefs, recipes and cooking habits, Bob, still one half of a couple, asked:\"Would you cook like this if you were on your own? Do you take pleasure in cooking for its own sake, in cooking for others, or for the pleasure of eating?\"I had to think. I enjoy cooking, it can be a creative outlet. I enjoy eating, I enjoy entertaining; I am also lazy and like to do as little as possible but still make an impression. Beloved and I keep a reasonable table, we eat very little in the way of convenience food and have one home cooked hot meal every day we are at home.Nobody can say for certain what they will do at a time in the future. My answer was:\"Yes, I would still cook enjoyable meals. I would buy more special things from delicatessens' counters, small quantities of luxury foods, perhaps more ready made meals with fancy ingredients. I believe food is a pleasure, not just fuel, and there is much to be said for treating oneself kindly. I would also hope to be able to open a bottle of wine with my meals, even if it would take me three days to drink it on my own.\"The men round the table thought that they would probably not bother to cook much, although all three have cooked meals for themselves and their partners in the past; pub meals were mentioned and beans on toast. Allan said that most men wouldn't know how and would probably be unwilling to learn. Pauline, the widow, said, she certainly cooks herself good meals; any leftovers would be coming in handy another time. Pauline also said, that there is usually a bottle waiting to be finished in her fridge.Is this really just a straight male/female divide? Is this a generation thing? Do people still cook proper meals or do they make do with TV cookery programmes while  eating  take-away?I know what I prefer."},
{"title": "First Love", "date": "Friday 12 November 2010", "text": "Lorenzo Quinn  -  First LoveThere are nights when sleep will just not come to me and all that remains to do is to give up and give in, and compose myself in patience, allow myself to drift.Mentally, I spread my wings and let my thoughts go where they will, flying high above the landscape of my memories, alighting here and there on the peaks and skimming the troughs.One night recently I landed on a memory dear to me, but long in the past. When I was seventeen, there was a boy I loved very much. He was nineteen, a college drop-out, a bit wild, tall and lanky, who owned a Vespa. He was my first true love. We suffered all the pangs that young love brings, the heartache, the joy, the delirium; it was a time of soul-stirring, blood-quickening intensity. I have fallen in love since, each time there has been great excitement, but no later love has been as sweetly innocent, as new and shiny, as that first one. Neither set of parents approved, which made the experience all the more delicious. My schoolwork suffered, he vacillated between working and going back to college. When a parent put their foot down we broke up, only to get back together again promptly.We had a blissful time of it, gloriously melodramatic, bitter-sweet; the kind of young love the great poets describe:LoveJoyfulAnd sighfulAnd pensive in turns,Now easing,Now freezingIn anguish that burns,Drowned in despair,Demented with bliss,The lover aloneKnows what happiness is.GoetheAlas, it didn’t last. His parents moved away and for almost a year he came back every few weeks, hitchhiking on the Autobahn, a distance of 600 km, a journey which took him from between twelve to eighteen hours, depending on the kindness of drivers.Then it was me who left, I started a course in the UK which was to last for two years. We wrote each other passionate letters, but the inevitable happened. Life intervened, new experiences, jobs, studies, and eventually, a new love. He was heartbroken; occasionally, he visited my mother who, very unwillingly, gave him news of me. My new love soon failed but the misery of that commitment continued for many years.We met just once more, many years later, in London. Germany and England played against each other at football and my first love came over with a group to watch the match at Wembley Stadium.In the event, he missed it. We met at Piccadilly Circus, in the midst of vast crowds; the meeting was to be a very quick one, before he was to join his mates at Wembley.Instead, we walked to Hyde Park, spending the whole of a brilliantly sunny afternoon sitting on a park bench; catching up, reminiscing, regretting what might have been and never was; finally falling silent.We didn’t kiss until we said goodbye at the turnstile into the Underground station, he to return to his hotel to pick up his bag, me to take the train back to my unhappy life.We could so easily have gone to his hotel;  perhaps it was too late for both of us.It is true what they say, you only regret the things you didn’t do."},

It has helped me to post both my reply to it and my own, unrelated, post following below, on the same afternoon.Schubert At The PianobyGustav KlimtTo understand the post title you have to go to the last post. If you don't want to do that, just watch me gloat!Can you hear me buzz?  See me fizz? A bee in high summer with pollen available by the bucket load couldn't buzz louder. The best vintage champagne has nothing on me when it comes to fizz.I have had the most marvellous day yesterday.It started with a very positive review from he The Weblog Review People which put me in a good mood. Try as I might, I couldn't find the derisive laughter between the lines, so I gave up searching for it.First stop of the day was a new venture. I have joined a proper creative writers group, with a teacher who actually rips your work to shreds. She is a tiny person, slim and lively, with a sharp mind, a quick eye for a ridiculous turn of phrase and the capacity to reduce her pupils to gibbering wrecks, in a nice way, of course; give her her due, she grudgingly allows you the hint of a brownie point when you've done well.A quick stop in a lay-by to swallow a sandwich, then off to the next Buzz stop, a meeting of the German Conversation Group of the University of the Third Age (U3A), where we listened to Schubert Lieder and  discussed the (very average) poetry which Schubert used for them. The 'poets' were his friends, hence his, to my mind, rather misguided choice. Never mind, we soon dismissed the poetry and gave full  attention to his music. These were old recordings by Dietrich Fischer Dieskau, still among the best ever.The group has a leader who is a highly intelligent, widely read, multi linguist, who used to be a teacher and has the teacher's failing, in that he likes the sound of his own voice.  (Sorry all you lovely teachers among my blogging buddies, but you have to admit that talking comes easily). This teacher, an excellent fellow otherwise, also likes to add a little giggle to the end of many of his sentences.By the time evening came round I was too high to worry about cooking,so we went to The White Horse at Valley's End.The table in the alcove by the wood burner was waiting for us.All that culture gives me a thirst.PS: I really like teachers, some of my bestfriends, etc, etc."},
{"title": "Elitism ?", "date": "Monday 8 November 2010", "text": "At the last meeting of the poetry reading group, somebody absent that evening was reported as having complained that the group had become too precious, the poetry too high-brow, too difficult. My manners are sadly lacking, so I jumped in, instantly, with both feet. I will allow high-brow and difficult, but I will not allow precious.Precious in this context is a derogatory term, almost an insult.It was a fascinating evening;  an exploration of  Seamus Heaney’s lyrical translation of ‘Beowulf’, a heroic narrative written some time between the seventh and tenth centuries, in the language which is now called Anglo-Saxon or Old English. We  soon got off the poem itself and into all sorts of literary, historical, religious and even scientific avenues.  Several people there knew their stuff, the background to pre-mediaeval, Anglo-Saxon tradition;  I love the sort of discussion where the mention of one thing inevitably leads to another, a kind of intellectual ramble; I had a great time.As a non-native, even after decades of living here, I still have to be careful what I say, or, at least, how I say it. Impulsiveness usually gets me into trouble; so I try to choose my words carefully. Something is ‘precious’ when it is seen as affectedly refined, a little camp.  Anyone who enjoys poetry rather than simple, popular, verse, is definitely suspect.  (Perhaps that’s another reason I like blogging: I have never come across so many people who openly admit a liking for poetry, even write it themselves! as in blogland).There was a Tory MP several years ago, who, when discussing funding of art institutes in this country, brought up ballet and opera. Of ballet, in particular, he said,“What is that but a lot of poofters prancing around in tights”.He and many others  maintain that no sane person could actually care for opera, ‘a load of screeching and dramatics’, costing a lot of money and really only of interest to a small elite.Fair enough, they don’t like it. I can accept that.There is an atmosphere in this country, which ridicules people who openly admit a liking for a high-brow art form.  Elitism. being elitist, have come to be pejorative terms too. Mention going to the theatre and it is assumed that you saw a show, a musical, a lightweight piece where all the performers are known by their TV appearances. At best, you are permitted to go to an open-air production of say, a Shakespeare play, or a concert in the park, where the picnic before the show and during the interval is the main event.I am very happy to watch a whodunit on TV, a populist documentary or a costume drama. I might not go for the reality or talent show formula – my arthritic toe can’t  stay curled for long -  but I really don’t mind if watching people being publicly humiliated and tortured is your favourite evening’s entertainment.Of course, the lady who complained about the kind of poetry being read and discussed at the meetings has a point; every member should feel comfortable with what’s on offer. We’ll have to ask her to be more specific about her objections.Perhaps a compromise is in order.As for me? I’ll stay an unreconstructed cultural elitist,  occasionally happily slipping into the elasticated waistband of popular culture."},

It's enough to make a dog weep.  And messing about with walkies too? What's that all about?\"What have I done to deserve that?\" You can see in his eyes how hurt he is.In case you're wondering about the five meals a day: he has a delicate stomach and needs his food divided into small portions, at regular intervals.

He thinks it would make life easier for all of us.This heron is standing in his very own assembly line of food, silently, infinitely patient, almost trancelike.Very occasionally he shifts position and, with great deliberation, steps sideways, like a stilt-walker, for a better vantage point.  Every so often that sharp beak stabs down and brings up a tasty morsel.  I stood and watched him for a long time; a perfect tool for meditation.From The Heron by Theodore RoethkeHe walks the shallow with an antic grace.The great feet break the ridges of the sand,The long eye notes the minnows hiding place.His beak is quicker than a human hand.I have recently been honoured with not one, not two, but three awards.  It is time I displayed this honour here and now.  Herrad at her blog Access Denied - Living with Multiple Sclerosisgave me the first one.I am one of those moaning minnies who frequently whine and complain - well, we should all go and see what this patient and brave lady has to cope with, her unfailing humour and courage in the face ofthis beastly disease is an example to us all.Val of monkeys on the roof gave me this one.I have only recently discovered Val, who lives on a Nature Reserve in South Africa.I understand that internet access is  only so-so; in spite of it she manages to post fantastic posts telling us about her world and the world of the animals who share it.Val's blog is better than a nature program on TV; her stories are instant and immediate, they talk about yesterday and today, rather than what happened last spring.Jinksy of napple notes is a long time favourite.Or she would be, if she didn't take the mickey so mercilessly.Usually in verse form!Anyway, she took it upon herself to design, execute and hand over this award for me and me alone - I am saying this here, Jinksy, so you can't change your mind and distribute it amongst all and sundry -.Thank you all very much."},
{"title": "The Bremen Town Rock Musicians", "date": "Wednesday 3 November 2010", "text": "WILLOW'S MAGPIE No. 39One day, a long time ago, I was walking in the forest near the town of Bremen, when I came across a very old cat, seemingly all alone and lost. I rather like cats. “Here, kitty, kitty”, I called out and from my pocket pulled out a bit of sandwich which was meant to be my lunch. I held it out in front of me and the cat came closer. I knelt down, still holding out a morsel, when I felt sharp teeth going into my leg through the cloth of my trousers. I yelped and looked round, seeing that a mangy cur had got hold of my leg, fangs bared and slobbering. “Let go, you nasty beast”, I shouted, trying to kick at it with my free foot.The dog held on. By now the cat had come close enough to snatch the bread;it ignored the bread, however, and sank its teeth into my hand instead, causing me excruciating pain.I shouted and screamed, kicked and cursed, the beasts held on.“Hallo, hallo, hallo, what have we here”; a shrill voice rang out from the wood and a ragged donkey appeared.“What’s all the fuss about”, the donkey brayed, ‘ you are making enough noise to wake the dead”. The donkey continued “ Griselda, Grimper, let go  for now, but keep a close eye on this human; we know they can’t be trusted”.Cat and dog let go. I sat on the ground, rubbing my wounds. The donkey asked me what I was doing in the forest, so far from other humans. “Walking, just walking”, I said. “Minding my own business and trying to be kind to the cat.”“Walking? Just walking?” the donkey clearly didn’t believe me.  “Just walking?” it repeated. “Being kind? Humans being kind?”The donkey swished his tail, the dog scratched its flank, the cat yawned. Finally the donkey said “ this is a matter to lay before the boss, let’s call him.”The three produced the most earsplitting noise. it was worse than being mauled. The donkey noticed that I winced. “We are singing to our conductor and soloist. When he comes he’ll sort this problem out for us. Conductors and soloists have special powers, you’ll see”.Sure enough, a fourth creature appeared from the top of the trees, flying down to us, crashing into trunks and branches on the way. His coat was moth eaten and he’d lost most of his tail feathers a long time ago, his comb  but a floppy semblance of his former crown.The donkey cleared its throat. “This human was found trespassing. He says he was walking, just walking and being kind. What shall we do with him?”The cock croaked. He cawed. He stalked up and down and round and round.“He was being kind, you say? Hmmm”. The cock scratched at the ground.He seemed to come to a decision.“Humans are never kind”, he said. “All four of us were threatened with death by our former masters. Would you believe, they were going to turn me into soup? We all ran away before they could do for us; we decided to be our own boss, form a band and earn our living that way. Our kind of music is all the rage and we will soon have earned enough for homes in Florida, Acapulco, Paris and Berlin. In the meantime we live in a very desirable residence right here in the forest. The former owners, a band of robbers, kindly left it to us when they were suddenly called away.”Hearing this sad story almost broke my heart. “ I am so very sorry for the treatment you have received at the hand of humankind’” I said; “Let me make it up to you. You can trust me, I never hurt an animal.”“And how would you do that, make it up to us, I mean,” the cock asked.Out of nowhere, I had a brainwave. Sitting there on the ground, the idea hit me. I knew what I would do.“I am going to become your manager,” I said.And that’s why I now have second and third homes all over the world. The band? They’re doing fine, since you ask. Still in that wood near Bremen, but we’re getting there. We’re getting there."},

She calls it the most sterile environment she has ever lived in.Personally, I have no experience of a gated community. They exist in the UK too, are often born out of a fear of crime and usually very expensive places to live. You would therefore think that they are meant  solely 'for people like us', you would think that the residents have a lot in common and would band together in a real community.Not so, according to Nancy.  Far from it, in fact. It seems that the word 'community' is a misnomer here.Here at Valley's End there is not a 'Keep Out' gate anywhere, the only gates we have are front gates, picket gates, garden gates, gates to keep stock in, and gates for decorative purposes only.All roads and lanes lead to open country all around, secretive footpaths invite rambling without let or hindrance. If you meet someone unknown, you greet them, and if they give you half a chance, you involve them in a conversation about the weather, where they come from, what they are doing in the area, where they are staying if they are on holiday; most importantly, how they like it here.So far I have met only with friendliness and courtesy from visitors. Nobody has yet said: \"it would be paradise if it weren't for the nosy locals\".According to the Valley Diary, which is  produced entirely by people in our community, there are currently 27 local societies, as well as Church groups, school related groups, good neighbour groups,  groups providing emergency transport. We have a village hall and a Museum. We also have our own surgery and dispensary, a hardware shop, 2 butchers, a small supermarket, a shop selling flowers and a few groceries, a newsagent's and a hairdresser's. All that for about 700 inhabitants and a further 200 people living in the outlying hamlets and on farms.All societies flourish; admittedly, it is mainly incomers who do the work, provide the meals on wheels, run the elderly to hospitals or sit with them and pick up prescriptions. Much is run by committee, on the whole, people mean well and are kind, even if some might try to boss others around.  Much is achieved by a small number of volunteers and large amounts of money are collected almost weekly through the many fundraising events held by the societies.In a small community like ours good neighbourliness is all, without it, many people would find daily life difficult.  You pop in to see if Mrs. Smith is alright, minding your own business is not an option. Of course, that can cause problems, Mrs. Smith sometimes resents the interfering busybody who checks on her, but at other times she is very grateful.Having moved here from the big city, I find this community a little claustrophobic at times; we don't have any of Nancy's gates, but there is the danger  of living in a different kind of enclosure, that of smallhorizons and closed minds; rural communities in the UK tend to look inwards.But closed minds and small horizons are to be found in big cities too and if being part of this community means that everybody and his wife knows that I crashed into the gateposts of Mrs. Brown's wide open gate and pulls my leg over it, so be it. At least Mrs. Brown isn't reporting me and the matter is settled as it should be: in a neighbourly fashion."},

During an important anatomy exam, she stood at the dissecting table and watched an attendant carry a tray holding an object covered with a cloth towards her. Students were not given exam details in advance and she therefore awaited disclosure of the object nervously.The cloth was removed and to her utter amazement, there, on the tray, rested the head of Sir Adrian Boult, which she recognized immediately and which she had last seen attached to his body, very much alive, conducting her and the orchestra from the rostrum.Sir Adrian Boult had died and left his body to medical science.. . . . . . .  and Sir George’s Reputation.It is a well-known fact that medicine and music have a great affinity for each other. Medics often love music as much or even more than musicians do.Beloved tells a story, which goes something like this:When he was in imminent danger of losing the use of his fingering arm (i.e. the arm that holds up a string instrument), a very serious and potentially life-threatening operation to his neck was the only option. The famous medic, who happened to be the Queen’s official Neurosurgeon, who was to perform the operation, found time for a chat during prepping.“I hear you are a musician at Covent Garden; what do you think of Solti”?Beloved was one of only two members of the orchestra who actually liked and admired Sir George Solti for his rigorous and exacting approach to music and who was therefore known as a bit of a slave driver.  Beloved admitted his admiration with a clear conscience.“That’s good”, said the great man, “ the last time I had dinner with George . . . “The operation went well, the arm and Beloved’s career were saved."},

I wrote it.”Beloved, who was already employed at the Royal Opera, couldn’t believe his ears. Margaret Truman was a singer? Surely not.“Well” Eric said, “I needed a story, so I rang the White House, giving the name of The Times Of London, got through to the Press Office and asked them, if they could they please confirm the rumour that Margaret Truman was to appear on  stage at Covent Garden as a singer.” “As there had never been such a rumour, naturally, they denied it,” Eric added, \"which made the piece ‘White House denies rumour that the President’s daughter is to appear at Covent Garden’ the absolute truth”.If you didn’t already, now you know how it’s done."},
{"title": "Kaffeeklatsch", "date": "Friday 15 October 2010", "text": "The seven of them all lived in a small town in the South of England; they met, at irregular intervals, in each other’s homes; they served home baked cakes and brewed large pots of coffee, which they took while sitting around the dining table. They competed with each other to lay the prettiest, daintiest table, using lacy cloths and napkins and their best, matching china. Each one followed the rules, as their mothers had before them, and their grandmothers before them.They didn’t all come from the same country, home had been Austria and Germany, Hungary and what was once Czechoslovakia.Winter and summer, spring and autumn, they met. Before and after the coffee table ritual they sat, talked, listened to music which had long been forgotten by everybody else even in their home countries; they sat in deep chairs by the fire on cold afternoons, by wide-open windows on hot days, in kitchens and sitting rooms, garden rooms and sometimes, not often, they strayed out of doors, into the shade of the very ordinary English trees they had planted in their gardens.All of them had found a new home in England, several had found English husbands and raised English children; had you asked them, they would all have sad they were happy and contented with their lives.The seven had very little in common, three were educated professionals, three were housewives, one was a widow and long retired. They spoke English with each other, more or less fluently, with the harsh guttural sounds and rolling RR’s of Central European languages always present. Although five of them had enough German to communicate easily, shyly genteel Edith, who came from Budapest, spoke little English and no German. Agnes, also from Budapest, her exact opposite, loud and buxom, spoke both languages fluently but badly, and helped out when necessary. But it wasn’t often necessary, because the ladies appeared to communicate on a mysterious level, where each could use a mix of several languages and still be fully understood. Esther from Prague was by far the eldest; she preferred to speak nothing but English, She felt safer that way. She always wore long sleeves that covered her wrists and the number tattooed on one of them.When they met, they found common ground from deep within them, the folk memory of what life had been like long before they became adults, before they were children even, from a time before they were born. Fate had destined them to be eternal wanderers, always searching, always carrying their lives’ stories with them. In spite of their settled domesticity their roots stretched far into the distance and the past.Lucy, once a statuesque Viennese beauty, was the one who insisted on music, although it always made her cry. In the old way, the ladies took a drink after coffee, a brandy, a liqueur, a glass of wine; that, together with endless talk about the old days, the ‘people back home’, the sadness of lost youth, lost family, the yearning for ‘the way things used to be’ provoked a little tear on many occasions.Christine, also from Austria, from mountain stock, unsentimental and as beautiful, yet harsh, as the landscape that bred her, found her compatriot overly sentimental; her flame-red hair bespoke her fiery temper and her quick tongue whipped across the tears.The two Germans held back their tears for private moments. Both North European in outlook and nature, and therefore a little repressed, they were rarely loud, usually calm, and invariably amused when the Austro-Hungarian temperament enlivened the afternoon. Hedwig, a very elegant lady, who never left home without a hat, smiled graciously and blamed the drink when the noise levels rose.By late afternoon cheeks had reddened and faces grew flushed; coffee, open fruit tarts, friendship, baked cheese cakes and creamy confections, followed by a convivial, lady-like sip of the cup that cheers yet only slightly inebriates, had had a benevolent effect on the company. The meetings were a means to unburden themselves of slights or put-downs they felt they had received at the hands of the host country, as well as finding the freedom to regret the host country’s indisputably alien way of life.The ladies had all had to leave their homelands for one reason or another and these meetings were the only way they had to keep the past alive and real.For one bitter-sweet afternoon they forgot they had been uprooted.As these things go, the ladies were not connected by close friendship, but they certainly understood each other. Their bond was deeper than the bond of friendship."},

The hues exactly complement each other, I feel like the filling in a sandwich of gold.October holds on to the affirmation of life by giving us plentiful reasons for celebrating nature's bounty in the form of fairs and festivals.After the September rains, the river is finally in spate again, carrying brown soil stolen from the fields and banks further upstream on its back. The generous flow keeps trees and bushes growing alongside  green and fresh for a little while longer. Even the river seems to want to join in the celebrations, the greens and browns and the silver sparkle of the rippling water add to the carnival of colours.There is a flourish, an abundance, a fabulous cheerfulness and unashamed boastfulness about October that ill-prepares us for the reminder of death and decay that November brings.But for now, we celebrate, the bunting is out."},

Simple ingredients beautifully cooked and presented, it's a pleasure to eat there.Twenty five years ago we wouldn't have spent the money as readily, but that was not the only difference. We had a much better memory then. Yesterday, in the restaurant, while eating all this wonderful food, we were trying to work out whether he had gone to work after that first meeting, or if he'd had the evening off; neither of us could remember. By a process of elimination we worked it out: a) he was dressed in jeans and a shabby anorak, and b) both of us recalled eating a pancake in each other's company  during that first evening of meeting,  so we must have taken enough time over it to decide to meet again.Memory may have gone but we still have brilliant ideas.How would it be if some clever boffin invented a kind of memory stick, to be used by humans, a kind of Neuro-Transmitter which automatically records all your fleeting thoughts, the memos-to-self stuff. You could then plug it into your brain at a later date and retrieve the memories as and when needed.The only problem remaining then, is :WHERE DID I LEAVE THAT BLASTED STICK!"},

My therapist, on whose shoulder I wept bitter tears at such folly afterwards, advised me to erect a barrier between me and the wall of noise by means of another wall of noise, brought to me via earphones and one of these new-fangled gadgets that usually come attached with a young person in a public place.Whatever happened to admiring the scenery out of the window and thinking aimless thoughts?I am not sure that the young man who stood on the railings over a busy motorway for two days, threatening to jump, had not had a similar experience. Having thoroughly and very effectively disrupted the traffic on a busy main road into the city –  exacting revenge? – during that time, the police, who did their best to help with the disruption, finally charged him with ‘causing a public disorder’ or something and he agreed to come down. The waiter in the theatre restaurant next door told us the young man had felt peckish during his time of elevation, whereupon the authorities kindly supplied him with sandwiches; fingerfood is so much easier to manage on these occasions than balancing a plate and cutlery.The setThe new play, ‘The Habit Of Art’, is excellent. I am beginning to think that Alan Bennett has reached an age where he can indulge himself and use as many rude words, filthy ideas and sad old men as he likes. The audience at a matinee is usually of  late middle age and over, and is given to tittering in all the wrong places; at the beginning of a play every slightly salacious reference and possible double-entendre provokes a storm of giggles. Luckily the playwright, having thus got the audience’s attention, calms down by and by, and so does the audience, saving me from spontaneous combustion.Birmingham, proud of its self-awarded title, “The UK’s Second City”, is a very ambitious city indeed; the new library being built is of heroic proportions. Being unable to get through to the Art Gallery due to the afore-mentioned road blockage, we watched the dance of the cranes on the gigantic construction site instead, a different kind of art, but fascinating all the same. Unfortunately, we were chased away by a young man in a hard hat. Did he think we were going to hurl ourselves into the building chaos below?All that remained before we were shepherded back on to the bus was to have fun with the many fractured buildings all around Centenary Square, a Hall of Mirrors of gigantic proportions."},
{"title": "The Delights Of A Picnic", "date": "Saturday 2 October 2010", "text": "James TissotFrench Painter1836-1902Now that autumn is fully with us there is no longer any danger of having to find an excuse to turn down invitations to picnics. Gone are the days when tables and chairs were arranged in the shade of trees, if you were lucky, or in the full sun under an inadequate umbrella, if you were not. Sitting under trees in the garden brought you the added interest of bits of tree or a large variety of bugs falling down on you, while flying insects bit and stung you. Roasting in the sun is a particular pastime indulged in by the natives of these shores; at the first hint of a sunny day, Beloved will take off as many items of clothing as he can get away with, while still remaining decent, and spend all the hours of the day basking in the rarely glimpsed rays of the fireball in the sky. Siesta? Whatever for?Picnicking close to home, in your own garden or the garden of a near neighbour will at least allow those squeamish souls who prefer to stay under cover during the hottest part of the day to find solace indoors; offering to do some washing up or freshen the salad bowl are accepted gladly and the prospect of a confidential gossip out of earshot of the party on the lawn will always find several takers.Much, much worse is the summer picnic away from hearth and home, the kind of picnic which requires a general to organise and an army of foot soldiers to execute.You set off in a convoy of cars, having spent the previous day assembling most of the food and drink to be taken. You get up early to cut sandwiches and make salads on the day.The hour of departure arrives and you find that several parties are missing, aunt Edna and George and Kate are late; they finally turn up in a huff of bad temper; somebody got the time wrong and George spent half an hour searching for his favourite bottle opener.However, you drive off and get there, only one car losing contact with the others; but, thanks to modern technology and mobile phones, which miraculously stayed on signal, this car is soon shepherded off the wrong turn and away from the motorway and back into the fold, delaying the start of proceedings by no more than a bearable forty-five minutes.The picnic spot has been chosen in advance, an isolated clearing halfway up a hillside, reached by a bumpy track through a wood. When Dennis and Jacky first found the spot several years ago, they raved about it; the views were spectacular, they said, nobody ever went there and the air was fresh and clean.Paradise, they said.Dennis and Jacky are almost certain that the spot you finally arrive at is the one they chose all those years ago, but what is this? The view down the valley has turned into a huge new housing estate, partly ready and partly still being built; you have an uninterrupted view of JCBs, trench diggers and bulldozers, trundling up and down, as well as a camp site of caravans and pre-fabs to house the workers.However, nobody complains; you assure each other that this couldn’t have been foreseen and that you won’t let this setback spoil your picnic. You spread blankets and cushions on the grass and bring out the picnic baskets, flasks, bottles, bowls and plastic utensils. Kevin and Mary have forgotten their share of the food; Mary admits it is sitting on the kitchen counter at home where she left it in full view, to make sure she wouldn’t leave it behind.  You all laugh gaily, say ‘typical Mary and Kevin’; assuring each other that there is enough for everybody even so.Sitting on the ground is not easy, stones dig into your bottom and you need a hand to prop yourself up. You bite into a sandwich with a squishy filling, egg mayonnaise, say, and half the filling shoots out and slithers down your pretty top.George, ever the gentleman, reaches over and wipes the goo off you with his napkin, upsetting the open bottle of red wine propped up precariously between you; the wine which does not end up in the bowl of limp lettuce lands in Aunt Edna’s lap. Aunt Edna is elderly and unable to get out of the way quickly enough, but she does manage to swing her knees sideways, tipping up the dish holding chicken drumsticks, which were deliciously crisp when you packed them, and causing them to roll off the blanket in all directions.There are a few giggles at this, but the laughter is just a touch strained by now.Tea and coffee are poured, both tepid, the tea badly stewed. Slices of fruit cake are handed out and eaten quickly, before the army of ants, which has suddenly appeared out of nowhere, can get to the loaf.The men make a half-hearted attempt to lie back, Dennis, embarrassed at not having checked out the location before persuading the others to choose it for their summer picnic, even raises his arms and puts his hands under his head, saying ‘this is the life’, but his remark falls rather flat. Although they would all bite off their tongue rather than admit publicly that the picnic has been a bit of a disaster, each one of them secretly vows ‘never again’.I think I’ll start practising my excuses for next year now."},
{"title": "Awards And Other Follies", "date": "Wednesday 29 September 2010", "text": "Mark Kerstetter whose blog The Bricoleur I admire tremendously, gave me this very prestigious award a week or two ago. Mark received the award himself from  Linda at Leftbrainwave, a blog for 'proper writers'; I think if Linda knew that Mark has passed it on to me, she'd be sorely tempted to cashier him.Mark's blog is a work of art, literally; not only does he write the most elegant prose, compose poetry that compares favourably to the best around the blogosphere, he is also a painter and sculptor. As if that weren't enough, I also consider him a philosopher, so how he came to think of me on this occasion is a mystery to me. Still,  I hereby accept the award publicly and noisily, just in case he changes his mind.Thank you Mark.These things do not come without strings attached. I am meant to 'do something creative' in return for the honour. Well, therein lies the rub . . . . However, Bonnie of Original Art Studio recently asked me, when it was that I first discovered poetry. It seems to me that poetry has been a part of my life forever, but Bonnie's prompt reminded me of a particular teacher at my Grammar School in Germany, who, perhaps more than anyone else, was responsible for awakening my interest in lyricism. Miss Baumgartner was a young woman teacher, not long out of university and training college, pretty raw and clumsy, a little abrasive and unnecessarily strict. Sadly, nobody liked her much, the other teachers considered her lazy and arrogant, an opinion which soon filtered down to the pupils.Strangely, I did not share the general dislike. Miss Baumgartner was not at all attractive, in spite of her slim figure and soulful brown eyes, her dark shoulder-length hair and white skin. It must have been her clothes, which were drab and dowdy. and her dour manner, which made her appear unlikeable.Miss Baumgartner taught German, my mother tongue, and she had a great liking for, and understanding of, German literature and poetry. She was neither inspired nor inspiring, but, somehow, she spoke to me directly. Perhaps she realised that I was not as hostile or dismissive  as almost everybody else in the classwas, perhaps I was someone to hold on to in her undoubted misery as a failing teacher; anyway, I did my essays diligently, learned the poems she set us and generally behaved well in her class.Yet, without intending to do so, I succeeded in making her an object of ridicule on top of everything else.I expect the same applies in all schools, wherever they may be, that pupils are called to the front of the class to recite a poem by heart. On one occasion, Miss Baumgartner  allowed several of us to recite a poem of our own choosing; I was very pleased, I had just been given an anthology of black poetry in translation, probably the first in German ever. I was very proud of this book, read the poems over and over and had started to memorise  some of them.The poem I chose to recite was by Countée Cullen, calledFor A Lady I KnowShe even thinks that up in heavenHer class lies late and snoresWhile poor black cherubs rise at sevenTo do celestial chores. The second I finished, there was a stunned silence, then loud, raucous laughter erupted, lasting for an eternity. I stood there, hoping for the earth to swallow me up, while Miss Baumgartner's face turned bright red. When the class was finally wiping the tears of laughter from its hateful collective eye, she turned to me angrily, saying : \"you will go home, learn every word of Schiller's Glocke (an interminably long ballad) and recite it here at the next lesson\".The mother of one of my class mates was a teacher at our school. The episode did the rounds of the whole school, the teachers' common room included, within hours. I was the hero of the school. Miss Baumgartner had been made a fool of, \"serve her right\", was the general opinion.I was mortified. I duly learned 'Die Glocke' and recited it, or part of it, during the next lesson. Miss Baumgartner interrupted me after several verses and I returned to my seat. And then Miss Baumgartner did something unexpected: she pulled out from her bag a copy of 'Black Orpheus' , the very same anthology I so proudly owned. There were only two other pupils in the class, whose parents had a copy, but soon enough we were all reading and exploring black poetry from the Americas as well as Africa.Miss Baumgartner mellowed, her dress sense improved by and by, she became less awkward in her manner and she won over a number of other pupils in her class. She forgave me almost immediately, no doubt she realised that I had committed an innocent blunder rather than a deliberate attempt to ridicule her.She and I learned to recognise each other as kindred spirits and I enjoyed her lessons enormously."},
{"title": "Village Houses", "date": "Monday 27 September 2010", "text": "After the strenuous work of answering Bonnie's very personal questions and reading your, frankly, very frank replies and comments, I need time off from raving and ranting; a gentle walk through the village streets is just what the doctor ordered. There is a very busy week ahead - I'll tell you about it later, whether you want to know it or not - isn't that what we bloggers do? - but for now I'll show you where I live.This is an ancient village, to the 'real' locals, families who have lived in these hills for generations, not relative newcomers, or 'people from off' like us, it is a town, in spite of only boasting 900 souls, a number which includes people living in the surrounding hamlets; it is a town because it has a town hall. In the days before public transport and private cars, when farmers took their produce to market by horse drawn carriage, Valley's End was a flourishing market town. From miles around farm labourers, farmers, and their wives and children came to Valley's End, which had a school, the big church, many pubs, and a great variety of shops from drapers, tailors, shoe shops and cobblers, hardware stores, seed merchants, to grocers, butchers, and bakers and probably even a candlestick maker. People simply lived very simple lives centred on small communities.Many houses are built from local stone. In fact, once the Lord of the Manor had left his Castle, the local population promptly helped themselves to the fallen masonry from the crumbling building. Half of the houses in Valley's End owe their picturesque exterior to building materials 'found lying around'. This was all centuries ago, of course, nowadays the reclaimers would get there first.  The other predominant building material is red brick, as seen here in these wonderful 17th century chimneys.Farming was thirsty work. Farmers and their labourers. the craftsmen living in the town, the blacksmith and his helpers, the stallholders in the market, shopkeepers and civic dignitaries needed regular lubrication and on market days, special days and holidays, the pubs in Valley's End were busy. Now there are just three left; and one of them is closed 'for permanent refurbishment'.This is one of he lucky survivors. It even has a few bedrooms for hire.Tiny Valley's End did not only possess many pubs but also a number of churches. There was the big church, dating back nearly a thousand years, with a few anglo-saxon remnants still visible today. But there are two other chapels, the Methodist Chapel and this tiny chapel which is part of the almshouses built in 1614 to provide charitable accommodation for twelve old men of good character.The last house is a relatively new house, hidden in its pretty garden and sheltered by some very ancient trees, which were planted long before this house was even thought of;  to this house I now turn my steps, because this is where I live."},

She has even grabbed some of my photos to go with the interview - well, questionnaire really - , the whole thing is tastefully arranged, looks as handsome as everything always does on Bonnie's blog and although it doesn't quite come up to Bonnie's usual high standard of writing and is nowhere near as artistic as her own posts, it is bearable. Trust Bonnie to see to that.Now you are all meant to go and read the thing; I promise you, I've kept the answers as short, if not sweet, as I can, so you won't be bored out of your mind. Not for long, anyway. Naturally, I also want to know what you think of the thing, so leave a comment here or there, or maybe even both places?Sorry, I am fresh out of polite phrases, being knackered from the day's work and in a tearing hurry to grab a sandwich before I march off to the village hall, where they are showing Colin Firth in\"A Solitary Man\"; otherwise I am sure I would have been able to do full justice to the occasion andfound a suitably refined introduction to the great honour of appearing on Bonnie's blog.Thank you Bonnie, you are a dear.And those of you who go and read have my undying gratitude.

Momentarily, the hum of conversation lessened. With all eyes on him, he stood still, nonchalantly and supremely confident, framed by the doorway just behind him.Mrs. Montgomery came towards him; stretching out her hand. Lightly, he took it, bowed his head, and left the merest suggestion of a kiss on it. She led him into the centre of the room, to the group assembled there. She smiled and the group opened up to admit the newcomer.Miss Marjorie had coloured slightly when she had first seen him. Proximity to the man she secretly, if ill-advisedly, adored, always made her nervous. She hoped no one had noticed the slight tremor of the hand holding her glass; but all was well, nobody had noticed. Nobody ever noticed her. She sighed, raising her hand to her forehead, as if to wipe away the sad thought. As she did so, she spilled a small amount of wine, leaving a tiny red puddle on her arm.Instantly, he withdrew the snowy white handkerchief from his top pocket to assist her, wiping the spill.Col. Bottomley observed this; secretly, he was annoyed at the popinjay, as he called the latecomer.  “Not really our sort of chap”, he had said on more than one occasion, “don’t know why Old Montgomery has him in the house”.“Bit heavy on the old Acqua di Parma, old chap”, he now said, as the fragrance emanating from the scrap of cloth hit his nostrils, allowing a faint hint of distaste into the words."},

{"title": "September: Old Wives' Summer", "date": "Sunday 19 September 2010", "text": "PhotoRobins Seite: WiesendetailsSince the Julian calendar reform in 46 B.C. September has been masquerading under the wrong name, i.e. ‘The Seventh’; March was the first month in the year, and when the Romans changed the calendar they kept to the old name; force of habit, probably, they didn’t like major changes any more than we, ok then, I do.The same is true for the three following months, of course.September can be a lovely month; we bid good-bye to summer, the heat has gone, but the days are still mild and soft, in the fields the harvest is in, it is time for sowing the new crop. Radiant reds, yellows, and deep dark blues of ripening fruit glow in the branches and the vines hang heavy with grapes; September is the start of a busy time in the vineyards.This stretch of warm days, marked by a meteorological period of stable high pressure known as Indian Summer in English is called ‘Old Wives’ Summer’ in Germany.  Such weather conditions allow for wonderful, clear views across the lowlands far into the distance and trees, woods, rivers, lakes and the skies above acquire a sheen rarely seen at other times of the year. Leaves colour up intensively at this time and the kaleidoscope of nature’s tints becomes a miracle to behold.The name Old Wives’ Summer (Altweibersommer) derives from the activities of  young baldachin spiders; these spin long, silken threads which float in the air like the wispy white hair of an old women; the spiders use them to sail through the air in early autumn. These delicate strands are often no more than a glint of silver  caught unexpectedly, as they sway in the gentlest breath of a breeze, outside the window or between fence posts. They are at their very best when covered in a suspicion of dew in the light of a sunny early morning.Folk wisdom calls these gossamer threads elves’ weave, or dwarves’ weave.In the hedgerows everywhere berries are ripening. If the supply of haws and hips is particularly plentiful, it is said that a harsh winter must be expected. Green hazelnuts are ready for picking and after a hot summer walnut shells are hardening and turning pale brown.Although nature is catching her breath before the onset of autumn proper and the first frosts of winter, kitchens are busy. In September Mother was in a race with time, bottling fruit, making jams and jellies. She kept earthenware crocks filled with green beans in brine and prepared her own Sauerkraut by shredding an endless supply of white cabbages and layering it with salt and juniper berries, the whole wrapped in vine leaves.These crocks stood on shelves in the cellar; throughout winter, when green beans or Sauerkraut were part of the menu for the day, she’d go down and simply remove the wanted quantity from the crock. She also pickled vegetables, we had pickled gherkins, onions, and red cabbage. Pickled herring, plain and green herring, fried and pickled, were available for most of the year too, although she preserved the latter mainly in spring.Apples for storing over winter were selected at this time. They too had shelf space in the cellar although the larger quantities were kept in the attic.Father was busy ordering and storing potatoes, coal and firewood. It was his job to fill the designated bins and shovel the coal into the separate coal cellar from the pile which had come down the chute under the cellar window.None of these jobs, with the exception of making jams and jellies, is relevant today. We buy fruit and vegetables at any time of the year, heating comes by virtue of the national grid and we certainly no longer value that wonderful feeling, the deep satisfaction, that come with providing for the family’s needs and safeguarding its existence during the leaner time of winter.There is no need for any of that effort, that labour of love. Whether we are the richer or the poorer for our easy way of living I don’t know. That question needs more careful examination than I have time or space for here and now.What we can do is go out, watch the leaves changing colour and the baldachin spider create its pathways of silver threads in the air. Nature’s autumn fireworks are about to begin."},

Raising her eyes,  she saw HIS face,  towering over the women. looking down on her with anxious eyes. She shivered a little, HE was here, looking down at her. Dimly, she wondered, why were they looking down on her? All she remembered was being whirled about the room by HIM in a sensuous waltz, getting giddier and giddier with the excitement of it all. So why was she lying on the chaiselongue now?Her eyes found those of her sister.  Her sister came closer.“What happened?”, she whispered.“You fainted during the waltz”, her sister whispered back.“How did I come to lie on the sofa, who carried me here?”“HE did, he carried you in his arms. He carried you here, then he laid you on the sofa. I saw him put both his hands around your waist to adjust your skirts, but then Mrs. Brownlow stepped in and made him leave you”.She shivered again. A delicious feeling came over her. It had all been worth it!The time her sister and Melanie had spent pulling on her corset strings, pulling them tighter and tighter, until she could barely breathe, had been time and effort well spent. No matter that she had almost passed out on her way to the Ball, no matter that her ribcage hurt abominably, HE had noticed her tiny waist, HE had measured it with his hands,  HE had carried her perfect hourglass figure."},

The centre is well restored and preserved, with someexcellent and smart shops.This is a postcard of Fish Street, formerly called'Chepynstrete' (a market street) until the late14th century, when the name was changed andfishmongers and butchers traded here.Neither fish, flesh nor fowl are to be had here now.o-o-o-oMore culture to follow, a theatre play this time,a comedy with serious undercurrents.Four names famous in the UK: Michael Jayston, GwenTaylor, Timothy West and Susannah Yorke played retired opera singers living out their lives in a retirement home for ex-musicians.All four actors are 'off the telly' which made the elderly audience titter even before the characters spoke their first lines.  Coach party audiences are so determined to enjoy themselves, they laugh andcheer their favourites for no reason that I can see.Luckily the audience calmed down after a bit.I do so hate sitting in the midst of what could well be a canned laughter soundtrack for some brainlessTV half-hour sitcom.Yes, I do know that I am a cranky old spoilsport and a mean cow. And yes, in spite of the titters andthoughtless laughter I enjoyed the show.o-o-o-oNot done yet, not by a long chalk.The annual visit to Mid-Wales Opera was also duethis week.Verdi's Falstaff may not be everybody's singalongafavourite, but there is some great music and thecompany consisted of several excellent singers, some quite outstanding, who deserved a full house rather thanthe half empty house they had.The recession bites deeply.I am always amazed that such a small company, workingwithout massive subsidies and certainly without thepatronage the famous opera houses receive, can keep going at such a high standard.At least the audience was very appreciative.If you like opera (and if not, I'd like to know why not)and the National Tour comes anywhere near whereyou live in England, GO SEE THEM.o-o-o-oAs if all that in less than two weeks hadn't been enough excitement for my fragile state of mentalstability, I invited a few friends to what was billed as a supper party, but turned into a full-blown dinner which lasted well into the small hours of this morning. I kid you not.We had much fun talking about all the subjects not meant for a polite dinner table, like religion and the churches' hierarchy,  politics and politicians, feminism and its decline, social workers' struggle to keep their sanity in a world horribly disposed to blame society's ills on them, books and music; when we had finally had our fill of such intellectual topics and permitted ourselves to get down to local gossip, the people round the table got their second wind; the party finally broke up around 2am, when I loaded the dishwasher and collapsed into bed. A stimulating evening like this keeps my brain in overdrive for hours, which means I have had little sleep.I promise to get back to blog reading from tomorrow, in the meantime I need to recover.It's been a hard slog, but it is all over now."},
{"title": "The Fateful Apple", "date": "Thursday 2 September 2010", "text": "Willow's Magpie Tale no. 30Many many moons ago, in a far distant land, there lived an evil  tyrant called Gessler, who ruled over the people of the mountains with a rod of iron. In the name of the Emperor who had newly appointed him, he demanded absolute obedience from young and old. His word was law, he exacted cruel taxes and punished those who were unable to pay;  no matter how much the townsfolk begged and pleaded with him, he stayed deaf and blind to their suffering.One day he had a large pole erected in the market place and hung his hat on it. Any woman passing it had to curtsey to the hat and any man had to bow to it. The townsfolk did as they were bid, punishment for noncompliance was severe, nobody was brave enough to risk being flogged or worse, lose their life.It so happened that a famous marksman, by the name of William Tell came into the town, bringing his young son Walter with him. William was a proud man, used to the hard life of the mountains, where it was easy to risk life and limb almost daily in the pursuit of survival.William, being headstrong and a rebel to boot, ignored the pole with its ridiculous hat on the top and passed by without bowing.Gessler heard of it,  and immediately had William and Walter arrested. Gessler knew all about William's reputation as the finest marksman for miles around. He also knew that William was a troublemaker who could and probably would incite the townsfolk to rise up and rebel against his overlordship.He therefore devised a cunning plan to stop William and, at the same time, appear as a fair arbiter of justice. He decreed that an apple be placed on Walter's head and that William should split the apple with an arrow from his crossbow. He would have one shot and one shot only. If he hit the apple they would both go free.William and Walter were brought to the market place. The townspeople gathered, muttering darkly, until Gessler's soldiers roughly herded them into an enclosure formed by their lances and pikestaffs.William stood, crossbow at the ready. There were two arrows in his quiver. Only William knew that the second arrow was meant for Gessler, should he be so unlucky as to hit his child with the first.Gessler stepped up to little Walter, who was at a loss to understand the meaning of the drama unfolding.He was too young to know about tyrants and the cruelty they inflicted. He quite liked being the centre of everyone's attention. His Dad had told him to stand absolutely still, which was a little unusual and Walter shuffled his feet a bit. When Gessler came closer, all Walter saw was the rosy-cheeked apple in his outstretched hand, red and round and juicy. Walter hadn't had anything to eat since early in the morning when they left their farm to come into the town. He was hungry. The apple looked very inviting.Being a polite little boy, not yet given to rebelling, he thanked Gessler nicely, accepted the apple and took a big bite out of it.A hundred voices gave a sharp cry.Walter looked round the assembled townsfolk, soldiers, his father and the man with the funny hat, who had given him the apple.\"What ?\", he said."},

Beloved and I suit each other well and although the first, second and third flushes of love's young dream have long departed and we very rarely surprise each other with unexplored pockets of wit or depth of intellect, and patience in the face of stereotypical male/female behaviour diminishes progressively with the length of service, we rub along tolerably well.The friend of a friend of a friend envies us and wants to achieve this blissful state too. What to do?I know very little about Dating Agencies, virtual or physical, but I have had a look at Lonely Hearts ads. The applicant has to sell her/himself, make the reader positively drool with anticipation at the riches on offer, the beauty, the great sense of humour, the intelligence, the many interests and talents ranging from sports to sociability, culture to country pursuits to food and drink.The fact that most of the advertisers and readers are in reality lonely and shy, a bit needy and lost at best or weirdos looking to make a quick hit at worst, never gets mentioned. This f-o-a-f-o-a-f has come across a very mixed bag in her/his exploration of the field.This is what I would say:Female,single, could do with a friend,likes gardening.The following need not  apply:jokers, posers, fools and inadequates.Time-wasters will be weeded out mercilessly.P.S.Applicant must have own trowel."},
{"title": "Gleaning - Another Way of Harvesting.", "date": "Sunday 29 August 2010", "text": "The GleanersJean-Francois Millet1817-1875And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddence of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest;thou shalt leave them unto the poor and the stranger.LeviticusThe villagers knew which field would be harvested on a particular day. Adults and children turned up long before the last horse-drawn cart had left, lined up along the field edge, awaiting the signal to start, which was usually just a wave of the arm as the farmer and his helpers followed the carts off the field at the other end.My parents lined up with the rest of the villagers, with me beside them. In retrospect, I feel that I enjoyed these \"outings\", particularly in the potato fields. The days were hot, the atmosphere was not exactly jolly but calm and friendly; everyone was in the same boat, intent on gathering as many stray potatoes as they could find. You stayed in your row, hoed and grubbed in the freshly turned soil and dragged a basket or potato sack behind you. As with stealing coal later on in the winter, the rule was that you did not help yourself to another person's loot.On rare occasions only half the potato field had been harvested before the farmer gave the signal freeing the cleared half for gleaning. I was very small, to keep me safe and keep an eye on me while slowly traversing the field on their knees, my parents had me crawling between them and the edge of the field which was to be harvested the next day, a field still full of large, healthy potato plants, some of them taller than me. In my eagerness to help, my little hands strayed more than once into the lush growth next to me, coming up with clumps of potatoes.\"Look\", I shouted, \"I have found plenty here\". \"Come away from there\"; my father was angry with me and I didn't understand why, after all, we were there to gather potatoes and I had just found a large supply of them.It had happened before, somebody getting too close to a row of plants had been barred from gleaning. Father did not want this to happen to us. Farmers were very suspicious, they gave nothing away unless you had goods in exchange for food.It was much harder to collect grain. The stubble was sharp and painful and you could easily tear and scratch your knees until they bled. Being very small, I managed to stay in the gap between two rows, but even then I often cried out when a vicious stalk dug into my leg. I can see puddles of grain lying between the rows of stubble even now, neat little heaps, or sometimes little streams of grain, ready to be scooped up with bare hands.Gleaning was backbreaking work for the adults, for whom it would have been a matter of survival. The gravity of the situation went straight over the head of a child; for me it would have been a game, a game of hunting for food, being in a competition to see who could gather the most.This is part of a post previously published in July 2009.Few people read this blog then, as it is once again harvest time,it might bear repeating."},
{"title": "Stream Of Consciousness", "date": "Friday 27 August 2010", "text": "It’s all so very different from what I'd expected.Funny really, not funny ha-ha, more funny peculiar.But there you are,you just never can tell in advance.The beginning was quite ordinary.A small family, mum, dad, and me, plus the regulation number of aunts and uncles, an assortment of cousins, two grandpas. Both grannies deceased.I wonder why the grannies were in such a hurry to shuffle off this mortal coil before they’d had a chance to sample the easy life? Their photos show them to be a bit care-and-work-worn; they had large families, a war, and the old-fashioned type of husband, the law-giver sort, to contend with; perhaps the prospect of more of the same just didn’t appeal. Poor grannies, I wish I’d known you.The grandpas hung around for years; cranky old men, perhaps the lack of women in their life had made them so. Sex outside marriage was not then the indoor sport it is now. One took up politics, the other religion; anything to keep the juices flowing.You’d think such ordinary beginnings would predispose me to a life constrained by custom.It did, to begin with, and the road ahead in my little world was straight and narrow, as the roads generally tend to be in that part of the North European plain where I come from. Ancient Roman roads, built by legionaries, for marching armies up and down on, armies meant to subdue the barbarian Germanic tribes who preferred to stick with their heathen ways deep in the forests and only came out for a spot of raping and pillaging when the mood took them.Anyway, in spite of the straight and narrow road ahead, the good little girl turned rebellious, and a stroppy teenager emerged. Which is where the trouble started. Stroppy teenagers should be discouraged, they should  be towed out to sea and deposited on a deserted island until the steaming tide of their hormones settles down. (Hormones in teenagers are a totally disruptive force : a substance produced within the body of an animal or plant and carried in the blood or sap  to an organ which it stimulates).Says it all, really, doesn’t it.Couldn’t get out fast enough. Couldn’t get into trouble fast enough. Caused all sorts of ructions, gnashings of teeth, recriminations, accusations. The teenage drama queen had her way.The parents wrung their hands, asking “where did we go wrong?” They always knew that all that reading under the bedclothes, by torchlight, wasn’t healthy; if only they’d put a stop to it! Parents do that sort of thing, they realize the error of their ways long after the damage has been done; anybody could have told them that book-reading would lead to no good in the end.Which is why I ended up on this island long after my raging hormones had settled down and I am still here.Too late to get off now."},
{"title": "Easy Pickings", "date": "Thursday 26 August 2010", "text": "Willow's Magpie no. 29All was quiet in the lane. Large gardens enclosed the pretty cottages, none of great size, but all of them well-kept and attractive. Cottages bought by commuters to the nearby city, retired couples or even second-homers, who only came during the holidays.A green van, neither shabby nor shining new drove along the lane, at a steady but slow speed; neither slow  nor fast enough to be noticeable, had anybody  been looking. What was unusual was that the same van returned fifteen minutes later, driving in the other direction, a little slower this time.Two men could be seen in the cab, apparently very interested in a pink cottage nestling in its garden, which very effectively hid three sides of it from the lane; the windows that were visible were shut. As it was a warm day, this in itself was unusual, the wrought iron gate was also firmly shut, a sign that nobody had driven through it recently.The van drove on. This time it turned off the lane not far from the cottage, where a track  leading to a picnic spot  could just be seen. It can't have been a very busy spot, perhaps it was a little late in the summer; in any case, the van was the only car there. The driver came to a halt a little deeper in the trees than was absolutely necessary, the dark green of the van blended into the background and it became almost invisible. The men got out, one of them carrying a small holdall. They strolled up the track and into the lane, in the direction of the pink cottage. Once abreast of it, one of the men found that he had a stone in his shoe, he leant on the wrought-iron gate, banged the shoe hard against it, making quite a noise. His friend casually opened the gate; it creaked, like wrought-iron gates that haven't been oiled for a while often do.No answering sound from anywhere, no barking dog, no scrap of music, no laughter, just the peaceful silence of a late summer afternoon. Soon, people would come home from the city, the retired couple would wake from its nap, car doors would slam, radios and TVs be switched on, ordinary life would recommence.But for now all was silent.It took the men two minutes to get into the house.The older man said:\"Remember what I told you. Don't get greedy; a quick once-over for small valuables, maybe a laptop if you see one without searching, but nothing big. Ten minutes max and we're out of here. Touch nothing, disturb nothing. In and out, ok.\"The younger man nodded."},

The river runs sluggish and even the ducks prefer to stick their heads under a wing, squatting on their haunches on the pebble bank in the middle of the depleted stream.Perhaps going for our usual afternoon walk was not a good idea.As we reach the path which will lead us uphill into the pine forest straddling the cone-shaped hill with its iron age fort on the top, the sun beats down on us, pricking my skin and hurting my eyes. I keep my eyes lowered, away from the piercing rays of the sun.Halfway up through a cutting in the plantation I see distant summer lightning tear the sky momentarily in two. Dark clouds gather in the West. Benno is panting, the heat is getting to him too; his thick black coat is a most inappropriate garment on a day like today.It is too late to turn back and go home, we might as well press on. Benno stays close, he has given up running ahead or exploring the undergrowth on both sides of the path. Very soon I know why: I can hear the distant rumble of thunder and more streaks of gold flash across the sky.Benno is afraid of thunderstorms.As he is afraid, I had better be brave. I talk to him quietly as we struggle uphill.  We are trying to walk faster, but I am soon out of breath.A small wind comes up, creating little eddies of dust on the path; the bracken sways and there’s an ominous creaking in the tops of the pines. The light above is dimmed,  mountains of black thundercloud arrive out of nowhere. Benno almost trips me up in his eagerness to get closer.We walk right into a swarm of midges and flies,  disturbed into boldness by the  approaching storm. I flap and beat my arms about in vain,  the furious swarm stays with us until we reach the copse, the last bit of the climb,  before we get out into the open fields, along a hedge and through a sunken lane which will eventually take us back into the village.The storm reaches us at the same time as we step from the path through the copse into the open fields. The mountainous clouds open, the rain comes down in a sheet of blinding fury; instantly we are drenched. There is no shelter.The wind pushes me downhill with an iron fist in my back,  suddenly I am running, stumbling; blindly I crash into any obstacle on the way, Benno streaking ahead, terrified, himself now a flash of lightning, albeit black.The storm stops as abruptly as it started.  We come to a halt, me bent double, both of us panting,  clothes and coat sticking to us, water running off in rivulets. The sunken lane has turned into a shallow but fast flowing stream. No matter, it is the only way forward; at any rate, we could hardly get any wetter.By the time we reach the metalled lane into the village the sun is out again. The sky has turned a brilliant blue,  the odd rumble of thunder and feeble flash of lightning gently disappearing over the hills.The road is steaming, there is a wonderful smell of freshly washed meadow in the air and as we draw level with the first houses we hear the happy gurgle of water running off roofs into water butts.All is well."},

{"title": "False Start", "date": "Wednesday 18 August 2010", "text": "Eva's TaleFor those who haven't met Eva before, here is a short introduction:-Eva was a little girl growing up in post-war Germany in a small village on the left bank of the Lower Rhine. Previous adventures can be found under the label 'Eva's Tale' in the side bar. Each story stands on its own. Sometimes Eva writes the story herself, at other times she asks me to do it.This is one of those that I tell for her.o-o-o-o-oThe area where Eva grew up was predominantly Catholic;  an important lesson at the village school she attended was religious instruction; Eva, together with most of the school - there were very few Protestant children then -  had to go to Mass on  Sundays. Each year was allocated its own pew. Eva rather enjoyed the Latin services, she liked the plain chant and hearty communal singing; the sounds and sights and smells appealed to her nature. Eva was always one for a dramatic spectacle.Religious observance played very little part in her family as a whole,  in fact, to add to the confusion, there were those who saw it as 'the devil's work'; but that is another story.It so happened that on one particular Sunday she was very late arriving at Church. The service had started and she didn't feel comfortable to make her way to the front where her class mates were piously kneeling in their pew; she slipped into an empty seat in the set behind,  joining children several years older.One of the initiation rites in the Catholic Church is the First Communion when the child has reached 'the age of reason'.  It was the custom in those days that a whole year would be deemed to have reached this stage; with all children receiving the necessary preparation at the same time.When all the children in the pews Eva had joined got up and shuffled to the communion rail, Eva dutifully followed, making sure she did exactly as they did. This had never happened before and she was worried that she might get it wrong; she noticed that the priest hesitated when her turn came, but he carried on and when the others got up she again followed them back to the pew.Within  minutes a murmuring and whispering like the first breath of a playful wind rustling a handful of  leaves arose all around her, there was a faint disturbance in the air, a shifting on seats andshuffling of feet. The murmurs and whispers grew louder, Eva instinctively knew that she had done wrong and was therefore not surprised when a black-clad arm grabbed hers and dragged her out of the pew and to the back of the church.The woman hissed, \"you are not ready to take communion, don't you know what you did is a sin!\"Eva knew that a sin was a terrible thing,  although she had only a very vague idea what kind of deed might be involved; she was badly frightened and burst into tears, making for the big church doors to escape from the angry woman.She ran home;  even so, the news had reached her Dad before she got there. Other children had run even faster to be first with the grim tidings;  no doubt anticipating dire retribution to befall the sinner.Eva saw her father hurrying towards her in the middle of the road, in shirtsleeves and braces, without tie and coat, an unheard of state of affairs on a Sunday. She herself was hotly pursued by two of the village women who had been at the service, a tall, scrawny pair, both in black hats and long coats, flapping and cawing like crows about to fall on carrion.Eva wailed, \"Papa\";  her Dad scooped her up, his arms lifting her high,  turning on the women with a stream of furious invective. Eva's Dad was a strong man, tall and imposing physically, with a very hot temper to match. He was also one of the members of the family with no time for organised religion.The women stopped shrieking. Eva's Dad threatened them with unspeakable acts of violence should he hear of any further persecution of his precious girl. The women were not to know that this was an empty threat, violence simply not  being part of his nature. They fled.At school on Monday morning, Eva was taken to one side and firmly but kindly told that she must never do this again. Two years later it was her turn to learn her catechism and in due course became officially eligible to take communion."},

Every time a new follower signs in I do a little gurgle of pleasure, and every time somebody unfollows me, I sigh deeply, unhappily, and question my reason for being – for being a blogger, that is, not the general sort of being on this earth.In the greater scheme of things, I am the most unnecessary invention, a totally irrelevant speck of dust on the sole of creation’s boot. My continued presence hardly even merits a footnote in the annals of my own family, much less in anybody else’s. Beloved would probably miss me – there’d be nobody to ask “what are we doing for dinner today?”  The kids are too busy to bother, they are the centre of their own universe, as is the way of the world; the ancient crone known as Mum is surplus to requirements. I bet they already dread the day when they are faced with the task of putting me away somewhere suitable, where I can drool and dribble, click and suck my teeth and have incontinence problems. I am planning to pretend not to know them anymore when that happens, or, at the very least, I’ll get all their names wrong.The above does not mean that I am depressed, no more than on a good day anyway; no, I see it as a pretty accurate description of the human condition generally.But, I digress, the point of this post is to address my followers. So, where was I?First of all, dear people, thank you very much for being my followers. I really appreciate it, That goes for those of you who only want to sell me something too; I am not proud.Obviously, the followers I like best are those who leave their name and calling card, i.e. blogging address, and if you are amongst those who comment too, you have earned my undying gratitude. Besides, I probably follow you too and the whole thing is a bit like a mutual admiration society. Everybody's happy, at least I hope so.Then there are followers who leave an address, but never comment. To begin with, I visit your blogs, introduce myself and leave a comment wherever possible.  If there is no feedback, I will eventually stop visiting.Next come the followers who leave their name, but no forwarding address.Your blogs are barred to me unless I sign in and apply for membership. Well, how do I know I can? You might be an axe murderer, or worse, the Smith Family blog, detailing every burp and belch, every tooth and cute new lock of hair in  little Johnny's life, which makes your blog such a riveting read.As you by and large never leave a comment, I have no means of getting back to you, and as I am curious enough to visit every follower, every blogger who leaves a comment, and everyone who gets in touch, at least once after the initial contact, we might both miss out.Last, and most certainly least, come the anonymous followers. There are, of course, exceptions, where somebody is with a different blog host and can only follow anonymously. To those of you my special thanks, it must be quite a palaver to do that. I consider your presence  a great compliment.But the genuinely anonymous followers I simply don't understand. Do you actually read the blog? A blog name flashes up when I point the cursor at you but that is all there is. Are you blogging at work and can't afford to be traced? Are you blogging against the wishes of your nearest and dearest? Do you actually not have a blog at all but would still like to be part of blogland? Are you spies?Do tell, one or two of you, if you can, curiosity is a weakness I prefer not to overcome.What I really hope will not happen is that I will now see a spate of unfollowings - that's what blogger calls it - . You really wouldn't want to break my heart, would you? Just when we are beginning to get to know each other."},

She is striking looking, always dresses well, often in dramatic black and white, somebody you notice.No shrinking violet is my Dee.The four of us went to the village pub for dinner. We lined up behind the row of barflies on their stools, trying to catch the barmaid’s eye so that we could order drinks and she could direct us to our pre-booked table in the restaurant.The first I knew that something unusual was going on was when I saw Dee being encircled by the arm of a rather fat man sitting at the bar and heard gales of laughter coming from his companions and the man himself. Dee too was grinning all over her face.Could she have come across an old friend here at Valley’s End? Surely not.What happened was as follows:Dee walked in on, and quite by accident came to stand behind, the fat man, who had his back to the room, as he was telling his companions a story about a big black woman. The others had noticed Dee come in and were grimacing at him to stop.As she heard what he was saying, Dee put both hands on the man’s shoulders from behind, leaning in close, and said, loudly, with the full force of her personality, “like me, you mean?”, smiling disarmingly.The chap turned sharply, saw what he had done, grinned back and paid her an extravagant compliment, asking what was a beautiful black lady like her doing in Valley’s End and offering his services, on the spot, to show her the sights.Later, as we were sitting in the window of the restaurant, he walked by outside, knocked on the window and waved. Dee waved back.Her quick-thinking action had turned what could have been an ugly and embarrassing incident into an amusing one. I am sure she has had occasion to do so before; perhaps the fat man will not be quite so free with his opinions in future."},
{"title": "And So Life Goes On . . .", "date": "Sunday 8 August 2010", "text": "August - The Month of Harvest.The first day of August, Lammas Day, is the festival of harvest's beginning, when the first sheaf of corn, or bread made from it, was blessed and offered in churches.Wheat FieldWild OatingStudents have always been keen to earn pocket money during the summer holidays.There aren't many jobs around nowadays, particularly in rural areas. There are odd jobs, like mowing the grass, there's shelf stacking in supermarkets or generally helping out in shops while the full-timestaff go on holiday. On the whole, summer jobs are hard to find, jobs like cutting asparagus, and picking fruit are done by students from abroad, mainly East Europeans, who come for the season,  live on the farms and go home again at the end of the harvest.No so many years ago, local children went 'wild oating'.Oats are prolific self-seeders; armed with an empty fertiliser sack, each teenager went up and down the tram lines in cereal fields to rip out self-seeded wild oats. Oats spoiled the crop and farmers were keen to eliminate all trace of them from their harvest. Pay was £1/hour, not a bad rate, according to the young labourers.At the end of the day face, neck and shoulders were burned by the sun while the legs of their jeans were bleached white from the day-long rubbing of the cereal stalks. The full sacks of oats were left for the farmer to collect, perhaps to be used as fodder or bedding, depending on its condition.FeverfewAre you giddy in the head? Now is the time to harvest feverfew, the febrifuge, or fever-chaser.Its Latin name is Tanacetum Parthenium; it's a pretty yellow and white daisy-like flower, pungent and a prolific self-seeder. Once you have it in the garden, it's there to stay.Gerard's Herbal from 1633 says: Against summer headaches and migraines inhale the crushed leaves of yellow and white feverfew, or dried, powdered and taken with honey or sweet wine.\"Feverfew purgeth by siege melancholy and phlegm, wherefore it is very good for them that are giddy in the head, or which have the turning called Vertigo, that is a swimming or turning in the head. Also it is good for such as be melancholic, sad, pensive, and without speech.\"August VisitingAugust is the month for visiting around here.If you are going visiting, remember this: Visitors are like fish, three days on and they begin to smell.Besides, as Marianne Moore's Father said: \" Superior people never make long visits\"."},
{"title": "On Friendship", "date": "Thursday 5 August 2010", "text": "This photo of my friend S.J.was taken six weeks ago, on the occasion of abirthday party she arranged for me.Making friends is not something that comes to me easily. In fact, you could say that I rarely, if ever, initiate the process and that I become ‘friends’ with somebody almost in spite of myself.This is not something new or recent. I have no fond memories of friends of old, I barely remember the names of two or three school or college friends, every job I’ve ever had I have left more or less without a backward glance of regret at losing colleagues who might have become friends. I have certainly never felt obliged to keep in touch with a holiday acquaintance, no matter how much fun we might have had while thrown together by chance.Poets wax lyrical about true and faithful friendships, friendships for life, in good times and bad; friends who support each other through thick and thin. Cynics use expressions like ‘fair weather friends’. Ambrose Bierce defines friendship as “a ship big enough to carry two in fair weather, but only one in foul”.I have observed friendships between others, I have seen friends fall out over trivialities, I have watched them rip each other apart and get back together again afterwards as if nothing had happened. Woe betide the innocent bystander chosen to supply a sympathetic ear, if she gives an opinion that amounts to more than a mild “oh dear”, she will find herself in the black books of both friends once they have made up. I have seen close friends ask each other to be totally candid; “tell me honestly, what do you think?”,  they say – and not just ‘does my bum look big in this?’ -  and watched the fall-out, standing well clear myself.Close friends tell each other ‘everything’ over the years, they confide in each other, revealing their innermost secrets; their power to wound is therefore almost unlimited.How wonderful it is that there are those who never use this power, friends who are true to each other and remain friends to the end. I know of one old lady in her eighties who still meets up with friends from junior school. “There were four of us”, she tells me, “ one has gone now, but the rest of us visit each other and we still have lots to talk about”. She has actually admitted to knowing everything there is to know about them.Personally, I would very much dislike knowing ‘everything’ about somebody else, or have somebody else know ‘everything’ about me.In spite of all my misgivings expressed here, I do have friends. There is one in particular, whom I have known for just over twelve years, one whose heart was big enough to welcome me and all my crankiness without reservation. We have almost nothing in common, but each recognized in the other a quality worth exploring, a kindred spirit, a straightforward, realistic world view, a willingness to help those in need and a common love of the observation of others’ foibles.Dearest S.J., I have never heard you say an unkind word about anyone, have never heard you complain about any of the obstacles life put in your way. You kept your spirits up in the face of deep unhappiness. “Got to make an effort”, you said during the hardest times. Even now, in your darkest hour, your indomitable spirit is a beacon to us whom you are leaving behind.Thank you for accepting me as your friend."},

{"title": "The Chastity Belt", "date": "Thursday 29 July 2010", "text": "Magpie 25Once again the king of Goodlands called his lords, who owed him allegiance, to join him in war. The unruly hordes living in Badlands to the South threatened to invade his borders.  The lords passed on the call to arms to the barons, the barons to the humble knights, the knights rounded up their yeomen, all were expected to drop whatever they were doing, gather their body servants, and muster beneath the standards. Bugles sounded in towns, villages, hamlets, finding their way to hovels on island reed beds in the river and poor farmsteads, high up on the moor. Every able-bodied man, young and old, was obliged to follow the call. Only the old and sick and feeble-minded were excused from service.Baron Edwin, who had been on many such forays, always returning home to his beloved Matilda unharmed and in good working order, spoke to her while they were at breakfast the morning he was due to leave:-“My dearest wife, all is in readiness, my armour is rust proofed and polished, the smith has sharpened my sword, my harness has been mended. The men are awaiting my command. There is only one thing left to do”.Edwin held up the chastity belt which his wife had worn during each of his absences at war.“It is not that I don’t trust you,” he said, “but rules are rules. I would ask you to please be so kind and wear this belt yet again, as a sign of obedience to my wishes and to secure your good name once more”.She sighed. Really, they were both far too old to bother with such silliness, but if he wanted her to, then she would do him the favour.“Thank you, my dear”, he said, attaching the lock to the belt and carefully putting the key into the pouch hanging from his own. “I am sure I will not be away for long, and you shall soon be free”.Matilda kissed him dutifully, fondly, patting his back, and sent him off with her good wishes for a speedy and healthy return.The horses’ hooves clattered out of the castle courtyard; for a while she remained where she was and gave a last wave to the disappearing cavalcade with her white kerchief.Servants shut the gate and she went back inside. Now, where had she put that second key she had had cut many years earlier? Silly man, did he really expect her to wear this irksome contraption for months at a time? There hadn’t been any need for it for years; besides, with only the old, sick and feeble-minded men left behind, Matilda felt herself totally safe from any temptation.She sighed again.

And dramatic skyscapes, both day and night, even in high summer. As the saying goes: ‘if you are fed up with the weather in England just wait five minutes’.A typical summer skywith just the hint of a slight thickening in the cloud.The view from my window is changing daily. Farmers are using every minute of daylight for haymaking and fresh fields are turning from bright green to  light tan, with every shade from palest straw to rich cream in between. The sound of tractors crisscrossing fields and hillsides is everywhere, and long even tramlines of hay appear, are left to dry and scooped, rolled and wrapped up in a white, filmy bandage or a horrible, shiny black plastic skin as soon as possible. The threat of rain is ever present and getting the hay in while it is dry is no easy task. Damp hay rots easily and becomes a stinky, mouldy mess, that no beast will touch.Hayfields after mowingWhole herds of cattle are still in the fields together, the bull keeping a watchful eye on his family, cows grazing contentedly. The calves will son be removed from their mothers, which means that these will call for days for their offspring, a mournful sound, getting more and more desperate, until, finally, they give up. I know that this is where my roast beef comes from and why I can have milk in my coffee, but I still find these sounds heartbreaking. Curious calves peeking at me from across the riverThe thistles are in flower in July, providing a welcome harvest of nectar for bees. There are ever fewer bees around and I am very glad to see that thistles in the hedgerows and some garden plants, like buddleias still attract a good number around here. Every bee that loses its way and gets into the house or conservatory is carefully gathered up by means of a gentle shove into a clear plastic cup and safely deposited on a flower outside. Bumblebee on a thistleBerries are harvested in July. We have almost finished picking red- and blackcurrants, raspberries, worcesterberies and gooseberries. All end up in the freezer for now. Freezers are a boon to me, In the olden days women had to deal with the glut of vegetables, fruit and berries instantly; now we can freeze most of them and either preserve them whole and unprocessed or turn them into jams and jellies, chutneys and pickles at our leisure. Beloved is only now turning last year’s berries into home made ‘wine’, which is splendid for cooking, being very fruity.Gooseberries waiting to be frozwnAll photos can be enlarged."},

There are many bloggers of a more general nature who occasionally treat us to a tried and tested recipe of their own and the comments are always appreciative, the commentators promising to try it out for themselves. I don’t keep track of how many do.Tales of cookery disasters are less frequent.I like cooking, not so much the daily catering aspect of it, rather more the entertaining aspect, the playing around with recipes aspect. When I had to stop paid employment for health reasons and Beloved took over as my main private breadwinner, cooking became one of my hobbies. In other words, I learned to cook in middle age.Until then, right from the very beginning, in various of my incarnations, for many meals we made do with the deep freeze aisle in supermarkets. Which is where I bought my first ever chicken, frozen and, no doubt, not free-range, something not to be thought of nowadays.So there I was, a new housewife, planning to cook a proper meal; roast chicken with all the trimmings, a \"proper Sunday dinner\". The chicken needed unwrapping, I could do that. It needed defrosting, I hadn’t reckoned on that; I’d just give it a bit extra time in the oven. The trimmings were easy to do, all of it oven-ready, vegetables from the freezer and potatoes. I could do potatoes.When it came to dishing up, the chicken actually looked nicely brown, the potatoes were a bit soggy, having sat in the liquid from the frozen chicken, but at least they were cooked. It was while the man in my life in those far off days carved the chicken that the surprise came: poking his fingers into the cavity, a look of utter disgust spread across his face. “What on earth is this”, he said, as he pulled out a small package: the chicken giblets, still neatly tucked inside their plastic bag,uncooked.How was I to know, nobody told me.Photo Tjalf Sparnaay\"Supermarket Chicken\""},

When he was finally done he went up the steep stairs to his  bed in the room above, which was the family’s living and sleeping quarters, disturbing his wife, who had turned in an hour earlier. On his way he stumbled over the baker’s boy’s pallet at the foot of the stairs, kicking it for good measure, making sure that Annie, the maid, was nowhere near the boy’s bed but that she was lying on her own straw pallet in the corner of the bakehouse, half hidden behind a makeshift curtain. The boy grunted, cursing his master under his breath for being late to bed. He would miss Annie tonight. Even on Sunday people wanted fresh bread and he was to rise first to see to the ovens, fanning the flames to bring them to the required temperature. Sleepily, he yawned and dug himself deeper into the straw.It was Sunday, the 2nd September 1666.The night was as silent as a night within the old Roman Walls of the City of London could be. A few revellers were still about, but here, on Pudding Lane, not far from St. Paul’s Cathedral, only a few taverns kept really late hours and soon the only noise in the bakery was the rustling of rats in the rushes, and the crackling of the fire in the ovens. The boy went back to sleep. The noise from the room above, where the baker had roughly woken his wife, had stopped. All was quiet. The boy dreamt. He dreamt that a fire was breaking out in the bakehouse. He dreamt that he was the only one awake and it was up to him to stop the blaze. It was almost as if he could feel the heat coming closer, sweeping across the rushes and licking the wattle and daub walls.  He rose from his pallet and there was a strange apparatus waiting for him. He bent to pick it up and lo and behold, the strange apparatus belched its white breath at the fire. The boy and the apparatus fought the fire, inch by inch, step by step, until they had vanquished it. In his dream he became a hero and the Mayor of London praised him in front of the multitudes and the King himself called him to the Palace of Westminster. Annie came to his bed every night. He could feel the heat of her body scorching his skin.The boy awoke.  Mag 23 has more Magpie Tales"},
{"title": "Multiple Choices", "date": "Wednesday 14 July 2010", "text": "Have you noticed what a huge virtue ‘being able to choose’ has become?Every time I go to the supermarket, wanting to buy even the most common kind of food staple, cleaning agent, or beverage, I am faced with a bewildering choice.  What brand, kind, country of origin do I want my coffee or tea to be, which kind of biscuit, tinned beans or rice do I want today, which floor cleaner or sink scourer will be the only one suitable  for my specialized flooring, or the material my kitchen sink is made of. The purchase of the most mundane, boring, commonplace household item requires a conscious decision. It’s enough to make my head ache.Shopping is a bore at the best of times, having to use valuable thinking capacity doing it is a waste of human resources. Sell me the stuff I need, make it a decent quality at a reasonable price and I’ll be yours forever.Consumer goods, whether white, electrical, digital, leisure, whatever, come in dozens of varieties nowadays. Just invent the best washing machine you can, do away with inbuilt obsolescence, show me how it works and I’m away. And, for heaven’s sake, why do I need a dozen or more different washing powders, gels, liquids, concentrated, not concentrated, long-life, flavoured, spring-scented for whites, for coloureds, for delicates, for  woollens, his ‘n’ her’s, the kid’s and old uncle Tom Cobley ‘n’ all ? Choice is everything. Women were told that having the choice between household drudgery and an exciting working life was like finding the holy grail. In the end we chose to have it all, juggling paid work, household drudgery, husbands, and childrearing. What a con that turned out to be.I am all in favour of  weighing up the pros and cons of any specific issue, moral, political, cultural, commercial and financial. We can choose how to have our children, even what sex they should be. We chose our children’s school. We chose our environmental footprint by choosing our car, our holidays, our home. Not every choice we make is wise, there is room for disagreement. Ethics come into it. I wish we didn’t have to make some choices: all schools should guarantee a decent education for our children, we shouldn’t have to elbow other parents aside to get our kids into the best schools. I wish we didn’t have to park our old people in dreadful care homes, which are anything but caring. I wish we hadn’t attacked our planet with such gusto in the past and were now free to choose to live a life that shares the earth’s resources generously and justly.I wish choosing one politician over another, one political party rather than another, made a real difference. I wish that believing one set of promises over another makes my choice a genuine one; instead, so very often, they are cynically discarded for the sake of expediency, making my choice a fool’s errand. If I might have a choice in the matter, could I please have quality rather than quantity, the best the wisest  can come up with, choose with the benefit of all in mind.Then, and only then, you can keep your 57 varieties, one of everything will do me fine."},

The rain is badly needed. I should feel newly energized. Sadly, I don’t.What to blog about?There are ideas, some notes, a few headings, some half completed scribblings, but nothing that has any substance as yet. It’s there in my head, now it needs writing. Writing it is the hard part. Can non-writers suffer from writer’s block?Summer is a slow time, the living may be easy, but the heat saps energy, thoughts run like treacle, sticky and viscous. All I want to do is sit in the shade and read.I went to the village barbecue, hoping for some blogging material. After all, I am good at people-watching, people-dissecting. The barbecue is an annual event, run by the ladies who run all such activities, like coffee mornings, the Women’s Institute, the bring-and-buys, I’m sure you know the sort of thing I mean. On the face of it, the barbecue represents  the perfect milking parlour but I came away with nothing.Sure, Colonel Blimp was there, full of his glory years, still reliving the  Empire; the Squire and his lady put in an appearance, smiling graciously,  instantly surrounded by a fawning coterie; the local MP, a worthy man, no doubt meaning well, but a politician nevertheless and therefore happy to take from the poor to give to the rich, showed his face briefly.The Church was represented too, several vicars, male and female, in dog collar and black or dusty grey garb, were huddled around the same table, occasionally rising to tend to a particular member of their flock.The village idiot family was there, middle-aged children keeping close to Mum and Dad, enjoying the outing.The village intelligentsia mingled nicely, dripping words of wisdom and allowing the run of the mill villagers the benefit of their superior intellect.The artist colony flapped and gesticulated, laughed a lot and, having made sure that everybody had noticed their presence, made their prolonged exits.In other words, everybody had fun, everybody was kind to everybody else and ate the burnt meats and bland salads with a good grace. Wine flowed, at £1.50 a glass an easy treat. The accordion lady played her instrument in the middle of it all.The evening was balmy, the gardens lovely and the surrounding fields a picture of bucolic innocence.Yes, I came away with nothing. Singling out any particular grouping at this friendly, enjoyable event to use as blogging fodder would have been too unkind.So, what to blog about?"},

Eva had permission to play in it if she stayed off the vegetable beds and kept away from the chicken coop. She was allowed to go down the narrow path to the gate at the bottom which led to the rear access for the terraced houses.Whenever she came out the man who owned the garden kept a close eye on her. It was summer and his vegetables were ripening. She had been told not to touch any of the fruit and vegetables and she was too timid to disobey.  But she could look.On her way to the bottom of the garden she passed a row of tomato plants. Their fruits fascinated her; she had been watching them develop from the moment the flowers appeared and now, several weeks later, the fruits had set and begun to show colour. Every day she visited the plants, measuring them with her eyes, looking at them from underneath, above, sideways on.Along with the tomatoes, a plan ripened in her. She would take one, perhaps the one which was at the back of the truss, and therefore slightly hidden. Her visits became more frequent. She was going to wait until her chosen tomato had turned fully red, plump, and juicy looking. She would say it had fallen off and been eaten by animals.Another day maybe and then she’d come out while no one was about and she’d pick it, take it into the alley behind the gardens, and eat it. Just thinking about it made her mouth water.On her chosen day she came out early and made straight for the tomato plants. There was no red anywhere, only green and yellowish fruits remained. The man had picked all the ripe tomatoes during the previous evening, after she been sent to bed.For more tomato stories visitMagpie Tales - Mag 22"},

I found this one on a table on the terrace after a night of high winds.  Every time it hopped away from me it lost more bits of fluffy feathers. In the end it hopped, skipped and stumbled off the table and under a large lilac bush, where it hid, issuing pitiful little gurgles, a sound like a blunt pebble being rolled on a rough, earthy surface.I stood well away and mother turned up, clucking and fussing.VIIII know noble accentsAnd lucid, inescapable rhythms,But I know, too,That the blackbird is involvedIn what I know.Wallace StevensFrom Thirteen Ways to look at a BlackbirdA sparrow's nest ?This tiny nest came down with the wind,  It is bowl-shaped, very shallow, andno more then 4 inches wide.Whenever I find  birds' nests I am always surprised  how spotless they are.Birds truly do not 'foul their own nests'.The married birds with nice selection cullSoft thistledown, gray moss, and scattered wool,Line the secluded nest with feathery rings,Meet with fond bills, and woo with fluttering wings.Erasmus Darwinfrom Reproduction of LifeA Dead MoleI found this mole by the compost heaps, just lying there, stiff and cold, without any discernible injury.I hope Moley died of old age, after a riotous night at Toad Hall with Ratty and Badger and Mr. Toad.Benno and I gave him a decent burial, reading a poem as part of the ceremony:A Dead MoleStrong-shouldered mole,That so much lived below the ground,Dug, fought and loved, hunted and fed,For you to raise a moundWas as for us to make a hole; What wonder now that being deadYour body lies here stout and squareBuried within the blue vault of the air?Andrew YoungExcept, of course, the poet must eventually have done what we did,buried him in a hole in the ground.

The waning moon pierces the velvet sky, creating a silvery sheen above the deeper blackness of trees and the edge of the hills.Bright Venus is in attendance.All is still, all is silent.As my spirit settles into the night, my eyes distinguish minute differences in the texture of the darkness, here and there a man-made light glimmers and the gentlest breeze shifts the tops of trees.My ears become attuned to far-off sounds.An owl hoots; there is an answering shriek from across the valley.In a distant farmyard a dog barks briefly, disturbed perhaps by the call of a vixen.I hear a hum, a delicate, yet deep-throated hum; like a blanket of sound covering all other sounds.It is the river, flowing low after weeks of blue skies and no rain to fill its bed with new vigour.The river carries my spirit and I become one with the night."},
{"title": "Gardener's Reprieve", "date": "Saturday 3 July 2010", "text": "It's July,and a period of leisure has at long last arrived for thoseengaged in gardening for recreation only.Now is the time to sit back and enjoy.Round about the time of the Chelsea Flower ShowI give clumps of many herbaceous perennials what is known as\"The Chelsea Chop\",i.e., I cut them down almost to ground level.This ensures a second period of flowering fairly quickly,and it means that flower beds remain interesting - and tidy - for mostof the season. Pruning of shrubs that have finished flowering is over, those that are still flowering can wait until later. Birds are busy with second and possibly third clutches,which means that I leave hedges alone until I am sure thatthe youngsters have flown the nest.The only work to be done in ornamental gardens nowis watering during dry periods, deadheading, feeding, weedingand, of course, mowing the lawn.Siting in the garden,admiring,and not getting up to work,is far harder than working,as any gardener will tell you.So I went round and took a few photos.This is part of  my 'hot' border,where I grow herbs like this thyme,wavy-hair grasses and houseleeks.Dublin Bay performs year after year.She embraces and smothers her large metal climbing frameand flowers with abandon for many weeks over the summer.The sea holly (Eryngium)also does best in a dry and sunny border. As its name name implies, sea holly is very happy in gardens by the sea.But it does equally well here in the Shropshire Hills.Nevada is a large rose, 7ft by 7ft.,with creamy white, semi-double blooms of about 4\" across.At dusk they remind me of  floppy white handkerchiefs.In my experience, Nevada likes fairly drastic removal of old wood if it isto keep up its performance over the years. It gives a wonderful show early in theseason, when it is smothered with blooms all along its stems.It has intermittent, less generous  crops later on. This is 'Graham Thomas',an English Rose, widely sought after forits wonderful colour and delicate tea scent. This photograph doesn't fully show the very unusual, rich and deep,  pure yellow colour,without a hint of lemon.   The blooms are cup shaped, and formed like a Paeony;It will flower profusely all summer and is very easy to growand undemanding.Another beauty, \"Guinee\", a climber.Very hard to photograph; I've tried it in bright sunshine, on gloomy days, at dusk, early in the morning.This rose is the darkest of all garden roses, almost black.Its velvet like texture makes it appear dull and lifeless in our cloudyEnglish climate. But on bright, sunny days it glows with a smooth, purplish sheen.It is very pleasantly scented, not sweet, but fragrant and slightly tangy.Guinee flowers profusely in late June and early July, but subsequent flowering is sparse.It has stiff and rigid stems and is best grown on walls.Guinee is one of these rare, very showy beauties, very demanding, needing a lot of attention, instant and constant deadheading, lots of feeding and treatment for mildew.You either love it or hate it.Not many gardeners grow it. Everybody who sees it at its best is instantly smitten.It is the one rose which has knots of admiring visitors standing in front of iton 'Open Garden' days, sniffing it, cradling a bloom in both hands, feeling the texture,writing down its name. I always warn people about its capricious nature,  It can be exasperating, but I wouldn't want to be without it. Rosa Rugosa is a completely different animal. Easy to grow, will sucker almostlike a weed, is very large and prickly and therefore wonderful in hedges.There is nothing special about rosa rugosa, it comes in purplish pink and white,needs no special treatment, can be cut down to ground level, yet still comes back obediently.A proper workhorse.Apart from its usefulness, rugosa has one special, redeeming feature, namely the huge, orangey hips in autumn,which will look very attractive for a long time and my birds love them.I couldn't resist taking this close-upof the tiny open flowers of the common thyme.A herb is a herb is a herb, there's little to say about it,but, by golly, a patch of flowering thyme can stop you in your tracks.PS:  For anybody wondering, gardener is still alive.He's been chain-sawing trees today, under strict supervision."},
{"title": "None Of My Business", "date": "Thursday 1 July 2010", "text": "What I am about to write here is not really a very good post. You might say, that none of it is any of my business, but I want to get it off my chest, because the whole thing is making me very sad.One of my old ladies had what she and others like her would call 'a bit of a turn', probably a small stroke.Her 88 year old husband called the ambulance and she was promptly taken to hospital.This is where it gets complicated.Let's call the old lady Margaret and the husband Richard. Richard was due to go on a trip to Europe with a younger friend of his within two days of Margaret being taken ill. Margaret, who has not been well for some time, was due to spend the time of his absence with her daughter, who lives in another part of the UK.Margaret falling ill was really most inconvenient and she upset a lot of plans.Margaret has other family living in the valley, nieces and great nieces, who have been very good to Margaret's sister during her last years. Margaret's sister had no children to look after her and the nieces more or less took over. Margaret's sister had let it be known that she had made a will in which she would thank them for their kindness towards her.Margaret and Richard have two children, a daughter and son, both living a long way away.With Margaret taken care of in hospital, Richard decided he would stick to his plan and go on holiday.The evening before he left, he rang round a few kind ladies living in Valley's End and asked them to visit Margaret in whatever hospital - there are several possibilities after the acute stage is over -  she would find herself. Margaret's and Richards's daughter, who had been called to come over for the emergency, also left again for home and work.The nieces decided they couldn't possibly do for Margaret what they had done for Margaret's sister.Which left the three kind ladies, who got in a huddle and debated what to do. Nobody had been left in charge. The three kind ladies had no idea what, if anything, Margaret had taken into hospital with her, whether she had clothes and underwear available, simple things like soap, towels, tissues, etc.In the end it was left to the three kind ladies to find out these things. They got in touch with the daughter and  the hospital - who were rather curt and unwilling to give out information to strangers.Finding out where Margaret was, what needed doing and getting permission from the daughter to do it, all took time.Margaret was admitted on Friday, husband and daughter had left her by Sunday. The following Wednesday the first of the three kind ladies finally managed to visit her in hospital.She found Margaret much improved, but desperate for company, and for all the small bits and pieces that make a stay in hospital bearable. Luckily, the kind ladies being practical souls,  had anticipated Margaret's needs and were able to supply everything necessary.None of this is any of my business, it's family business, nobody else's. Nobody was ill treated, nobody was seriously neglected. The daughter will be back at the weekend and the niece has actually relented and paid a visit herself since.And yet . . .  . . . . I am one of the three kind ladies. Even though we don't want to sit in judgement, we can't help but feela little sad.Do you understand why?"},
{"title": "The Joys Of Sunday", "date": "Monday 28 June 2010", "text": "pub lunchYesterday was Sunday.Depending on your perception, Sunday is the first or seventh day, a religious high day, or  just  part of the weekend, a day off from work, or school; for many it is a day to work at or from home, doing the jobs for which there isn't time during the week. When I was still gainfully employed, Saturdays were a slog but Sunday morning was for lying in, a leisurely perusal of the paper, a home cooked meal for lunch, and quality time with the family in the afternoon.By Sunday evening the joys of quality time had palled, and all three of us were  bored to distraction, the kids were looking forward to seeing their friends at school and I was usually ready to go back to work next morning.Neither Beloved nor I work for money now, our time is our own, all week, Sundays included. However, my catholic training from long ago still makes me feel that Sundays are special, that I must do something to lift Sunday out of the pleasant but mundane routine and make each one memorable, whatever the effort involved. No gain without pain.It's a feeling I fight very hard to overcome.Sadly, we lack all the usual Sunday diversions: we have no grannies to entertain, children to bore with family games, or the endurance test of family visits; we are not given to going on strenuous nature rambles - nature is strictly for weekdays. Sunday pub lunches are a definite no-no:  all you can eat of the set meal, the Sunday Roast, two kinds of potato and various vegetables, all swimming in gravy, with a steam pudding and custard to follow, until you need the help of a crane to lift you off your chair at the end of it. The pub is crammed full with robust and hearty eaters tucking in,  granny and widowed uncle Bertie included;  the younger couples have brought their children and small kids are racing each other between the tables. Strong-armed  waitresses, red-faced and glowing with perspiration,  heaving laden plates and heavy dishes, keep the throng supplied.Carl Spitzweg  -  Der SpaziergangChildhood Sundays were equally nightmarish. On Summer Sundays one went for a walk.In those far off days there was still a difference in clothing between work-a-day clothing and Sunday Best. Dad and custom decreed that for Sunday walks in the park only Sunday Best was good enough. Dad set the tone by wearing a light weight, light coloured suit, topped with a hat and a walking stick over his arm. Mother wore her best floral  silk, a fetching hat, gloves, and high heels, which were killing her halfway through the walk.But the tortured child suffered the most. Picture the poor innocent in her pretty, smocked or ruched frock, often white but certainly no darker than pastel-hued, white cotton ankle socks and tight fitting, black patent leather shoes. Every scuffed step would leave a black mark on the sock, there was no skipping off or kicking stones, no touching anything that could cause a smudge on the dress. \"Pick up your feet,\", \"Don't dawdle\",  \"Don't touch\". All the other families were out too, this was an occasion to see and be seen, to meet and greet. Dad's hat was lifted and replaced every few steps, women stepped aside for a moment to exchange a pleasant word, while keeping an eagle eye on the young, who were required to  curtsey or bow, depending on gender, every time this happened. Adults shook hands formally.These walks were interminable, from one end of the park to the other, around the lake, and back again.The highlight was getting too close to the swans on the lake and squealing in terror when these made to follow the culprit, who was then roundly admonished to \"behave yourself\", or \"stop being silly\".Once safely back home, suits and dresses were taking off, brushed and hung up again, to await the next outing. Mothers said \"just look at your socks and shoes, whatever have you been doing?\" Sunday lunch in the gardenSundays  chez nous are simplicity itself. Lunch is important to us, but we eat the food suitable for the occasion, considering the weather, the effort involved and our appetites.  Nobody is obliged to do anything they don't feel like doing and we never play games. We might whistle for the dog, grab a stick and take a gentle walk by the river; we might pick up a book and spend the afternoon reading. We might linger over a bottle, sit in the shade of the old plum tree, talk, and even fall asleep. Whether we are joined by friends or we are on our own, the procedure is the same. Relaxation is the order of the day. Sunday Best never gets a look-in."},
{"title": "Flaming June", "date": "Friday 25 June 2010", "text": "Will there ever be such  summers again as the ones we knew when we were small?What summers they were, summers that never ended, stretched out in the shimmering haze of the endless sky, summers when even the bees faded to the drowsiest hum, hardly able to lift their heavy load of pollen to tumble drunkenly  amongst the blooms in the golden gorse on the railway embankment . The games we played there or in  fragrant swathes of camomile on the banks of the stream hardly mattered, we were soon  overcome by the heat and lay in the tall grass, talking and boasting, inventing tall tales, as only innocent children will. And when we had even tired of that, we just lay back and watched bugs and beetles crawl up the grass stem next to our face, the insects, like us, wanting to get out of the shadows, to bask in the sun.We had been sent to collect the flowers of the camomile plant, a herb useful in many ways. The flower heads were dried in the attic, on wooden boards, which, come autumn, would hold apples and pears for winter storage. The pleasant smell quickly became all-pervasive, an integral part of home.Camomile was used as a panacea for all ills as well as a herbal tea. For colds and coughs, flu and fevers, via tummy aches, constipation and haemorrhoids, to inflammations, infections, as a diuretic and 'blood cleanser' as well as a refreshing drink, camomile tinctures, mixed with grease as a cream and in sachets for hot and cold compresses, were an absolute necessity in the German housewife's household pharmacopeia.The Saints help the child who came home without its bag, stitched together from an old cotton tea cloth, filled with the heads of camomile plants. Cheating was not allowed, stems were not wanted. We were sent out to gather the herb for weeks, on as many sunny days as there were, from the end of June to the middle of July, the time of ripening. At weekends the adults came too, it was classified as a family outing  for a useful purpose. What is known as 'quality time' nowadays, I suppose.We were out for many hours on our own, picking not just the herb, but also poppies, cornflowers and daisies. By the time we arrived home,  the bunches of flowers wilted, we children were happily tired out and intoxicated with freedom and summer."},
{"title": "Standing Your Ground", "date": "Wednesday 23 June 2010", "text": "We like a glass of wine or two, with meals, as an aperitif,  or for no particular reason, while reading or watching TV, maybe. A lot of our everyday wines come from supermarkets and when we see that a particular favourite is on 'special offer'. we buy a box or two.The other day we saw that one of the wines we enjoy had been seriously reduced; the labels were there, but there were no bottles left on the shelf.  We made enquiries and were told that deliveries were being held up by a fire and an overturned lorry on the motorway but that the store was expecting to re-stock the next day. As we live about an hour away from the town it was unlikely that we would return, we therefore ordered a dozen bottles to be collected at our convenience. \"Certainly, madam, that will be fine. Let me have your number and I will ring you when deliveries get through.\"I asked if the reduction in price would apply. \" Yes indeed, this wine is on offer until the end of the month.\"Lovely, thank you very much, good-bye.Having heard nothing for over a week, I rang the supermarket last night. \"Yes, the wine is here; sorry, I can't find your order; unfortunately, it doesn't look as if it has been put aside for you.\"   I asked, and they agreed, to put a dozen bottles aside for me there and then, to be collected  from the customer services desk today.When we presented ourselves before midday, the wine was found to have gone back to its full price as from this morning.I let the desk staff know that I was hurt, disappointed, even angry at their inefficiency and unwilling to buy the wine, order or no order, except at the reduced price.The culprit who had mislaid the order was called, the supervisor appeared, as did the suit responsible for the wine department. Heads were shaken, sorrowful faces presented, apologies offered.I was unwilling to relent, it was a misery of their own making.Reader, I walked out of the store clutching my one dozen bottles of Sauvignon Blanc, not only at the reduced price but also with a small reduction for the quantity purchased.Standing your ground brings benefits. I advise you to do likewise.Cheers!"},

{"title": "Our Revels Now Are Ended", "date": "Saturday 19 June 2010", "text": "“Be cheerful, sir.Our revels now are ended.”The birthday week is over; Beloved and I have a birthday within two days of each other, which makes the whole thing either less of an ordeal or more of a celebration, whichever way you want to look at it.Firstly, I must make amends. Having slept well for several nights, and having come to terms with ‘hanging yet another year on the line’, I must give the ladies, about whom I was so very rude in my last post, their due.  They gave me a splendid lunch at Mellington Hall, a hotel set in lovely countryside, deep in the Shropshire/Welsh Marches.  Because there were eight of us, gossipy huddles were difficult to arrange, a bonus for me; instead the conversation was good-natured, friendly, and very jolly. I enjoyed myself. There was just one slightly awkward moment when the waiter came in, bearing the tiniest birthday cake with a tiny birthday candle -  and the group burst into a very giggly and unmelodious rendition of “Happy Birthday To You”.I don’t mind pushing myself into the limelight on occasion, but I hate it when others do it.We had B’s birthday meal at a Michelin-starred ‘pub-restaurant with rooms’.(I love that description; it conjures up all kinds of naughty ideas for me. Do you avail yourself of ‘the rooms’ before or after the meal, or possibly spend the night?) However, The Stagg Inn is a very proper establishment, with glorious food, served unobtrusively and efficiently and not a frilly pink shell-folded napkin in sight. At the next table sat a middle-aged couple, who obviously didn’t officially belong together; they were much too lively, talkative and amused with each other to have a high mileage behind them.When they arrived, they made a great fuss over a warning on the menu that certain items would require a lengthy cooking time. It’s what happens with freshly cooked dishes; food slammed into the microwave straight from the freezer comes more quickly. However, Mrs. Naughty then went into the bar where she stayed for ages. Her ‘partner’ eventually went to fetch her; not in the least embarrassed, she exclaimed loudly: “ I was looking at the bar menu and got talking to some delightful people there.” Only then did they study the restaurant menu and order.You might think, this Friko person is a busybody, sticking her nose in where it has no business to be, watching and recording; you might be right – how else am I going to get blogging material on a slow day.Yesterday, three charming bloggers and I met at a North Shropshire Garden.Wollerton Old Hall Gardens are small but ‘perfectly formed’, with formal and informal garden rooms divided from each other by hedges, walls and pergolas.The planting is very attractive, with colour co-ordinated rooms, some pale and monochrome and others bright and colourful. I particularly liked some beautiful trees, which had obviously been in situ long before the current gardens were established.Sadly, it rained for part of the visit. We spent the dry part in the coffee shop, only venturing out after the rain had started, which made it all very eccentric. During the worst of the rain, we took shelter in a lovely little summer pavilion with a swagged roof like a baldachin. Having met before, and all four being keen gardeners, there was none of that initial awkwardness; speaking purely for myself, I enjoyed the trip.I hope the others did too.PS: I did not bake the delicious birthday cake shown in the first picture; The village cake baker made it for us."},
{"title": "Confession Is Bad For The Soul", "date": "Wednesday 16 June 2010", "text": "About as bad for the soul as it gets.In the wee small hours of the morningWhen the whole wide world is fast asleep,I think of  . . .And never ever think of counting sheep . . . . Having had a full body massage today/yesterday doesn’t help, a massage always stirs up all the aches and pains that normally get buried during the day and then proceed to nag me all night. And without a massage I’d never get full control of my joints and never get rid of the rocks lodged in them.It is 3 in the morning and sleep is as far away as the man in the moon.Tomorrow/Today is my birthday, one of those with a big fat nought, the one where retirement and old age start, where you finally have to face up to the fact that you will never do any of the things your vast talents promised you’d do when you were young, I have just been downstairs to the drinks cupboard and poured a large glass of sherry; on top of 20mg of temazepam and a double dose of paracetamol that should at least dull the feeling of dissatisfaction, even if it doesn’t knock me out sufficiently to send me into the arms of Morpheus. I wish I could be the kind of nightowl who sits over a glass of whiskey on the rocks, a gently smoking cigarette in the ashtray and a romantic tear glistening on her cheek. I am not even granted that dreary stereotype, being far too damned realistic and down-to-earth for any fancy rubbish like that. Besides, I neither smoke nor drink spirits.I am the sort of insomniac who tosses and turns all night, whose thoughts are of the pointless, circular kind, who feels nothing but self pity and useless regret. And is going to be a complete wreck in the morning.A group of boring women is taking me out to lunch tomorrow. There is no other kind of woman in rural England; the sort, for whom a good gossip is all the intellectual stimulation needed to provide a warm glow of rather nasty self satisfaction. I shall look a complete mess, which can barely be hidden under a layer of make-up. Still, at least I know how to put on a party face and these poor souls mean well; they went to the trouble of booking a table, organized others of their sort to come along and make up the numbers and they probably feel they are doing me a great favour, when all the time I feel I’m doing  penance.I’m too bloody kind in spite of my nasty, sneering nature. I should have told them I was busy. It is my birthday, after all.All of you would probably be overrun with family. The number of female bloggers who describe themselves as “mother of ../ wife . . ./grandmother of…./ always surprises me. I thought we’d left the era when we were somebody’s appendage behind us, and had become women and people in our own right and not valid only because we filled a niche in somebody else’s life. I’m wrong there.I am all those wheels on somebody else’s carriage myself but I’ll be damned if I validate my existence other than by my own efforts, on my behalf. Still, it would be nice if any of the brood could be bothered to make a fuss of me on my birthday.I was a rotten mother, always too busy earning a living and being a friend to my children. “I don’t want a friend”, my daughter, who no longer speaks to me, said, “ I want a mum, like the other kids have”. Tough tittie. Food and clothes and a roof over your head came first, my girl.Right, that’s got rid of most of my readers. In my present state of mind I don’t care, although it would be very kind of you if you could overlook this lapse of good manners and give me the benefit of the doubt. I might behave better in future.But now I am depressed; I am aching to go to sleep and stop talking rubbish into nothingness, which is all there is to the virtual world. Thank Goodness, You don’t know who I am.Confession is bad for the soul, not to mention embarrassing.If I post this, I deserve to be evicted for stupidity.Would you believe that the thrush has started his morning concert, and there is already enough light in the sky to see the river? I think I'll go down the bank in my nightdress and drown myself."},
{"title": "Eva's Tale  -  Eva meets Death", "date": "Monday 14 June 2010", "text": "Eva is a little girl growing up in post-war Germany. She has been telling us about her adventures while she was on an island in the North Sea, Norderney,  where she was in a sanatorium and children's home, to cure her of incipient TB. She is much improved and back in her home village now. She likes telling stories and has agreed to tell us about more of her life.This is the first story since she has been back. Eva Meets DeathI’m bored. Lucy isn’t coming out to play. She can only come to the window to talk to me, her mum won’t let me in. My mum says that Lucy is really sick and that I shouldn’t keep knocking on her door, that it would make her too tired. That is ridiculous, we don’t talk much and it’s not as if I were climbing up to the window or anything.Lucy looks clean all the time, really white and pink and she doesn’t stay at the window for long. But we can still play because I take my box of transparencies and paper dollies and we play with the pictures and dress the dollies up in paper clothes.Mrs. Jansen came to the window and said we’d have to stop playing because Lucy had to have her rest. I could see that Lucy was tired and Mrs. Jansen looked tired too. Mrs. Jansen looked more tired than Lucy and her eyes had gone a bit red and puffy, like mine do, when I cry and when I look in the mirror afterwards, I can see it. Mum says I’m too old to be such a crybaby but I think all children cry sometimes; I know that the kids in school cry when Miss Speer tells them off.  I don’t cry because even if Miss Speer tells me off I don’t want to cry and I hold my breath until the tears don’t want to come anymore.o - o -o - o - o - oIt’s really hot today. I wanted to ask Lucy if she was better and could come out into the garden. Mum has put the big tin bath out for me and she filled it with water right to the top. I am allowed to wear my swimming costume and it would be nice to have Lucy come over. We could sit in the bath together and just talk.  She is only next door and she wouldn’t have to walk very far in this heat.Mrs. Jansen came to the door and said that Lucy wasn’t better yet and that she couldn’t come to play. I really think that Lucy has been sick for ages now and if she doesn’t get better soon she’ll miss the holidays and the hot weather.Mum told me off for knocking on Lucy’s door. She said that I was a pest and should leave people alone. She looked very serious, but then I think she was sorry for telling me off and she gave me a big, sticky hug. And she put her face into my hair which was a funny thing to do. When I looked at her, her eyes had gone shiny and she saw that I was looking at her, so she quickly clapped her arms around me; then I couldn’t see her face anymore.Grown-ups are peculiar, one minute they’re cross, the next minute they go all gooey. But I don’t mind, mum’s okay, really.o - o - o - o - o - oWhen I got up this morning, I could see that mum had her serious face on. She said that I should be a big brave girl because she had something to tell me which was very sad. My friend Lucy had died, that she wasn’t sick anymore and that she had gone to a place where little girls are well looked after. I asked If I could go there to play with her but mum said that wasn’t possible. But I could go to Lucy’s house to say goodbye to her. Perhaps they are sending her to  a sanatorium to make her better.In the afternoon mum took me over. I had to wear a proper dress in the middle of the week and in the holidays; I didn’t think I should, but mum said I’d have to, it would be more fitting. All my dresses are getting too small for me, Dad says he can't keep up with how I shoot up from one day to the next and how I am outgrowing all my clothes too fast and nothing fits me anyway.When we got there, there were some other children from the street in the hall; Mrs. Jansen opened the door to the front room and told us to be quiet and not to shuffle our feet, and not to touch anything, and to go in now.The parlour table was in the middle of the room and there was a kind of long white box on it and in the box there was Lucy, just lying there, with her head on a white pillow and a white coverlet over her. Mrs. Jansen told us not to go further into the room but I could see Lucy well from where I was standing. She didn’t look dead one little bit. Mum says dead is when you have no life in you, but even when you are asleep you have life in you. You can always tell if someone has life in them when they breathe. I wanted to go up to Lucy and see if she was breathing because she looked just like she was asleep, not a bit like she had no life in her. It was all very strange. But Mrs. Jansen stopped me from going closer to the box and I couldn’t tell for sure if Lucy was breathing or not.Mrs. Jansen said to say goodbye to Lucy and to say a little prayer for her and to be good children and leave quietly.I went into the garden and sat in my secret den by the rabbit hutch. Mum came out and asked if I was hiding, if I was okay and did I want some lemonade.I told her that I had some thinking to do and that a glass of lemonade would be fine and if she wanted she could come and sit in the den for a bit."},
{"title": "Family Ties", "date": "Saturday 12 June 2010", "text": "My friend Jayne and I went for a walk the other day. It was a long, companionable walk, dogs running ahead, the stream alongside the path  gently purling and swirling in eddies where stones and small boulders hindered its free flow. Squadrons of rooks bustled overhead in formation, swooping, diving, then settling in the tops of the trees lining the hollow lane, cawing raucously, the black rags of their untidy plumage fluttering in the breeze.It was a day to be at peace with yourself and the world. My friend has had a troubled past; recently she lost two close relatives, leaving her with a ragbag of emotions, unanswered questions, and an inner turmoil which will take a long time to resolve.When your protagonist is dead, whatever is unresolved, remains unresolved.Jayne has family, from most of whom she is estranged; I am an only child, I have no family other than very distant cousins.  For entirely different reasons we therefore find ourselves in very similar circumstances, without close family ties.  (I am speaking here only of  the current generation , not children or grandchildren)Did I mind, she asked. Did I feel the lack of close kin?\"Yes and No, or maybe just Maybe?\"Well, what was I supposed to say? There’s no easy answer to that.As we climbed  higher up the lane, we pondered the question. I have often thought how very pleasant it would be to have brothers or sisters, but here I had the example of Jayne before me, whose relationship with her brothers and sisters is difficult, to say the least.History and novels are full of dysfunctional families, sibling rivalry, jealousy, even murder. I am not saying that fact and fiction are the same or that fiction is always based on commonplace reality, but  plenty of those ‘misery memoirs’ have been published, where one person’s view of family history is another person’s fiction.If, like me, you are an ex-patriate, on a very mundane level, being an only child means you have no one to visit in your home country, no automatic right of entry into “your family”.  Continuity, your ‘slot’, your connection, have gone, you are a tourist in your own home town. Of course, there’s no guarantee that your siblings have stayed ‘home’ and that they’d want you to descend on them.Being the only one of your generation means that you have no one to share your memories, which can be a very isolating feeling. Growing up as the only child probably also means that you have always been  solitary,  thrown back on your own resources, possibly lacking social skills and the ability to make friends easily, and to keep those you have.  Again, on the other hand, the lucky ones gain early independence and the ability to make their own decisions.Jayne grew up as a member of an extended family, has a large circle of friends and is very easy company.  Her friendships with others are no closer or deeper than the very few I have. Like me she has little in the way of family contact.I don’t know whether Jayne and I are exceptions to the rule or representative of our own backgrounds in our different ways; I don’t even know if there are rules.  I know several very close siblings, who have chosen to live near each other and who provide each other with help and support;  I know of others who live far apart but visit as often as they can and would consider their relationship to be a close one. I also know of siblings who positively dislike each other and even some, who might be as well be at war with each other.As we came back down the hill, I was no nearer to answering her question than I had been when she first asked it. The nearest I could get to an answer, was to say:  “It all depends”.Ideally, I would like to have had siblings, of the kind, compatible and supportive sort, and lived in the fantasy of a large and happy family; but then I would now most probably be a very different person to who I am. To my mind, a feuding family would be hell, a happy family, heaven. Either way, I have no experience of “The Family  -  that dear octopus from whose tentacles we never quite escape”,  as Dodie Smith said,  and never will.Which is what?  Sad, not sad, a good thing, a bad thing? You tell me."},

The three others were ready to leave the house. It was a wild night, rain lashing  the window panes, adding to her feeling of dread. She was breathing hard, the pressure mounting.The others left; the man looked back at her angrily, his face a grimace of impatience.She was very late when she finally locked the front door behind her, pushing her bicycle into the road. The rain and wind caught at her, as she mounted her bike, trying to push her back.She reached the four-lane boulevard; traffic was heavy, the wet asphalt black and shiny in the bright headlights and street lamps, large plate glass shop fronts mirrored and increased the busyness tenfold. She managed to weave  her way through lines of cars and buses, overtaking knots of cyclists, who swerved out into her lane at the same time as she was trying to pass them.Her legs pumped furiously, heart pounding and throat aching with the effort of breathing, she raced the race of her life.At the station the train was still on the platform. Dishevelled, panting, the sweat trickling down between her shoulder blades, she jumped off her bike and was about to lift it into the guards’ carriage when she looked up and saw the man standing at the open door to their compartment, his arm beckoning her on imperiously, a look of fury mixed with disgust on his face.She stopped abruptly, put down the bike again. Dimly she heard a whistle being blown. Her right hand let go of the handlebar of her bike, and slowly rose into the air in one smooth and graceful movement, two fingers sticking up triumphantly.A few seconds later she took the handlebar again. turned the bike round in a semicircle and wheeled it back down along the platform. She never once looked back and therefore missed entirely the look of utter, dumbfounded, open-mouthed astonishment on his face."},
{"title": "Dog Owner Training", "date": "Monday 7 June 2010", "text": "A photo of the English Heritage BoardWe live on the edge of the wide open space that is the castle mound, the field surrounding it and the river enclosing the whole in a semicircle. My garden hedge runs alongside the dry moat and footpath leading to the castle ruins. It's summertime and on sunny days the trippers come, bringing children and dogs.Valley's End is far off the beaten track,  so the number of visitors is modest, by no means unpleasant. The excited voices of little boys who run ahead of their parents across the bridge,  and clamber up the hill, from where they get their first sight of the castle, always make me smile.  \"Dad, Dad, there's a castle! I can see it from here, come quick!\" Their delighted squeals echo across the greensward. Many of the visitors come from the cities of the Midlands and to have this amount of space freely available is a treat for many of the children.Dogs get equally excited. The moment they are let off the lead, they start their mad games, running the length of the field, jumping into the river and generally behave in a doglike fashion. Which pleases me.But there is one thing which really irritates me and that is dog owners who lack training.The river in late SpringThey've crossed the bridge, and let the dog go. Almost instantly they shout the dog's name. The dog doesn't react, naturally.  So they shout again. And again; and once more, for luck.The dog is off, taking no notice. I can hear the dog owner's voice go the whole gamut from a normal call, through frustration, resignation, anger, alarm and, finally, panic.

{"title": "Rubble Children  -  Trümmerkinder", "date": "Tuesday 1 June 2010", "text": "For the whole of one very hot summer two little girls played at housekeeping every day. Each took over a couple of rooms in the ruins of the large house on the corner plot, whose lower floor was almost intact except for the space furthest away from where the entrance door had been, where an iron girder was laid bare between the black and white  tiles of the vestibule. The children spent most of the time in what had been the kitchen of the house, with two large basins of white china clay, miraculously undamaged, having come to rest on the floor at a crazy angle. Twisted pipes hung down over the basins; there was, of course, no water, but as there was no other kitchen furniture at all except for the basins, imagination supplied what they needed. There was enough rubble inside and outside to build your own cooker and table and benches. Broken tiles became pots and pans. What they couldn’t invent they imagined and what couldn’t be imagined they discarded as unnecessary.Having access to a whole house with floor space for playing was luck indeed. The whole street was in ruins; although all the rubble had been cleared from the roadway itself, most of the remains of former houses were standing amid fallen masonry, shattered chimneys and smashed roof tiles. The wood had all gone, used as firewood. The girls were adventurous, to them the ruins were not dangerous places; they made sure they stayed away from black, gaping holes which opened into the cellars.  They knew that if they fell in, there was no easy way to clamber out again. Besides, they had heard the adults talk about people who had been inside the cellars when the houses collapsed on top of  them. “Who knows”, they said, “ their ghosts might still be down there”.It was dead people they feared, not the adults they knew. And certainly not houses which had once been houses for real people to live in.  The upper floors to the house were missing, fragments of walls reached into the friendly  skies whose deep blue was safe now.  The children knew nothing of what had brought about the world in which they lived. The old world the adults spoke of was alien to them, they knew that the houses had not always been in ruins, that they had had walls and roofs and doorways and windows that could be opened and shut, much like the flats they lived in now.  The word ‘makeshift’ meant nothing to the children. When the adults said that the day would come when all would be well again, the children looked at them as if to say “ what is not well now?” The adults spoke of toys and food and clothes and shoes they had once had and would have again one day, and the children didn’t understand. They had shoes on their feet and clothes to wear and food in their bellies, and above all, they had their wonderful ruined house, where they could take their rag dolls and play housekeeping.The house had once stood in its own grounds and although much of the former garden was covered in rubble from the cleared roadway, a small patch right in the middle of it was left free. The black frocked priest in church had talked of paradise and the girls thought they must have found it. Being secretive and unwilling to share the secret, they kept their discovery to themselves, forcing their way through the rubble which was partly hidden under the by now rampant vegetation and overgrown with long strands of trailing brambles, patches of thigh high nettles and thorny rose bushes, until they reached their own special den, the heart of the original garden, where flowering shrubs mingled with a large stand of willowherb. The scent was overpowering. The girls flattened some of the tall willowherb, which was taller than they were; when sitting on the ground they were completely hidden from view. Here they took their afternoon picnic. They had brought precious lemonade to drink out of toy cups, they had a few sweets; sometimes they had a biscuit each;  everything else their imagination supplied. They did as children do, and always will.Summer that year was a miracle, paradise indeed, never to be forgotten. But all summers have to come to an end eventually.The following year rebuilding began; the ruined house was demolished completely. One little girl moved away and the other remained a while longer, searching for a long time for her lost garden in the hustle and bustle of rebirth. It had disappeared completely and become the foundation for a whole new world."},
{"title": "A Very Sensible Man", "date": "Sunday 30 May 2010", "text": "I went to visit one of my elderly ladies this afternoon. These visits are meant to cheer them up and provide a little relief in an otherwise rather lonely day.I usually take the dog along with me, he is well-behaved and provides a small focus to get them away from talking about their failing health.Conversation is limited, I try to introduce some local gossip, ask for news of friends and family, and find out who, if anybody, has visited them.Marjorie is in her mid to late eighties, not very well and mobile only with assistance, but otherwise bright and as cheerful as somebody in her situation can be.Asking after their health is a must, and I always prepare myself for a long tale of woe.But today Marjorie had a very unexpected tale to tell. She recently had a spell in hospital, one of several in the last eighteen months. She has been complaining throughout that time that nobody will tell her what’s wrong with her and she’s been getting quite cross with the medical and nursing professions.A few days ago a doctor, a locum filling in while her regular Practitioner was away, made a house call.“I see that you have been asking for information on what’s wrong with you”, he said to Marjorie.“Yes”, said Marjorie, “I don’t know why nobody will tell me anything. It’s as if nobody has been able to make a diagnosis”.The doctor looked at Marjorie, considered for a moment, and then pulled several sheets of paper from his bag.“My dear, I have here a list of things we think are wrong with you, let me read it out to you”.Which is what he did, starting with minor ailments and progressing to more important ones. He finished with the first sheet and was about to turn over and continue, when he looked up and asked,“Do you want me to go on? Or shall I just tell you what is wrong with you?The fact of the matter is, that old age has caught up with you, your body is wearing out. AND THERE IS NOT A DAMN THING I CAN DO ABOUT IT !So you might as well accept it and make the most of what you have left.”When Marjorie told me this story she was beaming with pride, and oddly gratified. “You see”, she said to me, “He sized me up, he decided that I could take it, he just went ahead. Now I will stop worrying, I will do as much as I can and stop fretting about what’s beyond me. I’ll rest when I need rest and sleep when I want to. I’ll eat what I can, when I can and enjoy it while I can.”“And I’ll tell you something else”, she added, “I am really quite relieved”.It actually showed, she looked a lot better than she has done for weeks."},

Every major refill of larder and store cupboard requires a round trip of two hours' duration, if we want to use the large supermarkets for the purpose. Sometimes we talk, at other times we just sit and wish we lived somewhere else, nearer to a big town. We do this about every three to four weeks, which means that  these trips provide us with the opportunity to study the effects of the changing seasons.Yesterday we talked, we were in a slow-moving stream of traffic and there was plenty of time to admire the pretty countryside. The hawthorn hedges were in full bloom.\"Spring this year has been a bit like a performance at the Music Halls\".\"Oh yes? How come?\"\"Well, Spring has been late and it seems that each act has been on for just five minutes, trying to hog the stage;  while the next act's already waiting in the wings,  pushing and shoving to get centre stage\".\" Just look at the hedgerows. The cow parsley could be the chorus line\".\" Yes, I can see that. All frothy and frou-frou\".\"The dandelions have had their spectacular five minutes in the sun, now they've gone faded and blowsy and their glory days are over.Look at them, their hair's already turned white, there are far too many of them, gone to seed and turned out to grass. Nobody wants an old dame, everybody runs for cover when they see them coming, Sad, really\".\"Look at that hedge over there; broom, lilac and hawthorn all jostling for space at the same time. Perhaps they are the can can dancers, petticoats flashing, legs kicking\".\"We must be coming up to the main attraction, here come the chorines, a whole field of them, dancing and swaying in the breeze, each pretty little thing beaming and turning to the sun,  each trying to attract our attention\".\"Ah, here she is, the one we've all been waiting for, teasing and twirling, tantalizing and tempting\".\"The Stripper!\"o-o-o-o-o-oWe seem to have got our metaphors slightly mangled during the drive and blithely swept from music hall, to vaudeville, to strip joint.

{"title": "Getting Older", "date": "Sunday 23 May 2010", "text": "Salvador Dali 1940Three AgesHaving posted on the physical effects of getting older in the previous post, I now have a more positive tale to tell.At the last poetry group meeting the subject just happened to be ‘old age’, a subject which has exercised poets through the ages; some have bewailed old age, others found it  frightening, yet there are those for whom old age has many positive sides.At these meetings we not only read poems that deal with the subject, which is set in advance, we also discuss the poems and the  poets who wrote them and to finish off there is usually a general discussion of our own perception of the subject matter, both anecdotal and as a result of research. The members of the poetry group are mostly of retirement age; several are well into their seventies. Old age is a matter of personal experience for most, not something which will happen in the distant future; it has either happened already or is not that far off.I was delighted to hear one elderly lady say :” You know, I am glad of my age. I  feel I have gained a perspective on history simply by living through it. I am enjoying these years of reflection very much.”I know that this lady is a widow, whose children live some distance away and have busy lives of their own; this happens to be the case for so many older women. She suffers from ME and has to have several periods of rest during the day, which she uses to study and read. I know that she is about to enrol in a correspondence course on science having recently finished a course on prehistoric man.As so many of you, who commented on the previous post, said : \"One door closes and another door opens\".One of the poems I read at the meeting was by Elaine Feinstein, one of my favourite poets.:Getting OlderThe first surprise, I like it.Whatever happens now, some thingsthat used to terrify have not:I didn't die young, for instance.

{"title": "May Landscape", "date": "Sunday 16 May 2010", "text": "I remember the land of my childhood on the Dutch-German border as gentle and mostly silent. A peaceful land, neither dramatic nor exciting, with wide skies and clouds always in a hurry to move on. A low hill here and there hardly dares show itself, the earth is spread wide and flat and green and fertile. The observer’s wandering eye is allowed an endless supply of nourishing horizon-fare. Blossoming orchards are dotted between the lush meadows; streams, brooks and the mighty river Rhine keep all supplied with life-giving moisture. Once out of the industrial cities, small villages embedded in this landscape show off neat and tidy houses with scrubbed faces and pretty, tidy little vegetable and flower gardens. The sun’s rays are always clothed in a thin veil of silver radiance, soft mists envelop and dampen the view on all but the hottest summer days.This is a landscape for walkers, cyclists at most. This is a landscape where rest is inbuilt, the wanderer will not tire himself or herself; a welcoming inn beckons from morning to night and there is no need for making great plans beforehand, take your time and let your steps, or bicycle,  take you where they will.Soft greens and browns of  hedgerow, copse and field, pink and white blossoms, muddy ponds colonized by emerging water lilies, a tinkling stream still holding late meltwater, all these  bring peace of mind; pliant earth makes walking easy and if you are cycling, there are many paths set aside especially for you. Willow trees assume their shimmering, glimmering spring coats. In the meadows black and white cows gently chivvy their calves after a long winter in the stable. And above you, if you are very lucky, invisible larks will hurl their joyful song into the canopy of  the endless sky.This Landscape is good, tender, friendly and full of little miracles. It is the landscape of May."},
{"title": "Diaries", "date": "Friday 14 May 2010", "text": "Last night I finally caught up with my current diary; I hadn’t made any entries for several weeks and it was becoming a question of looking at the household engagement diary and copying dates. I hate the kind of diary which says “and then I did - - - - -,  and then I went - - - - -, ” as much as I dislike blogs of that nature.I have written diaries of one sort or another, my own and invented ones, for many years, starting as a child. I still write them now, by hand, in ordinary school exercise books, lined and with margins, the sort of exercise books used  by morons, who write with tongue sticking out from between moist, slightly open lips, while mouthing each word as they press on their pencils to keep within the lines. As a teenager I got into serious trouble because of it. I read a lot of unsuitable books from an early age and being a solitary child with a feverish imagination, I thought I could do as well, or better. Transferring some of the more insalubrious passages, in my own, still rather childish words, and altered to fit  my ideas of the femme fatale I was training to become, to my own diaries, was good writing practice, I thought. And fun too, of course.My mother thought differently. She must have been sneaking peeks at my various diaries for some time and when she came upon a passage describing adventures I really should not have known about, ( and actually didn’t, in reality) she made a very unfortunate comment in the diary, in large letters, across a whole page. Poor Mum. Finding this comment the next time I opened the diary was devastating for me.The whole sorry episode ended with my mother feeling a complete and very angry fool and me tearing up the diaries.I still read unsuitable books, but now I know what they are talking about and a purple passage stimulates my funny bone rather than erotic imagination. I also have first hand knowledge on the subject of my own to fall back on, when necessary.Several years later, I re-started writing diaries until I now have a whole wooden chest full of be-scribbled paper and exercise books. I used to hide them, although I know that there were others who found them and occasionally read them, until I found a new hiding place. I got my revenge on mum by writing in a language she couldn’t read and on an ex-husband by writing in shorthand and in a foreign language, adapting the one to the other, just in case.It must have been infuriating for them.Only once did I forgive an uninvited reader and that was when an entry was used to trace me in an emergency. But that really is a very private story.I am very happy that I no longer need to hide any writing, imagined or factual."},

Ray and Taff are reading at another, and a solo school is going strong next to them, Stan, Bob, Jock and Ken. A few more of our blokes are situated at strategic points, while two tables are occupied by some arty civvies who travelled over on the boat, a perfumed black man, a precious man in blue, and two sycophantic women.\"What's trumps?\"\" . . . a perfectly divine little man who cooked like an angel . . . \"\"entrance to a mine, in five letters - - -\"\"Cor, - - -  me,  I've saved the wrong bloody suit\"\"Ever read this?

In my pack and music case I have 2 watches, camera equipment, a lighter, some lace, toys, jewellery, a pen, an electric iron, German stamps, sheet music, wooden plates, books and scent. I spent a grand total of 1185 cigarettes, one ounce of tobacco, thirteen bars of soap, two bars of chocolate and three and a quarter pounds of coffee. These cost me the princely sum of £3.1.10.Not bad, but, as I said, this is modest compared to some blokes' loot.o-o-o-o-o-o-oI can't read anymore for a bit. The bright sunlight on my face draws my eyes outward to the swelling hills and the rich brown fields. Old hedgerows reflecting the sun, two brilliant lovers laughing in a field, a quiet stream shuffling over stones; the sudden, cool blazing of a bridge, fields still flooded here and there, and trees whose bareness in the new warmth seems a freedom rather than a martyrdom. English telegraph wires and England racing into my Spring life at fifty miles an hour, and laughing away there, chuffed to busting.I feel fine and clean and unusually young. The country is lovely and it is England. All I want now is a drop of leave.

The lady in the chemist's says that I can't get quinine without a prescription.This is England, and the sun is shining.In the cookhouse, the tables are dirty, the meat is tough, the greens are uneatable.

'Empire Rapier'    -   Saturday, April 12th, 1947.I am snatching a few moments to write this after dinner, which looked like it was meant to be a half-way mark between the food of the last six weeks and that to which we are returning.Everything about this voyage is smoother and slicker than the last. The boat is faster and the weather is as different from the snow and gales of six weeks ago as possible. There is a pretty stiff wind blowing, but the sun is shining gaily and the sea is quite warm, and, above all, the table stays still.We have a wide, curving wake of pure, milky foam and nothing seems to impede the almost visible purposefulness of the ship. The sky is unclouded and the visibility excellent. There is no ice floating about.  Instead, we got stuck on a sandbank for two hours during the night.Psychologically speaking, one of the most interesting symptoms of our homeward sickness - and a sign more finite than the voyage that we have left Germany - is the sudden generosity of the band. We were issued with forty cigarettes each this morning, and since then I have accepted five from other lads - more than I have been offered in the last three weeks! I suppose that it's natural enough, but I have smoked far too may cigarettes already.Most of the blokes aboard are grouphappy, or else going on leave, but there is no air of gaiety, that air that seems to be so obvious to lady journalists. We are just going to England, that's all, because the ship happens to be going there.A bloke two bunks away is torturing a mouthorgan, and, incidentally, me.  Smoking is prohibited down here; every soldier in sight has a lighted fag in his mouth. The ship is trembling with unspeakable and unnecessary emotion.Memo to self: must decide what articles to declare, and what story to tell if found out.o-o-o-o-o-oENGLAND!  -  Sunday, April 13th, 1947\"Oh to be in England, etc \".I have said that several times lately and even after only six weeks of exile, England holds something that is more than just a welcome.I am sitting in the shabby carriage of a slow train, looking through the dirty windows at the furtive smoke insinuating its pollution into the fresh fields' laughter.And yet it is not as slow, and the seats are softer, and the fields yet smile, and even the smoke breathes purpose more than there.The squat, smoky houses by the way are squalid and sullen in the sun.And yet they do not cringe in the air, and there are not acres of devastation and despair as there have been there.Doncaster. The sun is bright, and Spring seems to have kissed our return, and laid her benediction upon us. The ground, cindery, is strewn with litter between the rails. Scraps of paper, dog ends, orange peel, the rails have rusty sides and careworn hypnotic faces. A pile of deserted mailbags lies disconsolately on platform five, oozing melancholy.This is England, we are home, and it is in no sense bitterly, but a conscious knowing of the land, and yet loving.We docked at eleven thirty last night and at eight this morning we joined the tail of the queue before the customs shed, growing steadily more and more apprehensive.We arrived at the head of the queue.\"Any spirits. cameras, binoculars, or watches?\" said the man.\"No\", we said.He looked at us.\"Oh\", he said, \"Band, eh? Go straight through\" and doubtless added \"too dumb to smuggle\", under his breath.The train was waiting by the quayside. We got aboard and waited; the train moved a few hundred yards and stopped. We waited.Now going through the yards at Doncaster, I have made up my winnings at solo to one pound in English money. The sun is shining courageously on the page, but I cannot find a really comfortable writing position.Roll On. Bloody Roll On.o-o-o-o-o-oThere is just one short instalment to come before the Scraper reaches his destination and therefore the end of this diary. I will post this tomorrow."},
{"title": "Happiness is also . . . . .", "date": "Sunday 9 May 2010", "text": "A misty, drizzly, morningI feel never happier than when I’ve done a day’s hard labour in the garden. Gardener insists that I work with him when he comes; we work for seven hours, with only a short break for lunch and two breaks for a cup of tea.I love it.It was cold and damp and windy in the morning; I was more than half hoping gardener would decide to stay away, so when I looked out of the window and saw him walking round the back garden while I was lingering over my second cup of breakfast tea, I was almost disappointed at not getting a lazy Saturday to myself; especially as we had been out to dinner with friends the night before and not got home until midnight.Once out in the garden, woolly hat and fleecy jacket on, trowel and secateurs at the ready, wheelbarrow, spade, fork and rake in position, there was no stopping me.I started with the pelargoniums (indoor geraniums to most people), which needed potting on. I counted about fifty. Normally, they’d go out into pots and borders now, but the weather being as capricious as April this May, I can’t risk it.  Gardener shoveled muck, and trimmed and redefined border and lawn edges. Neat and tidy edging makes a big difference to the look of a garden.Some of the pelargoniums waiting to be potted on.We then turned our attention to a particular bed which has suffered a lot of frost damage. We took out an ancient hebe, which had seen better days, trimmed back a choisya – at the wrong time of year, because we cut off a lot of the  summer flowering branches, but nasty, slimy, brown frost bitten leaves do not look good – and finally turned to the bay tree.  Last autumn it was still a magnificent specimen, mature and dense, actually a bit too large, beginning to outgrow its space.I took a deep breath and started to hack away at it, cutting out branches, stripping the remaining ones of all leaves, leaving only a trimmed-back pompom at the very tips. I want to turn it into a ‘cloud’ tree. It looks pretty awful now, but If it works, it will be an interesting and unusual shaped shrub to have, if it doesn’t, there’s not much harm done, because it might shoot again from lower down. That is, if it is indeed still alive. Cloud trees and shrubs fascinate me; as so many of these interesting ideas about unusual treatment of plants, it comes from Japan.    The fernery/shrubbery was next. For once, the harsh winter has done some good; all my native ferns seem to have benefited; the tree fern ‘Dicksonia’ is dead, of course, but then that was to be expected. No Australian would be up to last winter’s temperatures, no matter how well wrapped, wusses that they are. I’ve waited until now to attack my private enemy Number One, the lesser celandine, which loves the fernery and hides among the fronds. Now that I can see the first croziers unfurling, I can deal with them.My garden is bordered by English Heritage land along one side; some tree surgeons had operated on trees in the castle ground and chipped the wood there and then, leaving vast piles just spread over the bank. Very useful stuff for covering paths, wood chippings. So gardener and I clambered up and filled four large sacks. The path along the fernery looks splendid now, the chippings came in very handy!Saturday morning I thought I might manage a couple of hours’ work, two hours turned into seven and I was still loath to come in. The experts who say that outdoor exercise is the best medicine for a gloomy outlook are right, happiness is a sore back, rough hands and muddy knees, provided a hot shower and a glass of sherry are available when the work is done.All of the photos were taken this morning when the sun was out."},

{"title": "NORMAL  - I'm normal. Are You?", "date": "Tuesday 4 May 2010", "text": "What is it that we call 'normal' in our society ?The other day an acquaintance found it necessary to remind me that some of my tastes, preferences, priorities, ideas and opinions, are slightly outside the usual, what she called ‘everyday, normal’ range; when she noticed my face, she quickly added ‘but in a nice way’, so I forgave her instantly. Apparently, she found my enthusiasm for opera and poetry, my willingness to discuss rural life and the accompanying, lower case ’c,’ conservative attitudes robustly, and my equal unwillingness to dedicate a large part of my life to village concerns rather alarming. The fact that that doesn’t worry me seemed to disturb her even more.She was right, of course, I can quite see that.We think of ourselves as liberal and open-minded, we understand and feel sympathetic towards everybody and everything.  We practice tolerance.But what happens when this tolerance comes up against people who look, behave and act outside the parameters of what is generally seen as the norm, who provoke our sense of decency and custom, who are simply different from others?Being concerned about how society sees us, how we want to be seen, is this question still relevant in today’s world, where anything goes? I remember the time when parents and teachers reminded me of what is and isn't 'done', how I should look and behave to please convention. How many of us experienced and remember the phrase \"what will people think\"?Who determines what normal is, who defines normal and not normal?Basically, the majority of people want to be seen as normal, be part of a set, avoid sticking out like a sore thumb, avoid being instantly, recognizably different. It’s comfy and safe being one of us, belonging.There are as many ways of belonging as there are of being different.Every parent has had  cause to say “what do you think you are wearing?” Every child has, at some time, replied, “Mum, Dad, this is normal, this is what everybody wears. You wouldn’t understand”. This difference in personal taste goes on throughout life; while we stay broadly within the appropriate grouping, personal preferences matter little. We are still recognizably normal. Whatever way of life we choose, we will still fit some pigeonhole or other. We may get stared at for the way we look, be ridiculed for our opinions, what we eat, even, but either we pay little or no attention, or we conform.But what happens when we are disabled, mentally or physically? When we bear the visible scars of impairment, when we ‘show up’ as different. When we are not 'normal' ?We all try very hard to stay fit; consider the fitness mania. The moment we are ill, many hide away. If at all possible, we pretend that nothing is wrong; if we can’t, we feel ashamed. Why should the disabled person feel ashamed for being different, why avoid eye contact on an equal level, lower their gaze?Considering that a huge percentage of the population will, at some time, suffer from mental illness, why is mental illness still such a taboo? Something to be ashamed of?Being depressed, sad, disturbed, happens to most people, are we not normal when we suffer? An acquaintance admitted to a family member’s brush with the law quite cheerfully the other day, but the same person hid, for as long as she could, somebody else’s depression. This mental illness was hidden so well, that the sufferer received no help and attempted suicide.There are still many places today where a person’s sexual orientation is cause for scandal,  censure and condemnation. How appallingly hard it must be to keep such a huge part of your personality a secret. Worse, to feel trapped in the wrong body, unable to do anything about it; having to come to terms with being an outsider, a misfit, abnormal. How does this person cope in the face of Society’s disapproval?This is where Society itself becomes abnormal. In the mass, it is normal to bay for the blood of a perceived wrong-doer, found guilty or not, there is mass hatred of countries which live to a different code from our own; in the mass, mankind is a very frightening animal indeed. But nobody says, ‘this is not normal’.Lying politicians, companies who cheat and exploit,  clerics who abuse their calling, nobody calls them abnormal. We say they should be ashamed of themselves, which they obviously are not, as we watch them, or another of their ilk, carry on. Most of the time, there is no punishment to fit the crime.We tolerate their actions; they are wrong perhaps, even immoral, but still within the bounds of normality.Or so we say."},

{"title": "Let Music Be The Soul Of Discretion", "date": "Wednesday 28 April 2010", "text": "An invitation to a meal at the house of musicians is fine, provided you are a musician yourself. If not, you are in for a rough ride. I am not. I deal in words, not notes.Musicians have words too, of course, but a lot of their words deal with the character assassination of other musicians, particularly conductors, and then, a long way after, with music. I love the idea of juicy gossip, but as I don’t know the subjects personally, although quite a few of them are well known, even famous people, my interest soon wanders.As these particular musicians are polite, friendly, generous and kind hosts, for the first thirty minutes the conversation concerned itself with the topic of left over berries in the freezer and what to do with them, arising from serving a token shot of cassis in the first bottle of bubbly. This in turn led to discussing home made wine and its uses in the house, particularly for bleaching and disinfecting purposes.By now our host was raring to go; I could tell he was keeping a tight rein on himself.  Still on the subject of home made wine, he told us how he had recently been given some elderberry wine which seemed rather strong. As it is not easy to determine the alcohol content of home made wine, our host sent a bottle for analysis to a laboratory. In due course the answer came back. “ I am sorry to say that your horse suffers from diabetes”.Lunch was delicious. Musicians eat and drink well. Beloved and I were rather slow and our hosts finished their courses long before us. When we apologized, John said: “that shows the difference between freelancers and those in fixed employment. Freelancers learn to chew and swallow vivacissimo”.  Beloved always was on a regular contract.After the meal I took Benno out into the garden, I could hear gales of laughter coming from the open windows. By now the conversation was very firmly established in the world of performers of classical music, names falling thick and fast, each anecdote leading to the next.When I got back inside, a well known violinist, a foreigner living in the UK, aspiring to being the perfect English gentleman in speech and manner and famous for his interpretation of Mozart, was being discussed. The soloist had been asked, at fairly short notice, to play a Mozart concerto. A colleague, also a soloist, but not a great friend, asked how it had gone.“Terribly, dear boy, terribly”.Sensing a triumph over his colleague, the second soloist asked, “ Oh dear, were the critics there?”“Yes, unfortunately, they were”. Ever more solicitous, the second soloist said,“Do you happen to have a copy on you?”The famous man pulled a sheaf of them out of his pocket.“Here they are, quite terrible”.The other read them, each critique glowing with praise.“What do you mean, terrible, these are very good indeed”.The famous man sighed.“The grammar, dear boy, the grammar”."},

I therefore extorted forty cigarettes from him and gave him the bottle. I changed the cigarettes into 200 Marks.o-o-o-o-oThursday, April 9th, 1947Yesterday morning we walked round the town and found many lovely pieces of silver jewellery that we were far too impecunious to purchase. I bought a cigarette box and some German stamps from a little shop by the bridge. I walked into the shop intending to ask for pre-war stamps that showed Hitler's face; when I was inside I realised that I had no idea how to say this in German and the Philatelist seemed to understand neither English nor my efforts at speaking French. As this was probably the last opportunity I had to buy stamps, I scratched around in the remnants of my schoolboy Latin and tried that.  To my surprise and great delight he understood me and replied in Latin. Neither of us could be called fluent, by any stretch of the imagination; nevertheless, I successfully purchased the stamps I wanted.The main shopping street here is incredibly quaint; one stretch of it is merely a cobblestone pavement about ten feet wide, with shops staring each other out on either side.In the evening we received another Naafi ration of cigarettes, also our free issue of fifty. There was an immediate exodus to the station, and ninety percent of the cigarettes were disposed of.After a cream cake supper in the Naafi, Mike and I went to the cinema, and we saw \"Perfect Strangers\".o-o-o-o-oFriday, April 11th, CuxhavnBaggage RoomI am sitting on top of a three-tier luggage rack in the baggage room at Cuxhavn docks. Rumour has it that we do not board ship until ten, so I shall endeavour to summarise the events of the past two days.It's a difficult task, the light is poor, the seat is hard, and I have already been interrupted three times to enter into discussion with my fellow loafers, or to add an air of erudition to their impenetrable ignorance.We visited Rendsburg station black market for the last time on Wednesday evening, and spent an amusing half hour inspecting the various goods that the Germans eagerly proffered us, without having any intention, or wherewithal, to purchase them. In a moment of absentmindedness I filled my pipe, and then, in a moment of weakness, offered my pouch to a labourer who had been earnestly drawing on an empty pipe for many minutes. I looked down and found a queue of four pipes waiting expectantly beside him. When they had all been satisfied and supplied with matches, I held up the pouch and said \"100 Marks?\" A bloke took it, punched it, prodded it, then tipped the contents onto the table. Having scratched around in this for a minute, shaking his head the while, he offered me thirty. I took thirty-five and kept the pouch.The light is now worse, all that is shed on this paper being the willing rays of a 60 watt bulb some twelve feet away that has to illuminate fifteen feet the other side of itself. I doesn't seem to be concentrating on the job and the  fellows seem dim and vague, a crowd of meaningless shadows, drifting in infinite boredom.Yesterday morning, we loaded the lorries, and drove to Kiel.Mike, Len and I hitchhiked the laborious five miles into the town only to find that the shops were shut.There was a string concert last night, which, considering that it was the first for three weeks, went well.Supper was laid on for 9.30. We arrived at the cookhouse at 9.50 and found the place in darkness. We trooped up to the YMCA, which was also shut; we returned to the billet and packed the instruments with the loot in the boxes; we are now hoping and praying that these boxes pass through customs unopened, as band kit. Lights out at 11.30, after one or two altercations with late comers. Reveille this morning was at five.Having an hour off this afternoon, Mike, Len and I went round the shops, in a desperate attempt to get rid of our last marks without suffering a loss. stamp shops seemed to be non-existent, so i bought two large, utterly unpackable wooden plates, only to stumble over two stamp shops five minutes later.Now we are off to the Naafi gift shop, I have 10 shillings in my pocket."},

When Helen, the beauty therapist asked me, \"Have you done anything exciting since I last saw you\", while trying to peel the patina of ages off my face, I was thrown off balance. I was prepared for an hour's pampering, not for a question and answer session. Besides, I prefer my hairdressers, masseuses and beauticians to be silent; there's enough going on  in my head to send me to distraction already. Helen is a sweet young woman, usually quiet; perhaps she'd been on a refresher course where the lecturer had told her that she must engage the client in conversation, to show an interest.\"So, have you done anything exciting?\"In a word, \"no\".  \"Certainly nothing you would find exciting\".When I thought about it a bit more I came to realize how boring my life must seem to a young, busy, working wife and mother of three school age kids.Last week we went  to see a \"boring\" play, Pinter's  The Caretaker, one day, and entertained a group of very elderly people to tea the next;  I also had lunch and a giggle with a friend, a real highlight. Spending the day gardening, walking the dog, shopping for and cooking dinner, doing household chores, reading the papers, watching TV, talking to a neighbour about nothing in particular, taking the dog to the vet, spending an hour on a fiendishly difficult crossword, getting the car serviced, going to the pub with Beloved,  that's the usual picture. In a good month social life picks up a bit, there might be a party or two, or a visit to a concert thrown in. But on the whole, life is spent at home, doing nothing much.I still write letters, by hand, on paper, to friends who dislike emails and typed manuscripts. On average, I write about once every two  months to each of them;  composing an interesting letter that deals with all the news of a couple of months is getting harder all the time; on paper one can't just waffle on as one does in a blog, a quick soundbite as in an email is not suitable either. I have to think, compose proper sentences, paragraphs with meaning and real news.  At no other time am I more aware of how eventless my life has become.Wendy Copethe English poet,summed it up beautifully.Being BoringIf you ask me 'What's new?', I have nothing to say Except that the garden is growing. I had a slight cold but it's better today. I'm content with the way things are going. Yes, he is the same as he usually is, Still eating and sleeping and snoring. I get on with my work. He gets on with his. I know this is all very boring. There was drama enough in my turbulent past: Tears and passion-I've used up a tankful. No news is good news, and long may it last, If nothing much happens, I'm thankful. A happier cabbage you never did see, My vegetable spirits are soaring. If you're after excitement, steer well clear of me. I want to go on being boring. I don't go to parties. Well, what are they for, If you don't need to find a new lover? You drink and you listen and drink a bit more And you take the next day to recover. Someone to stay home with was all my desire And, now that I've found a safe mooring, I've just one ambition in life: I aspire To go on and on being boring."},

{"title": "You Never Know Whom You Might Meet In The Pub", "date": "Thursday 15 April 2010", "text": "It was our 23rd wedding anniversary the other day. Second time round for both of us, so no, we were no giddy goats when we set out 23 years ago.“Will they last, do you think?”  “No chance”.Sorry, chaps, they did, this long anyway. And unless they fall out over who has first call on the Zimmer frame, gets to eat all the soft centre chocolates in the box, or has control of the TV remote, (what is it with men and the remote?), they’ll probably last for the duration.But back to the pub.25 years ago the Charing Cross Road in London was still full of bookshops, red double deckers, black cabs; pavements covered in litter, sleazy bars and old-fashioned pubs and the occasional ‘working girl’  straying from nearby Soho.Theatres and the  Astoria Cinema fetched in the suburban crowds in the evening,  while tramps and young, homeless boys and girls murmured their monotonous chant “got any spare change” at them.Centre Point stood tall and empty and opposite Centre Point was The Royal Sovereign, not exactly spit and sawdust, but dark and shabby, full of wooden, ‘mahagony type’ pub furniture, settles and benches, with small brass tables, where tiny beer puddles gathered in the dimples of the beaten tops.The nearest Underground station was just around the corner, which made the pub a handy pit stop for a quick drink and unwind before going home after work.Artists came here, media people (who were not called media people in those days), booksellers and assorted office workers. People just setting out for a night’s work came here too, like musicians playing in West End shows and The Royal Opera in Covent Garden.A particular chap caught my eye on several occasions; we got talking over a pint, decided to go for a pancake in nearby Holborn, which was close to this chaps’ place of work and another tube station for me on my way home.Reader, I married him.Twenty five years later I thank my lucky stars for women’s lib, without which I would not have had the nerve to walk into a pub after work, talk to a strange man, go for a pancake with him, without ‘having been introduced properly’.All you young women and girls of today, who take such freedoms for granted and make fun of the old-style feminists, think again. You owe them quite a debt of gratitude."},
{"title": "A Very Sad Garden", "date": "Tuesday 13 April 2010", "text": "This is my first attempt at creating a collage. I think I'd rather go on working in the garden.We had a gorgeous weekend, the sun shone, it was warm and the birds sang. Gardener came and we worked for seven hours, with a short intermission for a hasty lunch and frequent cups of tea provided by Beloved.The flowers shown are Chaenomeles, white anemones, blue anemones, miniature tulips and  yellow primroses.Gardener and I have been taking a close look at the shrubs, flowering, evergreen and ordinary deciduous ones.There is a lot of winter damage; most of the hebes have succumbed to the frost, the leaves on the bay tree and an ancient and very large cistus have turned brown and shrivelled, certain to crumble and drop soon. Olearias, nandinas, a hydrangea or two barely hang on, one or two of the Japanese maples have suffered severe wind damage, and all phormiums have rotted away.Abelias, caryopteris, and ceanothus show no, or very little, sign of life.So much of the backbone of the garden has been destroyed this winter that it breaks my heart. Herbaceous plants are easy to replace, either by division, root cuttings or scrounging, a favourite way of enlarging your stock among friends and fellow gardeners.Unless you are a gardener you probably think 'what a lot of fuss over nothing'. 'Just buy new plants'.Most of these plants have a history; I remember where they came from; some were swapped for other plants, some were grown from tiny cuttings (one or two of which I might even have taken from famous gardens, with permission from the head gardener), for some I travelled to specialist nurseries all over the UK, some have come with me from a previous garden, been dug up and transplanted. Some were given as presents for a special occasion, their growth measuring somebody's passing years.Of course, they can all be replaced, but it takes a long time for shrubs to grow to maturity. There is still the possibility that some shrubs might recover after serious pruning later on this Spring; sometimes new shoots and leaves will sprout as much as a year later. In the meantime, I will have large gaps in my borders, to be filled with my least favourite gap fillers, here-today-and-gone-tomorrow annuals, silly and brazenly colourful show-offs, only good for tubs and pots and window boxes normally."},
{"title": "You Don't Have To Like People To Like Them", "date": "Sunday 11 April 2010", "text": "Pierre-Auguste RenoirThe Luncheon of the Boating Party1881No, not a mistake, I know what I said there.Let me explain.There were eight of us to lunch with a couple who had invited us to their house for the first time. We had met a few times before, had sat at the same table even, just never in our own homes. So the invitation did not come completely out of the blue, but we hadn’t really been expecting one either.We arrived to find other couples we knew, the host offered wine and the conversation began in a relaxed and amiable fashion. From the beginning, we found that we shared very few of the opinions of the others most of the time. No matter what the topic was, from leisure activities, cultural preferences, religion, politics, to music, literature, films, newspapers, our tastes were quite different from the hosts’ and usually several of the other guests.Yet it made no difference to the friendly atmosphere round the table. Although we all spoke frankly, nobody fell out with anybody else and when the opinion expressed by one or other seemed too extreme to counter, we just kept quiet.Back home, I nearly fell off my chair when Beloved casually said “Nice people”. He meant it. I had to agree. In spite of the differences of opinion and some difficulties about the food (the hostess didn’t realize that I have a particular food intolerance), we had both thoroughly enjoyed the lunch. In fact, we and another couple stayed long after it would have been polite to leave. I am certain hat this will not have been the last time we share a meal.What is it that allows us to get on with people, and enjoy their company, with whom we have nothing in common whereas we can fall out with others, whose opinions we share ?Family is different. You row and shout and become very rude, you hate each other and say so, you dredge up every last insult and slight and misunderstanding, you vow never to darken each other’s doorstep again. When that is over, and the air is cleared, you band together as a family once more, until the next time. Very well, it doesn’t happen in your family, your family is different. Lucky you.There are close friends who do that to each other too. I have no close friends.When we meet others socially, we have to be on our best behaviour, we are unlikely to provoke a row. Telling the other what we think of him is for children or social morons. Manners come into it, an ability to remain detached and polite, to respect the other and accept them as equals, to listen to what they have to say without interruption.But what is it that allows us to say, quite genuinely, “Nice People”, when we have just spent a few hours in  the company of people of the kind “we don’t like”?And it wasn’t only the wine!"},

I had heard that they had more or less given up handing out prizes for the prettiest, flower-filled thimble and the tastiest slice of fruitcake and have turned their attention to weightier matters.I duly turned up at the village hall and was made very welcome.Picture the scene: an old-fashioned, plain village hall, a row of chairs neatly lined up and facing a large table behind which stood more chairs for use by ‘the committee’, and an old upright piano along one wall. On the table were small items of a decorative nature, floral and handicraft.The ladies sat down; I noticed that one had gone to the old piano. She lifted the lid. The top table gave a signal, everybody stood up again, the piano roared into life and the ladies sang! Sang  Jerusalem ! Lustily, loudly and with great enthusiasm. Somebody kindly handed me a song sheet, inviting me to join in. In for a penny, in for a pound.I was just exhorting the powers who have such treasures within their gift toBring me my bow of burning gold,Bring me my arrows of desire;Bring me my spear: o cloud unfold!Bring me my chariot of fire, when my necklace broke and pretty beads clattered all over the wooden floor.  The ladies either side of me abandoned their stations and scrabbled about to hunt them down, while I stood, petrified, burning with shame, clutching the few beads remaining on the broken string. The song came to an end, the ladies handed me the beads they had gathered up;  I dumped the lot in my bag. From the top table came a voice expressing regret at the unfortunate disturbance to the solemn start of the meeting. I wanted to sink through the floorboards and vanish without trace. I stayed.Next a pair of ladies from another group were introduced who had had great success with initiating play-acting during meetings and were willing to share their success with our little band. We were duly lined up, in pairs, and asked to perform a series of activities which included greeting each other, bowing, raising an imaginary hat, conversing and moving on to the next group, there to repeat the performance.This was to release inhibitions and prepare us for more demanding work.I grew desperate. I could feel myself seizing up and a rictus grin settling on my face.  One of the instructresses noticed my discomfort and asked sweetly:  “Don’t you like the theatre?” The rest of the meeting became a blur; I know there was some kind of round dance with more bowing and scraping, during which, and long before tea and biscuits, I made my excuses and fled.When I got home I was almost in shock, it took a large glass of wine to restore me to equanimity. Utterly ridiculous, I know.I never went back."},

We discovered a fair, almost hidden by mobs of children. I tried my hand, unsuccessfully, at hoopla and Aunt Sally. Mike won a shapeless, purposeless piece of metal at the Aunt Sally. Most of the stalls were merely pigs in pokes. You bought little screws of paper at 20 Pfennigs each and if they bore a number you won a suitably insignificant prize. Most of the prizes were cheap, useless things, rosettes, cheap dolls and penknives and the like. One prize, rated pretty highly, was a teat for a baby's bottle.There were none of the English side shows like roll-'em-downs, rubber-ball-rollings and lotteries; nothing but a few tawdry roundabouts. I felt a general air of \"I must enjoy myself, even if it is all hollow.\"Having seen all we wanted of the fair, we went slowly on to the Naafi and sat in the lounge reading. Soon after, a funeral cortège passed the window.First came a ragged procession of men in greys and browns, all wearing bowlers or caps. Gradually the colours darkened and then came four men in black frock coats and top hats; then came the wreaths, reverently carried by sad-looking elders; then came the hearse, draped in black and drawn by two black horses in black-plumed harnesses. Directly behind the hearse was an old lady, leaning on the arm of a young man, weeping proudly and profusely. Behind them came three young women with wet eyes and handkerchiefs. A black robed priest followed wearing what seemed to me to be a cardinal's black biretta.A ragged assortment of men and women followed, in dark clothes or with black armbands and finally, there was a closed carriage, in which four black-clad old women were talking animatedly.The whole procession was in unrelieved black, with a few greys and browns sprinkled through here and there, except for the bright red shorts worn by six men who marched, three on each side, by the side of the hearse, heads bowed. There was no sound except for the shuffling of feet and the ragged rattle of the horses' hooves.They passed beyond our field of vision and we sat down gain. Len started playing some light song. I  picked up my book again.\"Quaint, these continental customs\", said the W.V.S. lady, and went back to her book-sorting."},
{"title": "EASTER", "date": "Saturday 3 April 2010", "text": "Easter eggs and the Easter BunnySince the time of the ancient Teutonic world the egg has been regarded as a bringer of luck and symbol of fertility, a joyful gift to celebrate the return of spring.Although egg painting was known in pre-Christian Greece the custom did not reach Northern Europe until the 17th Century when the Turks conquered Byzantium, causing many of the inhabitants to flee northwards, taking their traditions with them, including the custom of painting eggs.Written records show that the Easter Bunny as egg bringer first appeared on German soil in 1682, in the company of cockerels, foxes and donkeys, who were all deemed \"responsible\" for the delivery of eggs. It seems most likely that the rabbit won through against the competition because of its high symbolism. Like the egg, the ancient Greeks, Romans and Teutons revered the rabbit as a symbol of fertility.All the Easter Sundays of my childhood were sunny, how could it have been otherwise. In the predominantly catholic area where I grew up children were told that the Church bells, which fell silent on \"Green Thursday\" (Maundy Thursday) and did not sound again until Easter Sunday, had flown to Rome, to be blessed by the Pope. So, on Easter Sunday morning, we were woken by the joyous, noisy clamour of the freshly returned bells of the village Church and all the other Churches in villages all around ringing out over the wide, flat, marshy land.Children rushed outdoors to hunt for the Easter eggs which their parents had painted and hidden in small clusters all over the garden. There were no chocolate eggs until much later but I do remember, that we were given sweets, such as liquorice sticks and boiled, flavoured lumps of sugar when food  became available off the rations and the black markets had ceased to exist.The eggs were eaten for breakfast. Once the first novelty and excitement of the hunt had passed and the basket of prettily patterned, painted eggs on the table had been admired, I soon grew tired of eating them. They were, of course, cold and hard-boiled, I could never manage more than one; thinking back now, it seems to me that they were dished up, in some form or other, for days afterwards. Eggs were by no means plentiful, not even in the country; being part of the rations, they were a precious source of nourishment, highly appreciated."},

{"title": "AMBITION", "date": "Monday 29 March 2010", "text": "For want of anything more aspirational I shall make it my ambition to live to the ripe old age of eighty.When I was very young, forty was an immense age, an age reserved for people without imagination, for people who lacked the moral courage to terminate their  by then useless lives, to do the  decent thing and make room for  dynamic younger generations. When people proudly mentioned their great age, I’d think : “yea, right, whatever, and bully for you.  It’s not as if you had to do anything towards getting old. You just got.”Callow youth was ever thus.Now that forty is but a distant memory, eighty and the years leading up to eighty look quite different. Inviting, in fact. I am filled to the brim with good, common sense, experience and wisdom; I am even willing and unselfish enough to let the younger generation benefit, I am ready to pass on this wisdom to any and all. In fact, I often do. Silly squirts, don’t seem to want to know.It is unlikely, but just possible, that I shall have to undergo a few physical changes before I get to eighty. If you ask me how I am, I shall tell you, in detail; I shall tell you about my ailments, explaining at length about minor and major operations, as well as not forgetting to fill you in on the surgical procedures of friends.In the meantime I have decided to adopt a few pleasant customs for the years ahead.The colour green suits me, so I shall try to own at least one green outfit to wear as often as possible. A red wig to go with it, should my hair go grey and wispy. I promise not to click or suck my teeth while chewing my favourite toffees, but to keep them firmly glued in at all times.Driving will become a doddle. Here at Valley’s End, the oldies drive how they like and park where they like. And if I have to go further afield, I shall keep to a steady 40 mph, wherever I happen to be. It is so reassuring and a great boon for other motorists to know they can rely on me. I can tell they like it by the long queues that form behind cars driven by older drivers. Nice and safe.There are lots of things that will please me. Walking sticks and accidentally slipping them in front of an impatient person trying to get past me, is one. Or standing in the checkout queue at the supermarket and suddenly remembering that I have to pay for my groceries. My wallet holding credit cards is so hard to find in my capacious bag; I find that the cashiers are usually very patient and don’t mind explaining to me that I must press the green button first, or maybe last, I forget which. They’re also quite willing to wait until I’ve found the bit of paper with my pin number. Silly me, I do forget. And if I should forget an item, somebody will run off and fetch it for me.There will be plenty of time for being in the company of friends andacquaintances. Maybe even family. I will try to remember my hearing aid, but if I forget, people are quite happy to shout, in public places, like restaurants. At home, I won’t need it, after all, I can always turn up the sound on the TV. There’s only me to consider; I’ll probably find that I can’t usually hear the neighbours thumping on the wall.And best of all, I could rave and rant and shout and complain about everything, from politicians to social services, immigrants and feckless layabouts on social security, young girls having babies to get a council flat, the rubbish in the streets, declining public standards, and the general disregard the young have for the old.I could work myself into a right old lather.On second thoughts, that would mean becoming a completely different person so maybe I’ll give that kind of raving and ranting a miss."},

{"title": "Books and Me", "date": "Wednesday 24 March 2010", "text": "Here I am, once again, sitting at the dreaded keyboard, staring at words appearing on a screen.  From my head, to my fingers, to the screen. my own words appear in black on white; words and sentences I already know before they appear.Where is the  excitement in that?Now books are a whole other kettle of fish. Unless I’ve sneaked a look at the last page, I have no idea how the characters develop, what hoops the author makes them jump through and how the tale ends, whether happily or, as they deserve, miserably and in tatters. (Oh, I love a good comeuppance, don’t you?)Books, I’ve loved them all my life.When I was a skinny beanpole of  eight or nine, who, acc. to my aunt, could have done with some serious feeding up, I once pestered my mum so persistently to buy me a couple of books from a second hand stall, that she actually softened and spent that day’s dinner money on them. We were very poor then. “Your Dad will kill me”, she said several times on the way home. In the end she didn’t tell him and dinner that day plumbed new depths of inventiveness.From when I was about ten, twelve years old, books were all I ever asked for. When asked , “and what present did you have for your birthday, Christmas, whenever?”, the answer was a jubilant “books”, or a sad and dejected “clothes”. One Christmas I remember, to my shame, going so far as to recite the titles of all the books I’d asked for and been given and then telling people the cost. “Books for one hundred marks”,  a lot of money then.The aunts were disgusted. “Send her out to play; no wonder she’s as pale as cheese, crouching over her books all the time.  It’s unnatural!” Books were my world. I read not only children’s stories but anything I could get my hands on. I lived the adventures, travelled to distant places, learned about geography and history, read stories about strange cultures, read children’s classics and the greatest rubbish printed. I swallowed it all.Books have always been a treat; frequently indulged in when there was  time and sneaked in guiltily when there wasn’t. For years I had a book in the desk at my office, open; if anyone came in, I unhurriedly shut the drawer, smiling innocently at my visitor.  I preferred long journeys to work on the Underground, particularly, if I had been fortunate to grab a seat. There was a lot less free reading time at work or at home.During some rather dark years reading was my only solace. The children were very good, they were allowed to stay up in the evening until it was their  generously extended bedtime,  if they promised to spend the time quietly in their rooms, with their own books and music, while I lay, face down, on the sitting room carpet, reading. I must have read every thriller published in the English language in those years, too tired to read anything more demanding.Now that I have all the reading time I want, I write and blog, inventing stories nobody will ever read about characters nobody could ever be interested in. As for blogging? Is there a greater waste of reading time? (Oops, I wonder if anybody has got as far as this?)In winter, when snow and ice keep us indoors, what could be cosier than sitting reading, curled up on the sofa? In summer, is there anything more soothing than lying on a chair in the garden, sipping a lemonade and slowly turning the pages of your chosen book, while bees and insects busy themselves around you.I am writing this in my favourite room in the house, my study, two walls of which consist entirely of bookshelves filled with my own books; Beloved’s shelves are elsewhere. My study smells of books, the dry, dusty, slightly mouldy and mildewy smell of a lot of books together, mixed with a little leftover incense. Spring is around the corner and I shall soon have to appear, blinking, into the sunlight, much like my aunt recommended all those years ago. Where’s that garden chair?"},
{"title": "EVA'S TALE", "date": "Monday 22 March 2010", "text": "Eva Goes On Holiday  # 6Miss Manfred and The Lady who sits with us in the dining room and when we play games indoors said that it’s my birthday today.How was I supposed to know, nobody told me.It was an ordinary day; we played on the beach in the morning, then we had to go to the nurse and she did what she calls an examination and I had to take my vest off again; I have to do this all the time here, at least maybe three or four times already, or maybe six. The nurse says that the sea air has done me good and that my chest is much clearer and that I’ll be a new girl when I go home.  That’s so silly, I don’t think that I can be new, how can I be new when I’m already a big girl.After our lunch we had to lie down again for a rest and then we went to tea and to play games indoors in the big dining room. All the other children from the  big house were there too and when I tried to go to the table for the children from the isolation ward, where we always sit, The Lady called me back and said to come to the front next to her table where she and Miss Manfred and some of the other grown-ups sit to have their meals and watch us play.Nobody else had ever had to do this before and I was really frightened. I knew I hadn’t done anything bad, I don’t think Miss Manfred had seen us when Susie and I went and hid in the dunes and pretended to be lost, because we went back before she noticed that we had run away.I went to The Lady and I saw that she was smiling, so she couldn’t be cross with me. When grown-ups tell me off they never smile, they look serious and angry and upset. Then they tell me that they are very upset and they don’t think that I might be upset because they are cross with me.The Lady and Miss Manfred were standing by a little table between the big tables for the grown-ups and I saw that they had a cake on it; the cake looked very nice and I thought how lucky they were to have it.The Lady made me stand by the little table, right in front of all the children and the grown-ups and she said that it was a very special day for me because it was my birthday and then she said that I could choose any song and that all the children would sing it for me because it was my birthday and did I know which song I wanted them to sing for me. And that I could also choose a game to play afterwards and that the cake was for my table and for the other girls from the isolation ward and that everybody would have a piece of cake to eat and that there was enough cake for everybody.I have never had a cake because of me before and I didn’t know any songs for everybody to sing and I didn’t want to choose a game either. Nobody told me that it was my birthday and I didn’t like to stand there and everybody staring at me. I could tell that The Lady was looking at Miss Manfred and that Miss Manfred was looking back at the Lady and they were making private grown-up faces at each other, with smiles and shruggy shoulders. I know grown-ups when they think you can’t see them because they are taller than you and secretly they are saying that they think you are stupid and they make poor child faces, when really they have no idea that they are being creepy with their songs and their games.In the end The Lady said that everybody should sing the song about the Jolly Rambler and would I like that. Well of course I know that song, we sing it all the time and it is nothing special and I could have told her that too and she also said we could play a game of Black Peter afterwards, if I liked.So she made me stand there and everybody sang about the Jolly Rambler and I had to pretend to be glad because it was specially for me, but it was really creepy and I could see that I hadn’t cleaned my shoes after we had been to the beach and there was a lot of sand in the cracks. I am glad I was dribbling sand all over their clean floor.After everybody had shouted happy birthday Eva, The Lady let me go back to my table.The cake was lovely and I ate a very big piece all by myself. When I go home again I must ask Mum if I can have a cake for my next birthday. At least, I won’t have to  have a song sung for me."},

{"title": "Letter To My Mother", "date": "Wednesday 17 March 2010", "text": "SistersDear MotherLast Sunday was Mothering Sunday here in the UK. Do you remember how I used to send you a card on the wrong day for a few years, until I finally remembered to mark the relevant page in my diary?You were not amused.That is what I remember most about you, you never found me amusing. Being amused by somebody and liking them go together and where liking is missing, amusement has no entry. Perhaps you loved me, it’s what mothers do, after all.Even when I was an adult, you found me irritating, annoying, willful, disobedient, and most of all, ungrateful. You never missed a chance to recite your litany of all the things you had done for me, had had to give up for me; “and for what”, you asked,  “what do I get in return?”I don’t know what you expected in return for having me and raising me. Later, when I had children of my own, I asked myself what I wanted from them and I found I had no answer.  Once they had grown up I hoped for an affectionate, adult relationship, on equal terms and free from constraint on both sides.  It didn’t work out quite the way I had hoped, but now I know that I did my best, which is really all we can do.Which brings me back to you and me. You often complained bitterly about ‘having been the workhorse, the unappreciated drudge’ in your father’s house after your mother died. You complained that you were the one to run the household while your brothers and sister were free to pursue their own interests. You complained that your efforts were never valued, your wishes never considered. You felt unloved.I remember one particular occasion when, on the drive home after a visit to your sister’s house, you burst into hysterical tears, and resentment at your sister’s selfishness poured forth in an unstoppable flow. I remember being terribly embarrassed at what I saw as a lack of restraint. I wish I had understood at the time, felt sympathy rather than distaste.Is that what happened with me? Did I also take what you gave, showing neither appreciation nor gratitude? Did you raise me, your only surviving child, with the expectation of a return on your investment?  When you said that ‘Annie’, your stillborn child was prettier, sweeter than me, when you said that she would have been grateful while I ‘just took’, were you repaying your own family for the way they hurt you?It is too late to ask you, you are gone. You would not have spoken anyway, getting close enough to speak of feelings was always to be avoided. When I tried to approach you, you always changed the subject, saying “I don’t know what you want. Things are fine, we get on well, don’t we?” But the day always came when  the dam broke and the torrent of recrimination, accusation and condemnation swept over me and drowned me in a flood of guilt. Did I finally do right when you lay dying? When the hospital doctors and their medicines kept you alive long after you had had enough, did I do right when you demanded that I took the pills away the moment the nurses turned their back? “Put them in the bin”, you said.  “They’ll see them there”, I said, “I’ll take them out with me”. We did this for a week. You calmed down and grew weaker. The doctors couldn’t understand. I sat with you, all day, every day and late into the night, hoping you would finally speak to me.On your last day, a little girl came to visit the patient in the other bed in the room. You turned your head away from me and smiled your last smile."},

Taking the narrow country lanes up through the farmland we soon reach the forest and the Rhos Fiddle Nature Reserve.Rhos Fiddle is a Shropshire Wildlife Trust nature reserve, little more than a mile from the Welsh border. The SWT describes it as one of the quietest places in Shropshire; I would go so far as to say that it is one of the quietest places on earth. There are buzzards, snipe and hares, as well as curlews and other birds which have become rare.In spite of its name, 'Clun Forest' is actually an ancient, unimproved, upland heathland and bog, marshy and reedy, with many species of plantlife which are becoming ever more rare in this industrialized 'agro-business' world we live in. Botanists come to study mosses and grasses; the whole area is a rare surviving fragment of an almost extinct, precious, natural resource.Yesterday, we had the many acres of windswept heath to ourselves. It is too early in the year for nesting birds. But for the mewling of a pair of buzzards lazily circling, the bleat of a distant lamb and the sound of the wind, the silence up here is absolute.The only grazing here is by imported, tough highland cattle which do not damage the balance of the natural world,  sheep are allowed in only very rarely and then only on to the outer edges of the land.

{"title": "How Not To Make Friends", "date": "Thursday 11 March 2010", "text": "Have you ever been dropped by someone because of the newspaper you read?I have. The newspaper in question was (and is, I still read it for preference) by no means any kind of radical, either ultra left or ultra right wing rag; no, it is a nice, sometimes slightly well-meaning, occasionally off-the-wall, middle-of-the-road broadsheet, which likes its arts, literature and well-written and thoughtful editorials, known affectionately for its dodgy proof-readers.When we first decided to try country living, we moved to the Home Counties (for my non-UK readers: the counties surrounding London). Any new place is slightly daunting at first, it takes some time to get to know the locals, so I was very glad to come across another dog-walker, who said she’d love to team up for walks in the very pleasant countryside surrounding the village.things that I know nobody told me - about friendshipRollin KocsisWe met three or four times for walks before I asked her to tea; we seemed to have quite a lot in common and never ran out of conversation. I was beginning to congratulate myself on my good fortune.Then we asked both my new acquaintance and her husband to come for drinks, just the two of them. As you do, we talked about what we all do for a living, etc. He was a builder, with his own company; my involvement in an international trade secretariat with a European office didn’t go down too well, whereas Beloved is, of course, a layabout musician. Or so the husband soon appeared to think. We should have smelled a rat when Beloved explained that musicians have the right to a ten minute break in every three hours worked, both in rehearsals and, where possible, during performances and Husband said that he’d sack any of his workers who demanded a break after three hours’ work.Fair enough, we believe in live and let-live and didn’t take him very seriously. While Wife, Beloved and I drank wine, Husband was very happy with Beloved’s bottle of whisky all to himself. Very happy.So happy, in fact, that he became quite animated. And then it happened, he took a tour of our 17th century cottage and saw a pile of newspapers on a side table. “Oh my God, they read the **** fill-in-name-of-paper”, turning to his wife, his face by now bright red. (I am glad to say, he had a heart condition) His wife cringed, “yes, I know”, she said, obviously having seen it on previous visits and not dared to inform him of this heinous offence.She shushed him and asked him to sit down again, which he did. The funny thing was that in spite of his horror at finding himself in the house of subversives and layabouts,  it didn’t stop him from near enough finishing Beloved’s bottle of single malt before they left.I rang her several times afterwards to make a date for a walk; she was never free."},

I have played three times in the last fortnight; once in the O.Rs dining hall at Munsterlager and once in the Sergeant's Mess here, and once unofficially; a few little quartets I had arranged from Orlando Gibbons and Giles Farnaby.We travel about, but journeys are much the same everywhere. We have our own coach, and I win money at whist every time we travel for more than half an hour.Having travelled away from the Rhineland, through Brunswick, to Schleswig-Holstein, I still feel that it is the character of the country that is missing, the air has no personality. Further North, the people seem better fed and clothed, more contented, the shops have more in them. Probably they endured no shell fire here.The soldiers try to make what they can out of the people and the people try, more successfully, to get all they can from us. The only air about is lethargy, dangerous lethargy.I have become accustomed to bomb damage, a strange tongue, and traffic on the right by now. The only things that still seem strange are the black market and the tarts.As I found occasion to say this morning, this is indeed a country of 'brothelly' love.And now it is Easter Sunday morning and the maids have just cleaned the room, Mike is lying on his bed, reading, dictionary at hand, and I am sitting at the table, writing this, thinking nothing in particular and feeling hungry.o-o-o-o-o-o-oHusum, Easter MondayWe arrived here this morning after a four hour journey. The country up here is flat and flooded and most uninspired in the cheerless light of a wet day. The streets are long and quaint and the windmills only add to the Dutch character of the views. The string orchestra has just finished playing in the barracks here, amid ribald remarks from our overworked military and dance-band colleagues.Two or three days ago, Mike, Len, Derek and myself decided that, if opportunity arose, we would get drunk on spirits before we returned to Larkhill, partly in vague celebration, and largely because spirits are so much cheaper over here. The opportunity arose last night, when, by sundry wangling, we obtained permission from the manager to buy gin, which is normally reserved for sergeants only.By going to the serving hatch in turns, in order not to arouse the barman's suspicions, we managed to buy and consume six gins, two cakes and two German cocktails (which we decided were constituted of cascura and coughcure) each. One of the cocktails was contributed by a slightly merry B.M., and we were quite merry ourselves by this time. We soon fell to singing and telling stories. Mike bought a round of beer, which I refused to drink and the three of them became rather drunk on the strength of it. Supper came and went and Mike and Derek grew rather uncontrollable. Derek started playing the piano quite indescribably and Mike wandered round telling a revolting story, which took him ten minutes to finish - once.Eventually, they were persuaded to go to bed. Derek, having been assisted to his room, insisted on going round most rooms, saying good night to people. After two of these trips I locked him in his room.Mike was a little pugnacious and unsteady, but otherwise normal.Meanwhile, I was feeling almost sober, but I had a headache, and my eyes refused to focus on anything without a struggle. However, having finally seen Mike, Derek and Len in bed, I retired myself and closed my eyes. Immediately I did that, everything began to move to the left, at first slowly and then accelerando, until I opened my eyes suddenly to stop fainting, and when everything skidded to a halt, it was almost as bad.Eventually, I got to sleep and slept heavily until seven. When I woke, I felt like an innocent, albeit a bit bruised.There's been a rumour that we'll reach Larkhill next Sunday night.Roll on, roll bloody on."},

Although not one of us had met more than one or two of the others before, the only quiet time was when we were all tucking into a plentiful meal. (After all, we all have our priorities right!) The rest of the time the talk around the round table was buzzing, within minutes gales of laughter erupted; we felt we already knew each other intimately. Perhaps we  reveal more about ourselves in our blogs, what kind of person we are, than we plan or is immediately obvious.After the meal we climbed up into the kingdom of Trelystan where we braved the sunny but very cold day to visit the hidden gem of Trelystan Church in its snowdrop carpeted churchyard, taking innumerable photos of the spectacular views all around.  Inside we found a wonderful stained glass window and, strangely, a barrel organ. Nobody was brave enough to turn the handle with enough determination to elicit a sound.Every time I am asked to meet otherbloggers I feel slightly uncomfortable about the prospect.This has been my third such meeting and I have to admit that my apprehension has so far not been justified by the subsequent get-together.More bloggers meetings?

Silver birches shone victorious and larch and spruce painted the Heath in tender green hues. Willows by the brook stretched their long, bare arms into the newly blue sky and shed their gnomish winter image. Children's GamesbyPieter Bruegel the ElderAfter the long months of winter incarceration, March was the month when we children burst out into the light of backyard and garden, the village street and square; when the paraphernalia of outdoor games made their triumphant re-emergence from dusty corners and deep cupboards.  Many of the over 80 games Bruegel painted in 1560 were still known in the villages of the flat landscapes of Northern Europe in the 40s and 50s of the last century, and I remember playing tag and marbles, hopscotch and skipping, ball games, bowling hoops and whip top. Girls held hands, sang and danced to nursery rhymes and boys climbed trees.There was little spare cash for buying toys in the early years, later on our parents 'organised' scooters, roller skates and even bicycles for us, many of them cobbled together from spare parts. In those days, necessity was indeed the mother of invention.Now March is the month when work in the garden starts in earnest, when spring lambs are born and the brown March hares fight in the fields.Mad March hares -  the most mysterious andsacred of British animals  -  now performing their mating rituals."},
{"title": "Cancer  -  \"Be Positive\" ?", "date": "Monday 1 March 2010", "text": "cancer cell at the moment of divisionphoto by Dr. Paul Andrews, University of DundeeThis blog is not going to start concentrating on medical matters, although you might be forgiven for thinking so after the last two posts.Bear with me for just one more entry, although, friends, this time, there will be no jokes and definitely no laughs. If that turns you off, so be it.My blogging friend Deborah in her last post urged us to go and visit Caroline, who has recently started blogging about her cancer. Caroline's blog is desperately moving, she needs all the positive support the blogging community can give her.Both Caroline and I have railed against the prevailing wisdom, which exhorts cancer sufferers to \"remain positive\" at all times and Deborah asked why we didn't buy into this philosophy whole-heartedly.In an email I explained to Deborah, but I think it might be of general interest, so I will tell you all too.This is what I wrote:o-o-o-oWhen you are first told you have cancer the world collapses around you. Suddenly you have no future other than a painful and possibly short one.For everybody to concentrate on you being positive (bp from now on) when you really want to rave and rant and scream the place down and \"why me, why me\" and howl and weep and despair, bp is bloody hard.You really want to be left alone to react the way you NEED to there and then.Then you get used to the diagnosis (or not) and the rollercoaster of treatments begins. You feel bloody awful again and for quite a beastly long time. You have lost all control over your body, doctors and nurses and oncologists and radiotherapists take over. Inside you are probably still screaming; I was. The cancer becomes the centre of your world.In spite of all that, it is possible to remain passionate about something; for me it was gardening. My oncologist and I used to discuss gardening and crops and hard work at every session, She'd root around inside me, (I had endometrial cancer), and take my mind off things that way. She'd also ask me about the garden and my plans for it, therefore giving me a future. . . . . .I think what many cancer sufferers and survivors, at least those who can think for themselves, object to, is that bp is the be-all and end-all for some. If the treatment doesn't work, bp doesn't work. Cancer is not something you are responsible for and bp isn't going to make you better. Neither is giving in without a fight, of course. Bp helps the whole person to be in a healthier place, better able to withstand the onslaught, and it bloody well is an onslaught.But fighting  and bp only help so far, you can still die in spite of the most positive attitude in the world.I remember one day in particular; Waking up in the morning I found I was crying. Not howling, just crying, tears spilling down my face. An hour later, on the hour-long drive to the day's session, I was still crying. While I was waiting, in my scanty gown, to go into the radiotherapy room, the crying went on. Staff looked at me, \"there, there, it's not so bad, you'll soon be on your way home again\". \"B p\" Before, during, after treatment, and while getting dressed, I cried. On the way home, Beloved driving, I cried. At home, I cried, All evening, I cried. I went to bed crying. By next  morning I had stopped.I had been so bloody positive all the time, something in me took over and caused me and my psyche and my body to react the way it needed to react.I had absolutely no control over those tears.I felt a lot better afterwards and the bp wasn't nearly as enforced and straitjacketed ever again.Dear Deb, thank you for asking, I think I needed to tell someone. My friend Jenny, whom I mentioned to Caroline, is only just starting treatment and all she tells me is, \"I've got to stay positive\", her cancer is inoperable and probably terminal and I can't bring myself to tell her to be kind to herself.o-o-o-oI know that there are a few of us who have blogged, and are still blogging, on living with cancer. Once you have/have had cancer (luckily, life expectancy is so much better now than it was), you find lots of others coming out and discussing this intruder, this unwanted, evil enemy that has taken over your body and how to cope with it. I did everything I could, I took everything on offer, from every kind of alternative treatment to anything the doctors threw at me. I am a survivor.If it should be you, now or in the future, or somebody you love, allow yourself/them space to despair, to weep, to rave and rant, to curse fate. Although I can only speak for myself, I can say that I felt better for it afterwards, able to pick myself up and  face whatever came next."},
{"title": "Medical Interlude", "date": "Saturday 27 February 2010", "text": "A whole week lost to norovirus. Appointments cancelled, jobs left undone, blogs unread and posts unwritten.  I didn’t even feel good enough to enjoy the enforced idleness. The dog pined, not getting his usual walks, the cleaning help refused to set foot in the house, dirty laundry piled up.Beloved brought the virus home first; he was done with it in three days, after having generously donated it to me. With me it liked to linger longer; I am one of those unfortunate people whose heart sometimes plays silly-buggers. 98% of the time it ticks and tocks along nicely but under the strain of a viral infection and the havoc this wreaks, one minute it can be playing jungle drums, the next withdraw from the scene like a Victorian lady having the vapours. Letting it go on for any length of time is usually not a good idea.So the trusty GP arrived, my sweet and gentle friend Dr. J.; next, a couple of burly chaps in blue were bundling me into their evil-smelling ambulance, in spite of saying ‘yes, boss’ when I swore at them to leave me where I was.Once on the ward - where my heart soon assumed normal service  - pretty little nurslings, otherwise known as auxiliaries, in pale pastel uniforms, with very little nursing training, were flitting about occasionally, sending vague smiles in my direction, but probably too scared to enter the personal space of a leper.  Full-grown nurses were very few and far between, doctors nowhere to be seen.As I was no longer an emergency, that didn’t matter and I settled back to observe.Nurses generally seem to be of the opinion that anybody in the vicinity of 60 and over must be deaf, half-blind and definitely gaga, in need of incontinence pads, hearing aids and receptacles for false teeth.  Very often they are right. Unless you, the patient, lay down the ground rules and set boundaries the minute you arrive, you become part of the great shadowy body of invisible, pitiable, demoralized, patronized, and mostly elderly occupants of NHS hospital wards. Nobody is actually deliberately unkind or abusive but you are certainly meant to keep quiet,  take your meds and don’t bother anyone. God help you if you can’t move under your own steam! The picture is not a pretty one. Ringing your bell is a waste of time.For 20 years I have held a season ticket to the show, I know what I am talking about.In spite of all of the above and perhaps because of having learned the hard way tonegotiate terms and conditions,  I am usually treated courteously. When the Polish doctor finally arrived at three in the morning, eight hours after I had arrived, I recognized him for an old friend I had met before and we were soon chatting away, comparing notes about health services in our respective countries.  Both of us being NHS insiders, as doctor and patient, we are allowed to do that; neither of us would allow an outsider to do so. Polish doctor will be leaving the UK eventually to return to Poland, where he will be a “better doctor” than his Polish colleagues because UK training is more rigorous than training in his own country; he turned down Germany because there the final exams “are harder”.Strange world.  To me that reasoning is somehow not quite logical, medicine being medicine? Maybe not.Polish doctor checked me over, hooked me up to a saline drip, filled in a few reams of paper and we parted the best of friends, me to stay in my bed, finally allowed a few hours sleep and he to continue on his rounds.In the morning I was discharged."},

{"title": "Eva's Tale", "date": "Thursday 18 February 2010", "text": "Eva Goes On Holiday  # 5The story so far: Eva is little girl living in post-war Germany. Because she might be in danger of contracting TBC she is sent to a children's home, which is also used as a sanatorium, on the island of Norderney in the North Sea.  She is away from home, on her own,  for the first time in her life. the sand dunes on NorderneyWe went to the beach today because it’s warm enough now and we are all much better, Miss Manfred says. Nobody had to stay behind, which was really nice.  I knew it must be the sea because the other children had told me what it looked like when they came back from the beach. The beach was really just sand, with sandhills and grass behind, which Miss Manfred said were dunes, but the sea was huge, lots and lots of water, as far as you could see, which was a sort of greeny-blue colour and sparkly and the water kept coming on to the beach, and you had to run backwards quickly if you didn’t want to get your skirt wet. Once I nearly fell over. Miss Manfred would have been really cross with me. First the waves came rolling up and they had white foam on the top, like egg-snow, and then they tipped over and when they reached the beach they were like little foamy ripples, just like when Mum chucks a bucket of soap water over the stones in the backyard.  And when I stood on the wet sand, it sort of shrank away from under my feet and made a hole and my feet got sucked into it. It was brilliant.I have never been to the sea before and I just stared and stared at it. Where the sun and the sea meet, far, far away, a kind of path appears, like a ribbon,  golden and shimmering, and it came all the way up to me, as if it was meant just for me, and I really wanted to run into the sea and walk on the path, into the sun. But I knew I couldn’t, because it was really just water and I would have sunk and maybe drowned.When I am grown-up and when I can go where I want, I will come back to the sea and I will try to walk on the path and if I can’t walk, then I will learn to swim in the golden path. I saw other people in the water and they were splashing and waving their arms about and throwing a big ball with lots of colours on it.   Lots of people were playing on the beach, in the sand, children and grown-ups too. Some people had spades and they were digging holes and making big heaps of sand. I didn’t know what they were doing with the sand but Miss Manfred said they were building sandcastles and would we like to build one too. She had spades and a ball for us in a big sack, so we could choose what we wanted to do, if we promised to stay away from the water and didn’t get lost or run too far. Birgie and Marianne wanted to play with the ball and Susie and Gisela and I asked for a spade. But it was silly to dig a hole and end up with a pile of sand. We were supposed to pour water over it and sort of make it into a wall. Miss Manfred gave us a bucket and we poured the water over the sand but it kept cracking and collapsed all the time. I watched the other people who were building sandcastles, they were much better at it, because they had big boys and grown-ups to help.I didn’t want to play; I wanted to sit in the sand and let the sun shine on me and watch the golden path.the North Sea at Sunset"},
{"title": "What I Really Think About Pre-Lunch Drinks Parties", "date": "Tuesday 16 February 2010", "text": "To paraphrase Wendy Cope, ‘bloody parties are like bloody buses, you wait forever and then three come along at once’.  There’s been one on each of the last three Sundays. Drinks parties, not buses, silly.Much though I’d hate not being invited, pre-lunch drinks parties are not a good idea, as far as I am concerned. For one thing, I like to mix my alcohol with food. My capacity is limited at the best of times. Besides, by 12 o’clock I am usually faint with hunger, so drinking on an empty stomach is bound to cause problems. Even the most generous hostess is not going to provide more than prettily arranged, colourful bits of airy nonsense, dainty appetizers, otherwise known as an outbreak of nibbles, not substantial enough to fill the holes in my teeth, much less the chasm in my stomach.“Red or white”, the host calls out gaily. “There’s also some juice here somewhere”.As I am not pregnant, ill or teetotal, wine it is. “You’ll be fine, a glass won’t hurt you.  Luckily, you won’t have far to go”, he says. Whatever does he mean by ‘far to go’?  Until I fall over?  Start dancing on the table? Proposition the vicar?  It’s always the host who pours the drinks and little does he know how wine, in the morning, on an empty stomach, affects my judgment. A distance of no more than 50 m can become a frightening obstacle course; add a hill, a few parked cars, a gate or two, a muddy track, a cattle grid, all readily available in Valley’s End, and perfectly easy to negotiate when I am sober, when I’m even slightly inebriated you’d best take me home in a wheelbarrow.However, for the moment I am still a party-guest, sparkling and witty and sophisticated, engaging in gay and lively banter. Well, what else would I tell you?That I am standing in a crush of people, balancing a glass in one hand and the nibbles plate plus napkin in the other, straining to understand what my current partner is saying and shouting a reply back; hoping that I’ve understood his side of the conversation and that my reply has made sense to him and I won’t have to repeat it; it really wasn’t interesting in the first place and repeating it would make that so pitifully obvious and an ass of me.Eating, drinking and shouting all at the same time can play havoc with one’s social graces, spitting crumbs and droplets of wine are not unusual and a furtive wipe with the napkin to mop up dribbles on the chin, trying not to pour the contents of your glass down your front, while laughing gaily at what you think was a joke you didn’t quite catch are part of the ritual. As is playing  musical chairs, a graceful waltz from group to group, partner to partner, each time picking up on the last sentence of the pre-you conversation and adding the perfect follow-on. But even the nicest party has to come to an end.  Once the exodus has started, everybody else leaves very quickly and after many more shouted good-byes, see you soon,  we all go our separate ways.“Lovely party”, we say, “wasn’t it nice to see old Jack again” and \"poor Fiona isn’t looking too good, do you think she misses him?” I’ve probably managed to make my one glass of wine last and the usual post-party headache is bearable. At least I won’t be drunk in charge of the dog, who is at home, waiting to be taken for his morning walk. Lunch will have to wait. Alas."},

{"title": "February in the Garden", "date": "Tuesday 9 February 2010", "text": "Bullfinches (pyrrhula pyrrhula) return to the garden in February and, although timid half the year, are now fearless and persevering. The bullfinches’ usual habitat is woodlands, hedgerows and orchards, where they will feed voraciously on the flower buds of fruit trees in spring. In spite of their bright beauty and sad and mournful call, fruit farmers still see a flock of bullfinches appear with some trepidation. Photo RSPBOne of the most popular February-flowering shrubs is Daphne Mezereum. Stiff, upright stems are clothed with purplish-red flowers in February and March. The variety Daphne odora 'Aureomarginata’ grows to 4ft x 5ft, has evergreen leaves prettily edged with a thin gold margin and smells divine, hence its full name. The starry flowers are followed by poisonous berries. Beware! The harsh winter here in Shropshire has caused the leaves to turn slightly dryish-brown, but the plant will soon recover when the days are warmer.Another early flowerer is Lonicera fragrantissima; it has fragrant creamy-white flowers throughout winter, often on bare stems. This Lonicera is a variety of shrubby honeysuckle; I have planted mine in a slightly sheltered spot by the back door. On sunny days the gorgeous smell meets me every time I leave the house.The Plant Directory UKIf you have a large space, then Hamamelis, the Witch Hazel, is the shrub you want at this time of year. The showy, spidery flowers appear on the leafless branches for many weeks in winter and the sweet fragrance is a bonus; you can cut a branch or two and bring them indoors. Although rather unexciting in summer, in autumn the leaves take on attractive tints. Mine grows in a space under trees, in summer I can use the shrub as a backdrop for hostas and ferns.Annette HoeggemeierRuhr Universitaet BochumThe one harbinger of spring that no garden should be without, is the humble snowdrop. Ubiquitous they may be, easy to grow, and slow to die;  but I would no more wish to be without them at this time of year than I would wish to forego the birds and the bees. There has a clump of them growing somewhere in my garden since Christmas and this particular spot of snowdrops amongst the leaves of heuchera is my favourite.For those of you who are still in the merciless grip of deep winter, here is a bit of advice:Avoid travelling by Night in Snowy Weather.For she was all froze in with frostEight days and nights, poor soulBut when they gave her up for lostThey found her down the hole.On this day in 1799 a passing farmer, noticing a handkerchief hanging on a bush, rescued Elizabeth Woodcock of Impington in Cambridgeshire from the snow hole in which she had taken refuge from a blizzard on the night of February the second. Drifting snow had subsequently covered her to a depth of six feet, and she had become too weak to climb out. During her confinement her only sustenance was two pinches of snuff.  (Snuff = tobacco for sniffing).Walk fast in snowIn frost walk slowWhen frost and snow are both togetherSit by the fire and save shoe leather.anonymous"},

It must be quite exasperating for others sometimes, waiting for me to finish my convoluted sentences, allowing me to go off into side alleys and dead ends, getting lost in clauses and sub clauses.  Translations often took me longer than they should have done, even when I was simply working on a technical specification.Anyway, I’ve enjoyed it. Still do.Communication is such a hugely important part of living and interacting; the lucky ones, who have speech, use predominantly words to do so, as well as body language and facial expression. Nowadays, of course, many of us sit in front of computers, typing words on a word-processor, words we hope make sense to others.“I have something to tell you”.I have something to tell you. These words. Dread words. Chill-words. Words no middle-aged wife wishes to hear uttered numbly, yet with a ghastly hopeful smile, by her middle-aged husband.When I read this paragraph in Joyce Carol Oates’ novel  ‘Middle Age’,recently, I thought of the many ways the word ‘WORD’ itself, as in, word, n. a unit of spoken language, (etc.), can convey many different meanings, depending on how it is used and the phrase in which it appears.You can be word-perfect, you can paint a word-picture, set a word-puzzle and enjoy word-play. You can produce a word-salad or be a word-splitter. You can also be a word-smith.And then there are the many phrases, My Word, there are a lot of them!Believe me, I give you my word on that! My word is my bond whereas his word cannot be taken for gospel; he hasn’t a good word to say for anybody. The word is that he puts words into your mouth before he takes the words right out of it again. I’ve been having words with him about this. I said “ I want a word with you,” which he didn’t like very much. But I carried on, “a word to the wise”, I said, “ a word in your ear”.  “Fair words butter no parsnips”, I said, “that’s not the word for it”; “You may be a man of many words, but I will never take your word for it”, I said. “I simply cannot take you at your word, in fact, I can hardly get a word in edgeways with you”.“In a word”, I said, “you break your word”.  At which he became very angry and said “ One day I will make you eat your words”!Let a poet have the last word:EnvoiGoodbye, words.I never liked you,Liking things and places, andLiking people best when their mouths are shut.Go out and lose yourself in a jabbering world,Be less than nothing, a vacuumOf which words will bewareLest by suction, your only assertion, you pull them in.For that I like you, words,Self-destroyed, self-dissolvedYou grow true.To what?

We tasted it.\"What is it\", said Derek, \"Bicarb?\"\"Persil, I think,\" I said.The waitress explained that the little dish had held salt. We wont forget in a hurry.We went into a German pub, in order to test the pulse of the Black Market over a glass of unmentionable beer. A very low dive. On one table a game of expletive-riddled poker was in progress. At another, a huddle of old men were deeply into serious, hissed, discussion, while, at a third, Bill and Ray were trying to drink enough to forget the girls they were with. Several more tarts were lounging about, bored.We sat at a table with two unshaven road sweepers, and soon got down to business. I changed sixty cigarettes into three hundred marks and made an appointment for tomorrow.Quite a Hemingway set-up. Real honky-tonk. Real low.o-o-o-o-o-oEaster Saturday, April 5thI kept thinking about those two girls, the ones with Bill and Ray last night. I mean, they were so young and yet they seemed to have no youth. They weren't common tarts, as I have since found out, but they will be soon. They're only novices, they just sat there, drinking, saying very little, and understanding the loud, self-conscious conversation of their pick-ups only in gesture, not words. Apparently, they had seen Bill and Ray and said \"Kaffee?\" and that was all that was needed.They left the inn before us, but the lads didn't get in until the small hours.We went to the inn again this afternoon, to meet some stockings, watches and a case. I bought a case and we sat drinking until the stockings arrived.When they turned up, half an hour later, we were surprised at the scale of operations. We were ushered into a back room and the two salesmen set up shop. They unpacked their cases and laid plastic raincoats and stockings over chairs and tables. Raincoats 200 cigarettes, stockings 60 cigarettes and ladies underwear (sets)  150 cigarettes; they were no amateur black marketeers, but fully-fledged professionals.They would not barter or lower their prices. They told me that the raincoats were made for them at a special factory, and that they could get me any number of them. The stockings, apart from some Parisian ones of Rayon were all fully-fashioned silk, smuggled from the Russian zone. I was asked whether there were many troops at our next halt, - Kiel - , so that they could tell if it would be worthwhile to visit the place on business.The episode had one amusing sidelight; they were discussing some coffee and chicory I had, in German,and I managed to understand one sentence: \"these Englishmen can't tell vinegar from coffee\". I could make remarks about German tea.Things had ben conducted with so much guile on both sides, and with such intensity, that I leant against the doorpost for a minute when I got outside and felt quite dizzy. The street still lay in the quiet sunshine and the kids still played in the gutter and on the hard old cobblestones. I could hardly believe that I was within ten feet of a very squalid section of commerce.I shrugged and walked on to the Y.M.C.A. That's how things are here. Very fair of face but with a real sickness at heart. The black market and the prostitutes aren't an illness in themselves, but a symptom of a very real national disease. There have been occasional eruptions of this illness while we have been here.Riots in Dusseldorf a fortnight after we left. Razor gangs on one side and rape on the other in Osnabruck, two days before we arrived. More razor gangs and theft in Oldenburg.And yet the air is peaceful and fresh. Spring is abroad, and the land itself smiles; but somehow there is something.........It's as vague as that.I buy a tablet of soap in the Y.M.C.A. for fivepence. I walk round to the pub and the innkeeper's brother gives me twenty five marks for the piece of soap that cost me fivepence. A mark equals sixpence at current exchange, but I can't exchange it. I can only buy twopence worth of goods with it."},

It kills spontaneity, the ability to enjoy what you have, it is a paralyzing, depressing, suffocating  blanket, very hard to shake off.webweavers free clipartI’ll tell you why I’ve admitted to the feeling expressed in the first sentence.Every so often I read a book, or watch a TV programme on the wonders of this world. I am allowed to look into ancient civilizations, historical events, the wonders of natural history, the miracles mankind has wrought in the course of its existence. Sometimes, at parties, I meet a truly interesting and knowledgeable person, somebody who knows his/her subject, who is well-travelled, who speaks well.Of course, too many of these TV programme are shallow, more a vehicle for a breathless presenter, who is shown endlessly rushing from one object to the other, in all corners of the world. We see the presenter rather than the subject. Or the book is boring, too full of dry facts, statistics. The clever, learned man may be the sort who monopolizes the dinner table conversation until I want to scream at him to shut up.Still, the book, the programme, the conversation remind me of everything I have missed, the subjects I could have studied, the worlds I could have explored. Sometimes, I am totally captivated; I am a child again, looking at a Christmas tree for the first time or marveling over some miracle of nature, eyes wide, mouth (almost) open. If only I could be part of this world of knowledge, if only I could be  living in the rarefied air of pure academia, breathing in its dust. Instead there's the real, humdrum, boring me. Don't get me wrong. I can't, and never could,become a brain surgeon, or win the Nobel prize for physics. I am not about to get on a camel and discover forgotten desert kingdoms, nor will I write the great 21st century novel, not to mention painting another Sistine Chapel.But I could have done more than I have.Long periods of my life were a struggle, at times a struggle to survive.My education was, at best, patchy. Apparently full of promise, I disappointed my parents to the extent that they stopped their support overnight, and I was left with no choice but to interrupt my studies and earn my living. There's nothing wrong with that, you may say, that's life.Unfortunately, being rather pig-headed, I got myself into some dodgy situations, the 'I'll Show You' attitude. By the time I had extricated myself, years later, getting back to full time education was out of the question; I had children, a household to run and a living to earn single-handedly. Again, so many of us had to, nothing unusual in that. I did manage to catch up on my education somewhat; I was good at my job and somehow the kids survived too.But all the time, during the difficult years, the dog-tired years, at times even 'back-to-the-wall' years, there was this hunger for knowledge, the longing to experience the colourful, exciting world of learning, learning for its own sake.Now that life is calm and really rather pleasant, the regrets are less powerful, but they are still there, sometimes.Do I start now? Or, could I perhaps ask for another life, to do better than the first time round?"},

{"title": "Books", "date": "Friday 22 January 2010", "text": "My good friend and blogging buddy Pondside  recently asked, apropos my post ‘Bored’….  if we had access to any good libraries here at Valley’s End, what with us being snow- and flood-bound far from civilisation and me being reduced to watching and writing about garden birds, for heaven’s sake. Pondside meant well and I am not in the least offended, my dear! Not only did she offer to send the Canadian Navy to dig us out of our icy misery but, I am sure, she would have charged them with delivering a large book bag, had there been any need.Well, I have to admit that there are, in my study, at any time, about thirty unread books lying around, gathering dust. That’s not counting Beloved’s separate pile elsewhere in the house.Most of these books are second-hand and come from various charitable book sales, absolute treasure chambers for rummaging and browsing. My current pile includes fiction and non-fiction, history, novels current and long out of print, thrillers ditto, biographies and poetry. There’s even some chick-lit – or maybe mid-life lit, hidden out of sight.I’ve just finished reading a collection of H.E. Bates’ short stories, long out of date, which I found very enjoyable and nicely soporific late at night. Less soporific, bitingly funny, stylish and wise, is the book I am reading at the moment, Joyce Carol Oates  ‘Middle Age’ about an affluent community in present-day America.Both books came second-hand and therefore neither is in pristine condition nor ranks among the current crop of three-for-two blockbusters on the bookshelves of the large stores. No matter.As I usually have about three books on the go at any time  - not all of them are read right through  - buying books at a fraction of their original cost is a good idea. You can always return them to the charity shops or charitable bookstalls for others to discover. All you have lost is a bit of your reading time, and a few pounds; on the plus side, you have helped a charitable organization to stay afloat for a little while longer."},
{"title": "The Scraper's Diary, Tuesday 1st April, 1947", "date": "Wednesday 20 January 2010", "text": "chapter 21Münsterlager, Tuesday morning,We got back to Münsterlager at 1.15 am. It was a most successful outing, I am writing this with a stylo pen I bought, among other things.Two rather amusing incidents occurred, in one shop I advanced to the counter and was greeted with  \"Good Afternoon, sir\",  in faultless Oxford English. There was no time to think of a new gambit, so I enquired  \"Do you speak English? I wonder if you have any opals?......\"The other incident occurred in a scent shop. The proprietor proffered three bottles invitingly and said  \"parfum, ver' nice, good smell?\"\"Yes\", I said, \"It stinks\".He nodded and, I'm sure, added a new word to his salesman's vocabulary.String orchestra will play at 12.30. Our first job since Sunday week last. Have polished all buttons, and blancoed all webbing equipment. Moreover, I have shaved. Moreover, I have pressed both service dress and battle dress. I'm becoming almost like a poor imitation of a soldier.Morning was nothing brilliant, but it was dry and warm, and passing lorries left us marooned in a cloud of dust, and the sky was too clear. I didn't notice how still it was until a gentle breeze decided to announce itself.The breeze liked the place and brought some of his friends, the clouds, along, and then, for half an hour, the sun was obscured and a thorough shower of rain baptized the camp.I left the block at half past three, to have my first bath since we reached Germany, and my heart and mind were cleansed by the new innocence of everything;  where every birch twig swelled into a bud, a pearl lay silently. The roads were fresh and lorries left no dust to dim the fretted filigree of the trees' tracery against the gently moving fronds of cloud, and my heart sang of Spring and love, and laughed at its own ingenuousness.For no reason, save that the thought came to me unheralded, I wish to protest against the application of the word 'wholesome' to a person. It merely means 'unresponsive, unemotional and undersexed. I'd sooner be unwholesome than so negative.o-o-o-o-o-oMünsterlager, Thursday, April 3rdToday, our last here, has been marked by a rash of rumours.First, the report went round that we were to parade at ten for the purpose of changing our battle dresses before the time when we have to pay for all replacements. We were also to take our service dress so that the tailor could press it. We were also to receive our free issue of cigarettes. As it grew nearer the time the reports grew faster and more erratically.Eventually, we received an order! We were to take our service dress to be pressed. Soon after we came back from the tailor, we were served with our NAAFI ration (forty cigarettes, the sergeants got eighty). As to free issue of kit change, we are still uninformed, but there is a new rumour, that we are not sailing until the fourteenth.Roll on, bloody roll on."},
{"title": "Bored, Bored, Bored, or Napoleon's Downfall", "date": "Sunday 17 January 2010", "text": "I’ve been so bored.Thank Goodness, we are freed from the icy embrace. Now come the floods, the slush, the mud, the endless rain and wind.Okay, enough with the moaning about the weather already, anybody would think I was born to it, I’m that good at it. On the whole, I’m quite a busy type, finding lots to do, indoors as well as outdoors; I’m boringly practical and sensible, boring and unexciting qualities which keep me well balanced and nicely occupied in my advancing years. (I promise this was the last ‘Boring’ in this post and no jokes about senility, if you please, if I forget.)It’s winter, the world turned a beautiful shade of white and virginal and became as inaccessible as a properly determined virgin. Shrubs and small trees, paths and hedgerows, lanes and fields, all formed a gently undulating landscape with no end and no beginning. A panorama for stroking, with sinuous flanks and secretive hollows, not to be despoiled. (hey, I’m still with the virginal, what fun! – The things one can get away with in a blog!)So Benno and I found ourselves for long periods of time with noses pressed against the glass, staring at nature’s bounty.  And birds. Garden birds. Benno got bored after a while and went to sleep; dreaming of all the rabbits he’s chased in his lifetime and discussing the ones that got away (all the live ones, labrador retrievers are fast, but not that fast), twitching and shaking and snuffling and barking under his breath, a sort of strangulated bark. If you have a dog you know what I mean.I digress, back to the birds, most garden birds in general and blackbirds in particular. Especially one very belligerent adult male who declared the feeding territory to be entirely under his jurisdiction and therefore declared war on all other aspirants, including a dozen or so other blackbirds, many of them his own family. I’ve known politicians, world leaders, behave less arrogantly! This male, let’s call him Napoleon, hardly had time to feed he was so busy head-swivelling,  repelling all  comers, large and small,  chattering loudly and rushing them, wing and tail feathers flapping like coat tails, half-flying at them. One magical thrush was determined not to give in, she retreated, came back from another direction, retreated again, perched in the lowest branch of the shrub, hopped down, hopped up, etc. You get the picture. Napoleon wore himself out. I swear I saw him stuffing three berries into his beak at the same time, that’s how pressed he was for time. (Notice how I’ve made the bully male and the wily bird female?) Anyway, how many hours can one person watch birds scrabbling over bird food?Without interfering?After two days of this I decided to do something about Napoleon; true, the other birds always got a chance to feed in the end, he backed off eventually, but I wanted to see what would happen if the feeding territory was enlarged.I put out three additional, large, plastic plant pot saucers, filling them with berries, oats, nuts and seeds, apples and kitchen scraps, drenching the whole mess in cooking oil. Next morning Napoleon came back to the original area, all fluffed up against the cold, ready to strut his stuff. He was soon joined by the usual throng and the dance of claim and counter claim began. It was the little birds which first noticed the new food filled saucers; a busy scrum developed around them.When Napoleon realized that he was no longer ruling over the entire kingdom something very funny happened. The saucers sat about a meter and half apart, all lined up in a row on the edge of the terrace. Napoleon literally ran from one saucer to the next along the row, including the original feeding place, and back again. Over and over, wings akimbo, head down, working himself into a frenzy but to very little avail. As soon as his back was turned, the other birds, who had briefly fluttered up, landed again, instantly pecking away. In the end I felt quite sorry for Napoleon  -  well, a bit anyway  -  He’ll be in bird therapy for the rest of his life.And the moral of the tale? Boredom is much underrated,or,don't enlarge your territory unless you have the might to defend it,or,don't bite off more than you can chew,or, keep all your eggs in one basket if your fledglings come home to roost."},
{"title": "Boom or Bust", "date": "Thursday 14 January 2010", "text": "To diet or not to diet, that is the question.A new year, a new set of resolutions.Every January, regular as clockwork, new diet plans sprout in magazine and newspaper articles; failsafe, they scream at us, weight loss guaranteed. Buy the book, follow the xyz diet and the new, slim-line, attractive you will emerge from the flabby, overweight blob you are now like the actress slipping out of her fat suit. If only it were that easy. There’s the little matter of left over Christmas chocolates, there’s the inclement weather which is so much more pleasant to look out on while sitting in a cosy fireside chair than actually being out in exercising the dog or shovelling snow and there is also the lack of  moral fibre and self-control,  both for me  always so much more pronounced during the chilly season.Does it really matter ?Of course, obesity is a real problemMail online says Obesity rates in Britain are soaring with nearly a quarter of adults now classed as clinically obese.Despite Government warnings that we are turning into a nation of couch potatoes and risking obesity-related illnesses such as heart disease and cancer, our waistlines keep growing. While the Telegraph online tells usGreed, rather than laziness, is the major cause of the obesity epidemic across the developed world, research has shown.Both statements are probably true, we should not laugh off obesity. Being seriously overweight is not only detrimental to health, it also restricts movement, forces us into elasticated waistbands and makes us objects of ridicule or pity.But what about the opposite?  What about Anorexia?Anorexia is equally, if not more, deadly. For those of us, particularly the young and vulnerable, who take the vociferous diet gurus and arbiters of style to be apostles of truth the danger of self-harm is great.Famous people who have died from Eating Disorders include Karen Carpenter, the musician, who died, aged 32, weighing 80 lbs. Several models have made the ED headlines, among them Ana Carolina Reston and Terri Schiavo. Dancers and a gymnast have starved themselves to death, as did Leila Pahlavi, the youngest daughter of the Shah of Persia. The American poet, Anne Sexton, who killed herself at age 46, suffered from anorexia and depression.The list of unknown young girls and not so young girls – and nowadays boys, I have read – suffering from Eating Disorders is an ever growing one. You don’t have to be famous to be on it.  My friend Marianne suffered from anorexia, long before we knew that that was its name. We were a group of four teenaged school friends; we met in each others houses after school listening to pop music, talking about boys, trying on somebody’s new trousers or top, experimented with make-up, tried smoking cigarettes and felt grown-up doing it; all of it very tame. This was in the days before drugs and binge drinking and sex at thirteen.The three of us noticed that Nanni seemed to become really obsessed with what she called physical fitness, she would practice a new gymnastics exercise relentlessly, until she had mastered it. She did the splits and threw her legs up into the air at a time when we’d only seen dancers and gymnasts do it on TV. She also seemed to eat less than the three of us, often going without meals, insisting that this was all part of a healthy regime and she would soon outrun and outperform the rest of us. We weren’t aware of having entered into a competition with her but we humoured her. Nanni was just being very silly.Weeks later we became worried about her, talking about her behind her back, trying to get her to share special treats with us and saying we were getting bored with the physical exercise routines. We knew she’d stopped having periods; she was looking haggard and very thin under her baggy clothes. We became frightened, at a loss to understand what was happening to her; we withdrew from our friend. In due course Nanni stopped coming to school.  We heard she had fallen ill. We tried to visit her at home, her parents  didn’t let us in; they said she wasn’t well enough for visitors, giving no explanation as to her illness, in spite of our questions. I remember that they appeared grave but also uneasy; they reassured us that Nanni would soon be well again but that we should stay away in the meantime.All sorts of rumours went round the school about her condition but the word anorexia was never mentioned; we wouldn’t have understood its meaning if it had. Finally, we heard that she had been admitted to a mental institution.We never saw Nanni again; her parents moved house. I still have no idea what happened to her.I think I'll try and eat sensibly again, now that Christmas is over. What about you?"},
{"title": "EVA's TALE", "date": "Monday 11 January 2010", "text": "The story so far: Eva is little girl living in post-war Germany. Because she might be in danger of contracting TBC she is sent to a children's home, which is also used as a sanatorium, on the island of Norderney in the North Sea.  She is away from home, on her own,  for the first time in her life. Eva Goes on Holiday #  4When I left home it was summer, I am sure it is summer here too; Miss Manfred says there is a cold wind coming off the North Sea, so we can’t go to see the sea, because the weather is bad for us. Then why did Mum send me here I’d like to know; I can be indoors at home where I have my books and my doll. We have weather at home too and sometimes the wind blows ever so fierce and makes my skirt blow up into my face but I am still allowed out. The other girls in the ward aren’t allowed to go to the sea either, we must all stay here in the sanatorium. There is a sandpit in the courtyard, Miss Manfred says there’s real sand in it, from the beach, and before lunch we can go out and we can build sandcastles there. There is supposed to be a shelter which stops the wind from blowing but I don’t know what that means because the sandpit is outdoors and it has no roof over it. We asked if we could have a bucket of water but that is supposed to be bad for us too. But then they make us have a bath and that’s full of water.Playing in the sandpit is boring but I suppose it is better than nothing.All the other children in the home have been to the sea lots of times; when they’ve been they show off about it and get all excited and they tell us how they had their shoes and socks off and  ran in the sea and splashed each other. o-o-o-o-o-oToday we went to the swimming baths. Miss Manfred promised us that we would get proper waves and that we could put our swimming costumes on and play in the water and that the water would be made of seawater. But the water was really in a big house which smelled funny, like nasty medicine in a hospital, and it was flat, with stones around the edge, not sand.The man in the white trousers asked us if we could swim. I don’t really know what swimming is so I said nothing, in case I got it wrong and he’d tell me off for fibbing. I looked at the other children in the pool but I couldn’t tell if they were swimming or jumping up and down. They were making a lot of noise and I was hoping they’d let me have a go too.The man put a rubber ring round my tummy, and took me to the stairs at one end of the water. He let me go down the stairs by myself. The water was a bit cold but I went in anyway.  He was still watching me but he nodded so it was all right and I could stay and play with the other girls from the isolation ward.Susie and Birgie said they could swim and I watched them to see if I could learn too and they waved their arms about in the water and pretended to lie down on the water and took one leg off the floor and sort of kicked and hopped with the other. I tried it and I could do it too after I practiced for a bit. I swallowed a lot of water, which tasted very salty, but then I just kept my head up and tried not to scream so much so the water wouldn’t run into my mouth. It was lots of fun. I really enjoyed swimming.Then the man in the white trousers blew on a very loud whistle and we all had to come out. There was another man and some of us had to have a really long string tied to our rubber rings, like very long leading straps, and they made us go back into the water while the men held the string. They got long poles, like fishing rods and they dangled us from the rods and pulled us into the middle of the water. I didn’t want to go, because I nearly couldn’t put my foot on the bottom any more and I coughed  because of swallowing lots of water which made even more water come in my mouth but they said, it’s all right, we won’t let go of you and you want to learn to swim, don’t you. Well, I didn’t want to learn to swim on a rod, I was quite happy swimming with one foot on the bottom, so they let us come out again after a bit. They took the string off  again which was good because we knew we didn’t have to have another lesson like being a fish.Miss Manfred said we could have one more go in the water, a very quick one, but to stay near the edge by the stairs and not to lie on the water but to stand up. When she said that she scrunched up her face and opened her eyes very wide, like gown-ups do when they are trying to trick kids and go all pretend-serious, so we knew something was up and we waited by the edge to see what would happen.And what happened was that the biggest, fastest, foamiest wave of water of my whole life came rushing through the pool, from one end to the other, and we all screamed and screeched and fell over.It was brilliant.I hope we can go again, even if they make me dangle from a pole."},

{"title": "BLOGGING -  the Ultimate in Self-Indulgence?", "date": "Sunday 3 January 2010", "text": "Blogs are strictly short-memory-span-affairs. I’d love to start one. And startle the world with my wit and wisdom. It will not become a diary, if I can help it, there is one of those already, handwritten in children’s exercise books, rather ‘pooterish’, along the lines of ‘and then I did this and then I did that’. There is the risk that blogging might become too self-absorbed an activity, something I do by myself, in my study, while life happens elsewhere, without me. On the other hand, I might find a way to write a ‘proper’ blog, whatever that may be, something to advertise to other bloggers, if any of them ever find their way to my portal.Blog entries will probably be no more than ephemeral writings that can be continued or stopped at any time, which mean as much or as little as the momentary thought; strictly self-indulgence and introspection, the sort of stuff that was once called navel gazing; a collection of musings, scribblings, memories, moans, joys and the occasional flash of inspiration.Format and frequency of writing must be flexible, honesty will be paramount; after all, nobody will ever know who I am. The whole idea is brand-new, it only came to me while I was walking the dog this afternoon.I’ll call it Friko’s Musings.This is what I wrote in November 2008, when the idea of blogging first came to me. I knew no other bloggers then, it was something periodically mentioned  in newspaper articles as  occupying the young, the self-interested and computer literate or, on the other side, journalists and others who saw it as a form of public service and a source of information.It still took me two months to get past the stage of politely coughing on the wrong side of the door into blogland, waiting for somebody to invite me in, before taking a deep breath and jumping in, with a post which was more than just a tentative clearing of the throat, a post where I risked voicing an opinion and coming out into the open. After all, nobody would ever find me.It took until March before I had my first comment and from then on I wrote more regularly, with comments coming in painfully sparsely but regularly. By the summer I had my first follower. I had also learned to explore blogland myself,  finding blogs I liked and visited. Blogland etiquette demands that you visit people, that you reply to comments and leave comments. Nowadays, I visit blogs new to me and leave comments, if I have something to say; but if there is no reply or return visit, I soon drop them.I am still very careful about telling anybody I know ‘in real life’ that I blog, it’s mostly embarrassment though; nobody has ‘come out’ to me either.There have been many blogposts in my time online exploring the joys or otherwise of blogging, the reasons for and against, the benefits and pitfalls of blogging, etc. The majority of bloggers praise the wonderful opportunities for making friends, for getting feedback, for learning about other countries and people of other nations; there are bloggers who use the medium to collect stories for their children, who become their own historians; there are those who talk about hard times, whose blogs are part of a therapy to overcome the most gruesome experiences in the safety of an anonymous blog;  many bloggers want to share the good times too and tell us about particularly pleasant, funny, times. There are poets and writers and artists, there are housewives and granddads and house-bound people, whose outlet on the world is the internet; there are well people and sick people, old people and young people, in fact, ‘all human life is here’ and, for my part, long may it continue. Writing a blog encourages me to think over what makes me feel good, what makes me happy. Because I also post photographs, I carry a little camera with me everywhere, which means that I look at the world around me much more attentively than before. I notice so much more than I used to do, blogging is helping me to stay alert and alive to possibilities.Yes, blogging may be the ‘ultimate form of narcissism’, or  ‘the ultimate in self-indulgence’, or even a ‘fake form of communicating’; yes, ‘friends and followers’ may be total strangers whom we might not like if we met them; yes, finding something worth saying is very hard and we may rarely, if ever, achieve it.  (all quotes found in newspaper articles).Instantaneous access to millions of other people via the internet is not always a good thing, a lot has been written about the harm that could be done;  of course we could also all bore each other to death.  Online interaction brings pleasure and convenience to millions, including me; I would never have met as many friendly, informative, clever, funny, interesting, and like-minded people anywhere else in so short a space of time. I have also been fortunate in that I have yet to come across any abusive, offensive and humourless bloggers. Once or twice misunderstandings have occurred, jokes may misfire, the tone of voice may get lost in the writing and there is no body language to be read. Not every blog I dip into enthralls me and my unfocussed ramblings, which are Friko’s Musings pure and simple and lay claim to neither literary nor  any other merit, cannot be of the slightest interest in the great scheme of things.So, on this almost anniversary, having well and truly entered the wonderful world of bloggers, my polite little cough has vanished for good and I make no apologies for staying put.Friends and Followers, stay with me."},
{"title": "HEIMAT   -   Take Me Home, Country Roads..........", "date": "Wednesday 30 December 2009", "text": "to the place I used to know.A discussion group on German language TV on the subject of ‘what is Heimat’, ‘what does Heimat mean to an individual’, reminded me of the many people I meet in blogland who are ex-patriates of some kind or other; who permanently or temporarily live in countries other than their native land. I would even include people who have moved from one state to another, as in the US, or from one geographical area to another, north to south, east to west, and vice versa, whether this is within a country or a continent.Special occasions, like the festive season we find ourselves in at the moment, have the effect of re-awakening long gone memories in me, a kind of ‘nostalgia for no known place’, a sort of yearning for a time that ‘may have been’ but probably never was. Memories have become concertina-ed, all summers were hot, all winters snow covered and the mists of time have taken on a permanently golden hue.There are many doctoral theses, scientific examinations and in-depth studies on the subject; but these do not concern me here. I would simply like to explore my own and other people’s feelings on the matter. The concept of Heimat was first explored by Pestalozzi, the Swiss educationalist. Before him, a 17th century Swiss medic, Johannes Hofer, discovered (invented?) the term Heimweh, or homesickness. It was considered to be a specific Swiss disease, a lethal condition, in particular, a disease of soldiers, until the 1930s, when it was simply re-classified as ‘depression’ or ‘feeling’. And there we have it, the term Heimat describes first and foremost and probably exclusively, a feeling.Chambers dictionary translates  ‘Heimat’ simply as home. There is the Swedish concept of hembygd, which comes closest to the German term. Home, homeland, fatherland, mother country, native soil, la patrie, all come close but, in essence, do not  entirely cover the meaning.Heimat must remain untranslated, but the feeling is universal. Heimat is the place where your conscious being was formed, the root of your existence, where you cried your earliest tears, smiled your earliest smile;the place where you grew up, where you learned to speak, to express yourself, your feelings, your moods. Heimat is the place where your identity was established, where you set off on the journey towards the person you are nowHeimat is the place where everybody understands the language you speak; language is a hugely important part of your identity; speaking a regional or local dialect immediately identifies you as a member of a very special and specific community. Nobody can ever learn to speak a dialect flawlessly unless they have learned it in childhood. The meaning of any phrase you utter in this language is immediately clear to your listeners, no explanation or translation is ever necessary, no matter how obscure the term. Heimat is the place where, for better or worse, you are missed when you leave, where the hole you leave is you-shaped, and only you can fill it.Heimat is the place where the culture is a given; music and folk music, literature, drama and storytelling, history, and the art of your native land have all been part of the natural experience of growing-up. Heimat is the place where poetry needs no translation.To be homesick is to yearn for Heimat.. It is a fact that once you have been away for a number of years, what you remember as Heimat no longer exists. As you grow and develop, so does the place you left; so do the people you left; the memory you have preserved is not the reality of the place you return to.As I said at the beginning, Heimat is a feeling; smells, sounds, food, songs can all conjure up an immediate feeling of Heimat.  Hearing a song your mother sang, eating a dish you ate as a child, hearing the sound of church bells, seeing a certain kind of light, a sky, can all remind you and transform you instantly into a time traveller. We can all create a new home for ourselves anywhere on this earth; our family is our home; for some people religion is home; we are at home in a circle of friends, we have a network of support, we live a full life ‘at home’.But the moment we get back to ‘our roots’, hear the familiar language or dialect, walk down old-familiar paths and, if we are lucky, see the folks we left behind, we are back in a world where we become the person we were then. No matter how old and wise, experienced, famous, infamous, disillusioned or successful  we have become, when we return to the place we call Heimat, we are as old as the day we left."},
{"title": "Christmas is for Giving", "date": "Saturday 26 December 2009", "text": "So, whose pile of unwanted gifts is ready for return/further distribution/exchange? Christmas is for giving, I’m told. Who am I to argue.Tinsel, turkey, tantrums and togetherness, all gift-wrapped in shiny sentimentality, have been and gone. Well, maybe the turkey hasn’t quite left the premises as yet, there is still the carcass to be turned into stock and about a week’s worth of leftovers have to be dealt with/turned into rissoles (a.k.a. frikos) or, more sensibly, surreptitiously fed to the dog when no one is watching.What to do with the gifts? If you are lucky, have trained your family and friends well, or you belong to that happy breed who is not afraid to say exactly what they want for Christmas then you may be blissfully happy with your little stash, ready to enjoy the books, CDs, chocolates, etc. Lucky you! Otherwise you may now be deliberating whether to brave the shops with a view to returning items during the hectic Sales period for something more to your taste, or hang on for a while longer, when everything half decent might have been sold. Is there a chance that Aunt Lizzie might find out that you have taken the colourful ski jumper she knitted for you, or the massive ghost-written autobiography spanning the first 15 years in the life of some minor celebrity which Uncle Fred has kindly bestowed on you, to the Charity shop already?  Problems, problems, and you're still reeling from that small altercation between Frieda and George about the time he was caught under the mistletoe with her from next door.Christmas is for giving.Gardener was telling me that he has drawers full of short socks, all proudly presented by his sister-in-law, a new pair or two every Christmas. “I hates them”, he says, “I never wears them, they slips under the heel and I has to pull them up all the time.  I’ve a good mind to take them to the Rashity shop. (Gardener has verbal dyslexia). “Why don’t you tell her”, I asked.  Stupid question, the answer was obvious. I should have known.  \"Noooo, I canna do that, it’s the thought”, he says. In fact, he is quite embarrassed by my show of social ineptitude.Any of his employers, who give him a bottle for Christmas run the risk of receiving a recycled one in return. We had one from him this year  in spite of having given him some gardening tools. “ If I gets a bottle, I looks round to pass it on, like”, he says, totally without irony. As he handed it over,  he reassured us that he had bought ours. “I only drinks for Christmas, or for family parties”, he says, ” and I always has to finish the bottle, can’t leave nothing in, as I dinna drink it the next day.” He says this like it’s a matter of honour.That seems to go for bottles of spirits too, expecially for home made sloe gin, which starts off as slin goe, until one of us helps him out with a straight face. Sloe gin appears to be a great favourite; one of his employers gives him a bottle for Christmas every year. Gardener is willing to share it on family occasions but, if nobody drinks with him, as usually happens, he finishes it off in one sitting, by himself.Christmas is for giving.Then there’s the delightful young women, one half of a couple with two small children struggling to make ends meet satisfactorily, who comes and helps me in the house occasionally. She starts her Christmas shopping at the end of October, “in dribs and drabs”, she says, because she can’t afford to buy every one a present otherwise. By ‘everyone’ she means the many children her nine siblings have produced between them, each of whom receives a present of some considerable monetary value.  And her own children only get one ‘major’ present each, apart from the small toys and games she puts into their stockings. When she told me the cost of the ‘major’ present I was amazed. “Because there were so many of us, Mum couldn’t afford to get us presents”, she told me, “I want my kids to have everything I never had”.  Okay, that may be laudable, but to go house cleaning for others to buy expensive presents for  a dozen or more nieces and nephews?Christmas is for giving. Giving is more blessed than receiving.We give and receive small presents, books, music, food and drink, tickets for a concert, a subscription to a magazine, a plant for the garden. We have no small children around, which would be a sad thing for the proud grandads and grannies who revel in the shiny faces of the very young at Christmas, nor are we obliged to put up with cantankerous, elderly relatives who have nowhere else to go, who have outlived their welcome everywhere else.Scrooges, us? Bah humbug!"},

{"title": "Running-up to Christmas", "date": "Wednesday 16 December 2009", "text": "Going online regularly at this time of year? Just forget it!The period which is called the run-up to Christmas is the craziest time. If you are a Christian, this is meant to be a quiet time, a time of contemplation and expectation; after all, you are preparing yourself for the birth of your Saviour.Everybody else just goes mad, even some Christians, who should know better. Beloved and I are going to have a quiet Christmas; we always do. It is not in my nature to turn Christmas into a circus, we leave the drunken orgies for New Year’s Eve!   (a girl can dream, can’t she!)  Even so, we too seem to have been infected with the virus; we have been buying more food and drink than we do at any other time of year – has anyone else heard the rumour that food and drink are shortly to go out of fashion ?I have to admit that I did enjoy greatly one particular shopping trip to Ludlow, our local market town. Ludlow is one of the best preserved mediaeval towns in the country; a huge, ruined castle and  a very fine church tower over the town. The market square is right in the heart of the town, it is surrounded by lovely old buildings and narrow lanes.  The place name ‘Ludlow’ is first recorded in 1138. It means ‘hill’ or ‘mound’ beside the ‘loud waters’ i.e., the rapids of the river Teme.Ludlow is justly proud of its status as one of the jewel cities of the UK and guards this status jealously, making sure that no awkward new buildings are allowed within the mediaeval heart.Ludlow’s other claim to fame is its status as a ‘foodie’ town. Unlike other busy market towns it has a large number of specialist food shops, and the stalls in the market are a joy to behold. Beloved and I visited the ‘Chocolate Gourmet’ for some extra special hand-made chocolate truffles to go with the champagne bought next door at the wine shop, before crossing over to the market and stopping to sample and buy the wares at the cheese stall, the game and fish dealer’s and the greengrocer’s stall, where we also bought large bunches of seasonal chrysanthemums, my favourite Christmas flowers. There’s even a stall which sells nothing but olives!Shopping gives me a thirst, the spectacular Feathers Hotel was the next port of call. ‘The Feathers’ has been a favourite haunt with American visitors for many years, but then, who could resist its ‘olde worlde’ charm. They serve a mean tea too.Valley’s End is preparing itself too. The grand Christmas-light-switch-on happened last Saturday evening in our own little square. The villagers stood in the square, getting in the way of all cars driving through, singing carols lustily and loudly, more or less in tune with each other and  accompanied by a small band. One of the many retired vicars living in Valley’s End spoke a few uplifting words between carols and a few more at the end of the session; sadly, they all got lost in the general jollity – besides the speaker system was behaving in a very wayward fashion. No matter; no doubt, the same vicar or one of his colleagues (they all like to keep their hand in in retirement) will make a similarly improving speech next year.The singing and jolliness all happened outside the village pub, from which the publican and his helpers issued forth at regular intervals with trays bearing free mulled wine and mini mince pies, which they distributed among the multitude. No slouch, our publican; free gifts of rather sour mulled wine (sorry about that, gift horses, mouths, etc, spring to mind) inspired vast numbers of those outside to cram themselves into the tiny public bar afterwards, this time to purchase their drinks.But first there was the grand ceremony. Naturally, the lads from the fire brigade had been testing the lights all week – in fact they had been blazing away merrilyfor days. This wouldn’t be rural England if it had all gone according to plan without any hitch at all; the count-down started, the designated switcher-onner applied digit to switch and the lights came on. Some of them, anyway.  All faces turned in the direction of the lights on one side of the square, theatrical oohhs and aahhs followed, then everybody swivelled round to the other side and a great moan went up, also theatrical, and well-rehearsed in other years, because here the darkness stubbornly remained. Perhaps it took several digits on several switches, for eventually both the lights on the tree above the pub and the remaining strings of light above the houses in the square shone forth in glory."},
{"title": "December in the Garden", "date": "Friday 11 December 2009", "text": "Yesterday was probably the last time this year that I spent a few hours in the garden. We were granted a rare sunny day between the rains of the past few weeks and the winter fogs, ice and wind to come. It was an opportunity to go out with my camera and search for those plants which are still pleasing to the eye at this otherwise so drab and dreary time of year, when staying indoors by the fire is much the preferred option.I found a surprising number of plants worth recording. It has always been my habit to ensure winter interest in the garden, after all, my kitchen window looks out over the main part and I like to linger there, idly surveying the bird feeders which are alive with small birds coming for their allocation of seeds, nuts, fat and kitchen scraps. There is a constant traffic between the feeding stations and the surrounding trees and hedges with frequent stop-overs at the seed heads of herbaceous plants left standing for just this purpose. Fragrance is also important to me and there are several winter flowering fragrant shrubs planted close to the back door and the path which I use most often to get to the back gate.Phormium with their stiff strap leavesthe bronze grassesand the prostrate euphorbias all give shelter to insectsin their convoluted and enclosed hearts,providing feeding grounds for birds all winter.The Silk Tassel Bush (Garrya elliptica)is a large shrub providing primarily winter interest with its gorgeous,genuinely grey tassels and grey-green leaves which are glossy greenabove and woolly grey below.The shrub is evergreen and will provide shelter for birds in all weathers.Garrya will grow anywhere, in sun or shade and poor, sandy or chalky soil.It does not like cold winter winds and would prefer to be grown in some wind shelter. Choysia Ternata is lovely at any time of year.Crush the leaves and their beautiful fragrance will reach out to you.Choysia is evergreen and when grown in a sheltered spot will blaze at you all winter, particularly so when caressed by sunlight.Bennocame out too; all his walks recently have been muddy ones;He enjoyed a stroll about the garden which didn't endin him being rubbed down before he was allowed backinto the house.and finally, the King of the winter garden, the holly bush.Although I grow several varieties, the variegated and golden leaved ones among them,at this time of year I make for the dark-green, spiny-leaved, red-berried ones.Making sure that I leave enough of the berries for our winter visitors,the fieldfares and redstarts, as well as our all-year resident, the blackbird,I cut the straightest twigs for the house;a Christmas house without holly in vases and small, home-madedecorative arrangements is unthinkable, as isa front door without its holly wreath to welcome visitors."},

Except in that the camp appears to hold some life, I agree. Except also, of course, that there are only three of us in this room, and that the lavatories aren't frozen. I have intended to mention for some time now that German inventiveness and thoroughness has made even details in barracks here better than British creativeness can make details at home.

Warm and happy, the temperatures many degrees above freezing point,  and yet there are large chunks of ice still on the river, and occasional patches of snow in the country ditches. Heavy clouds rolled up after tea and after an egotistical announcement of lightning and thunder, it rained hard. The sun set in a livid jaw of sky and it's nearly dark now. Dark and wet. Heigh-ho.We did quite a nice lot of business this afternoon in several jewellers' shops, had tea, and are now waiting patiently in the NAAFI  gramophone room for a Beethoven piano sonata to dry up so that we can hear the March Slav (Tchaikovsky) and (Sibelius') Swan of Tuonella."},

{"title": "Children Be Good, Nikolaus Is On His Way!", "date": "Saturday 5 December 2009", "text": "Tonight, the night of the 5th December,  is the night when children in central and eastern Europe expect the arrival of St Nikolaus, bringing his sack of toys and gifts for all children who  have been particularly good during the preceding twelve months.Saint Nicholas is the common name for Agios (Saint) Nikolaos , the Bishop of Myra, who lived in the fourth century AD in Myra, Lycia, now  part of modern Turkey. Historically, there is very little more known of him, except that he was generally seen as a charitable man with a social conscience.Legends however, abound. Nicolaos saves his home town from famine by  miraculously providing grain;  he saves three maidens from shame and ignominy by secretly leaving three pieces of gold in their hovel, while they sleep, thereby providing them with a dowry to marry. He saves sailors from a watery grave and leads a young man imprisoned in a far land back to his homeland. His most famous miracle is that he resurrects and reassembles three drunken  students, who have been murdered, chopped up and pickled in a vat by an evil innkeeper.No wonder Nicolaos became the patron saint of, among others, children, students, sailors, travelling merchants and apothecaries.St Nicholas is celebrated in many central and eastern European countries; in Germany, on his feast day, which falls on December 6th, he is a bringer of gifts for children. These gifts and sweets didn’t come free, you had to have been a very good child during the previous year. St. Nikolaus often brought his servant, Ruprecht, with him, who carried not only the sack with presents on his bent back but also held a switch, a bundle of birch twigs in his hand, which would be used if it could be shown that you had been naughty.When male members of the family, disguised with beard and appropriate costume, i.e., a magnificent coat  and boots for St Nikolaus and dark rags for the Servant Ruprecht, roughly knocked on the door and demanded entry, many a child’s heart beat a furious tattoo, fearfully remembering a small lie, a naughty deed or a hidden shame.  When Nikolaus accused little Eva  of spitting in anger, all she could think of to save her own neck, was telling on her cousin Markus. “He does it too, he did it first”, she squealed.  Nikolaus appeared to have been overcome with emotion at that, as evidenced by his heaving shoulders; she got away with it.Before the times allowed us to travel to branches of the family living in other villages and celebrate the day with my cousins, Saint Nikolaus didn’t come to me in person. “He has to visit too many other children to make time to come here, he may not come at all”, Mum said.  Obviously, I was very disappointed but also just a little relieved; my conscience was never totally clear. As the evening progressed, the atmosphere in the kitchen where I was sitting with my back to the large, old-fashioned range, with a picture or colouring book, grew quiet, with a slight tingle of tension in the air. I kept my head down firmly over my book, all the time listening for sounds from outside. The noise, when it came, did not come from outside, but from right behind me. With a great clatter a wooden toy, a tin of hard boiled sweets and toffees, apples and  gingerbread biscuits came flying into the room. Saint Nikolaus had thrown all these goodies down the chimney for me and they had survived coming down into the kitchen via the big black stove pipe and the fire in the range. It was a wonder Mum hadn’t been hit because she was standing right there, in the way. On the other hand, it was good that she was standing there because she said she had heard Saint Nikolaus  shout down the chimney that he might come again, later in the night, on his way back home and if he had anything left in his sack he’d put it in my boot, if I left it out for him. Which I did.

{"title": "Treats", "date": "Thursday 3 December 2009", "text": "Occasionally there's a season when things come together, a season of fireworks, when I am allowed to scrub up,  dress up, put on the slap and go out on the town instead of dressing down, enveloping myself in the massive and massively heavy family raincoat, trudging around the muddy fields with dog, walking stick and large hat jammed on head.The past few weeks have been the answer to this blogger's prayers,  not one but three such outings have been granted; I have been wallowing in culture, until I am almost drowning in the unaccustomed riches.The Mid Wales Opera Company performed Mozart's 'Marriage of Figaro' in Ludlow.This is a company of young players and singers, all of them at the beginning of their careers, but true professionals giving of their best nevertheless.The next outing was a visit to the theatre to see a performance of Pirandello's surreal masterpiece 'Six Characters In Search Of An Author' by the acclaimed Headlong Theatre Company under Rupert Goold.Never having seen the play before it was quite a challenge to follow the action;  the play is about six imaginary characters looking for an author to write their play, in which these characters and their roles already exist. The characters themselves act out the play yet to be written.Six Characters In Search Of An Author is a classic of modernism, a fundamentally subversive moment in the history of modern theatre. Its self-conscious setting, its fragmented narrative, confusing time levels and radical ideas caused an uproar at its first night on 9 May 1921.....Hard work, yet very enjoyable and just the kind of challenge I like after several months of mud-wrestling and not much else.And there was yet more! The City Of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra beckoned with a concert under its conductor Andris Nelsons playing three Romantics, Liadov, Rachmaninov and Dvorak. The fantastic young Pianist Nikolai Lugansky gave an absolutely virtuoso performance of Rachmaninov's Piano Concerto No. 3, which kept the audience in Symphony Hall on the edge of their seats. One of the men in our company was in tears at the end, I kid you not! Treats like these make the realization that life in the country isa permanent fact of life easier to accept. Country life has great advantages;  having to fight my way through the crowds in Birmingham is not something I frequently hanker after, but I will gladly do so in order to experience a world class concert by gifted performers.Valley's End is a gorgeous place; it is often said that there isn't a house that doesn't enjoy a spectacular view, the people are friendly and kind and the pace of life is quiet and calm. Just occasionally though, this blogger loves to partake of a different life, the life I left behind in the big city, a life of noise, dirt, excitement, traffic, crowded pavements, jostling people and rumbling, packed, trains.Eh? Who am I kidding? Where would you rather live?"},

{"title": "The First Sunday in Advent", "date": "Sunday 29 November 2009", "text": "The Sunday nearest the 30th November is the beginning of the time of Advent, the four-week-period before Christmas in the Western Christian calendar.  It is a very special season in Germany and my favourite time of year.In the afternoon, after early night had fallen,  Mother lit  the first candle on the Advent wreath, the first slice of Stollen (German Christmas cake) was cut and a plate of spiced biscuits appeared on the festive Kaffeetafel (German tea table).  There was music too, either Hausmusik, played and sung by members of the family, or more likely, special collections of old-familiar music associated with the time of year, on CD etc. The Advent wreath was always homemade then, the same large, horizontal, circular frame was used every year.  Florist’s foam and thin wire fixed twigs and swags of evergreens like pine, ivy and holly to the frame. Four candleholders for thick candles were attached to it and any unevenness in the final design was hidden with red ribbons tied into bows.  The wreath either sat in the middle of the table during meals or, if very large, was suspended on red ribbons above the table. Some houses had a hook in the ceiling the whole year round just for this purpose.The origins of the Advent wreath are not altogether clear. Some believe that the wreath is much older than Christianity, and was, in fact, a symbol of the eternal circle of the seasons and the lighted candles signified the persistence of life in the darkness of winter.A story told about a Protestant theologian by the name of  Johann Heinrich Wichern (1808-1881) says that he was the inventor of the first modern Advent wreath. He was a good man who had taken a number of poor boys into his home, to bring them up and educate them. Apparently, these boys gave him no peace in the weeks before Christmas, always asking when the feast would finally come (an early version of “are we there yet”) and he decided to create a wooden wreath with as many candles as there were days left before Christmas so that the boys could count the days themselves.Lately, the Advent calendar has taken over this role, although I cannot find the garish monstrosities sold in shops with a cheap chocolate hidden behind every door in the least bit attractive. We had the old-fashioned sort, at first home-made; and when the windows in the large cardboard calendar with its amateurish,  hand-painted pictures finally came off their folds and were beyond repair, we bought a calendar, a pretty snow scene, depicting a rather kitsch Christmas market and an imaginary cathedral, which was also in use for many years. It won’t be many days before I start digging in my own box of Advent decorations;  although I swear every year, that I will go easy, save myself the trouble, and ask myself ‘why bother’, the wooden figures, the pyramid, the candles and candle bow (Schwibbogen) will shortly make an appearance. At this time of year, sentimentality rules okay!  And there’s a glass of Glühwein to go with it."},
{"title": "Stray Dogs", "date": "Friday 27 November 2009", "text": "A recent post by English Rider brought the good news that the second of a pair of temporarily homeless dogs she had taken in quite some time ago had found a new, permanent home. This is the time of year when thoughtless idiots, looking around for a Christmas present, hit on the idea of 'giving' a puppy, often to a child, or a current girlfriend.  After Christmas, when the novelty has worn off, the puppy has soiled the carpets, or the daily routine of school and work starts again, the puppy is suddenly no longer wanted and ends up in a shelter or rescue centre, if it's lucky, or abandoned on the streets, if not. Or even worse, it is taken to the motorway and abandoned there, soon to be hit and killed.As most of you know, I am not exaggerating.My own Benno was one of those dogs given \"as a present\" to agirlfriend, for Valentine's Day, of all things. Both young people wereworking and neither really had much time to look after the dog; he was left alone for days on end and never learned to play or socialise properly.Benno, who was then called by a different name, is a labrador and soon grew into a large dog, much too large for a small two room flat.  Labradors also like their food, the couple hardly had enough money to feed themselves.Things got worse for the dog;  soon the couple had a baby and while the child was still a toddler, they split up. The woman moved into an upstairs, one room flat with baby and dog: money got even tighter. The dog was almost skeletal for lack of food.Eventually an interfering bystander (thank goodness for busybodies on this occasion) realized that the situation for all concerned was untenable, the dog was removed and re-homed with us. Our previous dog, also a rescued dog, had died and we were in need of canine companionship. As so often happens, Benno adopted us rather than the other way round and we have been a very happy family ever since.I don't believe that any of you reading this will be tempted to have a dog unless you are able to take care of it; however, let me just remind everybody of the RSPCA slogan:A DOG IS FOR LIFENOT JUST FOR CHRISTMAS"},
{"title": "THE PARTY'S OVER", "date": "Tuesday 24 November 2009", "text": "Towards the end of last week my visits to blogland were a bit thin on the ground. The reason was that we had a big party chez nous, at Valley’s End.I am still mad enough to do most of the work myself; when the idea first comes to me , say two weeks beforehand, the whole thing seems a doddle, something I can do in between shooting off blog posts, running the household and winning the Nobel prize for services to the advancement of mangelwurzels.The rough guest list in my head gets an airing; I also decide which kind of party it’ll be: the stand-around-with-a-drink-in-one-hand-and-a-sausage-roll-in-the-other sort, or the grab-a-plate-and-a-chair-and-if-you’re-lucky-a-table sort.By about a week before the event the guests have been invited; unless Fido has just died or the whole family is in quarantine due to an outbreak of galloping gypsophila everybody accepts. Believe me, all you good folks living near the fleshpots of civilization, you do not turn down an invitation to any kind of jolly when even a visit to the village hall, where they are showing last year’s blockbuster movie with an interval for a choc ice on a stick while the DVD player is cranked up for the second half, is a major social event.Now it’s time to make lists; food lists, drinks lists, nibbles lists; you count the glasses that haven’t got broken since the last party, the paper napkins left over from the charity coffee morning, the crockery and cutlery. If you are short, you borrow. From bitter experience you know whose cutlery is not dishwasher-proof and whose crockery is a family heirloom. Glasses we have plenty ourselves; the local supermarket has an everything-for-£1 aisle; several years ago they had a special consignment of practically unbreakable glasses at 3-for-a-pound, which have since done the rounds of the village for every party going; no point in more than one household having a spare box or two containing glasses, each carefully wrapped in kitchen roll and tied with a piece of string for easy transport.Three days before the party it’s time to panic. But it’s a controlled, well-organized sort of panic. Panic often enough and it becomes routine.The decision was to serve a-plate-and-fork dinner, cottage pie and vegetables for the main course, apple and plum tart for pudding and cheese and biscuits for any one still hungry. And believe me, my cottage pie is filling. The guests numbered twenty seven, that meant 27 portions of everything, at least, with a bit extra for unforeseen emergencies, like somebody saying, at the last minute, auntie Gwen is visiting, can she come too? Would the Aga cope? Of course not, it never does. So cooking has to happen in stages. Stage one, two days beforehand, cook the meat part; stage two, one day beforehand, cook the potato crust and grate the cheese topping. Also, defrost the tarts and prepare the vegetables; here Beloved comes into his own, he is a mean carrot baton chopper and his peeling and bottom cross cutting of the Brussel’s sprouts is second to none.As it is November, the party day dawns wet and windy and the river ‘is almost out’, which means, that if there’s a lot more rain during the day, half the guests won’t be able to come because they live on the wrong side of the bridge, i.e. the side away from our side of the bridge, if you get my drift. A detour of many miles would become necessary, all adding to the by now almost unbearable excitement.Seven-ish is kick-off. There’s always the couple arriving just a touch too early, catching you swearing uncontrollably at each other because neither of you will accept responsibility for having forgotten to cook the French beans, or unwrap the cheeses or not having thought to get the alcohol-free juice from the shop, thereby turning any driver present into an instant criminal. Beloved invariably falls back on his favourite ‘but I thought you said’ routine, looking extremely hurt and innocent of all wrong-doing.Suddenly, at 7.20 there is a huge commotion at the front and back doors, half the guests are arriving in a bunch, all divesting themselves of their wet overcoats and rubber boots in your pristine lobby and scullery respectively. You rush to welcome them, carrying piles of coats and shedding coat hangers like matchsticks from an upturned matchbox on your way to the coat cupboard. The rubber boots remain behind to trip you up as you rush to the scullery freezer to unpack the forgotten juice and shove a kilo and a half of French beans into the microwave.  From now on all is organized and orchestrated chaos, glasses have been filled beforehand, nibbles have been distributed, further guests let themselves in singly and in pairs, are greeted and swallowed up by the throng. Noise levels rise steadily, the party is up and running. An hour later everybody is eating, you have found a quiche for the chap who has become vegetarian since you last met him and there are plenty of bottles of wine distributed around the rooms for guests to help themselves. You have done it, you could even grab a bite and a glass yourself now, except it’s time to cut the tarts. If you don’t want fruit splodged all over the kitchen you had better load the cake plates yourself, you are probably the only one still sober enough to manipulate a cake slice and a sticky, fragile cake. Not to mention pouring the cream.Beloved has disappeared into the mêlée, he has been very good and introduced the one couple who insist on being out of things and sitting on the sofa next to each other instead of mingling, to the hostess’ favourite guests, the trio who can be relied upon to judge any situation nicely from the initial friendly smile and warm handshake to the eventual telling of risqué anecdotes.  Actually, you have made a mistake inviting the couple, this party is probably going to scar them for life.Country people keep early hours, even on a Saturday the last guests are ready to leave by midnight; once you have locked the doors behind the last of them you survey the battlefield. There is rarely any damage, you can shut your eyes to the mess for the present, the two of you can put your feet up and wind down over a final, small drink before going to bed.Once you’ve cleared up the next day, all that remains to be done over the next week is await the pretty thankyou notes and watch the invitations flood in."},

{"title": "The Scraper's Diary, Friday, March 28th, 1947", "date": "Friday 20 November 2009", "text": "On the Bank of the River AllerA pleasant, peaceful spot, the river swift-flowing-by, a slight icing of bubbles skating downstream, a protective huddle of old, multi-coloured houses across the river, to my left, screened behind a road of countryside trees, that somehow are a parade, and make the scene German. The sun has temporarily resigned to the rain; bulbous clouds, which, flowing effortlessly beyond me, show no sign of their inherent boredom. The grass ahead is rarely green and trodden to the grey earth's humility; away, by the turn of the river, two bare trees stand guard over a deserted cottage, and beyond, the fringes of a forest hide the horizon behind their skirts.When I sat here, a small boy, muddy clogs in hand, came and sat nearby, and watched me with a grave intent. Three of his playmates have now joined him and they are chattering their supremely important matters in their incomprehensible tongue and lying on their bellies, watching a backwater's  sloth.Two disdainful chickens are beachcombing closer and closer to me; the children are paddling in the shallows.I must get up and turn to the Barley bridge with its damaged stonework and I must go up to the old philosophical track to the road, and travel. I must move on again.o-o-o-o-oWe saw some rather nice handbags in a shop window, and so we went inside, saw two more on a shelf and started negotiations. I started conventionally;\"Do you speak English?\"\"No\".\"OK\".Stumped, we thought a minute, while the assistant leaned on the counter, rather embarrassed. I pointed to the handbags and looked 'query'. She handed me one. We inspected it and approved.\"How much ?\" I said.\"?\", she said.\"How much ?\" I said,  \"Combien ?\"  \"Marks?\"\"Ah,\" she said, \"Zwanzig Mark\".\"Twenty ?\", I said.\"Ja\".We went into a huddle then.\"Nein Deutschgeld\", I said. \"You take cigarettes?\"\"Zwanzig Mark\", she said. \" Und zwei kilos paper\".\"Nix paper\", I said, \"cigarettes?\"We went on at this for ten minutes, neither of us understanding much of the other's talk and giggling wholesale. We gathered that one gave twenty marks and two kilos paper for a bag. She gathered that we had enough marks, no paper, and a few cigarettes. She also gathered that we were a bit daft.Eventually we bribed her with soap and bought a bag each for twenty marks and twenty cigarettes each. We retired to a pub and bought some foul German beer that tasted like acorns and coca-cola. Armed with a glass of this, I went into an alcove and asked a German if he felt any inclination to purchase some cigarettes. He didn't seem too keen, in broken English, but condescended to give me a low price for seventy.Next, we went to another shop and bought some nice brass ashtrays. I asked the lady if she had any rings. She said something most Aryan, and  \"and an actress said 'after Easter' \".I realized that she'd understood all my linguistic attempts at their true banality, and beat a hasty retreat.footnote: the Scraper never did work out what he had been told in either of the two shops but did his heroic best to repeat the words as he heard them in his diary."},

{"title": "The Garden in November", "date": "Monday 16 November 2009", "text": "In between heavy rain, showers and the gale-force winds which lashed the valley for the whole of the weekend the garden beckoned;  what would I find outside? Donning the family raincoat, my own wellington boots, pulling my hood down and grabbing the camera, I set off outside, starting with Mimir who guards the entrance to the hollow tree stump at the bottom of the drive.Mimir seems to have protected us from the worst excesses of the storms; I could find no structural damage; naturally, a lot of wood has come down from the trees, but that happens every autumn, it's the trees' way of regeneration. Luckily, the hybrid tea rose border got away with only minor root disturbance; it is high time for  the bushes to receive their autumn cut-back. I have found whole bushes uprooted in other years after the first autumn storms. Each new storm weakens and pulls further at the root system, until the bush loses its hold in the ground completely.The mixed shrub border is protected by the wall behind it. Daphne, Cotinus and Weigela are doing well. Only the Cotinus is deciduous, the other two will keep their leaves, giving me something to look at out of the kitchen window for the whole of the winter. The stiff, upright, stems of the michaelmas daisy in front of the shrubs are turning a deep dark brown, the flowerheads are fading to the palest purple, but I won't be cutting them back until early spring. I prefer to grow herbaceous plants which give pleasure even in death;  I'm afraid, the ones whose foliage turns a mushy, slimy, mess are chopped off as soon as the flowers fade.Grasses are good all the year round but some of them  really come into their own in autumn when they turn a lovely colour, sandy, deep straw, russet or ochre.  The blood grass and wavy hair grass here are particularly attractive when there is so little else left. Grasses are easy to grow, they certainly earn their keep; I don't mind them spreading and self-seeding; they seem to have a knack of popping up only in those places where they add to the display.  And, if not, the smaller ones are easy to pull up. In a gentle breeze the quiet rustle of the larger grasses, like miscanthus and calamagrostis,  is wonderfully soothing.A high wind will make the plumes flutter like streamers.I also love hydrangeas, of all sorts. They have been out of fashion for years now and it is true, they take a long time before they emerge to their full splendour,  but once the huge, blowzy, flowers are out, hydrangeas shout out their presence until the following, early spring when they need pruning. No shrinking violets here. I love all hydrangea flowers, be they mophead,  lacecap, the cone shaped paniculata, or the plate shaped petiolaris. I prefer white and blue flowers to pink ones, but, hey, live and let live, in the garden as well as everywhere else.  The one shown here is a petiolaris, dying back beautifully.The Leycesteria is not a thing of beauty in winter. Neither is it particularly eye-catching at any other time,  except for the dangly flower heads; I always think of them as large,  colourful, flamboyant earrings  the kind which looks good depending from the ear of a beautiful lady with a mane of upswept hair and bare shoulders.Perhaps that's why the Victorians loved the Leycesteria.The schizostylis is a South African lily, which flowers from mid-summer through to the first frosts in autumn. It is totally hardy and, in mild winters, I have even cut a few blooms for the christmas table.Schizostylis spread easily, they belong in the give-away group of plants, until everyone you know has them, and your gardening friends hide when they see you coming with a bag full of spiky, green, strappy leaves. A bit like crocosmia, in fact.Although there is much less to do in my garden from now until next spring, there are still a few tasks remaining. Once the roses have been pruned they deserve a light sprinkling of bonemeal. It is very important that the moisture levels of evergreen shrubs are kept up, as otherwise they will dry out. Both camellias and magnolias have refused to flower for me because I deprived them of water during winter. The compost heaps and leaf mould cage need attention and the ornamental elder bushes will have to be pruned between now and early March. A major task during the weeks ahead is the protection of slightly tender plants, either by means of straw and conifer cones and pyramids, horticultural fleece or just pretty, upturned basket cones stuffed with leaf mould or the fronds of ferns.But the main work is to be done indoors; seed and plant catalogues are arriving in the post, there is a pile of gardening magazines kept back during the summer to read in the winter and envelopes stuffed with pictures ripped out of catalogues, garden brochures and advertisements are all waiting to be studied and dreamt over; some of these plans and dreams might even become reality next year. And if not, they allow me to dream of summer in the depth of winter.photos can be enlarged"},
{"title": "Eva's Tale", "date": "Friday 13 November 2009", "text": "The story so far: Eva is a little girl living in post-war Germany. Because she might be in danger of contracting Tbc she is sent to a children's home, which is also used as a sanatorium, on the island of Norderney in the North Sea. She is away from home, on her own, for the first time in her life. Eva Goes On Holiday   # 3   Miss Manfred took the Heidi book away from me. I cried a bit because I like my Heidi book and I wanted to read it again. Miss Manfred said that she would read it to all of us, in the afternoon, when we are all lying on our beds having a rest.My Mum sent me some sweeties because I asked for them but Miss Manfredtook them away too and she shared them out to everybody. But that’s all right because Miss Manfred shares out everybody’s sweeties and we get some every afternoon.It is very nice to lie on my bed and suck a sweetie and Miss Manfred reads my Heidi book out loud and sometimes we all fall asleep after a bit.o-o-o-o-oThis morning Miss Manfred asked me if I could go and clean the rubbish bin in the toilets. I said I would and found the Vim and a brush and some cloths in the cleaning cupboard.  Then I took the things into the toilets. There was nobody else there. I shut the door and because the bin was full of rubbish and I didn’t know what to do with it I tipped it all out on the floor. The bin was very dirty. I tipped in the Vim and got some water on the brush and scrubbed the bin until it was much cleaner. I dried it with the cloths. It was lovely and white after I finished cleaning it.There was still the rubbish from the bin on the floor. I picked it all up again and put it back into the bin. I left nothing lying on the floor because I wiped the floor with the cloths too. It took a very long time.Then I went out to play with the other children.When it was teatime Miss Manfred asked me if I had remembered to clean the bin. She should know without asking because it took me a long time and I missed a lot of playing time because I was in the toilets. When I said yes, she said, are you sure, and she looked at me like Miss Speer does when she asks why there are no names on the blackboard. Her face was all shut in and her mouth was closed and in a line and her face came right down to mine and she asked again, if I was sure. Well, of course, I was and I was a bit frightened because she didn’t smile and I told her to go and look and that I had put everything back in the cleaning cupboard afterwards.Miss Manfred said, very well then, but she didn’t smile and she didn’t say thank you either, which Mum says you must always do when somebody does something for you."},
{"title": "Reminiscing", "date": "Tuesday 10 November 2009", "text": "Celebrating St. Martin's DayEach year, on the 11th November,  St. Martin’s Day is celebrated in Germany. It is a mix of Christian and pagan customs. While it is the day of a saint, it is also associated with the Roman Vinalia, a wine festival in honour of Bacchus. It is generally considered to be end of all harvest, including the late vines, and the beginning of winter.First and foremost, during my childhood, St. Martin’s Day was a festival for children. Weeks before the day, we took stiff black paper, sheets of shiny, colourful transparent paper, glue, thin wire and all the wonderful artsy things, which we were not usually allowed to play with to school, where we were instructed in the magical art of lantern-making. We happily designed, drew and cut shapes and windows out of the stiff black paper. The red, green, gold, yellow, blue, scarlet sheets, and sheets of as many other colours as your parents were willing to purchase for you, became the “glass” for these cut-outs. A stiff piece of cardboard was used to provide the bottom for your lantern, while the top was left open, but held together with a wire with a loop in the top. A small tinfoil candleholder was securely glued to the middle of the cardboard bottom. The lantern was carried on the end of a thin, lightweight cane, which was furnished with a hook at one end, over which the loop was slipped. It was an absolute matter of pride to have a good, sturdy and beautiful lantern; if you had managed to make one with recognizable shapes, perhaps even one to copy some of the stained glass windows in the church, you were a proud and happy child indeed. Legend has it that Martinus was a Roman soldier, born in Hungary, educated in Pavia, in Italy. On a bitter winter’s night, during a military campaign, he found himself in Amiens, France, astride his horse, a starving and freezing beggar on the ground in front of him.  Martinus drew his sword, cut his cloak in two and flung one half of it down to the cowering beggar.The following night he dreamt that he saw Jesus wearing his cloak, saying to the angels,  \"Here is Martin, the Roman soldier who is not baptized; he has clothed me.\" (Sulpicius,ch 2)Martinus became a Christian at the age of 18; in 371 he became Bishop of Tours, in France. According to his legend, he was unwilling to become bishop. He hid in a stable filled with geese, whose noise betrayed him to the people coming to look for him. Perhaps that is the reason why goose is the festive fare traditionally eaten on his day.  Martin, the Bishop, is said to have led an exemplary life and to have done many good deeds.Each year, on the Saint’s feast day, the beggar scene is re-enacted at the end of a long procession of children through German towns and villages. Children from all  local schools get together with their teachers and parents; men with flaming torches line the route of the procession,  the children carry their sparkling lanterns, the small candle inside now lit, singing traditional Martin’s songs, singing about the holy man on his white horse, the lights in the sky and the lantern lights in their hands. At the head of this procession rides St. Martin, always on a white horse, dressed in Roman costume, with a cloak fluttering about his shoulders; he leads the procession to the doors of the church where a huge Martin’s fire has been lit and where a beggar awaits him, crouching on the lowest step in the dark. away from the fire. St Martin arrives at the head of his procession; the children spread out across the front of the church to watch him cut his cloak in two with a grand flourish, lean down from the saddle and hand the half-cloak to the beggar. Each procession goes about the play-acting at the end differently, using a different script for the short scene in front of the church, but always the beggar is invited to step closer to the fire and wrap himself in the good man’s gift. It was a magical evening of walking in procession, carrying lights and singing old familiar songs, the flames of the big Martin’s fire strangely frightening and seductive at one and the same time and all of us pushing and shoving, craning our necks and listening intently; we did not want to miss a word of what was being said during the play;  after all, we believed every word was true. We children too received a gift to take home at the end of the evening: a cone-shaped paper bag filled with a few sweets and a piece of fruit; each bag always held a small sweet wheaten loaf in the shape of a man, with raisins for eyes and a white clay pipe stuck to the front.  Never did a piece of sweet bread taste better."},

Without sleep you stop to function and eventually you die.Sleep deprivation is a preferred means of torture by those who go in for that sort of thing. However, I am not talking about torture inflicted by others here, but the torture of involuntary sleep deprivation, the torture of insomnia.Day is over, you’re home from work and, if you are lucky, you have had a pleasant evening. You’ve done the million and one chores that belong in the realm of daylight, your evening has been spent doing a few more, but let’s assume you’ve had a spare moment for the kids, a book, a favourite TV programme, your blog, a chat with a friend. It’s getting late, you are yawning, time for bed. All is quiet, your bed is comfortable, you’ve had your cocoa, it’s time to turn out the light. Bliss!Thirty minutes later there’s a band playing snippets of advertising jingles in your brain. Every humiliating conversation you’ve ever had with your boss/ex-partner/her with the flash car down the road/the ticket collector when you couldn’t find your season ticket/the waiter in the posh restaurant/ that show-off at dinner with friends the other day who knew every word of the latest theatrical adaptation when you thought you could get by with having read the programme notes when you introduced the subject/ is replayed in your head.Now, at one o’clock, two o’clock, two-thirty, three in the morning, you have that brilliant repartee at your fingertips; you have the perfect, witty, throw-away answer to fling in the face of these nobodies, these hopeless morons, who are not fit to lick your boots.Now you are firing on all cylinders. Your blog pops into your head; you can’t believe how many fantastic and fascinating ideas for blogposts you have; you start composing them, they are easy, effortless works of art to astound every blogging-buddy you’ve ever had. There is no doubt about it, you will be a Blogger Of Note within days.And why stop there. Your creative urges are at their peak around three-thirty in the morning; you can barely process these urges fast enough to accommodate their inventiveness and sheer intellectual brilliance. Before long, you have a short story, the synopsis for a novel, in your head. And the jingles play on in-between.Unfortunately, you have also grown several unnecessary, extra limbs by this time, all of them causing you great discomfort. St Vitus’ dance has got hold of your legs, your shoulders ache with tension, that damned headache is back and there’s a ton of grit sitting behind your eyelids. You’ve been up and down, have drunk enough water to float a battle ship and now, in desperation, you stumble to the bathroom to take a couple of paracetamol.  Why on earth didn’t you think of that earlier, but no, you had to finish grinding those morons into the dust, you had to complete the second draft of that wonderful post in your head.The next thing you know is the shrill screech of the alarm going off at seven. You drag yourself out of bed, what there is left in your head of the night’s furious literary efforts makes damn-all sense in the grey light of morning. You feel exhausted; the only thing that keeps you going during the day is the thought of a nice early night tonight.None of that ever happens to me.Image: Insomniaby NXFURY"},

{"title": "\"NOT ANOTHER BLOODY POEM\"", "date": "Wednesday 4 November 2009", "text": "I found this heading on a blogpost the other day and I realised how many different kinds of bloggers there are and how different our preferred reading matter is. Now, anyone who has read this blog before knows that I love poetry, it is a totally natural part of my life. I read poetry, discuss poetry in a poetry group and generally find it life-enhancing. I search out other lovers of poetry in blogland who introduce me to poets and poems hitherto unknown to me and I am grateful that they should take the time do so.Certainly, the phrase “not another bloody poem” smacked me right between the eyes.But there are blogs and blogposts which leave me yawning, irritated and even annoyed.“Hi, it’s me again; a bunch of us went to the cinema/pictures and we saw xyz which was good/bad/indifferent. We had popcorn and ice cream and laughed a lot”.Unless one of you choked on the popcorn, dripped ice cream down somebody’s collar or you were evicted for lewd behaviour, I don’t want to know.“Freddie had football/soccer practice and he fell over in the mud and he was sooo muddy and I had to wash piles of muddy clothes. Kids, eh?”Unless Freddy ran on his hands and headed three goals into the back of the net  or choked in the mud, I don’t want to know.“Hubby was sooo cross when he came home from work because  traffic round the gyratory system was really awful and he was late for his favourite soap”.No accident, didn’t write off the car, didn’t have sex with his secretary in the back of the car? Don’t tell me.Right, all together now: YOU DON’T HAVE TO READ THIS. Of course, I don’t.But you, the poetry hater, don’t have to read the poetry blog either.To end on a literary note, here's what Thomas Babington Macaulay (1800-1859) had to say on the subjectPerhaps no person can be a poet, or can even enjoy poetry,without a certain unsoundness of mind.and that, friends, is good enough for me."},

We drove in a sort of large Y shape South from Wilhelmshaven to Oldenburg and Bremen, then back up North to the bridge at Wesermunde and South again to Bremen and Verden.Thus we took over four hours to cross the river Weser from Bremen West to  Bremen East on the other side.

{"title": "Children's Playtime", "date": "Wednesday 28 October 2009", "text": "It’s conker playing time, so why are there no children coming up the garden path, asking if they may collect the conkers from our big old horse chestnut tree?Could it be something to do with the dreaded Health & Safety brigade forbidding children to play conkers in the school playground ?How do children of today develop their sense of adventure, an appetite for exploration, give their imagination free rein; perhaps even just learn how to negotiate a road, when they are under supervision almost every hour of the day.Why are so many playgrounds empty most of the time, even in good weather? Where are the children having fun?     This is not the beginning of a “better-in-my-day” rant. I genuinely feel sorry for the way children are hedged about on all sides by anxious parents, teachers concerned that they might be sued and officialdom adding prohibitive restrictions.     “In-my-day”, the young were sent out to play, to explore woods and fields and hedges, to build dens, climb trees, swim and paddle in streams and ponds. There were seasons for bike riding, roller and ice skating, sledging, skipping, hopscotch, playing ball and many other regularly recurring games. Girls took their dolls and doll related paraphernalia on to the doorstep or into the open porch, boys kicked a ball about in the street.     I realise that most children grow up in towns nowadays and that it would be foolish to allow them to play on busy roads but it must surely be within the bounds of adults’ ingenuity to encourage children to discover activities outside their computer and TV infested bedrooms or organised “after-school-activities”. Many children are ferried to and from lessons in extra-curricular subjects after school hours, could these subjects not include some unsupervised playtime in a safe environment?  Not just indoors but outdoors as well.     Even nowadays children could still have adventures away from adults, on their own, rehearsing how to become grown-up by taking on responsibility for themselves and each other; with older children keeping an eye out for the younger ones.     Perhaps parents’ reluctance to give their children the freedom they deserve and need is partly due to the constant reminders and solemn warnings in the media and public organs of the ever-present danger of psychopaths, rapists, muggers, lurking around every corner as well as gangs of feral boys, and more recently, girls, wielding guns and knives, ruling the streets.     I heard last weekend, that here, at Valley’s End, shrubs and trees have recently been cut down on the perimeter of  the children’s playground and the football field with the justification that “paedophiles might be lurking there hidden from view, waiting to pounce”. I sincerely hope that is no more than rumour, otherwise I would despair.     Horror stories like these sell papers and advertising; for the most part, these stories are wildly exaggerated, even  nonsense. The children who come to harm in our society, come to harm at home or in the care of people they know well, people out of their own, often closest, environment. Only the very worst of these stories come to public knowledge, the vast majority of them remain untold. But every isolated case of a stranger attacking a child is immediately whipped into a froth of public hysteria.     We must keep our children and grandchildren safe, we must protect them, look after them, but let us also allow them the space and freedom to grow into happy and well-adjusted adults. I feel that “learning to play” is very much part of that process.     What do you think? painting by Jacques Laurent Agasse 1767-1849  \"Der Spielplatz\""},
{"title": "The Pillow Book of Sei Shonagon", "date": "Monday 26 October 2009", "text": "Sei Shonagon, who was a lady-in-waiting at the court of he Emperor of Japan towards the end of the tenth century AD, wrote her Pillow Book as a sort of very early blog. Here are three more examples of her lists of things which she found worthy of noting.Things That Have Lost Their PowerA large boat which is high and dry in a creek at ebb-tide.A woman who has taken off her false locks to comb the short hair that remains.A large tree that has been blown down in a gale and lies on its side with its roots in the air.The retreating figure of a Sumo wrestler who has been defeated in a match.Awkward ThingsOne has gone to a house and asked to see someone; but the wrong person appears, thinking that it is he who is wanted; this is especially awkward if one has brought a present.One has allowed oneself to speak badly about someone without really intending to do so; a young child who has overheard it all goes and repeats what one has said in front of the person in question.Someone sobs out a pathetic story. One  is deeply moved; but it so happens that not a single tear comes to one's eyes - most awkward. Though one makes one's face look as if one is going to cry, it is no use; not a single tear will come. Yet there are times when, having heard something happy, one feels the tears streaming out.Things That Fall From The SkySnow. Hail. I do not like sleet, but when it is mixed with pure white snow it is very pretty.Snow looks wonderful when it has fallen on a roof of cypress bark.When snow begins to melt a little, or when only a small amount has fallen, it enters into all the cracks between the bricks, so that the roof is black in some places, pure white in others - most attractive.I like drizzle and hail when they come down on a shingle roof.I also like frost on a shingle roof or in a garden."},
{"title": "October", "date": "Saturday 24 October 2009", "text": "The month of October, the “golden month”, the month when the last fruits ripen, is a tranquil month, suitable for autumnal contemplation and for taking a well-deserved rest from the labours of the outdoor year.  In terms of the human lifespan, October falls into the fourth season, after childhood, youth, middle age; it is the month corresponding to the age of the senior, the older person. Lines and colours become sharper, the contours of a life lived, achievements and failures of a lifetime, become clearer, more defined. There’s nothing much we can do about anything now.   The age of the “senior”, the age of retirement, has not been with us for many years yet. In olden days, before the beginning of the 20th century, the aging man and woman worked until s/he could no longer do so, until s/he no longer had the physical or mental strength. The aging man would pass on his farm, his fields, his business, his trade, to his son and the farmer’s wife and housewife handed over  keys and responsibility for the household to the daughter or daughter-in-law. The elders would, however, remain with and in the family, needed still for advice, help with children and lighter work, thereby remaining active and retaining a sense of self-worth, a confirmation of their relevance, terms nobody would have known or used a hundred years ago.   With the advent of retirement age, a retirement pension, therefore a fixed date for leaving our active working life – good as these achievements  are – we also gradually invented a need for alternative employment and  a filling of our leisure time, particularly, as we in the West all live so much longer than we used to do.  In the old days, particularly in rural environments, it was common for three generations to live together under one roof, or at least in the same village. Before machines took over much of our work, when we grew our own food, washed our own clothes and scrubbed our own doorsteps, there was always enough work for everybody within the family, house and garden, when the daily bread-winning job was done.   Of course, not everything in the garden was endlessly rosy, far from it. People living together in close proximity has always caused problems, for all parties.   Still, grandfather and grandmother were of great importance to the children of the family, taking care of them, entertaining them, teaching them, telling stories, comforting, consoling them, when the need arose; tasks which are too often left to TV, computers and noisy games today.   A hundred years ago the older person was, much more than we can even imagine today, part of the continuous chain of generations; hence their adherence to what they knew, had learned throughout their lives.  When asked “why” or “since when” their answer was  “that’s how it’s always been”. And they’d stick to that. “Age and wisdom” are not always synonymous but there is no doubt that experience had taught them well.  The term “leisure activities” too was unknown a hundred years ago. There were  no organised entertainments or sports for the elderly rural population. They had  time to be aware of and in tune with the changing seasons, for instance; to watch both crops and children grow. They knew of  “all things between heaven and earth”. During long summer evenings there was time to sit on the doorstep and talk; the women knitting and the men maybe smoking a leisurely pipe.  And when they grew too old to be of use they were allowed to live out their remaining days in the bosom of their family, accepted as a part of the rhythm of life.   o-o-o-o-o   I have been prompted to these musings by the sad spectacle of an old lady of my acquaintance, a dear friend, being transported to a care home by her family.  I realise that her failing health is making this move necessary but I am still wondering if we are not too ready to put our old people away too readily."},

It is called Norderney, I asked Miss Manfred and she showed me how to spell it. Miss Manfred is in charge of me and I must do as she says. But she smiled a bit and I wasn’t scared. I’ve never been sent away before. Everybody says it’s good for me but I miss Mum. Mum packed a suitcase for me, with my knickers and vests and socks and my skirt and blouses and my dress and shoes and plimsolls and even my nighties.  She wouldn’t pack any toys, not even my Pummelchen*,  she said,  you will only lose them and anyway, toys from home are not allowed.     Sanatorium is a bit like school except I have to stay here all the time and sleep in a room which is called a dormitory and there are six of us, all girls, and we all have to lie on our beds in the afternoon and rest. Miss Manfred says that the doctor says we are all tired after lunch, but I am not tired and I asked Miss Manfred if I could read a book if I had one.      We are allowed to write a letter home but we have to show it to the lady who sits with us in the big room, where we eat and write letters and draw pictures and play games. The lady asks us many questions about how we are and what we like to do and if we like the Sanatorium and the nurses. I didn’t know that there are nurses, but the lady says that this is not just a children's home but also a Sanatorium and that there must be nurses.  And doctors. The doctor said I must have a thorough examination,  and he needs to check me. There was a nurse but she didn’t look like a nurse. she didn't have a white apron on; I was scared, they made me take off my vest and they didn’t give me a sweetie. I couldn’t manage all my buttons and the nurse helped me.     The doctor said I must go into a very special dormitory, for very special children. We get extra attention and the ward is called isolation. Miss Manfred is very nice to us, she is never cross, even when Susie cried all night because she missed her Mummy and we couldn’t sleep because she made such a racket. I cried a bit but very softly, so nobody heard me.     I wrote a letter to Mum. I think I was very clever to remember my Mum’s name from before she married my Dad. I didn’t think you could write a letter to two people so I wrote it just for Mum and I put her name on it, Miss Josten; I even put her other name on it, Miss Katherine Josten. I asked her to send me my winter coat and my Heidi book. I showed the letter to the lady and she put a stamp on the envelope. She smiled at me but she didn’t say anything.     I don’t know what all the fuss is about, my Mum sent the coat and the Heidi book and a letter saying that I was very naughty and the lady called me in and she smiled again and she said I must put my Mum’s proper name on the next letter.  But the name she said I must put on the envelope  is my Dad’s name I said, not my Mum’s. The Lady smiled a bit more and she said, all the same, could I please do as Mum asked and then she said that she enjoys having me and I am not to worry and she will tell my Mum that she likes me and that I am a good girl. *Pummelchen = rag doll"},

I breathe all the time,  sometimes I breathe very hard, like when I run or play hopscotch with Lucy and Jenny. Lucy is my best friend ever. Jenny is my best friend too, but not like Lucy, I like Lucy better, she can’t run fast and we play together nicely, Mum says.  The doctor waggled his head when he finished knocking on my chest and my back. I like him, his hands are warm  and he gives me a sweetie. We’ll try to get her into the next group, he said, six weeks of sea air will do her good.   Six weeks, that’s forever. I think it must be a very long time, because when Mum and I told Miss Speer, she also waggled her head a bit and said, she will miss most of the summer term then. Miss Speer is my teacher, she is very, very old, she has her hair all scraped back, with a bun in the back and lots of grips and when she smiles her face goes all crinkly. She is really lovely. Except when she has to leave the room and she makes me stand in front of the class and write down the names of naughty children on the blackboard. I don’t like that. But Miss Speer says I must do it, you must do your duty, she says. I wish she would pick someone else sometimes. Even if Katy and Marianne are naughty I never write their names on the blackboard. I only pretend. I go round the back and I scrape the chalk over the blackboard so it sounds like I’m writing, but I’m not really. When Miss Speer comes back she always asks me who was naughty and why there are no names on the blackboard. I say that nobody was naughty and that everybody read their books and practised writing.  I can tell she doesn’t believe me.   Miss Speer says it’s all right for me to be sent away and breathe the sea air; I think it must be very special air, Mum says it will stop me coughing. Mum says I’m lucky, other children don’t get to go. Perhaps if I tried very hard to stop coughing they won’t send me away."},

{"title": "October in the Garden", "date": "Thursday 8 October 2009", "text": "from The Garden, Autumnby Vita Sackville WestAutumn in felted slipper shuffles on,Muted yet fiery, - Autumn's character.Brown as a monk yet flaring as a whore,And in the distance blue as Raphael's robeTender around the Virgin.This year's colours are absolutely spectacular, I have never seen such brilliant reds, ochres, golds, and yellows. we had the first frost of the year last night, but it seems to have done no harm; on the contrary, the colours appear to have been intensified by the cold. I have brought in all tender plants that I wish to save for propagation; there will be an earthy smell about the place for a few weeks until I have dealt with and safely stored geraniums, dahlias, some grasses and a few of the lavenders and rosemarys; I lost too many plants last year to risk repeating my mistakes.This is a narrow border close by the house.In the picture are the dying leaves of a herbaceous paeony,the flame-coloured plumes of a green-leaved cotinus,and the golden leaves of a choisya.This is an unusual and beautiful spiraea, which I grow mainlyfor its foliage. What it lacks in stature it makes up for inthe colour of its leaves: they are golden in spring and vary from deep red to the palest bronze in autumn.The spindle tree (Euonymous) is an indigenous tree of the hedgerows in Europe.It is pretty inconspicuous for long periods. It produces small white flowers in May which turn into a profusion of rose-red capsules which open to reveal orange seeds.But in autumn it takes centre-stage in any garden, it turns a deep red flame, stealing the show and overshadowing in beauty any rare shrub you may be cosseting.  I love Euphorbias, a plant of mediterranean origin and I grow several varieties.They are not strictly speaking of particular interest in autumn;they make quite a show in any season.But they can be relied upon to provide colour ranging fromlime green over deep green to reddish purple in autumn and deepest winter.They certainly earn their keep.At this time of year and during the winter the small, unassumingcyclamen fill many a shady space in the garden which would otherwise be bare.This clump is growing around the foot of an ancient rambling rose.But the biggest scene-stealer in the garden in October is this ornamental cherry tree. On  the tree these leaves provide a kaleidoscope of changing colour with every breath of wind that touches them.Underfoot they are the brightest oriental carpet you have ever walked on.And finally, some advice for October:Plant gooseberries, currants, raspberries and strawberries, that they may take root before winter; for those which are planted at this season will produce fruit the following summer, whereas those which are planted in spring, have seldom strength enough to produce any (or at least very few) until the second year.Philip Miller  The Gardeners Kalendar 1732"},
{"title": "Summer/Autumn 1945     How not to keep rabbits", "date": "Monday 5 October 2009", "text": "In the summer of 1945 a completely new system of food rationing and allocation of all available foodstuffs was introduced by the American authorities in the Lower Rhine area. The word calories soon became a term everyone was familiar with.  The average inhabitant of the region was entitled to the following quantities  -  always provided the food was actually available for distribution -  per week:  Bread   1 500 grams,  Meat  175 grams,  Butter 90 grams,  Sugar   100 grams,  Jam  150 grams,Various dry foods, such as noodles or rice  250 grams,   soft cheese  50 gramsMaking a total of about 5 547 calories per week, i.e. 792 calories per day.   Fresh fruit or vegetables were not included; in earlier reminiscences I explained hat these were collected by gleaning, foraging and sometimes stealing.   Meat and fish were hardly ever available, they may have been on the list of allocated foods but in reality they very much remained pie-in-the-sky.   Father had an idea. Father had always liked meat, he missed it badly. Mother and I had not had any for a long time, our health may have been suffering but that was not something mother was overly concerned with. Filling bellies sufficiently to alleviate hunger pangs was more her aim.   Father decided we should keep rabbits; we would collect their food in fields and meadows ourselves, fatten them up and eat them.   A rickety hutch was duly built, a pair of baby rabbits appeared out of the blue, were incarcerated and fed on grass, cabbage leaves (we had plenty of cabbage, we always had cabbage, cabbage was our main source of vitamins and minerals and cabbage made us all look fat and bloated, with huge bellies) and anything else we could find.   The rabbits became my pets. I visited them in the garden whenever I could, fed them by hand, even sharing my food with them, which made mother very cross.  I begged her to let them out occasionally, but she wouldn’t budge. These rabbits were to have no exercise which would lengthen the fattening process.   Soon one of them was pronounced ready for butchering. The problem was, how and by whom. In theory, turning a live rabbit into a dead one, ready for the oven, had seemed to be a simple task; in reality, father just couldn’t do it. His great idea had come to a dead end.  Still, these rabbits were food and destined to be cooked and eaten. So father took Hans (naturally, I had given them names), put him in a sack and took him to a farmer, who, in return for the skin, duly dispatched and cleaned him.   Father came home, handed mother the carcass and she cooked it. It was to be a very special Sunday treat. Despite the wonderful, rare cooking smells pervading the kitchen, the atmosphere was sombre, subdued. I was sitting in the corner, snivelling.   When the meal was dished up, my snivelling turned to howling; I absolutely refused to eat Hans; mother likewise felt herself become queasy;  she toyed with a piece but soon pushed it over on to father’s plate. Father was determined to show true grit, he grimly worked his way through his portion and ate mine and mother’s as well.  The next day father took Gretel, the other rabbit away, “to set it free”, he said.  It is more likely that he exchanged it for eggs or butter with someone less squeamish than his own family."},

The sky-writing planes were for a dead Franco or Mussolini, not for a lover. In 1936, however, whilst working with Benjamin Britten, Auden decided to use these two verses as the start of this love song.Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,Silence the pianos and with muffled drumBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.Let aeroplanes circle moaning overheadScribbling on the sky the message, He Is Dead,Put the crepe bows on the white necks of the public doves,Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.He was my North, my South, my East and West,My working week and my Sunday rest,My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.The stars are not wanted now; put out every one Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.For nothing now can ever come to any good."},

The roots need winter to stretch out into the soil and become used to their new abode, before starting growth in earnest in spring.Here is Anne Scott-James' adviceon planting.Circles of Soil.All the gardeners I have talked to, professionals and amateurs, have stressed the importance of leaving a generous circle of cultivated soil round shrubs, roses or fruit trees planted in grass for at least two years after planting. One nursery will not consider replacing dead plants unless a circle at least four feet in diameter has been left for trees and at least three feet for small shrubs.In gardens celebrated for their roses, I always observed round every rose a good circle ofcultivated soil accessible to air, rain andsupplies of food.The four shrubs pictured here are, from the top,Hypericum  (St. John's Wort)BerberisHydrangeaFuchsiaAll photos may be enlarged."},

{"title": "Culture al fresco", "date": "Monday 14 September 2009", "text": "Last night we went to what may be the last part indoor, part open air entertainment of the year, held in the grounds and ballroom of a local manor house. It was billed as an Opera Gala, performed by a quartet of young opera singers and their accomplished pianist.  Opera Gala seems to mean a selection of ‘your favourite tunes’, performed one after the other, with a short introduction to each aria, duet, etc. The singers did very well and the evening was a success. The audience was enthusiastic in their appreciation and many felt it necessary to clap with their hands above their heads and get up for a standing ovation at the end. The lady in the seat behind me hummed and sang along with one well-known aria and I turned round to admire her rendition. She stopped instantly, bless her.  During the interval everybody brought out their picnic hampers, bottles of wine, chairs and, in some cases, tables, all having been carried from the distant car park for the purpose. Napkins were unfolded, corks popped, glasses clinked and plates filled   It was a glorious evening after a sunny day, the park looked splendidly green and very English with its manicured lawns and tidy shrubberies.   A summer that has gone by without al fresco concerts, theatrical performances, fireworks, has somehow been lacking in one of its essential ingredients. A bit like going to the seaside without taking a bucket and spade. or maybe a picnic in a meadow without the wasps.   I have sat on plastic or canvas chairs, ground sheets and blankets in all weathers, in many places, attended grand concerts in Kenwood on Hampstead Health, in the park of Stately Homes and noble palaces; I have watched plays in Regent’s Park in London, and a number of castles, ruined and otherwise, Ludlow Castle included. One of the most memorable occasions and one of my first, was a performance of Heartbreak House at Shaw’s Corner in Ayot St. Lawrence, Hertfordshire; the house where Shaw lived.  It had been threatening to rain all day, so all came prepared with coats and hats and covers. On this occasion the picnic was to be eaten before the performance; about half way through the heavens opened. Gamely, the picnickers donned coats and hats, huddled under tarpaulins and large umbrellas and resumed the meal, water dripping into the wine and canapés. I was quite shocked, I had assumed everyone would run for cover and call the whole thing off. Nothing of the sort happened. The performers appeared on the roofless terrace, which was also the stage, and calmly announced that they were willing to go on if the audience was. The audience was willing, very willing. In fact, it seemed to me, that the deluge added to the entertainment value of the evening and sitting on soggy grass with rapidly forming puddles was a mere bagatelle to be taken in one’s easy stride.   Luckily, the rain eased off fairly quickly; we all enjoyed a splendid performance. Squelching to the cars afterwards, under a starbright sky, the general consensus was of an evening well spent.  A memorable occasion indeed, but not as memorable as a performance of Midsummer Night’s Dream in Ludlow Castle during the Festival. For once the weather was kind, the night was warm, the sky dark and velvety purple. A few stars twinkled in competition with the sprinkle of lights illuminating the brooding walls of the castle, forming the backdrop to the stage. Insects like tiny sparks of fire darted through the night air, miniature meteors extinguished the instant they flew into the darkness between beams of light.     A night of magic, both on and off the stage. And it didn’t end there. Leaving the castle at the end of the performance we came out into the silent market square, the ancient houses lining it bathed in the warm light of old-fashioned street lamps. We hardly spoke, preferring to hold on to the suspension of disbelief and remain wrapped in the magic of the night.     Evenings like this one and an afternoon of music and sunshine like yesterday, or a splendid display of fireworks after a concert, inevitably ending with the 1812 Overture, make me forget all the other occasions, when I’ve been huddled in the cold and damp, miserably wishing myself back home with a glass of wine and a good book."},
{"title": "Boris and Bhuna", "date": "Friday 11 September 2009", "text": "Friends for LifeShaggy dog stories are usually soppy, so if you don't do soppy, don't read this post.When Boris first came to live in Valley's End,Bhuna was already here. Boris was 4 years oldand Bhuna just eighteen months.Bhuna and Boris had had very different lives.Bhuna had always been a pet, he was untrained,spoilt and obedience was not something he had ever come across. His name is the Ethiopian name for coffee, his coat was coffee coloured.Boris was a foundling, picked up by a dog warden in the Essex countryside; he was sick, starving; he had a leg injury and was totally cowed. It became apparent that he had been trained as a working dog, a gun dog, in fact.Boris knew every command and followed itinstantly. In fact, he was pathetically pleasedto obey. He had obviously been harshly treated,he was ever ready to cringe and cower; when we first took him on, he was so afraid of men that he peed himself every time his new master spoke to him in a loud voice.He had congenital eye disease, which must have been the reason for his having been abandoned; no breeder could get away with a visible defect like that; nobody would buy expensive Labrador puppies who would more than likely pass the condition on.Within a month or so, after he'd come to us, Boris was fine; he had an operation on his eye, which stopped him going blind, he had put on weight and his fur was back to normal. He became a happy dog; also a very handsome one, he was pure black Labrador. Valley's End has a castle on a hill, a river round it and a field between the two.  All the local dogs are exercised here; this is where Boris and Bhuna first met and where Boris instantly set about training the unruly Bhuna.  Bhuna's master was delighted; we met up frequently, one or the other of us taking both dogs out for long walks; they became inseparable. In fact, Bhuna frequently turned up in our garden on his own, having jumped over the garden gate; Boris was too well-behaved to leave his territory, but he was always ready to welcome Bhuna. The two dogs were more like boys than dogs.I said that this was going to be  a soppy story, it's going to get even soppier.On one of our long walks we went up into the woods above the valley. The dogs were roaming freely, both noses in the same hole, both of them tugging at the same fallen branch or chasing the same animal scent. They disappeared, came back, disappeared again.Until, about an hour into the walk, there was only Bhuna; at first we paid no attention, walking on, thinking Boris would turn up eventually.  Bhuna started to behave strangely, walking backward in front of us, stopping, looking at us, then walking behind us, stopping again. He did this several times. ending up behind us, following very slowly, standing still in the middle of the path, looking at us, then half turning,  looking  back over his shoulder.We finally got the message. Bhuna was telling us Boris was missing, he was in trouble.The moment we turned back, Bhuna made for the steeply wooded slope ascending above the path and started to climb, all the time making sure we were following, stopping every so often to let us catch him up, finally leading us to where Boris lay, trapped by a huge spike attached to a branch which had gone deep into his paw. There was no way that Boris could have limped down the hill on three legs, every move he made drove the spike deeper into his paw, with the branch dragging on it.As soon as we reached Boris, Bhuna stood to one side, then ran off, totally unconcerned again.Boris took no lasting harm; we managed to remove the spike, performed some first aid with spit and a handkerchief and slowly made our way back down the hill.  The Vet cleaned out the wound and very soon all was well.Boris died of cancer when he was eleven years old; until then the dogs remained staunch allies. Within the year we adopted Benno, another black Labrador, also a rescue dog. We all thought Bhuna and Benno could pick up where Bhuna and Boris had left off but Bhuna never took to Benno. The two of them growled at each other every time they met."},

Last Sunday's portrait was of the famous philosopher and academic Sir Isaiah Berlin, who was on the Board of Directors at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, during the 1980s.Seeing the photograph, the Scraper was reminded of the following story:-Sir Isaiah BerlinMembers of the Orchestra had been invited to a reception in the Crush Bar at the Opera House, where the Scraper and a colleague were engaged in conversation by Sir Isaiah. The name Stravinsky came up and prompted the great man to recall the occasion, some twenty years earlier, when the 50th anniversary of the first performance of the Rite Of Spring, in Paris in 1913, was being celebrated at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Pierre Monteux had conducted the premiere and his services had been secured to conduct the anniversary concert.Stravinsky, who had never admired Monteux, was invited to the celebration.Igor StravinskyStravinsky accepted.  He had no intention of attending the actual performance but he was willing to take a bow afterwards.He therefore contacted his old friend,  Sir Isaiah,  and asked him to obtain six tickets for that night's performance, at the Royal Opera House of 'The Marriage of Figaro', which customarily had three intervals. Stravinsky planned to leave during the third interval, jump into a waiting taxi and reach the Albert Hall just in time to take the applause.Unfortunately, this particular production provided for no more than a quick scene change before the last act, and when Stravinsky and his party rose to leave, the usherette rushed up and whispered urgently, \" Sir, there is no interval, you cannot leave your seats\".Stravinsky, undeterred, continued the exodus and, from his great height, looked down on the unfortunate usherette, and said loudly, \" We all have diarrhoea, we are leaving!\""},

Some village children would make their way into the farmers' orchards and pick a few apples or pears; we were all too small to do much damage and we usually only picked what we could eat. Generally speaking, we were only chased away after we had had enough time to fill a pocket or two. The big boys would share their pickings with the children who were too small to reach even the lowest branches of the fruit trees. Plums and cherries were inaccessible to all.Farms in the low-lying, wind-swept area of the Lower Rhine were built in a rectangular, enclosed  pattern,  barns, stores and cattle sheds were all part of the enclosure, with the farmhouse itself forming one side of the rectangle, usually in a prominent position facing the massive farm gates. These gates were only opened for vehicles and livestock, at all other times pedestrians used the ordinary, man- sized door cut into one side of the gates.Outside the main gate on one such farm, in the middle of the green in front of it, stood a magnificent old walnut tree. Generations of children must have eyed up this tree, boys measuring their climbing prowess against it. During these hard times  few farmers were generous; the owner of the walnut tree  however, was by all accounts, a particularly mean man, only ever willing to exchange any food produced on his farm for goods many times its monetary value.  Starving people from the towns came out into the villages to barter precious possessions for a slice of butter or a bag of potatoes.One autumn afternoon a group of boys decided to raid the walnut tree. Although I was very small I tagged along, to the disgust of all the boys, one of whom had been told to mind me for an hour. In those days we were usually left to roam the countryside, the adults had no idea what games children played. When we got to the farm the pedestrian gate was shut. The boys had come armed with sticks which they threw up into the lower branches of the tree, thereby dislodging the nuts, causing a small shower of the fruits to rain down on us. It was only a very short time after this that the farm dog, chained to his kennel in the farmyard,started his furious barking. A moment later, the small door in the big gate flew open, the dog bounding out with the farmer in hot pursuit. The farmer had unchained his vicious guard dog and set it on us. The boys scattered in all directions; I ran too, as fast as I could, which was not very fast at all and very soon the big dog was on me, baring his fangs, slavering and growling.Terrified, I screamed. The farmer, who had not expected to see so small a child, ordered the dog to stand back. He ran up to us, me and the dog, and reattached the chain. He was badly shaken himself; setting his dog on a group of children, the oldest of whom was no more than ten years old, was a very foolhardy thing to do, which he must have realized as soon as he saw us scatter. He picked me up, set me on my feet. I was crying and trembling in fear but otherwise unhurt. The boy who was my minder slunk back, the farmer berating both of us soundly, giving his anger free rein. He threatened to beat us and set the dog on us, should he ever catch us trying to steal from him again.The boys never took me on such expeditions again."},

The season of mists and mellow fruitfulness is near; I must go out and show my appreciation of the garden's efforts before the plants succumb to autumn's gentle touch.The mixed border is still colourful with Sidalcea (the prairie mallow),Japanese Anemonies, the pale mauve Phlox paniculata andthe yellow buttons of the herbaceous Phlomis in the front. The prostrate Clematis x jouiniana grows over a wall of ancient stone liberated through the ages from the ruins of the castle next door and covers an area of 4m in total, actually making it impossible to leave the garden through one of the side gates. It is covered in bunches of pale blue flowers during late August to early October, when I cut it right back to the base. This leaves a perfect area for growing spring bulbs, The emerging leaves of the clematis soon cover unsightly yellowing leaves while the spring flowers are dying back.This pinky/purple Phlox paniculata is a very common garden phlox, but itwill make a great show in late summer; I like my plants to earn their keep.Ligularia Desdemona will grow in damp shade. It is a great favourite of slugs and I grow mine in pots. I bring them on in a working area of the garden and dump them under trees in  what I grandly call the fernery when the first flower heads form.The deep yellow of the flowers brightens the gloomiest area. Clematis Abundance is a great favourite of mine. This is a picture of it growing out through the crown of a useless old damson tree.The tree is barren but it provides a perch for the garden birds that come tothe nearby feeders and the perfect frame for this clematis which does full justice to its name.

But I am back now and, although still a bit shaken, well enough to share this poem by Ted Hughes on a late August plant which is presently ubiquitous in the hedgerows and fields of the Shropshire Marches.ThistlesbyTed HughesAgainst the rubber tongues of cows and the hoeing hands of menThistles spike the summer airAnd crackle open under a blue-black pressure.Every one a revengeful burstOf resurrection, a grasped fistfulOf splintered weapons and Icelandic frost thrust upFrom the underground stain of a decayed Viking.They are like pale hair and the gutterals of dialect.Every one manages a plume of blood.Then they grow like men.Mown down, it is a feud. Their sons appearStiff with weapons, fighting back over he same ground.It is too amusing, one day after I wrote a paean of praise to the UK's National Health Service in the pages of Time Goes By I was once again the grateful recipient of its many splendid services. There is no need to go into great detail; let me just say, that on Saturday afternoon I had cause to ring for an ambulance. We live 30 miles from the nearest hospital, it is not a good idea to hang about waiting for the situation to improve; if in doubt, call the Service out. The local paramedic arrived within 7 minutes, the ambulance with a driver and a further highly trained and efficient paramedic within 16 minutes. After some preliminary tests and examinations these professionals decided that the patient (me, as it happens) should be taken to the hospital immediately.Having arrived at Accident and Emergency a full programme of assessment, tests, examinations and treatments  swung into action. Of course, it took time and for some the waiting between each course of action might have been tedious but I was glad that no effort or expense were spared to get to the bottom of things. The medics decided that I should stay in overnight, for observation. A boring night and morning of repeated tests, little sleep and hospital food followed. Test results proved negative and I was allowed home after lunch. Right to the end the Service was excellent, in order to spare my husband, who is somewhat elderly, the 60 mile round trip, I was taken home by car, free and gratis, on the NHS.We in the UK all know that the Service is creaking at the seams, for a variety of reasons, but I am very grateful to the NHS; My husband and I have had need of it a good few times in the past 20 years and it has never let us down."},
{"title": "A Moment of Transformation", "date": "Thursday 20 August 2009", "text": "The lower Rhine area of Germany is part of the North European Plain which stretches all the way from the Ural Mountains and the Russian steppes in the East to the Atlantic Ocean in the West. The landscape is almost featureless, flat, wide and fertile, with woods and lakes interspersed with verdant meadows and rich brown fields. It is a quiet landscape, an autumn landscape with high, racing clouds and wonderfully soft, white mists rising from the marshy ground where the Rhine has left his alluvial deposits for many centuries of shifting in his bed. Even today the river refuses to remain civilized, every Spring, when the snows in the Alps melt, he threatens to overflow and break his banks.The many old river beds remain today as brooks, small lakes and marshland; they have become a picturesque habitat, rich in wildlife. Rare waterfowl nest here, there are several nature reserves where flora and fauna are under protection. Part of the landscape are the many windmills;  whether the wind direction is East or West, it is a wind that blows unhindered, often furiously, driving the high clouds in front of it at a pace only seen in the plains. Nowadays the windmills are decorative only, but many are left standing and are periodically repaired as reminders of a different age.The roads marching through this landscape are dead straight, always lined with trees, often with tall poplars or oaks. Each and every road has a cycle path running alongside it and bicycles are the preferred method of transportation, even today. Cycling here is always a pleasure, whether you are battling against the wind or being speeded along by it.The tree most typical of the landscape is the pollarded willow. All pollarded willows here are protected by law, they are the symbol of the area.This rather lengthy introduction finally leads  me to my 'Moment of Transformation'. It was Bonnie of  Original Art Studio whose post under this heading brought the moment back to me. On my visits to the area of my birth, when my parents were still alive, the first thing I always did  was to lug the old bike out of the cellar and set off for a long ride, always to the same, old familiar places, to  pay homage.On one of these rides the wind was blowing furiously, dark, heavy clouds were racing high above me in the endless sky, the trees in the copses waving their branches in supplication and the poplars by the side of the road almost bent double; the land all around wide and flat and magnificent in its severity - and there was I, alone, not a soul to be seen anywhere, a few birds carried shrieking to the far off ocean - there was I, also carried before the wind on my bicycle, shouting at the top of my voice: I AM ALIVE, I AM ALIVE, I AM ALIVE, over and over and over again. A moment of true exultation, never again have I felt this intensity of being one with the elements, nature , my history and the history of this modest landscape;  with  myself as part of infinity."},

This one is in Peebles.Photo Jeremy WhiteEvery year in August the famous Edinburgh Festival of the Arts is held in Edinburgh. In 1957 the musician Harry Legge 'invented' the Rehearsal Orchestra, which has run each year since then during the same period.  Each section of this orchestra is led and coached by a professional player, and students, amateurs and young professionals explore a wide repertoire of music, far broader than they could hope to meet in their college or local orchestras.One of the most faithful summer students was Miss Macbeth, an elderly Scots lady, who was a violin teacher in Ayr. Wednesdays were half-days at the course and on one particular Wednesday afternoon Miss Macbeth decided she'd like a trip out of Edinburgh on one of the many sight-seeing coach tours on offer. The trip took her to many of the wonderful Scottish sites and she enjoyed herself tremendously. Until they came to a ruined castle  which the tour guide introduced as \" .....and this is the castle of the notorious murderer, Macbeth\". Whereupon little Miss Macbeth rose from her seat, bristling with indignation, and replied, in her finest lady-like accents, \"Sir, I'll thank you to speak civilly of my ancestor\".The last, but by no means least, word goes to the Bard himself, who took the story of Macbeth and turned it into fiction. But what fiction!From MacbethAct V Scene vTomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow,Creeps in this petty face from day to day, To the last syllable of recorded time;And all our yesterdays have lighted foolsThe way to dusty death.

{"title": "Sunday Quotation", "date": "Sunday 9 August 2009", "text": "Vegetable Beautyby Gertrude Jekyll, 1900Getrude Jekyll's ideas about gardening were on a much grander scale than anything the modern gardener with his small plot could ever achieve. The lucky few might have an allotment for growing  vegetables but these are hard to come by and every council has long waiting lists for them. To make matters worse, many former allotments are under threat with councils wanting to sell them to developers for hard cash to fill their depleted coffers.In my little town this haven still survives,  hidden round the back of the ancient almshouses and chapel and here, together with Mrs. Jekyll's words are a few pictures of the results of hard work done by the allotment holders. I have often thought what a beautiful bit of summer gardening one could do, mainly planted with things usually grown in the kitchen garden only, and filling up spaces with quickly-grown flowering plants.                                                                                   For climbers there could be the Gourds and Marrows and Runner-Beans; for splendour of port and beauty of foliage, Globe Artichokes and Sea-kale, one of the grandest of blue-leaved plants. Horse-radish also makes handsome tufts of its vigorous deep-green leaves, and Rhubarb is one of the grandest of large-leaved plants.Or if the garden were in shape a double square, the further portion being given to vegetables why not have a bold planting of these grand things as a division between the two, and behind them a nine-foot high foliage-screen of Jerusalem Artichoke.This Artichoke, closely allied to our perennial Sunflowers, is also a capital thing for a partition screen; a bed of it two or three-feet wide is a complete protection through the summer and to the latest autumn."},

In seven words, nouns or adjectives. Just off the top of your head, don't think about it\".Beloved stops to think.\"What do you mean, what do I think you're like? You're fine, actually, you're quite nice\". (Note the qualifying 'quite'.)\"That's already no good, you left too long a gap, you were meant to react spontaneously\".Then comes the interrogation:\"Well, what DO you mean, why are you asking? I can't tell you what you're like, don't you knowwhat you're like? Anyway (slightly apprehensive hesitation here), I wasn't aware there were any major questions that needed asking? Everything okay, is it?\"We were never going to get anywhere this way. \"Oh, for goodness' sake, there's this thing doing the Purplecoo rounds and I'm to describe myself in seven words and I thought you might be able to come up with one or two things; you're not usually this slow with the \"you know you are very.......... kind of remark\".\"Sorrreee\", Beloved says.Disappointed, I trot off, up the stairs, to my study.Within five minutes I hear heavy steps lumbering up the stairs, Benno first (he usually overtakes Beloved half way up), Beloved next. Both come into my study, Benno lies down for a long session.Beloved speaks.\"You are open and warm, at least to a husband\", (again, note the qualification), \"you are a good, tender wife BUT, also likely to withdraw quickly, if you feel the need\". Golly, that man knows how to hedge his bets. Still, I accept that he means well.He had come to a decision about my character; considering that describing any human being in seven words cannot be more than superficial,  here are his (and my) Big Seven:Independent, in every sense of the word. Never in my adult life have I followed anyone or any cause blindly, never have I surrendered independence of spirit  in any situation, although it might have been pragmatic to do so. Resilient; I've had to be to survive. I have had a very difficult life for long stretches and when it finally got better and really quite easy, I fell ill; three times I jumped off the grim reapers shovel.Sensible; I wish I could be fluffy and silly and trivial and  helpless and all things \"little-woman-ish\", but in spite of occasionally trying my best, nobody has ever bought it.Intelligent; again, it comes with the territory, I can't imagine what life might have been like without it. Pretty dire, I guess. Blunt; It is a long time since I told myself any lies; I dislike people who do so. Facing facts is very important to me, without knowledge there can be neither solution nor resolution. I will always excuse telling white lies to and about others - never wanting to hurt anyone - but that's as far as I'll go. Under this heading I would also include being unable to bear fools lightly; I'll be kind to the foolish one but I'll certainly not make a friend of him/her and try to avoid contact.Loyal; very important. If you are my friend you can rely on me, in any or all situations. If you need help, you will have mine. I will not betray you. Disloyalty I consider to be one of the deadly sins.Melancholic; this is something I've laboured under all my life. I enjoy laughter as much as anybody but melancholia is my default state of mind. I'll go for the melancholic poet, the thoughtful read, the soulful music, the sunset rather than the sunrise, the autumn rather than high summer, the racing cloud rather than the cloudless sky, the deep wood rather than the sunny meadow, the rocky shore rather than the sandy beach."},

{"title": "Into the Void", "date": "Wednesday 22 July 2009", "text": "Emptinessphoto Stanislas Toma, Prague 1982I had a friend.My friend's body is still here, but Joan is no longer with us. Alzheimer's disease took her away from me.Years ago Joan's once  brilliant brain began to shut down, gradually losing the ability to perform the most basic tasks; she gradually forgot the names of her friends, gradually she stopped to recognize us.The BBC had a small news item yesterday, towards the end of the news, about a group of scientists calling for a three-fold increase in funding into research into dementia in the UK, urging the government to end years of underfunding for research into the debilitating disease.Anyone can develop dementia.Seven hundred thousand people in the UK now live with dementia, and the figure is going up fast. It is estimated that the cost of treating and caring for people with dementia is £17bn a year - more than the cost of heart disease, stroke and cancer combined.When we first moved here Joan was the first person to take me under her wing. I was taking a bag of household rubbish to the bin at the end of the drive, by the road, and this bright little lady, with a collie on a lead in tow, came towards me, waving her walking stick at me and hailing me. As we stood chatting, she pointed her stick at the sky above us; she had noticed a buzzard circling and so started this townie's introduction into the wonders of life in the countryside.Joan and I became friends.Her illness manifested itself in small ways at first, hardly noticeable. She forgot things, words mostly; but we all do that as we get older. It's what we call \"having a senior moment\". Only Joan's senior moments became more and more frequent until there was no question that she was suffering from the onset of dementia.Joan loved music. She still came to visit me occasionally and, on one occasion, before she had fully succumbed to the disease, when she still had a lucid moment or two, we decided to listen to Schubert's two cello Quintett Opus 163, a  sublime piece of music. We sat side by side on the sofa, both silent, both listening intently. During the Adagio I happened to look across at her, wanting to share the moment, and saw that tears were running down her cheeks, unchecked.On impulse, I took her hand in mine; she turned to me; the pain and despair in her eyes were so great that I too felt the tears starting up; the moment was almost unbearably poignant. This was the last time our spirits connected.I learned today that Joan has now \"forgotten\" how to walk, her doctor's words. not mine.The void has truly claimed her."},

{"title": "Summer 1945  -  Food and the Lack of it", "date": "Saturday 18 July 2009", "text": "It is over a month ago since I last posted on Reminiscences. Those days have been history now for so long, and lack of food, for me, today, is an unimaginable concept. Summoning up  that world requires a deliberate effort of will; how much of it is memory and how much family lore, I couldn't say.The situation in '45 was still bearable. In the lower Rhine area the war ended in March and in spite of huge obstacles farmers were able to till the land, to sow and plant, to tend the remaining cattle. By late summer the hedgerows were full of free food, there were berries and tree fruit to pick and the harvest in the fields was looking good.Shortages were not as acute then as they were to become later, in the winter of 1946/1947. Refugees from the East were still just trickling in, the exodus was only just beginning. The villagers stormed the Wehrmacht food depots and helped themselves until the Americans impounded the stores, declaring them \"war booty\". They had, however, already begun to secure the supply of flour to bakers and bread was available. The supply of grain from the East, Germany's \"Granary\" had dried up completely, the East was now in Russian hands.By August, the harvest was in full swing, turnips, potatoes, cereals and cabbage being the main crops of the area. Every able-bodied male was commandeered to help; there were hardly any tractors or other field machinery, the lack of fuel saw to that. Old men who knew how to handle tools like  sickles were standing in the fields, mowing the corn.Those who had no direct access to crops other than through the meagre supplies available on ration cards were dependent on the fields being freed for gleaning after the harvest proper. The villagers knew which field would be harvested on a particular day. Adults and children turned up long before the last horse-drawn cart had left, lined up along the field edge, awaiting the signal to start, which was usually just a wave of the arm as the farmer and his helpers followed the carts off the field at the other end.My parents lined up with the rest of the villagers, with me beside them. In retrospect, I feel that  I enjoyed these \"outings\", particularly in the potato fields. The days were hot, the atmosphere was not exactly jolly but calm and friendly; everyone was in the same boat, intent on gathering as many stray potatoes as they could find. You stayed in your row, hoed and grubbed in the freshly turned soil and dragged a basket or potato sack behind you. As with stealing coal later on in the winter, the rule was that you did not help yourself to  another person's loot. On rare occasions only half the potato field had been harvested before the farmer gave the signal freeing the cleared half for gleaning. I was very small, to keep me safe and keep an eye on me while slowly traversing the field on their knees, my parents had me crawling between them and the edge of the field which was to be harvested the next day, a field still full of large, healthy potato plants, some of them taller than me. In my eagerness to help, my little hands strayed more than once into the lush growth next to me, coming up with clumps of potatoes.\"Look\", I shouted, \"I have found plenty here\". \"Come away from there\";  my father was angry with me and I didn't understand why, after all, we were there to gather potatoes and I had just found a large supply of them. It had happened before, somebody getting too close to a row of plants had been barred from gleaning. Father did not want this to happen to us. Farmers were very suspicious, they gave nothing away unless you had goods in exchange for food.It was much harder to collect grain. The stubble was sharp and painful and you could easily tear and scratch your knees until they bled. Being very small, I managed to stay in the gap between two rows, but even then I often cried out when a vicious stalk dug into my leg.  I can see puddles of grain lying between the rows of stubble even now, neat little heaps, or sometimes little streams of grain, ready to be scooped up with bare hands.Gleaning was backbreaking work for the adults, for whom it would have been a matter of survival. The gravity of the situation went straight over the head of a child; for me it would have been a game, a game of hunting for food, being in a competition to see who could gather the most."},

This is provided by a layer of sticky mucus over their body, giving slugs their characteristic sliminess. Slugs are rarely seen during the day, they need the cool of the night to come out and play.And this is the playground they leave behind in the morning:But there is another side to slugs.Watch and be amazed!

{"title": "The Party Season", "date": "Thursday 9 July 2009", "text": "Twice a year, in summer and winter, for about six weeks each time, people in the valley in and around our little town feel the party spirit come upon them. Well, the summer party season is well and truly with us and invitations are coming in thick and fast.Not all of them are big dos, there are drinks parties, tea parties, select little dinner parties for four, six or eight (rarely more, because nobody nowadays has a dining table, much less a dining room, big enough to seat ten or more), huge outdoor barbecues, where you had better bring a coat against the evening chill and a cushion to sit on - as chairs and benches have been waiting outside all day, they have probably been rained on.Barbecue fare is best sampled on a full stomach - always eat something at home first!Chargrilled food can play havoc with your digestion. In order not to look a spoilsport you can always fill your plate with plain boiled rice salad, green lettuce and white bread rolls; both have invariably been available at any barbecue I have ever attended. The other possibility is that your host has forgotten to light the coals in good time - this often happens at barbecues in aid of something or other, where several men are in charge of joint proceedings - which means that you get no food for hours or that your sausages are raw inside.Drinks parties are slightly more civilized, your considerate hosts have provided room inside, where the guests can take shelter from sudden downpours. This is England, after all, there is usually a shower at least once a day. Drinks parties are noisy affairs, they usually happen before dinner, between six and eight in the evening, unless they are at that ungodly time of Sunday morning, before lunch.  There's not much point in finding a seat, everyone is standing around and talking busily; if you are sitting down all that talk happens above your head and you are left out.Come to think of it, maybe that is not such a bad choice after all. If you choose a nice, comfy seat anywhere near the \"nibbles\" table you could nick all the juiciest olives and unbroken cheese straws. And have a nap. Drinking before lunch or dinner can be quite hazardous.Cosiest of all are the tea parties, they are usually held inside; bees and wasps and other insects all love the smell and taste of strawberry cream teas and cakes and scones as much as some humans do and are therefore best excluded.Tea parties are the preferred option for the older generation; they like to get back to their comfortable sitting rooms in good time for the evening news and maybe a favourite soap opera. Besides, all that starch does make one feel rather drowsy.This leaves the dinner party, which can last for many hours, until late into the night, if you are lucky or maybe unlucky, depending on how much you are enjoying the occasion. At one recent such party I came home with face cramp from many hours of determined smiling. The hosts themselves are excellent people, who provide delicious food and dispense drink with a liberal hand. The problem was that one of the guests felt obliged to entertain the party, ably encouraged by his wife. All I remember now is a joke the man told:A barber complained that making a living from cutting hair in these days of the credit crunchwas getting ever more difficult. He was therefore contemplating going into the hedge trimming business as a sideline.The man swore blind it's a true story. Yes, well.At another recent dinner party the host read his own poetry and the hostess played Mozart on the piano, followed by Irving Berlin songs which were sung by a lady guest. Actually, you may not believe this, but I really enjoyed that party.It is rather bad form to accept hospitality and not return it. My turn next.photo Huub Koch Beweging 1984"},
{"title": "And Again : The Scraper's Diary, Sunday Morning", "date": "Wednesday 8 July 2009", "text": "Well, I did it, I got drunk.But whenever I achieve a sudden ambition like that, I wish afterwards that I had not.Perhaps that should be a lesson to me.I'm sober again now, but last night  -  phew!Mike and I went into the beer bar at 8.15;  the party was not there, but a friendly bombardier invited us to help him drink some of the dozen or so glasses that were on the table. He had already emptied twenty. We accepted.Here let me say that German glasses hold more than a half pint, and that the beer, which is chemical beer, is not so innocuous as it looks and tastes.After four glasses, I lost count, and began to feel a little merry. My eyes needed reminding to focus on anyone, when I walked out, my legs needed coercing to obey me.The waitress came up. I gave her a shilling and she brought back six more glasses, and then they stopped serving.We drank on. I emptied about thirteen glasses, Mike about eight. By this time I was thoroughly, uproariously drunk. I could not stand straight. Every time I put my foot down the floor jumped up to meet it. Mike was unsteady on his pins too, and as he grew drunker, so an episode in the Y.M.C.A. grew funnier to him (the microphone fell off the stage), and he kept remembering it, and going into fits of laughter.The place was nearly empty, and the attendants were urging us to leave; we emptied the last glasses, and I suddenly realized that I was going to be sick, so I lurched outside and vomited copiously. I felt much better then, and managed to walk back to the billet.Soon after I reentered our room, I realized that I wanted to be sick again, so I opened the window and leaned out. I spewed the rest of the beer, and kept on retching long after my stomach was empty. Mike decided, ridiculously, to go for a walk, so he went. Fifteen minutes later, when he staggered back, I was still leaning out of the window, but in the meantime I had collapsed dizzily onto a bed and then gone to the window again.With Mike's aid I staggered, almost unconscious, to the lavatory, where I stayed for fifteen minutes and emptied my stomach again and again. Then Mike helped me back again.Don't imagine that he was sober, he was wimbling all over the place, but was in a better state than me.Between us, we got me to bed, and I immediately fell sound asleep. My last words  (so they say)were \"Never again\".When I was woken, after over eight hours deep slumber, I felt perfectly normal, with no hangover.I have a dim recollection of reassuring Mike that a cigarette he put down was really going round and round, and also of the feeling that nothing was worth while. I wanted to die, my stomach and head were performing the most complicated rhumba, and my eyes seemed to be rolling in a complete circle.Never again, Never, never again."},

I've been invited to a farewell party by a bloke who is demobbed on Monday and I think I'll go and get drunk. Beer (weak) is 3d a pint.I feel like getting drunk.It snowed last night. Evening.This afternoon Mike, Len and I walked round Dortmund. I found a philatelic shop and bought two hundred marks worth of stamps for fifty cigarettes.We went into a German Kaffeehaus and ordered coffee. I forced myself to drink mine, to keep up appearances, - for the Germans were watching us, - but I was spitting for an hour afterwards, and even now, after ten, I can still taste it, - there was certainly no coffee in it. It was a dark green-brown fluid with  specks of some black stuff in the bottom of the cup. No milk, no sugar, it was probably ground acorns, and the taste bore no relation to anything I have ever drunk. If that is what the Germans drink, I pity them. Mike and Len left theirs after one sip.We walked through some deserted side streets on our way back, all around us piles of brick lay tragically, the view was limited all round by occasional broken walls that either tapered to a precarious chimney, or bore great cracks with sublime indifference. Rubble and cement covered the roads in uneven piles to a depth of up to three feet, and obviously no effort had been made to clear them away or to demolish any of the tottering, dangerous wrecks that were once proud homes or great stores. No one seems to worry, an air of lethargy is everywhere. Somehow, though in the middle of life, and an interesting adventure (for a sentimentalist can make Romance of nearly anything) I long to be in England and to see Spring coming down English valleys and English lanes.I feel that I suddenly understand the row of dots in the travel books: \"England.......\""},

{"title": "Open Gardens 2009", "date": "Monday 29 June 2009", "text": "It's over, we've done it. The Gardens Open weekend in aid of Church Funds has been and gone.It's been a triumph, even if I say so myself! I may open the garden again in autumn but it will be a much smaller affair, on a much more modest scale.For two days the weather has behaved itself, the public appeared in their  many hundreds, there have been no accidents, dogs and children were kept under control and a lot of money was raised. Tonight there's the social evening for the garden owners and all helpers on the day and that'll be that for another year.Gardener and I were still working until an hour before \"gates open\" on Saturday. We had forgotten to sweep the entrances, chop back some of the verdant growth on the walls leading up to the gates which might have impeded access a little (can't have that!) and arranged several trays with plants for sale. On these occasions I sell surplus plants, plants which I have divided, grown from cuttings or simply collected where they have self sown and potted up throughout the year.  It's another way of making money. Gardener gave the lawn a final trim, neatened the edges and helped me stow away all tools. He left, I had a quick shower, bolted down a bite of sandwich and awaited two o'clock.We have two entrances, we therefore need help welcoming people and taking their money. We had barely set out our chairs and a table each, tickets, programmes, maps and a plastic box to hold the cash when the first visitors arrived at the bottom end of the garden. From now on it was all systems go. Because I am the gardener, designer, expert, and all round boss-in-charge of our plot, scraper and the helpers sent all enquiries my way which meant I was on my feet for four hours solid; my advice to anybody else in such a situation is \"NEVER set yourself up as the know-all, you'll pay dearly\".  As in other years, visitors were pleasant, some exceptionally so. I always like the ones who are willing to talk about plants and gardens best. Groups of elderly ladies often belong in that category. Unfortunately, they tend to recognize an unusual plant and invariably ask its name; invariably, my mind goes blank at precisely that moment; expert, me? The ones I like least are the \"tickers off\". They have their programme always available, ready to tick off another garden. One such gentleman, on his own, in sturdy walking boots, his hold-all strap slung across his chest, rucking up his shirt, came marching up the long drive towards me; he looked neither left nor right, thereby missing a wide border of mixed flowering shrubs, many roses in full bloom and two very beautiful Japanese acers  -  you can tell how proud I am of that border. I greeted him and gently reminded him that he had come to see a garden and rushing through at his speed surely made that quite impossible? \"Six more to go\",  he said, tapping the programme in his hand with a pencil. There are single visitors who have all the time in the world and are only too happy if you involve them in a chat. Perhaps they come because they love gardens and don't have much of a plot themselves, perhaps they are lonely and have come for a pleasant afternoon out with tea and cake in the Church Hall on the way; they will stop and discuss the relative merits of various herbs, perhaps a purple thyme compared to a silver or golden thyme. Because they know their subject they are never boring.There are bores, of course; I got waylaid by a couple who started to tell me about a pond they had stocked with koi carp which had all got eaten by escaped mink. Personally, I dislike koi carp, can't see the point of them, but that need not deter other people from being carp aficionados. It seemed they had taken the loss very hard indeed, the fish had had names; I am not sure they didn't say the fish came when called, but I had stopped listening by then; I must have had the life history of each fish several times; luckily my helper was more sympathetic to the bereaved couple, I handed them over to her and made my excuses.Amongst the nicest visitors was an American couple, here on holiday, Stuart and Michelle from California. Michelle loved so many of my plants she soon ran out of paper to jot down their names. There will shortly be a variegated maple somewhere in a front yard in San Diego. We discussed which plants would survive the Californian climate and decided that a cistus would probably fit the bill; cistuses (rock roses) like it hot and dryish. Michelle and Stuart both fell in love with the roses, particularly \"Dublin Bay\", the rose at the top of the post. They stayed for what seemed a very long time and I enjoyed every minute of it. They were absolute sweeties. Stuart noted down my email address, I have been promised news of any plants they try to grow back home.Finally, what is most gratifying, is the fulsome praise some visitors bestow on the garden. Their appreciation is what makes all the hard work worthwhile."},

Perhaps that is one thing they lost in defeat.The towns are largely reduced to rubble. I am already used to seeing whole blocks of buildings crumbled to mounds of broken bricks and twisted girders - for nowhere has the damage been repaired or tidied up - but I cannot exult in this devastation. Many of my companions gloat over the destruction and take a vengeful pleasure in seeing cities that once stood. Probably, I would exult with them if I could feel an air of Germany about, but I cannot. I was in London throughout the blitz and the V-bombs, but I only feel a cold pity when I see the wreck of the Rhineland, and a further despair at human nature.Duesseldorf, Hamm, Hamburg, Hannover, Cologne, Wuppertal, Moenchen-Gladbach, Dortmund, - all are in ruins, with perhaps one home where twenty stood before, one shop in a parade. The Autobahn from Bad Oeynhausen to Duesseldorf crosses many bridges. Perhaps one in three of these is the same bridge as it was before the war.Then there are the people.Walking down any street you would not think that the folk you see are underfed or underclothed. They seem healthy and active although their faces have a strange pallor. The girls, particularly, are strong and attractive, and their faces bear no sign of the cruelty that is supposed to be inherent in them.We stood by the Rhine one morning and watched parents and children walking by. Some of the children were thin and looked rickety, but all were well-dressed in warm wools and furs. Their fathers looked prosperous, their mothers contented.However, there is the other side of the picture.The thin children begging by the trains, the two old gentlemen I saw in the main road rummaging in dustbins, with a pitiful look of pride on their faces, - and, of course, the black market.I doubt if anyone can explain the black market, for it disobeys all the rules of economics.German people bring watches, irons, clothes, tablecloths and such non-essentials down to dark streets in the towns. Soldiers with stocks of cigarettes, chocolate and soap arrive, and soon bartering is in full swing. One can usually beat a German down to well below his first price, but they are not desperate, they give nothing away.(In camp I maintain that when you give a German ten cigarettes, you give him one shilling and twopence. Bernard maintains that you give him forty marks. Actually, it must be a compromise.)The people in the black market look well-fed, their clothes are not shabby. They are neat and proper, and yet they descend to a degrading trade, and forget all pride. Why ?Probably for the same reason that girls sell themselves for a bar of chocolate and a few biscuits.Another thing is that I have seen no old people or cripples or folk anyhow maimed yet in Germany.And yet they all look well-fed and fairly happy.I have a feeling that, as a country, the Rhineland is slipping into a dangerous lethargy. (Vide the rubble-covered pavements.)And the soldiers, our boys, don't give a damn, - or ninety-nine percent of them don't - what happens to Germany. They would swindle the country as cheerfully as they cheat her people. They look after themselves all the time, and if that involves forgetting all rules of courtesy and acts of kindness, - or even if it entails stealing food from a starving man, well, no matter, they've been hard up themselves all through the war, and the temptation to get their own back is too great.It's an ugly business.Of course, coming over, as we did, on a boat with several hundred German repatriates, and having, as many of us have, some years to serve, and the war having been over for nearly two years, the irony of it all is too great for even soldiers to miss, and they feel they have some excuse.It's an ugly business.o-o-o-o-oToday I had a premonition of Spring.It's been raining all day, and the entire sky is masked by Army blankets of dirty cloud. The streets are wet, the places boring. And yet I had a premonition of Spring.It happened at tea-time. I thought for a minute that the jam was lemon-curd, and with the taste, my mind was suddenly filled with an old nostalgic longing, a wistful emptiness for home and England and sunshine, for the faces I know and love, and for the comfort of freedom. I felt those old, nameless urges for companionship that every year flood my veins as the green shoots roll through the stretching land. I heard in my heart a singing that was all the sweetest sentimental ballads, and I knew that Spring had caught up with me, and had touched my weakening spine with her thrilling fingers. I heard the birds and saw clear streams of crystal water laughing over the shallows. I felt the kiss of the sun on my face and my soul cried out in an ecstasy of unworthiness, knowing not how to bear any more beauty.And then I realized that it was jam after all, and I knew that it was raining outside, and that it was still winter."},

{"title": "Summer 1945  -  Food and the Lack of it", "date": "Monday 8 June 2009", "text": "Don't you just hate grocery shopping, the ordinary kind of supermarket shopping; not shopping for special and particular meals, meals to be shared with friends, meals for parties and family occasions, but the everyday \"catering\" kind of meals, the repetitive, boring meals. The \"what on earth am I going to cook today\" kind of meals. Queueing is another pet hate. There's usually a queue at the deli counter and you stand there with your ticket, waiting for your turn, keeping a very close eye out for shoppers trying to jump the queue. In the summer of '45 things were rather different.The cupboards were more or less bare, the meagre rations weren't enough to keep body and soul together and the shops had great difficulties providing the staples. There was milk and the bakers were given flour to bake bread, often supplemented from US army rations. Farmers had been able to till the land with the help of every old man and young boy in the village who wasn't needed elsewhere, clearing rubble, filling defensive ditches or dismantling military structures.But the harvest was months off; everybody was waiting for potatoes, cereal and cabbage, the main crops of the area. As I have already described in the last post on the time, women and children went out daily to gather anything edible they could find in hedgerows, field edges and woods.There was almost no meat or fat. On several occasions, there were rumours of a delivery of fish to the fishmonger's. The first people lined up at daybreak, waiting for the shop to open, only to be told that there had been no transport available that day and that the fish had gone elsewhere. Another time the fish had arrived but the queue was so long that it was a question of first come first served and people at the tail end of the queue went home empty handed.Typical meals mother cooked for us were a thick, unsweetened rice pudding sprinkled with nutmeg, a  buttermilk barley broth with prunes, or dumplings made out of flour and yeast and water. Even during the war mother preserved and bottled fruit and vegetables which were kept in the cellar and at that time we still had shelves  with a few jars of last summer's bottled plums which made the dumplings palatable. There were green beans, preserved in salt, which had to be soaked in clear water before they could be cooked. Sauerkraut was another staple of the area and every harvest time the  housewife bought a dozen or so heads of the large white cabbage and made her own Sauerkraut, which was kept in an earthenware crock in the cellar. And then there was the absolute treasure of the cellar, worth more than rubies to a hungry household, the Einkellerungskartoffeln, potatoes for storing over the winter. If you had potatoes left over, you were rich. By now, last year's potatoes were dry and wrinkled and sprouting; in ordinary times they would be fed to pigs. These were no ordinary times and even the shrunken tuber could be mashed with carrots, cabbage or beans to make a meal. We also had a dish called Himmel und Erde, heaven and earth, which was potatoes mashed with last year's stored apples.By late summer the harvest began, I learned the art of gleanings and to hack for potatoes."},

{"title": "Disgraceful Behaviour", "date": "Thursday 4 June 2009", "text": "When did I get to be old enough to nod off during a performance in the theatre?The scraper and I went to see Michael Frayn's comedy \"Alphabetical Order\". The play is a two acter about a chaotic newspaper library which is transformed into a place of almost painful order; the play finishes with the announcement that the newspaper is about to fold and the staff deciding to attempt a take-over.Michael Frayn is a very funny and clever playwright, humourist and novelist; his columns for the Guardian were highly amusing and satirical. He has also written serious plays; \"Copenhagen\" was a fascinating work.\"Alphabetical Order\" was one of his early efforts, probably far more relevant to the time it was written, after all, newspaper libraries and paper archives no longer exist. One click of a key will conjure up all the information you might be after. Still, the script is sharp, fast-paced, clever and funny enough to chuckle along.So really, I have no excuse for what happened. Except, except......This was an afternoon performance, after a generous lunch and a glass of wine (always a risky thing for me, drinking wine with lunch) and instead of the expectant buzz that comes from an audience which is alert  and looking forward to an evening's entertainment, this was more of a coach party outing, with  an elderly audience, people who might be ready for a snooze after lunch on an ordinary day ( like me), creating a soporific atmosphere rather than an electrifying one.So there I was, gently nodding off about half way into the first act - the sort of nodding off where you can still hear everything that is being said, albeit from a great distance, but the words don't really make sense and, actually, you'd prefer them to stop and let you sink into a peaceful slumber for just a little while. I woke up with a start when the scraper laughed out loud; I sneaked a guilty look at the occupant of the seat on my other side: had she noticed my disgrace? Far from it;  the lady's head had sunk on to her chest and she was breathing softly and regularly, giving a little puff at the end of each breath."},

Like most bloggers I've come across, I am shy and retiring and not at all willing to talk about myself. Apparently, there are rules attached:-  Respond and rework-  answer questions on your blog-  replace one question, and-  tag three other blogs.Questions first.  I can't believe that a) I am doing this, and                                  b) I am actually thinking about the answers!1.  If one song were to describe your life, what song would it be ?    A different song for different periods of my life; at the moment I would go with Paul Simon's     \"Yesterday, it was my birthday, I hung one more year on the line, but I'm having a good time   2.  Which item of clothing do you wear most?            knickers      3.  When did you get up today?       8am4.  Last thing you bought?     a digital satellite box to receive Central European TV channels here in the UK5.  What are you listening to?      the lyrical, melodious, mellifluous tones of a blackbird sitting on the edge       of the roof outside my window, which is wide open. It's 2.30 in the afternoon and I've      fled indoors to escape from the unseasonal heat.6.  If you were a God or a Goddess, who would you be?     I'd love to say Baldur, the God of light and harmony, but it'd probably have to be      grumpy old Thor, the God of thunder and black moods. (Oh dear, really? maybe not)7.  Favourite holiday spot?     The Auditorium of the National Theatre/The Royal Opera House      8.  What are you reading right now?      Just finished the last thriller/novel/philosophical treatise by Kate Atkinson       \"When Will There Be Good News\". I have tremendously enjoyed all of her books so far.9.  Favourite Film?     For a few years now I've only chosen to watch rubbish, hence \"Four Weddings and a      Funeral\"    (Hey, Francessa, I loved Wim Wenders' \" Wings of Desire\" too)10.  First spring thing?       Get out there and start pruning.11.  Funniest thing you saw in your life?       The face of George Bush at the Inauguration Ceremony of Barack Obama.12.  Who's your hero/heroine?        Don't have one, we all have feet of clay, some more brittle than others. Having said that,         I admire people who overcome the most horrendous obstacles to do good, like        Helen Keller.13.  Share some wisdom?       Don't beat yourself up about things you cannot change and forgive yourself for mistakes        you made in the past; after all, you (probably) did your best.14. If you were a tree, what tree would you be?      A willow, I can bend.15.  Fictitious characters who made a lasting impression on you?       That's easy! My favourite speech by any character ever is Polonius' farewell to Laertes  in        Act I, Scene III of Hamlet and my favourite bit out of that speech is the quotation at the top        of my blog.            16.  Four words to describe you?              Knows what she wants.17.  Why blog?       The more bloggers there are, talking to each other, making friends, getting to know each        other, the more people there will be who realize that we are all the same under the skin;       it might even be a small step towards peace among men."},

She also told me to wrap it in a cotton cloth filled with soda crystals and keep this on overnight. Well, I wouldn't have believed it, but it worked; the cloth was damp in the morning, the soda had solidified and the swelling was reduced considerably.  I can definitely recommend the procedure.Just to be sure I had done no lasting harm I popped into the surgery.

The other dozen blokes went out.Back at the barracks a pontoon school started operations. Being fairly hard up, I stayed out, and, as the stakes rose, I grew more thankful for my impecuniosity. I went to bed at 2.15, and the school went to another room, where they played until 7.30 a.m. One chap lost £8, another about £5.At three, the dance band returned from the officer's mess. Jock, who is in my room, was rolling drunk, and Harry and Ginger put him to bed.We woke this morning at ten, with bad headaches and tempers.About half an hour after the lights went out, I got a terrible fit of coughing. I couldn't stop and was very nearly sick on the spot. My eyes and nose were streaming; however, it passed.Today, no duty for myself and Mike, so we wandered through Dortmund with Len. It is terribly devastated. Words cannot convey the devastation.We went into a shop where Len saw a cushion cover he wanted. He picked it up, and an assistant approached.\"Sprechen Sie Deutsch,\" she said. Len looked dumb.\"Parlez-vous Français\", she said. Len shook his head.\"Do you speak English\", she said. Len said \"Yes\", and \"How much is this?\"o-o-o-o-oI've been over here a week now, and I want to attempt to give my impressions of Germany, before I realize how wrong I am. Naturally I speak only of the Rhineland as seen through a bad soldier's eyes, but they are quite compassionate eyes, and human.Strange as it may seem, the first strange thing to me in Germany is that traffic keeps to the right. To that, I cannot accustom myself.Somehow, in my innocent, untravelled and untrammelled mind, I thought that this trip would be a great adventure, seeing new places and new faces, and finding strange things and long-dreamt romance around the corner.

Look away now, if ranting doesn't light your candle.Recently, I read an article in the paper on the lengths some people go to to alter their appearance, for the sake of vanity. Obviously, I know it's nothing new and has been going on for quite some time now, has almost become commonplace and routine. I also realize, that it is a blessing for people who have undergone traumatic events resulting in serious physical and facial disfigurement; surgery can change their lives for the better, give them back what they have lost.However, this article dealt only with vanity. We live in a world which iconizes and celebrates youth, westernized, caucasian youth, at that.  The pursuit of body improvement is a global industry  now worth $160bn a year. Hair straightening, skin lightening, diet programs, body building are only the foothills of \"physical improvement\", hardly worth a mention. In Africa, the use of hair straightening products is widespread. Surgical procedures such as nose jobs are widely carried out in the near and far east, Tehran apparently being the world capital for rhinoplasty, while the Chinese go in for nose implants. We are brainwashing ourselves to believe that we can only be attractive and lovable if we have bigger noses, smaller noses, bigger boobs, smaller boobs, a flatter stomach, western eyes, straight hair, curly hair, blond hair, tighter skin.The photos in this article are too gruesome to reproduce here; I also wouldn't want to scare anybody witless. You know of people in the public eye, actors, socialites, with their wind-tunnel-faces, \"having work done\", but so far, I have not visualized what this actually entails. However, seeing the flaps of bleeding skin being lifted, stretched, pulled, cut and sewn up, made me gag. So, my good-looking days, my pretty, youthful days days are behind me; life and the years have left their mark on my face; childbearing and illness have taken the zing and spring out of my body; so what? Although surgery is not for me,  I will always defend your right to being chopped up, nipped, tucked and reassembled, if you so desire; however, my suggestion would be: have the lobotomy first."},

The worst meal I have had here was the equal to the best I have had at Larkhill. Moreover, the cookhouses are scrupulously clean, and smell-less.Moreover, he never has to queue for his food.Moreover, he is waited on by German men and sometimes, pretty women.The barrracks here are all brick and centrally heated.Moreover, they often have hot water.Moreover, there are adequate wash-places and baths, and lavatories.Moreover, the beds are all sprung.Moreover, there are often German girls to clean the room and press his suits.A soldier here can buy 75 cigarettes a week at 8d for twenty.Moreover, his sweet ration is greater than ours.Moreover, he gets 50 cigarettes a week free.He can buy far more in his canteens and Naafis than we can in our shops.He has all the facilities of the Black Market at his disposal - and these are terrific.And now he has the R.A.

You can tell, I love the stuff? Sure, I do. There's nothing more satisfying than deeply covering a bed in it, and myself in the process. The plants positively sigh in ecstasy.Gardener regularly turns the heaps for me; it is rather hard work. Unfortunately, he tends to overfill the bags, once the compost is ready, making it almost impossible for me to help myself to the pure gold when he's not here, which is most of the time.So there I am, pushing and pulling, shoving and heaving, trying to fill a wheelbarrow. It's my back that pays the penalty, leaving me bent and crippled.Which is where Jilly comes in. Jilly is a tiny person with healing hands. Boy, can she do massage! I lie down on her couch a cripple and get off ........... still a cripple, but of a different sort and for a short time only. Her clever hands pummel and knead, digging deep, isolating and homing in on the most painful knots and stiffest muscles, working on them until they give in and dissolve and I emerge bruised and battered, but once again straight backed and upright.

{"title": "Country Ladies", "date": "Tuesday 12 May 2009", "text": "Yes, I know, the feminist says \"country women\", but these ladies are wonderfully old-fashioned and feminism passed them by when the fighting first started and has still not caught up with them. So, ladies they are and will remain.They have names to suit their status: Edna and Audrey and Joyce and Pauline and Margaret; delightfully old-fashioned names to suit delightful old-fashioned ladies. The youngest of them is 75 and the oldest is 86. They are not as hale and hearty as they once were, nor are they as active, although both the 75 year old and the 82 year old could show me a thing or two when it comes to stamina.When I rang one of the ladies to see if she would like a visit,  for a chat, \"to cheer her up\", I found that no cheering up was required. \"Come on over\", she said, \"I'm having a little tea party; we have a designer/dressmaker coming to do a presentation, you'd enjoy it, I'm sure\".When I arrived, the ladies were assembled around the tea table, tucking into delicate sandwiches.  home made scones and cakes, and \"catching up\". Catching up is very much a good gossip about absent friends, never malicious or unkind, but very thorough, nonetheless.  They were having a high old time, cheeks getting pinker by the minute.The dressmaker arrived, a giggly but efficient young woman, who arranged her laptop to suit everyone and the show began. Flouncy, frilly summer dresses provoked oohs and aahs, as did little girl's dresses, but the highlight of the show were several wedding dresses, very elaborate and fancy, the sort often called \"meringues\".The clothes were totally unsuitable for anybody over 40, much less 70 - I can't imagine what the dressmaker was thinking of - but the show was a complete success with the ladies. They loved the clothes, but did agree that perhaps they were not quite the thing; they enjoyed the make-up lessons, which followed, even more, although Margaret said, she'd long ago stopped bothering. \"Why\", the others said, \"putting on a bit of slap can make all the difference\".And as for me? I thoroughly enjoyed the afternoon; I sincerely hope that the ladies will continue to consider me their \"young\" friend and continue to invite me to share their fun."},
{"title": "Summer 1945", "date": "Sunday 10 May 2009", "text": "The war was over.The guns  ceased firing and the bombs ceased dropping at midnight on May 8th-9th. Germany, and Europe, fell silent for the first time since September 1939. Millions and millions had died, on battlefields all over Europe, in concentration camps and in a thousand bombed out towns and cities.  Men, women and children, the innocent and guilty alike. The slaughter had ended. The Third Reich was defeated. It was time to turn away from the ruins and look to survival and re-birth.May 1945 was Germany's darkest hour, \"Zero Hour\".The people were there, and the land - the first dazed, bleeding and hungry, and, when winter came, shivering in their rags in makeshift shelters and cellars, often open to the elements. Much of the land was a vast wasteland of rubble, the infrastructure destroyed, factories and workshops demolished, neither transport nor food supply intact.  As I have said before, most houses in our little village were undamaged or only slightly damaged. My paternal grandfather's house in the same village had taken a hit, but was left comparatively intact, having lost no more than half a wall.  We did not experience the desperate shortage of housing; although the influx of  millions of refugees and expellees from the eastern parts of the former Reich, which soon began, certainly affected the villages in the Lower Rhine area.I was too small to know any of this; life is as life is. There were already two families living in our small house, the landlady and her son returned some time in May; there was no room for refugees. These were housed in hastily erected wooden sheds, in community halls and other public buildings, even churches and church halls.Food was a different matter. You ate what rations you were allocated, what your garden could produce, what you could beg or steal. It was possible to move about freely again; except, there was no transport. If you had a bicycle, you were lucky. The retreating Wehrmacht  had left behind sacks of flour in a hotel; these were soon plundered by the villagers. Even in the countryside meat and fat were rare,  towns and cities were worse off.Official records show that the military government deemed a diet of 792 calories per day sufficient for each person; however, the acute shortages meant that often rations amounting to no more than 400-500 calories per day could be distributed. If available, the fat or meat ration per month would amount to 400 grams of each.No wonder, therefore, that people foraged for food wherever they could. In fields and hedges and woods, people found free food, nettles, fungi, wild leaves and roots became part of the daily diet. Berries were gathered in gardens, hedgerows and woods. Women and children roamed the countryside, carrying baskets and bags, during that summer. The hope was, that soon it would be harvest time; farmers were once again tending their fields with the help of everyone who was not needed elsewhere, old men and young boys providing unpaid labour, or labour in return for food.Father had a very great, personal problem. He had been a smoker and the lack of tobacco hit him hard. I remember him trying to turn strawberry and rhubarb leaves into tobacco.He dried these leaves on top of the large family wardrobe; the smell was not unpleasant. Each time he discovered a new type of leaf, he was full of hope, only for the hope to be dashed as soon as he tried to stuff the dried leaves into his pipe and smoke it. Although Mother was sympathetic to his needs, his ever more desperate attempts soon began to annoy her; she saw our many other problems as far more deserving of ingenuity and effort. Poor Dad.Eventually, he tried growing tobacco. By August, he was ready to start harvesting. Again, the top of the wardrobe became his drying shed. Sadly, this attempt too failed. He persevered and smoked the \"tobacco\" in his pipe, even tried to roll the leaves into a cigar-shaped wedge. Sadly, the climate just wasn't suitable for growing the stuff; besides, who knows what kind of seeds he had been given.It was to be a long time before Father enjoyed his pipe again. In the meantime, lack of food, and ways and means of procuring it became the family's main preoccupation."},

Thank you so much, When I am Rich, I feel honoured and humbled.Okay, honoured, but maybe not humbled. Can't really see what makes me a worthy recipient, after all, I only write what comes into my head, when it comes into my head. All the same, it's great to be accepted amongst the blogerati; it makes blogging even more worthwhile. Why do I love blogging? Why have I become a blograt?Funnily enough, I was actually thinking this morning, how quickly I have become addicted to blogging and why that should be so. I only started to write proper posts in January.I started off rather hesitantly, not really knowing what blogging means (actually, I still don't);would I stick to it? would I have anything at all to say which would interest anybody at all?what if nobody ever found my blog? would that matter to me?And then, what sort of people would I find in blogland? would I want to be one of them? could I be myself, rave and rant, complain, write about painful subjects, silly subjects, serious subjects without laying myself open to ridicule? (always a consideration for me) So, what decided me?The desire to get back to writing, in a non-committal way, finding out if I still have the knack after years of writing nothing but letters, a journal, travelogues, came first. I have always been sad that nobody in my family ever seriously got down to putting family history in writing; Words were used as weapons, to educate, to fight, words were not for writing down.  My grandfather, the one I take after, was the most loquacious man amongst them, a real tub-thumping orator, a  rabble rousing trade unionist - a very dangerous thing to be at the time in Germany -  so when one of my brood expressed an interest, I thought, now's the time.  Courage, my girl! Lastly, living deep in the countryside is lovely in many ways; however, the countryside is not the most stimulating place. A lot of my life happens inside my head, so putting it on paper, i.e. a screen, was the next logical step. Blogland is the place to meet people who might or might not be interesting. no commitment necessary, but satisfying  communication possible. The safe place to be from which to venture forth to test the waters.A bit mixed, metaphorically, but then this is only a blog and blogs don't matter, do they? Or do they? One more thing: since I started this blog, I have changed the way I look at things, literally - through my camera - and in my mind's eye. I look at people and actions and events like a writer does: in a \"could-I-make-something-out-of-this\" way. It probably will not lead to serious writing, except for pleasure, but it is helping me to become more observant again, to experience things more deeply, to enjoy them more.Not bad going for the humble blog, eh?So, here I am, still a little hesitant, but determined to carry on. With or without readers.Because, quite simply, BLOGGING IS FUN.SORRY,  When I Am Rich, if you got more than you asked for, but I did start out saying, that I had  been thinking about this.I love your reasons and would certainly agree with all of them. But I couldn't just repeat them, could I?"},
{"title": "Open Garden", "date": "Tuesday 28 April 2009", "text": "After a gap of two summers I have committed myself to opening the garden again, in aid of church funds, for one weekend at the end of June.I stopped doing it because I got just too obsessed with creating a pristine garden, where every plant is wanted, every group of plants presents a beautiful picture at all times and nothing is left to nature, much less to chance. By definition, a garden is an unnatural creation.  I admit, however, that I took the concept too far and worked myself into the ground in the process. For weeks beforehand my usual position was \"arse over elbow\", as the phrase goes. The Scraper never got a look-in and even the dog had to walk himself. This year it will be different. Definitely. Maybe. I hope.Open Garden is a very English idea. There will be a number of gardens open all over the village, with little printed maps being handed out with the tickets, showing locations and giving a short description of each garden and the owner's aims in creating it. All gardens are pretty in their own way, even the neglected ones, where the owner describes it as \"a wilderness left for wildlife\". I have read sentences like \"we don't believe in weeding\" , and \"we love nature\". And yes, they get away with it. IT'S FOR CHARITY, after all. Most gardeners are, however, proud of their patch, love to show it off, and put in a lot of effort.There will be one or more plant stalls; a lot of the plants will be those that flourish and proliferate and self seed generously, simply divided and potted up, in a hurry, a few days beforehand, having had hardly enough time to establish roots. But you can also find a treasure, when a keen plantswoman (it's usually women) has potted up some of her choice and much loved specimens for sale. Some plants will have been donated by nurseries; charity fundraisers are persistent beggars.There will be a tea stall in one of the gardens, in the church hall, if wet. The village ladies bake mountains of scones and sponges, whip gallons of cream, make many pounds of strawberry jam. Massive tea urns from the village hall are pressed into service. Cream Teas, taken at a rickety table, sitting on plastic chairs or mossy garden benches, are a highlight of the day; visitors love them.Ah yes, visitors. Visitors are the lifeblood that give the event purpose and reason for being.And yes, they come, in droves, when the weather is fine. Even on damp days, they come. Some have been coming for years.Roughly, there are three categories of visitors to the Gardens Open weekend.Firstly, there are day trippers from the cities, whole families, dragging unwilling children and complaining grandparents along on the outing to the countryside. They are not particularly interested in gardening and know very little about it. They do the rounds, because it's a nice day out, they get to poke about in other peoples private spaces, the children might use any swings or climbing frames they find and there is usually a bench for grandpa to rest on until his minders pick him up on their way out, en route to the next garden on the list. The day trippers from the cities are often a little shy, they don't feel free to speak to the garden owner, they might be a little in awe of country dwellers and their abundant supply of air and greenery, even if the garden is only small.It's a pleasure to have them come and draw them out. They rarely buy plants but they enjoy the cream tea stall.The second group is an infuriating rabble. They come at a trot, rush around with unseeing eyes, talking amongst themselves about something entirely unrelated. They have a ticket entitling them to visit all the gardens, they glance at the outside of the house more than at any of the carefully tended beds; they never lift their eyes enough to admire your specially arranged vistas; all they ever ask you is the quickest route to the next garden.I have tried to engage them in garden lore, without success. If it were not for the ticket price, they might as well stay away.Lastly, we have a very special group, mainly consisting of groups of ladies; occasionally there is a lady on her own.They are always very knowledgeable, are keen gardeners themselves; they recognise and appreciate all your tricks, know about the hard work that goes into creating and maintaining a garden. They alight on the smallest patch with greedy eyes, asking you for the name of an obscure plant whose presence in your garden you have long forgotten or overlooked, due to its insignificance in the overall scheme of your plot. You admit that some plants are probably called  \"amnesias\" and hope they find you amusing.  For them you get out the plant books, the garden encyclopedias and How To guides; they involve you in long conversations on propagation, cultivation requirements and hardiness; they buy your best plants and send you into the shed to find boxes and bags for their transport. They never mind the lengthening queue of people waiting to speak to you; they take their time.These ladies are a delight;  they can also be a menace: some of them carry sharp little scissors or pocket knives, maybe a dampened plastic bag or two. If they ask you openly for a cutting, you will try and accommodate them, take it as a compliment. It's the ones who snip away without permission you need to watch out for. And then there's the vicar, who rushes from garden to garden, trying to look interested and rubbing his hands together, while thanking you profusely. He knows it'll all be worth it in the end.   This morning I saw Mrs. Blackbird hopping about, collecting bits of straw and twigs.Bit late for nest building, isn't it?Then I thought, perhaps she is a parliamentarian, furnishing her second home?"},

We boarded the coach and drove to some RASC camp twenty miles away.In the Naafi later, we met the fringes of the black market, but were not interested.Today we drove here, and saw many terrible acres of devastation in Hamm and Duesseldorf. Ten times worse than  London.The aptest comment I have heard happened in the coach:\"Well, well, well. So this is Germany. What's trumps?\"Hamm and Duesseldorf are blitzed to blazes, but apparently there's plenty of black market here. From what I've seen of them, the Germans are more happy, warm and well-fed round here than I had expected. It's rather ironic to think that we won the war, when we came over on the boat with hundreds of repatriate Germans, and I've got several years to serve.Len gave a German waiter a Woodbine today. He jumped to attention and saluted. What a situation! Fags cost 8d for twenty.o-o-o-o-o9th MarchI have made the acquaintance of the black market.We played at the Opera House last night and three women and a man were waiting for us. At our approach they displayed tablecloths, aprons, shoes, lace and cheap jewellery.They name a price, in cigarettes, and you can usually beat them down to half price. The women's faces bore a peculiar expression, half of eagerness and guile and half of resignation. They seemed to try to get a good bargain, and yet at the same time, know that cigarettes were worthless.It's all a false position. Cigarettes cost us 8d for twenty (75 a week), while on the black market they fetch five marks each. For bartering purposes, a cigarette equals one mark, and one mark equals sixpence on official exchange. However, for one mark one can buy about a shillingsworth in the shops.It's all screwy. I give sixty cigarettes for an electric iron. It thus costs me 2/6d, while the vendor gets three hundred marks for the fags, - roughly £15, - a good bargain both ways."},

One of the poems I took with me to read is by the Renaissance poet, George Wither, who lived from 1588-1667. He wrote it in 1635, 374 years ago and he might as well have written it yesterday: When I behold the havoc and the spoilWhich, even within the compass of my days,Is made through every quarter of this isle,In woods and groves, which were this kingdom's praise,And when I mind with how much greedinessWe seek the present gain in everything,Not caring (so our lust we may possess)What damage to posterity we bring...What our forefathers planted, we destroy;Nay, all men's labours, living heretofore,And all our own, we lavishly employTo serve our present lusts, and for no more.There is a powerful message in this poem, one we still haven't understood and probably never will.Amazing, just amazing !A power surge kills my TV and my modem router. Okay, so I can live without a TV for a while, but three whole days without access to the net is asking too much, far more than I am able to bear.So off I rush to the computer shop for a new modem, which is then duly installed (not by me). Panic over.And what happens when I get back to my blog? People have joined me, awarded me an award, left a message.There I was, happily trundling along in my backwater (both geographical and blogical), gingerly feeling my way through the blogosphere and thinking that, after three months of posting my bits and pieces, I might safely raise my head above the parapet. Wham, cross-fire!Strange, how addictive both the net and blogging have become in a relatively short period of time. Thanks folks, for noticing me.

Not until March 24th did the American Army finally cross the Rhine; that night and for  days and nights afterwards American tanks rolled past, an endless convoy of tanks,  an unceasing movement of troops, a war machine of unimaginable power and might. Once again the noise terrified me. Much of the terror I remember has to do with noise; the drone of aeroplanes, distant bombing, artillery fire, machine gun fire. The harsh sound of jackboots striking the pavement, men's voices shouting, bellowing commands, all that reached us in the cellar, through the coal hole. I don't think the darkness frightened me half as much as the noise. In fact, even now, so many decades afterwards, I still shake at the sound of loud voices, people arguing and  men fighting drives me away rather than stand and stare.Father had been home for several days, always in hiding. Food stores were running low, although Mother was allowed to collect our rations, mine and hers, Father had not been registered with the new authorities. Officially, he was a non-person. There were fewer house searches now, all soldiers had been rounded up and taken into a makeshift camp; Father stayed mostly in the back garden, close to a kind of cesspit where compost was being made. This pit was a fairly large, deep, square hole, with concrete sides, filled with every kind of rubbish that would rot, including  the bodies of dead animals and birds - not that there were any being thrown in now,  chickens  and rabbits had disappeared into the pot long ago. There were rats, though.This hole was deep enough to hold a crouching man; green sludge and cabbage leaves could be scraped away to make a space inside the pit and then heaped on top of the fugitive.This place was in its way as noisome as the earth closet into which Mother had stuffed the landlord's Nazi uniform, nobody would believe that a human being could be hiding there.The danger of being shot for desertion by German troops was over on  our side of the river, so Father finally decided to come out of hiding and give himself up. We had no food and he could do nothing for us as a fugitive.Each village had a commandant. Father presented himself in his workmen's clothes and was duly arrested and interned. We knew he would be safe. The Americans had not ill-treated the prisoners, they saw to it that they were fed, although the makeshift camps were simple enclosures without shelter.I cannot remember for how long Father was away, I don't think it was many weeks. Reasonably able-bodied men, who were not considered a threat, were desperately needed to start clearing rubble and  erect shelters for people left homeless.Our village was lucky, the nearby town had suffered two major raids, flattening it, but we had been spared complete destruction. There were only two houses completely destroyed in our street, several others had been partly burned and several were badly damaged but still inhabitable.The war was over, the struggle for survival had begun."},

The main topic of conversation was the generally sad state of the world, starting with dishonest and hypocritical politicians and ending with the sad way we treat the earth. Now, there's nothing we can do about politicians, after all, it is a truism that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and no matter how idealistically they may start out they soon revert to the nature of the beast.Besides, no matter how hard they try (in order to get re-elected) they cannot please all of the people all of the time.Our friend mentioned the Obama circus coming to town (DON'T get me wrong: I am seriously pro-Obama, not just for the sake of the USA but also the rest of us).

And guess what, I believe mankind not only can but will. I am an optimist. I don't know what form this action will take, I am neither scientist nor clairvoyant. We could remind ourselves about the time not so long ago when the nuclear holocaust clocks were about to strike twelve and we were all told to hide under a door or the kitchen table in the event - well, that acute fear has disappeared from everyday life. We could go further back in history and think of the first trains and cars - wasn't civilisation as mankind knew it then also going to come to an end? All the untold numbers who were going to perish never did, did they.When push comes to shove, mankind will find a way out. Mankind is infinitely inventive, resourceful and adaptable.  Our friends are both in their eighties. I asked him - after a prolonged bout of ranting about the economy, the environment, etc. etc. -  if he was glad he was old, without responsibility for the future, able to sit back and enjoy the fruits of his labour for whatever time there was left.He looked up, thought for a moment, then said, with a smile:\" I don't know that I am old.\"Considering that he is disabled through a stroke, and will never see eighty six again, that is saying something for man's optimism and adaptability indeed. I was mightily impressed.The meal was excellent in all respects."},

They are mainly used as working dogs; the labrador part being the reliable retriever and the lurcher providing the speed. Perhaps, we should call him a \"lurchbrador\" or \"labralurch\" ?Whatever, he is the sweetest, gentlest creature, always keen to please us.As for the rest of the family? Delightful people, all of them.

{"title": "Easter", "date": "Thursday 9 April 2009", "text": "Easter eggs and the Easter BunnySince the time of the ancient Teutonic world the egg has been regarded as a bringer of luck and symbol of fertility, a joyful gift to celebrate the return of spring.Although egg painting was known in pre-Christian Greece the custom did not reach Northern Europe until the 17th Century when the Turks conquered Byzantium, causing many of the inhabitants to flee northwards, taking their traditions with them, including the custom of painting eggs.Written records show that the Easter Bunny as egg bringer first appeared on German soil in 1682, in the company of cockerels, foxes and donkeys, who were all deemed \"responsible\" for the delivery of eggs. It seems most likely that the rabbit won through against the competition because of its high symbolism. Like the egg, the ancient Greeks, Romans and Teutons revered the rabbit as a symbol of fertility.All the Easter Sundays of my childhood were sunny, how could it have been otherwise. In the predominantly catholic area where I grew up children were told that the Church bells, which fell silent on \"Green Thursday\" (Maundy Thursday) and did not sound again until Easter Sunday,  had flown to Rome, to be blessed by the Pope. So, on Easter Sunday morning, we were woken by the joyous, noisy clamour of the freshly returned bells of the village Church and all the other Churches in villages all around ringing out over the wide, flat, marshy land.Children rushed outdoors to hunt for the Easter eggs which their parents had painted and hidden in small clusters all over the garden. There were no chocolate eggs until much later but I do remember, that within a few years of the end of the war, when real food was no longer a luxury available only on the black market, there were sweets, like liquorice sticks and boiled, flavoured lumps of sugar.The eggs were eaten for breakfast. Once the first novelty and excitement of the hunt had passed and the basket of prettily patterned, painted eggs on the table had been admired, I soon grew tired of eating them. They were, of course, cold and hard-boiled,  I could never manage more than one; thinking back now, it seems to me that they were dished up, in some form or other, for days afterwards. Eggs were by no means plentiful, not even in the country; being part of the rations, they were a precious source of nourishment, highly appreciated."},

I quite sympathise with the troops who walked off ships lately, the accommodation is rather inadequate. However, for a short crossing like this it isn't too bad.This ship is the \"Empire Cutlass\". To a landlubber like me, it seems colossal, except when the other five hundred and ninety nine are also moving about.We left the quay at 15.30 hours yesterday, and the sunless land slowly moved behind us. As we got out to sea, so the weather deteriorated. I got quite a thrill out of realising that the swaying motion of the walls was not a product of my inebriation.We settled down to a long session of solo. About half the band was seasick to some degree.We all wished that we were in the Navy when our ration of twenty \"Greys\" cost only eightpence, but most of us changed our minds later, when the sea grew rougher.There is what seems a mild gale to me blowing, and frozen snow bombards the face of anyone who ventures on deck. The sea is dark green, whipped to a dirty cream as the ship pushes its blunt way through he rollers.Altogether an interesting crossing, although quite uninspiring, quite unromantic.Visibility can't be more than a hundred yards.We were confined to our bunks for half an hour after we boarded ship, and I fell into an idle musing and reverie. The bloke in the bunk above me seemed to be most peculiarly shaped, judging from the bulges in the canvas. I picked out his head and hips easily, but then he had a big bump halfway down his spine, and, apparently, two treble-jointed legs. When we got down I was surprised to find him quite normal and well-proportioned.0 - 0 - 0 - 0I was in the luggage van coming to the docks. Just before we drove off, the B.S.M. handed his case over the tailboard; his blanket was strapped onto it. We drove away.\"That Buck's case?\" said Bill. \"Yeah\", I said.\"Fuck Buck\", said Bill, and kicked the case forward.\"What the bloody hell are you doing?\", said Harry and kicked it back.This went on for some time. Bill had drunk fourteen pints of wallop before we started.\"Here, hold on\", said Pop, \"you've kicked the bloody side in\".\"Christ!\", said Harry, \"put it out of the way.\"\"Fuck that\", said Bill, \"I don't want his bloody case on here\"  -  and he wiped his boots carefully on Buck's blanket.\"Here, mine are dirty too\", said Pop, and wiped his.I was killing myself laughing.Order was eventually restored, and the case,  -  with a hole in its side, and a soaking wet, filthy blanket tied to it  -  was passed back to a safe place.At the quayside, Buck was standing by the lorry. He saw his case. \"What the fuck's been happening\", he asked. \"Have you been using my blanket for a bloody doormat or what?\"\"I don't know Sir\". I said. \"it must have fallen over\".Later he came up to me. \"What happened to my case\", he said, \"there's a bloody great hole in the side\".\"I don't know, Sir,\" I said, \" I passed it back. You know these great bumps in the ground just after we started? \"Yeah\", said Buck. \"Well, several cases fell down there\", I said. \" and one must have fallen on yours.\"\"I've had that bloody case for years\", he said, and his eyes did not believe me either."},

A mixed lot, as you will always find in any barrack room, but, perhaps, a milder kind than most, having to some degree one thing in common, and that thing, music.Technically speaking, few of them are musical, but all are instrumentalists, though for a variety of reasons, and in varying degrees of proficiency.To start with, there's Hank, a long, drooping product of a country town, with a broad Southern accent. He is a violinist of average ability, and a keen concert goer. He knows the keys, opus number and main themes of most major works, and has the disconcerting habit of singing the noisiest of these themes at the top of his voice, while imitating the motions of a trombone with his hands.Len, a fair-sized ex-miner who is trying to get back to the pits, where he knows he will be medically discharged. He is the pianist, dark with a pimply face and a spreading imagination.Ginger, the lance bombardier of our room, is average size with an unambitious moustache.

{"title": "Poetry Group", "date": "Friday 27 March 2009", "text": "Last night's poetry meeting was rather unusual for our group: instead of everybody reading up on and presenting poems on a set subject we discussed in detail, two very long poems and one of medium length.Robert Browning's  \"Childe Harold To The Dark Tower Came\"  was the first.To appreciate it one must read it aloud, savouring each dark allusion, making the most of the horrors and fearful scenes  Browning's rich language evokes. He took the title from \"King Lear\" where Edgar, disguised as Poor Tom, sings:Child Roland to the dark tower came,His word was still \"fie, foh and fum,I smell the blood of a British man.Christina Rosetti's  \"Goblin Market\"  came next.I'm not particularly fond of this poem, I don't really do homilies, finger-wagging \"be good\" stuff, or else. That said, this poem must also be read aloud to get the full fruity flavour of it, particularly the long lists. One could become intoxicated on words here.D.H. Lawrence\"s  \"Snake\" was the last poem.And what a poem it is. one can, and some do, read all sorts of meanings into it; and why not.I love the surface of it too, perhaps even more than the allegorical depths; you can feel the heat, with the volcano smoking in the margins of the picture, see the man come out in his pyjamas, watch the snake and feel afraid of it, and finally, give in to mankind's petty and vindictive nature by hurting it.  An exhilarating evening.The next subject is Greed and Gluttony. Any ideas? I'll certainly have fun researching it. from the top:-Aubrietia, Jonquils,  Heuchera, Tulips, Chaenomeles               all proudly displaying themselves in the garden at the moment. If only the rotten weather would warm up a bit, I can't wait to roll up my sleeves and get out there. I've been very domesticated this past week, shopping, cooking, visiting my old ladies. I find grocery shopping very boring, so to make the almost day long shopping expedition at all interesting we have a meal at a restaurant. The Shropshire/Welsh Marches are famous for the many good restaurants and food shops; we have a veritable foodie paradise here.The Pound Inn at Leebotwood on the A49 between Church Stretton and Shrewsbury has a pleasant atmosphere, friendly service and a menu that reads like a dream.The day after was free so I spent the whole morning cooking: a large meatloaf filled with roasted peppers and aubergines and an equally large chicken thigh casserole with vegetables. When I have spare time I often cook dishes which go into the freezers;  my own \"ready meals\", which come in very useful when I want to do other things. We very rarely buy in ready meals, I love to cook and entertain; I count having a well-stocked larder and freezer amongst life's pleasures.

{"title": "March 1945", "date": "Tuesday 24 March 2009", "text": "One night after my American \"friend\" and his tank disappeared from the pavement in front of the house Mother and I heard a scratching, scrabbling noise coming from the backyard. It was black night, the only light came from the stars above and even the noise of day, the rumble of machinery and vehicles being moved, the drone of aeroplanes, had stopped. The noise from the frontline was different, sharper, and at the same time, more distant. This was a noise to be frightened of, a secret human presence very stealthily making itself known at the back of the house. Rumours of rapes and robberies were rife, it was as well to remain quiet and unnoticed, not to call attention to one's presence.The noise continued, becoming more insistent. And then a voice, the merest whisper. \"Katie\", it breathed, \"Katie\".  Katie was Mother's name. Mother crept to the back door. \"Are you mad\", she greeted Father, \"there are soldiers all around, patrolling; don't you know how dangerous it is for you to be here\".I have often heard this story told in the years to come, when life was normal again; how Mother received her \"heroic\" husband who had risked his life to return to her through fierce fighting, a deserter, for part of the way still in uniform, to come to the aid of his damsel in distress, by roundly reproaching him.   Rumours of the American and British advance had reached  Father's camp; he knew they must have reached the village by now. Having given up the war as a lost cause long since, he grabbed some rations and deserted, going absent without leave; his one thought to get to his wife and child whom he knew to be unprotected and alone.He had about 100 km to walk, first through his own lines, then enemy lines. He was in uniform when he started his trek; both sides would have shot him on the spot, had he been caught.It took him three days and four nights; he spent much of the time hiding in barns and hedges and moved with extreme caution. He was on the wrong side of the Rhine, the river must be crossed by one of the few bridges left standing which happened to be the bridge closest to home. Before attempting the crossing he made for a farm just inside the German lines. He attracted the attention of the farmer's wife who took him in, hid him in the barn and brought him food and a pair of her husband's dark blue overalls. My Father was a large man, clearly taller than the farmer whose overalls barely fitted him. The farmer's wife hid Father's uniform and sent him on his way with  heartfelt blessings. Father told us how she had said she hoped somebody would do the same for her husband, wherever he might be.My Father was one of the last men to cross the Duisburg bridge before the Germans blew it up. In the chaos a sole man, dirty and ragged, going in the wrong direction, towards the advancing American army gave no one cause for concern; let the fool run towards certain death, if he must.Somehow Father made it. He had tramped the back roads and country lanes often enough in his life; he knew isolated farms, secretive woods and hiding places. When somebody spied him, some other German, it helped that he was in workman's clothes. Few people risked leaving their shelters, although German units were retreating fast there was still fighting going on, particularly as the American advance approached  the river.Once he crossed the frontline the fighting diminished but he still had to dodge the vast body of military hardware and supply lines.  He later said it was his sheer bloody-minded determination to reach us, me and Mother, come hell or high water, that saw him through."},

We had water but no electricity and  food was beginning to be very scarce. We had very little left in  larder and cellar, although the soldiers had not stolen what there was; they were keener on drink than on food. Bread was available, the Americans had supplied flour for the bakers to continue baking  bread. The lack of electricity meant that bakers had to knead the dough with their feet, in a wooden dough trough, and bake it in the old-fashioned brick ovens. Farmers were allowed to tend their cattle and fresh milk was delivered daily.Mother hated to leave me alone in the house while she queued for food, she returned as soon as she could, never stopping to exchange news. She and I were rather isolated, without any means of communicating with anybody other than a quick word with neighbours over the fence in the garden.  The gardens were not overlooked from the street but Mother lacked the courage to stay outside for long. You never knew when the next search party would arrive at the door and demand instant access.Mother didn't know what had happened to Father. The fighting to the east of the village towards the nearest town on the left bank of the Rhine was still going on, we could hear artillery fire, the drone of aeroplanes; there was a lot of troop movement and tanks continued to rumble along Main Street on their way to the front. Mother knew that Father was in a camp about 100 km to the north of us. At the beginning of the war he had been a dispatch rider, travelling between units on the Western Front. He never saw action; as luck or misfortune, whichever way one likes to look at it, would have, he was seriously injured by opportunist fire from a low flying enemy plane which spotted him crossing the yard at his overnight accommodation, while visiting the latrines at night, carrying a light; an action which was strictly forbidden.Father was near death; it took many months before he could leave the field hospital; after that he was transferred to a hospital inside Germany. For the rest of his life he carried a large piece of shrapnel in his gut, too close to the spine to be operable. He was never fit for active service again.He was, however, declared fit to serve as a guard at a forced labour camp. which held mainly Poles, where he spent the rest of his war."},

I entered a narrow alley where the unguent snow, still falling, faded the memory of a pair of purposeful footprints under the yellow light of a swinging lamp. The rough bricks of the old houses seemed to provide a chorus to the cameo of romance, while the falling flakesinsisted a gentle prologue.I walked away unwilllingly, and it was some minutes before I realized that my feet were wet and that I was very cold.Tonight it was dark where I walked and the streets were silent; long white cuts in the snow bore witness of the night's purity, urgent in their symbolism.There was the finest possible rind of the infant moon lying on the horizon and all the stars shone steadfastly, as if proud each of its individual contribution to the stillness' beauty, and though I would have stayed still and silent,  I had to walk on, and the martyr snow beneath my feet spoke sadly of my profanation, shattering the silence, and heaping all nature's old hostility on my head.I turned on the threshold, and the silence spoke more eloquently than man can say in the finest moment of his inspiration.Thus England, in its coldest spell for years, and just to show you that there are beauties even in such severity, for those that will see."},

By day, the shutters were now open  and the handkerchief had disappeared. The villagers were allowed to leave their houses between 11 am and 12 noon to fetch milk and bread from the corner shop. The water had also been reconnected although there was still no electricity.By now the GIs had stolen a number of items from the landlord's part of the house, portable things that took their fancy, the spoils of war;  some valuable, some possibly \"keepsakes\", like watches and small pieces of jewellery. We also knew that the GIs liked to take any bottles of wine and spirits that they could find.  We never learned if anybody had investigated the contents of the earth closet, as far as we knew, nothing had been found.On the fourth morning Mother opened the shutters; I was with her at the window. In front of the house was a very wide pavement and on that pavement, less than a meter away from he window stood a tank, a Sherman tank. Mother immediately tried to slam the shutters shut again.  A hand stretched out from the tank, a black hand, grabbing the shutters and opening them wide. Mother tried to pull me away, and retreated into the room behind.  Curiosity won over fear, I knelt at the window to examine the strange apparition on the pavement and the hand still holding the shutters.While I watched an arm appeared, then a helmet and a face underneath it. The face too was black. I had never seen a black face before. The face was large and round,  I saw dark brown eyes which were smiling at me and a mouth open in a wide grin, showing brilliantly white teeth. I have never forgotten that face. For a while we stared at each other. Perhaps I smiled too, I cannot remember. But I know that I stayed at the window, behind the glass, mesmerised.The next morning I rushed to the window; the tank was still there. For a while \"my\" black GI and I stared and smiled at each other. Then, slowly, he brought out a hand. The hand held a shiny, round, yellow object: an orange, the first one I'd ever seen. He stretched out his hand towards the closed window, clearly offering the orange as a gift. Mother was watching. I wanted the orange, to hold and examine it, it looked very interesting. Mother said no. I begged. The GI still held out his hand, I begged again. In those very early days women were afraid of soldiers, there had been talk not only of theft and robbery and destruction of property but also of rape.In the end mother cautiously opened the window a tiny crack; I stretched out my arm and, miraculously, the orange was gently placed in my hand. It smelled and tasted like nothing I had ever experienced before. It tasted like sunshine and light and wide open spaces and freedom and life itself and the total absence of fear.One more morning came and, yes, my new friend was there, waiting for me. Eagerly I looked for his hands; they were hidden. I was very disappointed - there was to be no gift today.But \"my\" GI smiled his broad smile and then one of his hands reached out to me, this time holding a tiny package, a small bar wrapped in paper. Mother helped me with the window, she had lost some of her distrust and fear but not, by any means, all of it. The opening remained a tiny crack, just wide enough for a small child's arm to wriggle through.The package landed in my hand. The GI motioned that I should open it, tear the paper off. Curiously, I did as I was bid.  Chocolate! I would love to think I held a Hershey bar and I probably did, although I would not like to swear to it now.The kindness of that GI, the magnanimity the victor showed to the small child of the vanquished has remained with me all my life. There was so much hatred, evil and anger in the world I knew then, the only world I knew, that his deed stood out like a beacon of light in the darkness all around.Sadly, my friend and his tank had gone by the next morning.  I know he was not a dream because the pavement slabs in front of the house, where the tank had been parked, remained broken for all the time we lived there.A day later, in the middle of the night, Father came home."},

Tree surgeons have shortened the sail; as the tree overhangs an English Heritage park, any branches coming off would have fallen on an area used by the public. We have been assured that there is now no danger of that. Still, I wish something could be done to rescue these trees, but the sickness is slowly covering the whole of the country.We carried on tidying. I've pruned three of the largest clematis: clematis tangutica BillMac- Kenzie, C. viticella Polish Spirit and Abundance. All three provide luxurious tangles of leaf and flower every year; in spite of the cold weather buds on all three are large and healthy.I've also severely cut back cotinus coggygria Palace Purple, another splendid grower. By pruning it so severely I'll probably lose the smoke-like flowers in autumn, which are really the reason for growing this large cotinus, but it does rather outgrow its space and the deep purple leaves are quite spectacular by themselves.The large triangular mixed bed has had its first trim of the year, all dry and brown herbaceous plants have been cut down. Gardener said he'll do the \"tickling\" next. \"Tickling\" a border means forking it over fairly lightly with a small fork, weeding and loosening the soil ready for a generous mulching with home-made compost which is sitting by the hedge, ready bagged up.The first anemonies under the plumtree are out too."},

Poets that can move me to tears, raise me up, fill me with wonder, leave them cold. They stare at me in bemusement.Last week's theme was \"hope\".  To me, Richard Eberhart,  American Poet, b. 1904, expressed the epitome of \"hope\" in just six lines:The EclipseI stood out in the open coldTo see the essence of the eclipseWhich was its perfect darkness.I stood in the cold on the porchAnd could not think of anything so perfectAs man's hope of light in the face of darkness."},
{"title": "March 3rd 1945", "date": "Saturday 28 February 2009", "text": "March 1st/2nd 1945We knew that the Americans were coming ever closer. We could hear Artillery fire as villages only a few kilometers away were shelled. For weeks we had spent every night in the cellar, mother hadn't bothered carrying  bedding upstairs for a long time; it was easier that way. We had got used to the cold and darkness; I had lived a large part of my life underground and knew no better. Even at this late stage German infantry was in defence positions, both in the village and in the same woods where we later, in the winter of 46, stole coal from the trains. American shelling of the village centre started at midnight on the 1st, on the morning of the 2nd a small band of the village Volkssturm made their way towards the advancing American troops in a futile attempt to hold them up on the outskirts. Fifteen German soldiers lost their lives in these skirmishes. By early afternoon the remnants of the German resistance had retreated  and the American battalion was firmly in control in and around the village.  The fighting was over.The noises changed; instead of the engines of the overhead artillery plane and bursts of shelling and machine gun fire the rumble of tanks in seemingly endless procession reached our cellar through the opening of the coal hole.Somehow, in all the chaos,  before the tanks rolled in, mother had managed to hang a white handkerchief from the shutters on the kitchen window. Still in the cellar, we heard human voices above the rumble of the tanks; then thunderous knocking on the front door.Mother grabbed my hand and we stumbled up the cellar steps as fast as we could, realising that any delay could prove dangerous.  Mother opened the door.A search commando bristling with weapons roughly pushed past us. There were three or four GIs, one of them staying in the hall with us, the others searching the small house.  The search was soon over; the Americans were looking for German soldiers. There were none hiding in our house.Mother and I stayed utterly still and silent, we neither cried nor spoke at all; we couldn't understand what the GIs were shouting; we didn't even know if they were shouting at us. Mother was petrified, I was simply unable to understand what was going on, I just stared and stayed still. The GIs left the same way they had come, roughly, suddenly, leaving the front door wide open. Mother tried to shut it after them but a gun pushed it out of her hand and it stayed open.There was no reason to go back into the cellar; instead, we went into the kitchen, which was also our living room. Although the front door stood wide open the shutters on the window were still closed, the kitchen was dark.  There was no electricity, but even had there been, we would not have thought of switching on a lamp. The darkness was comforting in a way, it made the noise outside seem less threatening. A child closes its eyes to make the world disappear.There were many more searches during the same day and the following night and the following days. We owned very little of any value, nothing was stolen from us. We were never ill treated by any of the GIs. Mother and I stayed close together the whole of the time, day and night, taking naps in her bed, fully dressed, when we could. Mother's handkerchief stayed fixed to the shutters."},
{"title": "Town & Country and a bit of Culture", "date": "Monday 23 February 2009", "text": "In my last post I talked about the many societies we have; there is also a very active social scene. Many inhabitants are retired professionals, academics, artists, writers and musicians. Although not all of them meet socially, at least not in the same circles, quite a few social gatherings take place. we give each other meals, meet for drinks, have parties. In the last week the scraper and I went to a birthday party, a lunch party and gave a dinner party ourselves. We also spent an evening with friends watching Verdi's \"Don Carlo\"  on DVD, with a young Pavarotti and Ricardo Muti conducting the La Scala orchestra.Not bad for the sticks. Drinks parties can be boring, one meets the same 20 or 30 people in varying combinations and after a while it is difficult to find anything new to say. And I certainly don't want to listen to the same  stories time after time. I find switching off doesn't always help, sometimes I get found out because I've been asked a question which I simply haven't registered and am therefore unable to answer. Then one paddles like mad to catch up. Dinner parties are different. Sometimes you are paired with bores, which is rotten luck. Mostly though, and certainly on the occasions when the scraper and I  do the entertaining, we chose guests who will be amusing, lively and interesting. I try to get the IQ average to be twice that of the age average. At least. There were two history professors, two musicians, two teachers at the table this weeks, all of them happy to eat, drink, talk and be very merry indeed. A place like our village, which is so far from anywhere, has to have a lot going on which is not dependent on anyone or anything from outside - (or from  off, as the locals would say) -. According to the Valley Diary, which is also produced entirely by people in our community, there are currently 27 local societies, as well as Church groups, school related groups, good neighbour groups,  groups providing emergency transport. We have a village hall and a Museum. We also have our own surgery and dispensary, a hardware shop, 2 butchers, a small supermarket, a shop selling flowers and a few groceries, a newsagent's,  a post office (still) and a hairdresser's. All that for about 700 inhabitants and a further 200 people living in the outlying hamlets and on farms.All societies flourish; admittedly, it is mainly incomers who do the work, provide the meals on wheels, run the elderly to hospitals or sit with them and pick up prescriptions. Much is run by committee, on the whole, people mean well and are kind, even if some might try to boss others around.  Much is achieved by a small number of volunteers and large amounts of money are collected almost weekly through the many fundraising events held by the societies.In a small community like our's good neighbourliness is all, without it, many people would find daily life difficult.  You pop in to see if Mrs. Smith is alright, minding your own business is not an option. Of course, that can cause problems, Mrs. Smith sometimes resents the interfering busybody who checks on her, but at other times she is very grateful."},

We are still working on repair jobs like creosoting the new fence and making low brick walls around the beds where the cats dig up the earth and chuck it on the paths. Perhaps a brick wall will stop them. We pruned a couple of apple trees, an ancient one, all gnarled and bent, which produces scabby apples which are only good enough for the birds and a beautiful crab apple tree, Red Sentinel, which is spectacular in all seasons, first producing gorgeous blossom and later millions of tiny bright red apples, which stay on the branches throughout the winter, provided the birds don't eat them all. But there are so many of them even my greedy blackbirds can't take them all. I'd encourage anyone who has the space to plant and cherish a Red Sentinel, they are just so wonderful to look at. We also cut back a few fuchsia bushes; I sincerely hope I won't regret that, there will still be frosts. Most of the fuchsias grow in  sheltered spots along walls; perhaps that'll protect them enough. We tidied up and mulched the spring borders. Soon the daffodils will be too tall to get in there. The snowdrops and aconites are quite spectacular now and the hellebore buds are beginning to open."},

We rented two rooms and a kitchen in a house which belonged to Nazi sympathizers, members of the party since the beginning. Our landlord was somewhere at the front, but his wife and son, who was in the \"Hitler Youth\" lived in the same house. When news of the Americans' imminent arrival reached the village this woman and her son fled; they were not the only ones. Mother was left with a houseful of incriminating material, from pamphlets and posters to uniforms and a Nazi flag, all the accumulated detritus of 12 years' party membership. How to get rid of this was a huge problem for her; she had no help, couldn't ask anyone for help - even at this late stage there were still pockets of German resistance and you could still get shot for any sign of mutiny -. But the stuff had to be got rid of. The papers, pamphlets, magazines and posters she burned,  some in the range in the kitchen and some in the copper fire in the washhouse in the back. The uniforms, neckerchiefs and flag were much harder to dispose of. We had an earth closet in the back, in a part of the shed, the usual wooden box with a hole in the top and a cover for the hole; that's where she stuffed everything she couldn't burn. It was dark in the privy, the closet was deep and noisome; even a keen house search might forego a close inspection.Mother could only hope that she had found and disposed of everything there was; we kept our heads down and awaited developments."},

Ludlow is  famous for its restaurants and its markets selling produce from the surrounding areas. Come for a visit!! Alas, the dreaded Tesco has managed to get its foot in the door here too.Today's social outing was a pleasant lunch with neighbours.  After a glass of wine or two we feel quite ready to discuss and bemoan the dire state of the economy;  it seems to be the fashion to moan.\"A bank is a place that will lend you money if you can prove that you don't need it.\"Oh, Bob Hope, if only!!A visit to the ballet \"The Russian State Ballet & Orchestra of Siberia\" performing \"The Nutcracker\" last week provided the bit of culture; I went on my own - that is with a coachload of other people (how are the mighty fallen).

We are not exactly great friends but we get on very well and enjoy each others company whenever we meet.Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the other couple who was present. The husband is quiet, doesn't say much. The wife makes up for his reticence : she talks. And talks. And talks. I quite like people who entertain me, in whose slipstream I can gently doze away a pleasant couple of hours, while enjoying good food and drink. What I cannot abide is being forced to listen to every tiny detail in the life of somebody's (unknown to me) family, be they children, grandchildren, brothers and sisters, yes, even uncles and aunts. A bit of juicy gossip, yes, I can live with that. I admit, that secretly, I might even enjoy a bit of scandal - the sort that can never be repeated but causes a tiny frisson of glee all the same. But the everyday minutiae of very boring lives drive me rigid with fury.  Instead of relaxing in such people's company, I can feel my shoulders getting stiffer and more tense by the minute. And, politeness demands, that you say nothing to shut them up; you are a guest in somebody else's house.Could one possibly ask never to be invited at the same time again?"},
{"title": "Winter 46/47", "date": "Tuesday 3 February 2009", "text": "Huge news: it's winter - we have snow - Britain has come to a standstill!!! For a country which is obsessed with the weather (after all, there is hardly a casual conversation which does not start with a remark or two about it), we sure don't know how to cope with it.However, it's fun for me to wade through deep snow, snug in Aunt Josephine's ancient furs, watching Benno race around and manically bite into it. All his favourite sticks are burieddeep and he digs so hard to unearth them, the snow flies up and covers him too. The only problem is that we can't drive the car: we can't get it over the cattle grids and out of the drive.Winter wasn't always such fun.There was a time when frost, ice and snow were a curse and that was the winter of 46/47 in Germany. In fact,  more or less the whole of Europe iced over but for a country which was on its knees, with millions of people without fuel, without food, without shelter it was retribution indeed.   As a tiny child I lived in a village on the lower Rhine and although we had shelter we had neither food nor fuel. There were, however, trains filled with coal from the nearby mining area of the Ruhr, which rolled through  woods not far off on their way to the Dutch border.It so happened, that these trains always came to a momentary stop in the woods, waiting for a signal to allow them passage onwards.  It didn't take long for this to become known in the village. The coal was transported in open wagons, not very high ones, with iron bars or steps on the outside.  A few village men risked the first raids on the train; when nothing happened, others followed suit.  Little by little, everyone was involved in stealing coal, my parents and me included. It was always after dark when the raids took place. As soon as the train started to slow down (it was never very fast) the men clambered aboard, throwing down coal with their bare hands while the women and children frantically scooped it up, into sacks or baskets; the lucky ones might have had a handcart, although it was quite difficult to get anything but the smallest conveyance through the uneven terrain of the woods. We had a bicycle which helped with carrying our loot. My father pushed it. My mother was ill with starvation and unable to carry much and I was too small, although I remember dragging a sack behind me until we got out of the wood and my father loaded it onto his back. Because we were such a small group, we never managed to take much coal, enough for loading the stove once or twice only. Others were better organized; a family of several men and older children could carry two or three sacks away on each raid. The authorities soon became aware of the raids. The trains never stopped for long, at most five to ten minutes, not enough time to steal large quantities of coal; it was, however, a criminal offence; even people in danger of freezing to death could not be allowed to get away with it.We never knew how the military police found out but, within a week or two, the raids were regularly interrupted by several all terrain army vehicles arriving along the tracks, lights blazing, whistles whistling shrilly and much confused shouting. The men jumped from the wagons, women and children dragged away what they could and,  abandoning the rest, the thieves fled into the woods.Nevertheless, the raids continued for much of that winter. Not always did the military police get to the signal box in time; sometimes they came when the train was already moving again and the families were just about to vanish into the woods. I never heard of anybody being caught and punished. Why that is so I don't know. Children and women would have been easy prey. Did the soldiers and policemen resent having to leave their vehicles and follow the fugitives into the dark woods? Why were they occasionally late arriving? Were their barracks too cosy on these bitter nights? Were the raids over too quickly for decisive action? Or did they have a heart?"},

Austin, the gardener, and I cut back most of the roses, a job which should have been done long ago. we also started on cutting down last year's perennials, which really don't look very good anymore. The birds have had the seed by now and the partly dry and partly slimy old growth is pretty unsightly now. Some of the huge growths of clematis have been thinned out, particularly the ones which have been smothering the house at the back. we found five old birds nests in one climber.My eternal war against my arch-enemy, the evil lesser celandine, has resumed. Such a sweet little flower, and such a pest at the same time. I swear somebody comes at dead of night and digs in thousands of little bulbils as soon as I have dug them up during the day. They are very pretty in the grounds of the Castle around the garden but I DO NOT want them in the garden.Clearing the last remains of autumn's leaves off the woodland beds we found the pink pulmonarias in flower and the hellebore flowers are well on their way too. Was it as early as this last year? In spite of a harsher winter than usual the new growth on perennials and budding on shrubs is well under way. even the rhubarb heads are sitting up rosily.We used to say that gardening here in the Marches started about two weeks later than in the South East, where I gardened 12 years ago.

Still, he might manage to infuse the Tories with a bit of oxygenated blood. And give us all a good laugh.The other matter which tickled me is the perennial obsession with drink, or rather drinking to excess. So, now we have it straight from the horse's mouth,: drinking anything at all below the age of 15 causes brain damage. Aaaaah, my brain hurts.  In common with many children brought up in Europe (that bit cut off by the Channel), from an early age my parents encouraged me to sit at the dinner table at home with them and  accompany them to restaurants and cafes where drink was served with the meal. Occasionally, they would offer me some wine, usually watered down, always in my own glass, or a sip of beer. Beer was not a favourite of mine then, I found it too bitter. Most of the time I preferred to drink juice or water, even in my mid to late teenage years. Alcoholic drink was always available at home, although it played no great role in my parents' life.  Since then, I have only ever been drunk once; I felt so ill, I have never repeated the offence. I brought up my children to feel equally free to taste alcohol or not and they too have never drunk to excess. In fact, one of them now doesn't drink at all.I am not posting these remarks to prove anything, one example proves nothing. All the same, something needs to be done. workable solutions have to be found. These children littering the streets and bus shelters, waving beer cans around, effing and blinding at passers-by, uncaring of themselves, their future, their environment, are everybody's business and more than a set of guidelines is needed to save them."},
{"title": "Dying with Dignity", "date": "Tuesday 27 January 2009", "text": "The terms \" Dying with Dignity\", \"Assisted Suicide\", \"Euthanasia\"  crop up frequently at the moment and have done so for a while. I've even been to a drinks party at the beginning of this year where a discussion on the subject among a group of middle class,  middle aged and educated people became quite heated. Both among religious and non-religious people the opinions varied wildly. Surprisingly, the phrase \"God given Life\" was actually never mentioned, but a number of people expressed the fear that \"help with dying\" might turn into \"encouragement\", whatever form that might take.   Last Sunday's excellent BBC programme \"A short stay in Switzerland\"  showed the dramatization of the  real life tragedy of the death of Dr. Anne Turner and the way her family and friends coped with her decision to chose the moment of her dying. The play moved me so much it had me in tears at times.I was reminded of the last few days of my mother's life. The doctors at the hospital in Germany estimated that she would probably live for another 3 weeks, in great discomfort and exhausted with the effort of staying alive. She had almost given up eating and  drinking, in spite of being given only the softest and slipperiest of foods.  She knew there was no real hope for her; she also knew that these last weeks would be a great  struggle although she was not in any great pain.Medication kept her heart going;  we both knew, without it, she would go sooner. The medication made her ill; she felt nauseous constantly. On the day she decided she'd had enough - she was fully aware -, the nurse came, as usual, and put the cup containing the pills and her water glass within reach of her hand . \"Now take your pills, Mrs. S.\", she instructed Mama, not unkindly, but very briskly, and left. Mama and I looked at each other. She said: \"Take them, take them away with you when you go\". I hesitated  for only a few seconds, then poured the pills into my hand. Throughout the visit they stayed there. The next day I did the same, I removed the pills the moment the nurse turned her back on us. On the third day Mama got weaker. I was called to the doctor's office and told that they now thought my mother was sinking faster  than they had foreseen, was I sure she was taking her medication? Of course, I was; I was there when it was handed to her. Did they suspect? Even sympathize? Who knows. They warned me to prepare for the worst within days rather than weeks.And that is what happened. My mother died, very peacefully, in her sleep, four days later. She did not eat again, she took only tiny sips of water, the nausea left her and she seemed to be as comfortable as she could be. She had certainly become calmer, more settled, resigned. On Mama's last day of full consciousness the old lady In the bed next to her had a visitor who brought her tiny new child to see her. Mama watched with a small, crooked, a little strained smile on her lips. \"She's got it all before her\", she said. It was the last thing she said.Would we have said to each other  what neither of us had been able to say in our lifetimes if she had lived for another three weeks? Probably not. The dying are concerned with themselves, as are the old.Mama had plenty to criticize in me but I hope she finally approved of me in the end for what I helped her to achieve."},

He had some bad luck and got fired from his job - he's always been a touch belligerent and abrasive - long before his retirement age and never found work again. His abiding interest in life is art and he's quite a competent artist in a modest way - not that he's actually very modest about his abilities himself. She was a professional, a teacher, for most of her life. They came here when the big city had spewed him out and they created for themselves a reasonably happy and contented existence. (This is the sort of place where oddballs find a niche easily). Because he'd lost his job and she'd retired from full-time work money was tight for a number of years but their needs were modest and they made do. She was one of the first people who took me under her wing when I arrived here.We walked our dogs together and one of our favourite topics of conversation was religion, the various Christian sects, from established to fundamentalist. We also shared a love of words; it was a great joy to listen to her use of English which was precise and articulate, if a little prissy. Soon afterwards G. and J. had a great piece of luck: they inherited a fair bit of money and life should have become a lot easier for them. Most of the money had been left to J., but they were a close couple, G. took over the management of it and immersed himself in all sorts of investments.  It became a hobby. J. grinned and bore it, occasionally bemoaning his unwillingness to spend any of the money. Her wishes were as modest as ever but she felt that a couple of days away, a meal at the pub or a visit to a concert would have made a pleasant change.And then disaster struck: J. had a few \"funny turns\", she forgot things and sometimes couldn't remember the simplest words. She was getting old, she said. She told her doctor who sent her to have tests. J. was diagnosed as being in the early stages of Alzheimers. At first the changes were slow, gradual, hardly noticeable; her vocabulary wasn't quite as vast as it had been, she forgot dates and appointments unless she had written them down, our conversations became less fluent and effortless.One of the hardest things to bear was to see her respond to a piece of music,  crying silently, and not quite knowing why, feeling that something was horribly wrong.Eight years on and J. has disappeared into the void that is Alzheimers; J. is physically just alive but she has reached the stage of complete mental disintegration.G. has been very good to her, he has been a devoted husband, taking care of her, almost single-handedly, to the best of his abilities.Until now. J.'s condition is now such that she needs professional care, for one thing, she is doubly incontinent. She needs to be kept clean and warm. She needs more than the cheap pies and jam sandwiches G. feeds her on. G. is getting to the end of his capability, he is no longer a young man. G. is desperate to find help but here's the rub: he will not pay for it. He still sits on all of J.'s inheritance, but he will not pay for a carer. The hourly rate for a carer is £12. He refuses absolutely to pay what is for him a very small amount. Instead he begs for help from volunteers, rails at a system which will not take over J.'s care for free and becomes embittered and exhausted in the process. Frankly, I don't care that he's killing himself, It's J. and her pitiful state, whose needs are far beyond the help a volunteer, friend or neighbour could give, who breaks my heart."},

That's what I call civilization! Try it some time!The BBC's nature programme \"Swarms\" is great. If you've missed it try to catch it some other time. Vast numbers of a single type of creature are both fascinating and frightening. That goes for man as well. Nothing is as single-mindedly destructive as a horde.Another programme which is being repeated on Chanel 4 is \"John Adams\", about the American War of Independence. Brilliant. The photography is very special, the interiors might have been painted rather than filmed. First rate acting, too.But what has Channel 4 done with my beloved \"Houewives\"? A girl needs her escapism!"},

There's very little festive atmosphere to be had. We have the weather for it but the glow is missing. I'll have to tell you what is was like in the old country. Tomorrow."},
{"title": "greetings", "date": "Tuesday 9 December 2008", "text": "why would I want to have a blog? why does anyone have a blog? I've never even read a blog. Should I say a bit about myself to start off?  I live in the depth of the country, away from the fleshpots of the big city, although I've spent most of my life in London. Anyone who volunteers to bury themselves in the country needs their head examined. The country is good for the very old, the very young, those who've always lived there and those who've given up on life.I have a big house in a big garden in a very pretty part of the Welsh marches; I need to get into the car to go anywhere, although there is a butcher and grocer and hardware shop. The people are friendly, much given to holding  charity coffee mornings and gossip. My place in all this is very much on the periphery, I prefer it that way."},

What I'd like to do is write about the present and the past, rant a bit and rave a bit; mainly though I'd like to get my thoughts organized and find out if I have anything to say at all. If there is anybody who reads this blog, fine, I'll be happy. If nobody does, fine, I'm happy too.So here goes........"}
