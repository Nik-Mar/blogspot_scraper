And I didn't have icing sugar so I blitzed some ordinary sugar. I didn't photograph it before I decorated it as it looked as though it should be in the bathroom - if you get my drift. It doesn't look much better decorated as it has a shiny, lumpy quality that didn't get any better with knife smoothing. Putting it on a wooden platter may have helped the composition of the shot but I'm not convinced. Under the suspect icing is a homemade Swiss roll. (I didn't have greaseproof paper which didn't help the rolling up after it had baked!)Anyhow - Happy Yule Log Day to all.PS DH thought it was delicious.

The bowl I took from the fake wreath table decoration in the back room.It now has the poinsettia as its centre - plus some lights.These lights will stay up for all  of January to light the gloom in the new year.xx"},

The planner is a Filofax Classic Cross which won't mean much to most people but will to Filofax devotees! It's very battered and is the first one I purchased a long time ago. I have a few more now which seem to have formed a 'collection'.It opens up to a welcoming card that says it will soon be Christmas. Soon will, won't it!A couple of dividers set the festive scene.Ok, a couple more than a couple. The first section is a Christmas Checklist which notes things to do for Christmas from October onwards - check cards, buy presents, stock up with food and so on. There is also a post Christmas Checklist which tells me to write notes for next year, start a gift list, sort decorations before putting away and write Thank Yous.The next section is all about cards and gifts. Here I have the list of addresses for the Christmas cards.Each person has their own page with their address, names of all the family and any notes about them that they have written in their cards, eg life events since their last card. I also note when I receive their card and when I send the card.Information about gifts received and given are noted in this section plus a list of presents I have and suggested presents for the next year.The food section houses a Christmas Shopping List ...and ingredient lists for Christmas baking and cooking. I put some Christmas recipes in there too.ereThe final section houses notes about the present year - what went well or what didn't and notes for the next year - suggested decorations, where I've stored everything and general conclusions about the festivities.Let's end with the Wise Men following the star.Merry run up to Christmas.xx"},

Everybody wins. Good game? Why not join in. Here's my idea.I have put together 10 items, homemade, given or thrifted from the CB or CS. There is only one item that is new to me. I will send these items to one person who may choose up to three items to keep. They will then have to replace those chosen with some items of their own (no edibles or perishables please). Now it will be their turn to post on their blog to find another recipient. Once found they will send them ten items with the directions I have just outlined (I've repeated them in italics at the end of this post.)My ten items are:-1. A frilly, knitted scarf (I was on a roll when I knitted these!)2. Knitting for Tommy book which I received as a bloggy gift a while ago. It's time to pass it on.3. A flowery stamp.4. A set of 4 coasters.5. A glittery beanie hat in white and silver.6. A pad of note papers with pen.7. A selection of my crocheted motifs - Christmas stars, tree, hearts and more.8. A Suduko book.9. A monkey keyring.10. A small Me to You teddy with a pink coat.This idea may or may not get off the ground as it depends on who is interested and who wishes to spend money on posting a small parcel. I have a page already set up a page to record each step of the parcel's journey and we should be able to view quite a few new to us blogs along the way. (My first parcel chain seemed to stop at the first post so let's hope this one will be a little longer.)So here are the directions for the:-One, two, three out of Ten Chain Game1. Leave a comment to be in with a chance of receiving the parcel. Include the words 'Yes please, count me in.'2. Choose up to one, two or three things from the parcel and replace the items to make ten.3. Comment on the One, Two, Three out of Ten Chain Game page on Mumssimplyliving blog when you've received and sorted out your new package and posted on your blog.4. Decide whether to post just to the UK or to the world!5. In your post make sure you have these directions.I am only posting to the UK because of the weight of my package so my apologies to readers from across the seas.Remember that you must have your own blog so you can post the progress of your parcel. I will put all names into a hat and draw out a winner in one week's time.

Today I had my savoury mince with boiled potatoes and tomorrow I'll spice it up more with a bit of chilli powder and flakes and serve it over rice.The compost heap took care of the peelings and kitchen roll which was used to wipe out the wok.xx"},

Out came the pine cones, which will transition nicely into winter decorations - how many weeks is it until Christmas?In the kitchen the harvest is being brought in - ie a corn cob which is busy drying out in the desiccator.At weekend I will pick off the dried up French bean seed pods and save the seed.

In others’ eyes my life is an epitome of success.However, aside from work, I have little joy. In the end, wealth is only a fact of life that I am accustomed to.At this moment, lying on the sick bed and recalling my whole life, I realize that all the recognition and wealth that I took so much pride in, have paled and become meaningless in the face of impending death.You can employ someone to drive the car for you, make money for you but you cannot have someone to bear the sickness for you.Material things lost can be found. But there is one thing that can never be found when it is lost – \"Life\".When a person goes into the operating room, he will realize that there is one book that he has yet to finish reading – \"Book of Healthy Life\".Whichever stage in life we are at right now, with time, we will face the day when the curtain comes down.Treasure Love for your family, love for your spouse, love for your friends...Treat yourself well.

This one being for a pets' charity that needs blankets for the animals. We know that our hard work will be going to a good cause and we may recruit more knitters and crocheters along the way. My task was to sort out the pattern - number of stitches and size of needle and then to sew or crochet the squares together. Hope the project blossoms.This next pic is of my blanket in progress. The ripple blanket is so satisfying to crochet and I'm using up my DK stash. It will take me some time to finish but I'm in no rush.I've also been crocheting 'scrubbies' which are for washing up. They are crocheted from yarn that is actually strips of netting. The scrubbies don't work as well as ordinary scourers but look quite good around the sink.

Items are brought in, things moved around, clothes changed. Order and cleanliness doesn't last very long when activity and creativity are present. Illness, of which our family has had more than its fair share, doesn't help on the house maintenance front.

The gaps in between the radiator and the wall are dusted with my trusty 'not feather' dusted which fits brilliantly into the tiny area and helps prevent a build up of dust and detritus.(Perhaps I should call it my 'tickling stick'.  RIP Ken Dodd.)This same duster can also do picture rails and high up places easily.Other spots to thoroughly clean are the windows, of which there a are quite a few in this room, the dresser (waxed every blue moon), the floor and the lights.

Some Illuminations are up all year spanning the road.Most of the smaller tourist attractions are closed over the winter.Madame Tussaud's remains open.We turned off the promenade and headed inland a little. The shops here are quite rundown and many empty and in need of repair.Back up to the prom now and here is one of our 3 piers.In the distance now the Big One at the Pleasure Beach can clearly be seen. The sun was in my eyes most of the way.There's the Mirror Ball.Past the archway and straight ahead is St. Anne's. The new tram sheds are on the right and I'm sure I took a picture of a tram but it doesn't seem to be here.The built up promenade now gives way to sand dunes and today sand has blown all over the road.Heading into the town the area becomes more built up.Past the park and ...I alighted on the main street. Here the buildings are more well kept and the architecture is more attractive to the eye.Still bright sunshine and still a biting wind.After a quick walk up and down the main street I caught a bus back home.

I've trained the stem onto a wire at the back of the greenhouse which runs parallel with one of the offshoots of the main vine.All the unwanted growth was removed from the main vine stem.The side lead was trimmed back so the stem can clearly be seen.The main lead runs down the centre of the roof and quite a lot of growth has been trimmed away. The end of the lead has been cut back.All neat and tidy now and ready for next year.The showers came before I finished the strawberry patch. The cutting of the Chinese lantern plant from a friend has grown well and the lanterns are a welcome autumnal splash of colour.They clash with the leaves of the blueberry bush though.Thank you garden for all your produce this year.

This bigger vine has survived transplanting from growing in our kitchen to growing in the greenhouse. Each year I prune it back to the bare bones - usually in spring. Throughout the growing period I am continually cutting back the pieces I don't want. On the bigger vine I have 2 main leads, one running down the centre of the greenhouse and one over to one side. I cut off all the side shoots in spring and then wait. Quite a lot of side shoots will grow from the main stems. Wait until you see a bunch of grapes and then cut off the side shoot one leaf after the bunch. More side shoots will grow - just keep cutting them off.Here's my very last bunch of grapes.Unfortunately I only ate about 3 of these as the rest are definitely 'past it'.The vine leaves have started to fall.This is a picture of our most recently planted vine - (planted about a year and a half ago). The roots were planted outside the greenhouse and the shoot trained in through a gap to the inside.Our main vine comes in along the same wall. It's much thicker as it's much older. See the side shoots? They can be cut off.The stem grows up to the middle of the roof of the greenhouse ...... and travels the whole length. A side shoot off the main stem has been trained to run along one side of the greenhouse.Here you see the side shoot. From these main stems other side shoots grow and on them grow the grapes. (Grew the grapes.)All the leaves will eventually fall off and then I will be able to see the skeletal vine. From there I will start to prune back long and unwanted shoots.To sum up - prune to however many leading stems you want. From those leading stems prune off any side shoots you don't want. The vine will grow like mad in the growing season. Keep pruning to keep it in check and in some form of order.Hope this helps, Dani. I will post whenever I get out my secateurs so you can see the vine's progress over the year.xx"},

The husks will be taken off and the corn cobs frozen.

Only another grill with cheese and tomato and then you will finally rest.Now pear, I've already eaten one of you and one has dropped off into the strawberry patch and run away. Please don't drop off until you're a little softer and I can eat you for afters.Keep bright and cheerful, apples, your bedtime isn't until October.Strawberries, you are going to need a haircut before you go to bed.

The sorting took all afternoon because this room houses craft stuff and 'things' I want to keep at the moment. Here's a local newspaper pull out from 2003 which lays out future plans for Blackpool. We don't look a bit like the front cover yet. Obviously this dream is not likely to become a reality at the moment.Here's a picture drawn by DD when she was 3.

I have 3 sewing machines but do not seem to have time or inclination to use them. I love looking at old patterns though.I have a storage cube of cross stitch patterns, silks and threads which I should really get round to sewing. Time, again, is needed as well as the desire to complete everything. I think I gave up cross stitch when I couldn't focus properly.Oh dear - I shouldn't have emptied the storage unit.

This blanket became one of their favourite places to visit - such a warm, welcoming cocoon. One day rat was having a meander around the flowers of the blanket when he saw a small piece of yarn sticking up. \"That shouldn't be there,\" he thought and gave it a quick nibble to see whether it would go away. It did go away - right into his stomach. \"Wow, that tastes great!\" he cried and proceeded to chew a little more. Only a small hole was made so it wasn't noticed as there were other holes around in the blanket. Another day cat was having a quick roll around the flowers in the blanket, sunning herself and basking in the warmth. As she rolled she caught her claw in the hole made by rat. \"Oh, drat that rat!\" she cried and pulled her claw free. In doing so a little of the blanket unravelled and made a yarny tail for her to play with. It was great fun. She could even chew on the ends of the yarn and it made a squeaky sound. Such adventures. The chewing staved off the hunger pangs until Humom arrived home from work.Humom, upon seeing the blanket, folded it over in order not to see the holes being made each day. Eventually the Mum blanket looked like this.Everyone was very sad - except for the rat and the cat, who thought it was great sport.Time for Super Mum to sort out the mess ......xx"},

I did walk down the road and back plus did a bit of weeding so I have had a little more exercise.xx"},

The small basket of small balls of wool needed tidying so I spent some time rewinding wool to get it looking tidy again. I left this messy lot until last.I also wound back all the projects I'd started but not completed, which was very satisfying and I ended up with more small balls of wool. One crocheted square I left and added to it to make a cover for my new 'phone. The added bit folds over the top so the 'phone can't fall out. I needed additional  padding inside. (Who's good at dropping 'phones?)So I made use of an old mobile cover. Poor chicky had lost one eye. When I'd finished with him he was minus the other eye, his beak and his 2 legs.He was then tucked inside the pink and red cover and crocheted in. An added feature was the lanyard clip. (Who's good at dropping 'phones then?) I need mine attached to me at all times.The addition of 2 eyes made the cover a little bit more appealing. So - one thing led to another!Here's looking at you!xx"},

Just a small shop this week as I've still got plenty to go at in the fridge and freezer.  My shopping chariot accompanied me as always.The large gateposts of former large buildings still remain. Very imposing.Along quite a few walls I espied miniature gardens basking in the sun.Horse chestnuts are in full bloom.Shame about this person's supper. Mustn't have liked the taste. The street is very handy for dropped litter. This is just one of many items littering the streets. Not much dog poo this morning though! I wish people would take their litter and pet c-rap home with them and then I can focus more on where I'm going rather than looking downwards all the time. Rant over.Another wall garden of various ferns.In a seaside town one has to have seaside tables.The street was a heady delight of perfumed blossoms especially the lilacs. Shame we can't have smelly blogging. Spring is definitely here.My chariot comes in handy when shopping.

The mange tout is growing well and the lettuce doing nicely. The potatoes are peeping through.Directly in front are the strawberries and some already have flowers on them. The strawberries have survived the trampling when the greenhouse was overhauled.To my left are the leaves of the plum cordon. We've never had many plums from this - perhaps I prune too brutally!To my right is the greenhouse which contains 2 grapevines and the tomatoes. Soon a cucumber will be planted in there. I've pruned the grapevine to within an inch of its life but it has produced numerous bunches so it must be happy.Behind right is the apple cordon with quite a few blooms. Hope they grow into apples.Left in the bed is a blueberry bush with quite a few flowers - within picking distance of the bench.Also left is another grapevine bought for a pound from a nursery that was closing down. Already it has grown up to the top of the pergola and needs a bit of a train. It does not have grapes on yet.Below are some weeds that have been pulled from the strawberry bed. Each time we sit out I have a quick pull up of the never ending weed visitors.In front to the left is the edge of the edible plot and part of the patio area.It's been a lovely sunny day here.

A sort of homage to the writing and presentation techniques of the bloggers.So, hello everyone. First day of a new month. Let’s hope the weather hots up and then we can have more days out and about in the garden. It looks like it’s going to be a fresh and warm day today, without the gusty winds which we had yesterday. Just right for a Bank Holiday car boot maybe.In spite of the wind I managed to get quite a bit done yesterday as well as fitting in my walk, which was up the road and back and down the road and back so making 2.2 miles in total. There was some time spent in the garden hoeing weeds and inspecting the plants in the greenhouse. The corn is now a couple of centimetres high and the grapevine is going great guns. I’ve started pinching out the side shoots on the tomatoes. I’ll probable get some more time in today to do some more hoeing (must keep on top of those weeds) and then I’m going to plant some runner beans outside. There’s already one runner bean sprouting which must have been dropped last year. I shall leave it in and give it its own support.I forgot to make some bread yesterday so that will be first on the agenda today. There’s nothing to match home made bread. The shop bought versions are limp alternatives which taste of nothing and disintegrate in the mouth. Other tasks for today include making a chicken casserole (still eating from the freezer - only 2 shelves to go) and going for a swim. My walking will be around the car boot and walking to the gym. Breakfast will probably be a bacon butty at the car boot so this will last us until we eat the casserole at tea time. We may have some fruit or a small snack at lunch time depending on how hungry we feel.We will have no rest in the evening as it is the evening for our music group. Should be fun and afterwards we’ll flop in front of the TV to watch a new series. All in all a very full day which is just the way I like it. We've been sleeping better recently but last night the fences were rattling due to the wind. Needless to say they were fixed yesterday so tonights sleep should be noise free.Hope your day will be productive and full.Please look my Simply Delightful Blogs to find out whose style I've tried to re-create here. :)"},

It came from a clematis spilling over the walls of the parking area from a house next door. The top of the wall was covered in white blooms. When we had finished shopping a stray cutting of this beautiful plant landed up in one of our bags. That was a couple of years ago. It's not until this year that the cutting has really taken off and our 'rescued' plant is going growth crazy.Other plants in the garden are growing too. The mange tout came up in 10 days and is heading upwards to its growing frame. The ancient lettuce seed is springing to life and will soon need to be thinned out.We planted a bench in the strawberry patch and I can pull out weeds while I'm sitting in the sunshine.The rest of the edible garden is slowly being planted up as the warmer weather sets in. Already planted is beetroot, potatoes, fennel, kale, spring onions and leeks.The grapevine has had quite a few trims to keep it in check and another vine is growing in from the outside.I planted some Lidl-iddle lettuce (which had roots) in the greenhouse and they have started to romp away. I just pick a few leaves off them when I need them.I saved some seed from the corn from last year to plant this year and it's just starting to grow. The cucumbers and courgettes will soon join them.All is well in the garden.xx"},

It had pretty pictures on so I just cut round them and stuck them on different card bases.This Thank You card I made originally about 10 years ago with a detachable inner and it's moved to recipients and back to me quite a few times with just the inner replaced each time.The felt cut out trees were made when I was working in a school and were left-over shapes that weren't used in the classroom. They've been languishing in a box and used over the years to decorate home-made cards.I often use cut-outs from other cards and re-use them for my homemade ones.My craft room looked like a bomb had hit it after I'd finished this lot but it is now tidy.

Most of my Christmas wrapping paper has been used and I've not bought any more as I use material bags to 'wrap' the family presents. This bag was made from an old shiny gold top. All I did was sew the bottom up.Fill with presents then just tie the shoulder straps together. Other bags have been made from clothing or material in shiny, Christmassy colours.This year I tried something different and wrapped some presents up in a scarf - shiny and Christmassy of course. The recipient has a present on the outside as well as the inside. The scarves are bought very cheaply from the CS.This scarf wrapped present is adorned with festive tassels and decorations.Only a few more presents to wrap now and another task is ticked off the list.xx"},

Rant over now back to the post.My present to DD's partner is a Beer Advent calendar. I've purchased 24 bottles and I've just finished the numbered hats to top them with. The hats are made out of those Christmas cards that hang around for years and years in the Christmas card box. I'm sure you know the ones I mean. I've put them to good use now. Just half or nearly half a circle bent round to form a cone and a natty little decoration on the top. This next one is a portrait size card fringed at the top and selotaped to make a tube.    Grr! I still can't move the cursor down by the pictures.Here's one that looks like a crown. The bottom is decorated with some stick on santas. On this one I cut round the picture to make the top. I did 4 of each design. Tops all done now, beer bought - just a crate to find before the 1st. xxGrr!Cheers!"},
{"title": "Questions", "date": "Sunday 20 November 2016", "text": "1. What was the 'best bit' of yesterday?2. What was the most exciting thing you did?3. What was the most boring thing you did?4. What was your 'good deed' for the day?5. Did you achieve what you set out to achieve?Aren't I being nosey! One day tends to blur into another sometimes and the days and weeks rush by. Nothing seems to stand out much and life can be pretty hum drum at times. But is it? Some activities must stand out above others. Here are my answers to the above. They aren't sensational as life isn't most of the time.1. I had candles lit around the bath. O.K. so they were the battery lights as we don't use real candles but the lights were low and the candles flickered - very relaxing.2. Ah, exciting. Well exciting for me. I tried out a new chicken casserole recipe that popped up on Facebook last week. It was good but very same-ish so I will add my own embellishments to make it more interesting next time.3. I brush the kitchen floor every day but it takes me a while to dustpan the crumbs up at the end of sweeping. I will avoid it because it's so boring. It gets done eventually.4. Always do at least one good deed a day - good girl guide style. I called in at the CS and gave them a bit of help for about half an hour. No trouble as I was passing. (Plus I had a nosey round the shop for any bargains.)5. Yes, I did - all my list was crossed off, not that it was very long in the first place. Saturdays are put things away days so all that was done and hobbies pursued.xx"},

They've taken quite a long time to put together as I had to write 18 different letters which corresponded to 18 different items. The items are trivial but mean quite a lot. Each letter and item are put into an envelope to be opened at certain times during the year.For instance -Open when …you are missing me.Open when …you need peace.Open when …you're happy.Open when …you're down.The recipient lives quite far away so I've included - Open when …it's your birthday.Open when …it's your Anniversary.The first card to be opened is the Open Now envelope which explains the whole process and lists all the sentences on the envelopes. Here's part of my letter.\"Dear ……, Your present this year is a box of letters. What? Why write letters when we can Face Time or send each other messages and texts? There's even a telephone we can use. Well these letters are for certain times in your life to help, guide or encourage you. If you read the envelopes you will be able to see those times……..\"Only the Open Now and the Open when … it's Christmas envelopes are to be opened on Christmas Day.I've enjoyed putting these small notes together and decorating all the envelopes.

The first lot was wholemeal.Another cuppa was ready to be made.The floor was swept but the bits not picked up because ...my second batch was being made - white this time.While I was at it I decided that the Christmas cake needed its first feed. There's whiskey and cognac further along the counter.My burnt on casserole deposits from yesterday were being given a seeing to with bicarb and a damp cloth. I'm leaving it to soak in before I wipe them off. I'd done 'pulled pork' slow cooked pork on a bed of garlic, onions and carrots with a little stock to keep it moist. Left in for 5 hours it came out really well and is enough for a few meals.2nd batch made and final floury bits wiped up.Must stimulate the brain while doing all this practical work so while I was buzzing around I noted down a few other things for the shopping list this week. I always go with a list so I know exactly what's in my cupboards. The other writing on the paper must be some measurements for the greenhouse. I tend to re-use any scrap paper. It's surprising how much accumulates.Apples nearly ready - have to be quick otherwise they go brown and I'm not giving them my lemon for my drink.It's 10 o' clock now and at this particular moment I'm typing this post and drinking my lemon.

It is Sunday after all and today began as each day always begins with breakfast in bed with a slice of toast (no butter, just Marmite) and a grand cup of tea. A discussion of the day ahead and then off we go.9.00 - Tidying up the kitchen while DH gets on with the greenhouse renovation (big job this). Ingredients are gathered for a second Christmas cake and the bread is started. Today it is granary loaves. While this is going on I'm sweeping the kitchen floor, sorting out the rubbish, wiping down doors and under the sink.10.00 - I'm washing my hair and cleaning the bathroom sink. Break for DH and he calls upstairs that he's made a cuppa. Tea for him and a hot lemon drink for me while we have a little sit discussing how cold it is outside and how the weather forecast had been correct with a shower this morning just as he was up the ladder. After this I'm here upstairs typing and then I shall finish off the bathroom and write a few more Christmas cards. I've a few things to look up on the computer and then I'm going to clean the brass.11.00 - The brass has been cleaned, the last of the potatoes dug up from the garden - there were a few more hidden in the soil and the veg has been peeled for the roast later on. I'm going to make some soup with the left over chicken cacciatore, an onion and a stock cube. DH will need something warm when he comes in.12.00 - It's din dins with the homemade soup and an apple for DH, fresh fruit salad for me while listening to the Sunday Politics. Afterwards I'll put the barbed-wire plant I bought from Lidl last week back into a pot as I've read that it is a tender plant. It will have to go inside over winter as I would hate it to be killed by a frost.1.00 - I've just prepared all the ingredients ready to make the Christmas cake and am now sorting out my list for next week's shop. I don't need much particularly, just a top up of fruit and a few tins. Another Toblerone might fall into my trolley seeing as it's nearly, no-where near Christmas. I'm going to change my clothes (tut, tut, not got up yet) ready to receive a visitor/friend later on this afternoon. My cake should be smelling good by the time he arrives. The beef roast will go in later to be ready for tea. I've had to look up the constituent spices of mixed spice again as I've still not bought any.2.00 - Christmas cake is made and now I'm just awaiting our visitor.3.00 - Visitor has left so back to roast tea preparation. I went into the garden and dug up some leeks for a leek in cheese sauce dish and also picked what are definitely the last of the runner beans. Sauce made,  roasties peeled and beef ready to put in the oven.4.00 - Break time here for a quick drink and sit reading a magazine before tea which has been scheduled for 5.00. The bread is kneaded again into loaves to rise once more in this next hour. It will go in the oven when the roast comes out.5.00 - Tea time - roast beef, roast potatoes, leeks in cheese sauce, carrots, runner beans, gravy, horseradish, mustard and mint sauce followed by baked apples with boozy fruit (left over from the Christmas cake). We're full now.4 diddy cakes and 2 mediumGranary bread this weekThis evening is a bath and relax on the computer with a final hour of viewing the TV. Sunday done and dusted.Alright, it was 8 to 5 not 9 to 5. Not to worry. Hope you had a wonderful day.xx"},

It's a long job. He built the greenhouse over 30 years ago with reclaimed materials. The wooden roof struts are teak which was originally shelves. The ends have rotted but the majority is salvageable and in this second reincarnation of the greenhouse as many old pieces are put back into play as possible. New wood is bought only if absolutely necessary. The dentil mouldings have had to be remade with each little piece of wood cut and glued into place.

Leave to set for 10 minutes before turning out.Mine's not the neatest of looking cakes and the pears I used were very, very small and hard.It tasted fine though.My notes on my recipe paper were:-No way can breadcrumbs be formed by rubbing in, the mixture just sticks together. It is very heavy and sloppy. The cake smells delightful. Made it with Toblerone instead of dark chocolate and substituted nuts, fruits and seeds instead of just hazelnuts.I had mine piece with custard and DH had his with spray cream.

There is no need to set up any pictures as participants may submit from 1 picture up to 20, so no stress is involved to complete the lot. This opens up the challenge to anyone who doesn't want to tackle finding all the pictures.2. Pictures may be taken from personal collections and personal blogs so hunts in computer picture galleries are encouraged. Doing this may help to 'tidy up' the 100s of pictures that many of us store on our computers.3. There will be plenty of time to collect pictures as 'The Hunt' will run until the week of September 19th to 25th and during that week I shall post my finds and links to other Hunters can be made via the comments. There's no need to post pictures before the 19th. Posts can run throughout the week.Here's the list. The connection between the picture and word can be explained or left to the imagination of the reader and I have deliberately not put the indefinite article (a) in front of each word to allow for more interpretation. e.g. Sight could have a picture of eyes or a view (or perhaps a messy bedroom)!Mistake could be a DIY gone wrong or a spelling mistake on the high street.1. dream2. possession3. passion4. wonder5. source6. tune or song7. wink8. comfort9. thought10. glance11. spectacle12. inspiration13. sight14. beauty15. arrangement16. grace17. weakness18. elegance19. smell or aroma20. happinessHere is a list of the participants but, as always, please join in with the odd photo or two if you wish to join the party this week.

Spotted it yet?Here it is tied around the largest corn cob.These two will be eaten for tea.The Lidl cut and come again lettuce that was planted a while ago has now matured into large lettuce plants.It saves on trying to sew fiddly seeds. The small lettuce plants for 60 something pence grow really well.So does Lidl mint.Our potatoes have stayed in the ground long enough and have grown really large. All the top leaves have died down and it's quite difficult to spot where the potatoes are. Perhaps I need some more markers!xx"},

I very carefully take everything down and knot the various bits of string together to make a new ball ready for next year.Each year most of our toms are held up with very knotted string. My large cone of string has been going for many years because of this re-using.I must take down all the tomato plants whether finished or not because of ...… DRY ROT.

I then concentrated on some serious bedroom sorting.Knickers, bras, bags, scarves, gloves and shoes have been tidied, summer clothes put away and winter woolies taken out.Wardrobes and contents of drawers have been straightened.In the craft room I took stock of my material stash, folded, refolded, chucked and put away so I could see everything.I found some Christmas material that would be ideal as a table cloth.I still hoard this lace which is ideal for cafe curtains (I'm never, ever going to make cafe curtains) and the broderie anglaise fabric is so pretty (no ideas for that at all).I've noted a few jobs to do such as make some re-useable bags for Christmas out of the shiny materials, start another cot blanket (found some more fleece backing) and look through my dress patterns as I've plenty of fabric. There, that's the list well and truly sorted!xx"},

Whizzed with a whizzer this will make 4 portions of soup, one lot today and one lot for tomorrow.The courgette had grown quite large (very large), (along with 2 others), so I had to slice, de-middle then cube it.My runner beans will be a veggie addition to our roast chicken tea with roast onions, tomatoes and courgette as another offering. Can't wait.Later - we've just finished lunch and the soup was good. I think I'll write up this combination in my Foodie Filofax utilising my planner pages from I rescued from the CS.

{"title": "Crochet Pocket Travel Tissue Holder", "date": "Tuesday 23 August 2016", "text": "I thought I'd post the instructions on how to make the crocheted tissue holders from yesterday's post. They are very simple and only take about half an hour to make. These tissues from Lidl have spurred me on to make enough for our music team.Crochet Travel Tissue HolderI used a 4mm hook and DK yarn and the crochet terms are UK so one UK dc is the same as US sc.Chain 92 dc in 2nd chain from the hook.1 dc in every stitch until the last stitch.4 dc in the last stitch.1 dc in every stitch on the other side of the foundation chain until the last stitch is reached.2 dc in the last stitch. (This stitch contains the first 2 dc.)The holder can now be worked in rounds - if so slip stitch to the first dc, or in a spiral by just continuing in dc. I continued in a spiral putting 1 dc in every stitch and going round and round.Gradually the work will curl itself upwards.Keep going ...and going until the holder is as high as the tissues. Stop at one side.Ch 1 and turn.Dc to the other side. Ch 1 and turn.Dc to the other side and ch 1.From here decrease one stitch at the beginning of every row until you can decrease no more.Chain 10 for the button loop ...and slip stitch to attach it back to the flap.Dc all the way round the top opening and slip stitch to the beginning of the button loop.Sew on a button from the button box, insert a pocket tissue and you're done.Bless you all.xxPS The stitch can be varied to suit your fancy from the beginning of the spiral - half trebles or trebles or combinations. Experimentation will produce individual holders. More than one colour can be used to create a spiral or striped effect. Just make it up as you go along. I'd love to see any ones that are made from this idea."},

I saw these in Lidl and thought of Christmas - as you do! I'm busy crocheting travel tissue holders for our music group and these are going to be ideal as they have more interesting covers than normal ones.I also bought a pair of scissors for the kitchen as the ones we have already are blunt. These will be for best.I'd run out of lemons for my lemon drink so they went in the trolley too. I hate to throw anything away so as it was play (stay at home) day I had a pleasurable morning recycling. The tissues went into the crocheted tissue holders and the lemons' bag I made into a wool holder by threading 'that pesky ribbon' from my dress through the top. The plastic scissor holder is now a handy needle holder and the label made a present label with another 'pesky ribbon'. My wool shouldn't tie itself into a knot now.A warm welcome to my new readers and commenters I hope you enjoy popping by.xx"},

There's no need to take off your shoes as a masher will squash the grapes quite adequately.Mash away.The resulting mush can then be strained through a sieve and the resulting juice - drunk!It's a bit cloudy as I only filtered once and probably pushed some of the mush through the sieve but the resulting juice tasted just fine.

I always feel as though I'm milking a cow when I harvest these into a waiting basket. I use 2 hands to pull them off and they then drop down.The Ildi, with trusses of small fruit, are ripening fast now and have come early this year. There are waterfalls of yellow on one side of the greenhouse.Above is a waterfall of green with over a hundred bunches of lovely grapes.

Just double crocheting around the top would do.For the 2 pulls I did a foundation chain of 100 and then slip stitched along and fastened off. The pulls were woven around the top about 3 rows down and the ends fastened together.

I can keep them fresh in there for up to a week and they don't deteriorate like they did when I kept them on a shelf. The mercerised cotton works up a treat in UK trebles with a small hook.

If I have to go from one room to the other I just stay and tidy the room that I'm in.

My 3 rounds made quite an acceptable triangle for my odd shapes blanket but once extended became less and less like the isosceles triangle it was supposed to be. Angelika wanted more than 3 rounds on her triangle as she was making a hammock for her friend's cats out of a T-shirt strip. Here's one of the cats on her crocheted Cat Cave ) - what a wonderfully cosy creation. The hammocks are to be used somewhere else.Angelika gave me permission to reproduce some of her email which may be of help to others who wish to make a Cat Hammock.\"Hi Mum,… here are 2 cat hammocks (as well as a sleepy cat, two mice).  As a bonus, there is also a cat cave : one of the 3 cat recipients has already taken possession of it.  Note that the roof also acts as a hammock... with holes in it so that they can bug each other inside&out.I still had to pull the sides to maintain the right angle.  I also increased as I went along: when ever it would get too tight, I would increase, either from 3 to 4 clusters, or from 1&3 to 2&4 in between.  Changes are about every 3 rows.  Keep in mind that I am working with t-shirts which are very bulky and unyielding, compared to yarn.  When changing row, I would always go to the corner hole before adding the new color, so a few scs.  Then 3 scs up (=1st dc) and the rest.  for the last corners, I used 3 plastic rings to reinforce and just sc'd around it till I got back to the beginning.The one to the right is made with all the leftover yarn, so colors and rows do not exactly match!  To finish it off, I made a finger crochet cord and attached an empty film canister: great for a cat to bat around!  After the picture was taken, I unraveled the white on the hypotenuse and redid it with 2stog in the holes, instead of 3sc.  That pulls it back together and created a hammock rather than the 3rd side hanging out like a pouting lip.Well, that is it for my experiment with t-shirt yarn.  I had fun. but it will be a while - if ever - that I'll use that again.  Ah, the bliss of real yarn!  Thank you so much for your instructions.  That first row is crucial!  It might look funny, but it sure does the trick as nothing else does!AngelikaPS: ...The instructions for the other things also come from the internet.  I just adapted them (reinforcing the sides of the cat cave is my creation but I am not giving my secret away!)\"Thank you Angelika, I've had great fun chatting with you and now I'm going to look up - crocheted cat caves. I feel a new project coming on!PS from me - did you spot the 2 mice?PPS - just received another email from my virtual bloggy friend - No, the cat cave is separate.  It is meant for the cat to be cozy inside, but cats have a mind of their own...The hammocks will be hanging in the corner of a room, hence the requirement that they be a right angle.  My friend will put a hook in the corner and 2 hooks on the adjoining wall - for each.  ... The end product is 18\"x18\" or maybe slightly more, in 7 rows.  The t-shirt yarn was cut at 3/4\" and is a mix: mainly cotton but with a bit of other stuffs.  With an 8mm = L hook. PS from me - Live Bloggy Action here! Great stuff.xx"},

{"title": "For Angelika - Isosceles Granny Triangle", "date": "Thursday 30 June 2016", "text": "Angelika enquired about how I made a right angled granny i.e. half a granny square, as she landed on this post. Unfortunately I'd not posted the instructions on how I achieved this and could I remember? No, of course not as I'd made it up as I went along. I emailed back and said I'd experiment again so here is my up to date version of an isosceles granny triangle.The crucial part is getting the first round correct. I don't think this second attempt is exactly the same as the first but it does the job.First chain 3 - this is the base.Put your finger on the last chain and chain a further 2 which stand in for the first treble of the cluster.Chain 2 trebles into the chain marked with your finger.Chain 2 and then work another cluster of 3 trebles into the same chain. (This is the first corner.)Chain 1 and work a cluster of trebles into the next chain which is the second chain of the first 3.Chain 1 and work 2 clusters of trebles separated by 2 chain into the first chain. (This is the second corner.)Chain 1 and work 2 clusters of trebles separated by 2 chain into the middle chain of the first 3. (This is the third corner.)Join with a sl. st. to the first cluster.There should be 3 clusters or shells across the hypotenuse and 2 clusters down each side. The 3 corners have 2 chain separating the clusters and the sides - 1 chain. Now it's just like any other granny square except there are only 3 sides. In each corner work 2 clusters separated by 2 chain and on each side work one cluster separated by 1 chain. I suggest that if you want your corners sharper then a 3 chain gap may achieve that. (I've not experimented though.) Here's the second round.And here's the third.To make the first 3 chain stronger they could be chained with double yarn.I've not tried a 3, 4, 5 triangle but I'm sure the same principles will apply. I'll try one later and slot it in below.Hope this helps, Angelika.xxPS Apologies for the pictures not being clear and the rushed annotation - so excited to do the triangle. (That's my excuse!)Edited an hour later.This isosceles triangle pattern will only work for 3 rounds as the more rounds you add on, the longer the hypotenuse should get. I've worked 5 rounds here.As you can see I've altered the red round and done doubles instead of trebles. I also chained 2 in between at the sides on this row. For the white row I just crocheted doubles - as many as would fit in and I chained 3 at the corners. If this needs to be larger I would continue in this way. For a large triangular blanket an equilateral triangle is probably the way to go (it starts like an ordinary granny but with 3 clusters instead of 4) but it will have 60 degree angles as opposed to a right angle and 2 x 45 degrees. I'll keep going until I have a few more rounds.Thanks, Angelika for the challenge. O level maths has not deserted me!xxEdited more than an hour later.I've finished 10 rounds and my conclusions is that just dcs are needed on the hypotenuse in order to keep it straight.You can see that I tried to go back to clusters on the last round but it put the line out slightly. Maybe I should have left 3 chain instead of 2 in between the clusters or, to be on the safe side, just left it as all dcs.Angelika - you need to get yourself a blog so that I can see your finished creation in action!xx"},

{"title": "Whoo, hoo ...", "date": "Monday 27 June 2016", "text": "I lost another 2!Two pounds lighter this week and I'm not at all hungry or craving more. I have a very small breakfast - just one slice of toast with a cup of tea. I know it's recommended that dieters eat a large breakfast but I want to do this losing weight my way with as little disruption to my 'normal' diet as possible. My lunch consists of home made soup or something to do with eggs - 2 at the most and one slice of toast followed by a piece of fruit. My main meal is a 'normal' for me meal, just a smaller portion or a larger one minus anything really fattening. e.g. half the plate vegetables and only very small portions of meat, if any. Suppers are still there but I'm cutting down the portion size and the 'going back for more' aspect!My exercise is still the same as before dieting to lose weight and if needed I could possibly do more. I don't think I'll add anything to the formula this week and see what happens next. I'm nearing my first target weight and I'll see how I feel when I reach it. Now I can fit into all my jeans with the waistbands comfortable and not digging in. My bras are not tight either.Thank you so much for helping me - I could not do this without you spurring me on. The fact that I know others are 'watching' me makes me more determined to achieve my goal. I'm very close now and another few weeks should get me where I want to be.I'm hanging on in there!xx"},

Nearly half a stone gone, the clothes fit, the inches are lost and I feel much better about myself. I'm determined to take off the next half stone though so it's onward and upward with the same regime.Today I've had for breakfast one slice of toast spread thinly with Marmite.Lunch was one and a half scrambled eggs (DH had the other one and a half) with a few tinned tomatoes plus one dry slice of toast, followed by fresh fruit salad. Tea will be steamed veg and chicken followed by fresh fruit salad. My downfall is having a supper so I shall focus on cutting down or eliminating them altogether. Suppers have been crackers or muesli, a sandwich or a some left-overs from tea time.Supper today will be a few prawns from Lidl. I shall put them in a small bowl and nibble them slowly. And not have them served up as a prawn cocktail. And not have them in a sandwich with a packet of crisps! And not follow them with a slice of cake or some more crackers. And not secretly raid the choccy raisins! Oh dear my secrets are out. I shall report back on the subject of suppers next week. I shall need all the support I can get as I'm starving at suppertime.xxPS Pam, I've posted your parcel. There's an added small pressie in there aswell if you want it.

I'm having trouble cutting suppers altogether but I have cut the amount. Numbers 1, 2, 6 and 7 I can do fairly easily.My focus this week will be to add more veggies than I do already to my meals. The veg will be mainly mange tout as they are growing thick and fast. I shall do smaller portions of more fattening meals (I can't give up all my favourite meals) and leave the larger portions to non fattening foods.My clothes are less tight now which is good.xx"},

All is growing well and we will soon be eating the potatoes as these flowers have been on for a while. The Mange Tout are waving about in the background. Hi there.

Over to the left are broad beans and in the middle are sweetcorn which are just getting going.The dingily dangly mange tout grow from a flower in about a day! I don't need to string them and they take very little cooking - just steamed, stir fried, boiled for a while or eaten raw.A mountain of strawberries await us.The chive flowers make a wonderful show with the foxgloves opposite them.A very important part of my Morning Routine is picking off the side shoots of the tomato plants. In the past I have been very lax and they have grown all over the place in the greenhouse. No more - it's in the routine and off they come. I thought every other day would do for an inspection but no, daily vigilance is required to eliminate these little blighters.I thought I was doing well until I spotted this one sprouting from the base of the plant.Oh no! And this one is nearly another large plant.Most of the other plants are growing straight upwards, if a little wonky!Now they are receiving maximum light from the side windows.

Good game? Why not join in. Here's my idea.I have put together 10 items, homemade, given or thrifted from the CB or CS. There is only one item that is new to me. I will send these items to one person who may choose up to three items to keep. They will then have to replace those chosen with some items of their own (no edibles or perishables please). Now it will be their turn to post on their blog to find another recipient. Once found they will send them ten items with the directions I have just outlined (I've repeated them in italics at the end of this post.)My ten items are:-1. A frilly, knitted scarf2 - 6.  A Christmas stamp, dolphin cutter, wooden bookmark, fancy paper notebook and a pink necklace.7 - 10. A crochet book, a packet of Christmas or greetings card blanks with envelopes, a new hair slide and an Egyptian themed stampThis idea may or may not get off the ground as it depends on who is interested and who wishes to spend money on posting a small parcel. I'll set up a page to record each step of the parcel's journey and we should be able to view quite a few new to us blogs along the way.So here are the directions for the:-One, two, three out of Ten Chain Game1. Leave a comment to be in with a chance of receiving the parcel.2. Choose up to one, two or three things from the parcel and replace the items to make ten.3. Comment on the One, Two, Three out of Ten Chain Game page when you've received and sorted out your new package and posted on your blog.4. Decide whether to post just to the UK or to the world!4.

{"title": " Weight update", "date": "Monday 16 May 2016", "text": "Veggies and fruit have always been a major part of my diet but the weight piled on with puddings and chocolate. This last week the focus was on no bicciesno chocolatefruit for afters if I want afters and no sherry.I'm full and feel guilty for being full. Here's a sample of one of my meals. I lightly sprayed a non stick pan with sunflower oil and stir fried some sliced mushrooms with garlic granules and soy sauce. I added some spinach at the end and this concoction joined ...a small baked potato, some salad dressed with balsamic vinegar and one sausage - it's in there somewhere. The plate is not as artistic as Ilona's as I just tend to pile it on.Afters was a fruit salad - just cut up pieces of strawberries, blueberries, apple, melon and grapes.Thank you so much for your support.

In order to de-stress, (I wasn't particularly stressed but as the deadline approached I felt I ought to be able to find all the pics), the entire challenge I have made up my own rules.1. There is no need to set up any pictures as participants may submit from 1 picture up to 20, so no stress is involved to complete the lot. This opens up the challenge to anyone who doesn't want to tackle finding all the pictures.2. Pictures may be taken from personal collections and personal blogs so hunts in computer picture galleries are encouraged. Doing this may help to 'tidy up' the 100s of pictures that many of us store on our computers.3. There will be plenty of time to collect pictures as 'The Hunt' will run until the week of September 19th to 25th and during that week I shall post my finds and links to other Hunters can be made via the comments. There's no need to post pictures before the 19th. Posts can run throughout the week.Here's the list. The connection between the picture and word can be explained or left to the imagination of the reader and I have deliberately not put the indefinite article (a) in front of each word to allow for more interpretation. e.g. Sight could have a picture of eyes or a view (or perhaps a messy bedroom)!Mistake could be a DIY gone wrong or a spelling mistake on the high street.1. dream2. possession3. passion4. wonder5. source6. tune or song7. wink8. comfort9. thought10. glance11. spectacle12. inspiration13. sight14. beauty15. arrangement16. grace17. weakness18. elegance19. smell or aroma20. happinessIf you wish to sign up for this Hunt the Pic then please leave a comment.Happy Hunting!xx"},

He likes the branches festooned (good word).3.   Outside lightingHere's the lighting outside our loft window. 4.   A starThis is the wooden Christmas star from Germany which has decorated the kitchen for the last 5 or 6 years.5.   A snowmanThis is one of a few snowmen collected over the years. He's sitting and watching goings on in the kitchen at Christmas.6.   A puddleThis picture was taken in December after about a week of intense rain. The day was sunny but wet underfoot. It was the only puddle that I could find that didn't have a bit of litter floating about in it!7.   Berries and/or nuts8.   A wreathMy homemade wreath celebrated Hallowe'en (a pumpkin!), Autumn (with added leaves and foliage) through to Christmas (with added baubles and glittery bits). It was made with a roll of orange ribbon bought for 50p from a CB sale. There's still plenty left.9.   A tree that has lost all its leaves10.  A windy dayA very windy day, of which there are many in this seaside town (noted for fresh air and fun), sees the seagulls gracefully riding on the air currents.11.  Your favourite puddingIt has to be fruit and especially fruit grown in the garden especially to eat on a summer's day.12.  A fancy buttonThis button is one of many that were bought to put at the top of crocheted Christmas Trees. It's only fancy in that it is very colourful.13.  Street artThis is what normally springs to mind when thinking of street art - a person beavering away drawing artistically on the pavement.But isn't this 'art' on our promenade?Or, perhaps, an artistic silhouette one sunny day.Or, maybe this person riding his unicycle along the promenade showing off the 'art' of juggling. I think a click on the picture will show him in more detail.14.  Afternoon teaAfternoon tea is always on at the Tower Ballroom. Here you see lots of tables set ready for visitors. There is a group nearer to the dance floor that have their food already.15.  Candle lightThis is a Christmas decoration from Germany with the candle hidden inside a hollow carved piece of wood.16.  A chimneyChimneys in the local vicinity remind us of a bygone time when many houses had coal fires. It's surprising how tall chimney pots are when viewed close to.17.  A ladderThere are a few ladders in amongst the scaffolding on the Big One at the Pleasure Beach.18.  An arrowThis arrow points the way to the Illuminasia indoor lights exhibition at the Winter Gardens in Blackpool.19.  A fountainThis unusual fountain is outside a garden centre, hence the watering can and the flowers.20.  CutlerySpot the cutlery on this party table.21.  Your own handwriting (this one is compulsory and cannot be substituted)My handwriting as you can see can only be described as 'scruffy'.

(So much for my organising system.)I bought a super-duper shopping trolley from the CS with built in seat and clip fastening bag (detachable no less). (It was not a colour of my liking so my next project is a super-duper shopping trolley cover!)I received my copy of Heart Matters through the door and enthused with a Yeah! :}It's all happening here.

{"title": "Nine to Five", "date": "Saturday 12 March 2016", "text": "It seems to have been ages since I posted a Nine to Five day. I shall put that right now.9amWhat am I wearing? Long, black, stretchy dress - do I wear anything else around the house?What am I doing?I'm tidying the kitchen while I keep my eye on the cat in the garden. Each morning I wipe surfaces, sort the re-cycling into compost, tins and paper, sweep and mop the kitchen floor, load or unload the dishwasher and then make a coffee and a lemon drink.Where am I?In the kitchen of course.What's the sky like?Cloudy and overcast and when I went outside it was cold, too cold to paint the fences which is what I was going to do if it had been warm.What's motivating me?Having a clean and tidy house plus the incentive of a sit down with a cup of lemon when I've sorted out the kitchen.2pmWhat am I wearing?Same as beforeWhat am I doing?Listing some items on Ebay. I need to sell some more 'stuff' to feed my Filofax habit!Where am I?In the loft room where I read, crochet and work on the computerWhat's the sky like?Same as earlier on. I wish the sun would peep through.What's motivating me?Sorting, de-cluttering and the thought of doing more crocheting in a minute. I've already made 2 dishcloths with some cotton yarn from the stash. I thought I'd do some coloured ones which I can wash with our clothes, rather than white ones which 'fester away' in the laundry basket waiting for some light coloured sheets to be washed with them. Most of our clothes go in the coloureds or darks wash.5pmWhat am I wearing?Same as before.What am I doing?Eating tea - fish and chips with tinned tomatoes.Where am I?In the back roomWhat's the sky like?Same as earlier on. It's definitely been an 'in' sort of day.What's motivating me?Each mouthful of fish, chips, tomato juice, tartare sauce and vinegar. The flavours meld together creating a feeling of culinary satisfaction. I'm looking forward to a nice, hot bath and a relax after a non-busy day.Actually I've done quite a bit so perhaps I should do a '9 to 9' post or an '8 'til late' post.I'm linking to Thrift Deluxe's blog today as her blog is called Nine to Five.xx"},

The weather does not feel right and we only ventured out because it was not raining, cold or windy.Some seeds needed to be planted though - a row of parsnips and a nursery bed of leeks. Puss cat is helping but she does not stay out for very long. Being an indoor cat she would rather be in the warm. Each day she goes for a supervised sniff around but then she scuttles in quickly.The edges still need weeding. The small patch of grass I leave because Puss cat enjoys a chew. It's best to leave her outside for at least another 5 minutes, just in case she throws up - as cats do when they've eaten grass. We seem to be making a collection of compost bins. The Daleks are secretly going to take over.March will see a lot more planting and soon this edible garden will turn green again.xx"},
{"title": "Menu Planning", "date": "Tuesday 23 February 2016", "text": "I've struggled long and hard with menu planning (not really). I normally just go to the fridge and see what's in there that needs using up. Or I'll take something out of the freezer the night before.However,being a Filofax aficionado and would be organising guru, I thought I'd have a go.My planner post is here, which I posted yesterday. The same day, I read this post and thought it quite a chatty way to menu plan, so, with apologies to Jackie here's my take on it.MondayRoast chicken, I think, which I've taken out of the freezer. I must make a note to pick up another one when I'm next at the shops. I'll serve this with roast potatoes, carrots and possibly peas from the freezer. I'm trying to run down the veg that I've got stored in there. I'll make some stuffing from a packet.TuesdayWe won't have eaten all the chicken so we'll have some with chips tonight, tinned tomatoes and mushrooms. There'll be some stuffing left too.WednesdayHaving smaller portions (It's a diet thing!) will mean there will be some chicken left to put in a curry. I'll use up the peppers that have been in the fridge from 'I don't know when' and add in some frozen home grown veg from the freezer. There may be some mushrooms left in the box too. I'll serve it with rice.ThursdayI doubt if there'll be any chicken bits left to make a pie but I know there'll be some rice and curry left over for me and DH can have a chop from the freezer with a baked potato.FridayIf I've been to town yesterday I'll call into the market for some fish. We've tried haddock, hake and halibut. It's about time I moved on to another letter. (Any suggestions?)SaturdayEasy peasy day so I'll use up a couple of ready prepared meals from bulk cooking. Let's hunt the liver and onions for DH and the bacon, leek and potato bake that I made the other week for me.SundayI've probably succeeded in not going out for a big shop this week. I'll raid the freezer for some mince and probably make spag bol. Lunches as usual will be some sort of egg concoction or soup made from one of the meals and breakfasts will be toast as usual. DH has butter and marmalade on his while I just have Marmite.xxPS This post was written on Monday, the planning was done on Sunday."},

The Brown squares were just too depressing to carry on with. Mind you, Puss Cat seems rather depressed with all this modelling.I just crocheted 4 large squares together, added one for the under belly and one for the under neck.It does the job but is rather loose.My second attempt was with my Granny Rose squares, the pattern of which can be obtained from Apple Blossom Dreams blog. I crocheted them together in the following pattern but did not crochet where I've placed the ribbon.That loose square tucked under and linked with the other side to form a neck band.The two outer edges were joined together underneath. My joining was a crocheted line of doubles,with a jump over of one chain at each crossing point.There were plenty of ends to sew in.\"I'm very depressed.\"Here's the finished coat on a real cat model.xx"},

It's only in its infancy at the moment but here's a first walkthrough.My monthly divider cards are made from and old calendar. I probably don't need monthly dividers but at the end of the year I will be able to see how much I've done each month.The first section is for Ebay listings. I'm trying to de-clutter and one way of getting rid and recycling at the same time is by selling on Ebay.I have made an opening section to quickly list in order the items I intend to sell. The top headings include date of listing, starting price, whether auction or buy it now, postage price etc.Following on I have more details for each item and a place to put the proof of posting.The next section is for ...my foreign language practice and includes various exercises from different course books.The third section (and on this divider I have stuck a photo of some dance friends) is ......for notes on different dances. I'd kept a few handouts in my gym bag and now I have the ideal place to store them. My intention is to use this section as a reference for the different dance steps.I have quite a few other hobbies that won't necessarily end up in this organiser. For example my recipes have a book of their own. Our music group sessions are recorded in a separate book too. Crochet, knitting patterns and more recipes are stored on my computer.I wonder if I should start a Gardening Section or list my Lego collection. If I'm not careful I'll end up as just having the one hobby of - organisingwith no time for anything else!xx"},

The climbing plant is still climbing ...… and climbing… and climbing. It's attached itself to the ceiling and the wall.It's also branching out over the top shelf.I bought some green mugs from Wilkinsons as they were only 50p. The green oven mit is from B and M but it doesn't really work properly. I can still feel the heat through it.

The socks turned out looking like socks ...Looking goodStill looking goodWhoops… but my poor workmanship can be seen around the heel. My picking up of stitches leaves a lot to be desired. Ah well, back to the drawing board. I think I'll use four needles next time.Not organised (as normal) on the crocheting front either. Crocheting blankets is very relaxing so I decided I needed (no I don't need) another one and this time I've chosen to go with shell stitch.Colours are rather difficult now as I'm getting to the end of my DK single balls of wool. My approach to projects is somewhat laissez faire, organic, creative - I really can't find the word. I start with only one outcome, in this case a blanket, choose a starting colour and hope that I've got enough balls of wool to finish the blanket, whatever their colour may be. The same approach applies to the size of the blanket. I just crocheted a foundation row until I got fed up (making sure it was a multiple of 6 plus 2) and then started the pattern.Four rows done and it looks very smart but how it will turn out I haven't the faintest idea.

Wiping a skirting board in a room is so easy that I tend to do the picture rail aswell.)Monday, Wednesday, FridayClean a toilet and a sink.Saturday/SundayClean the hob or ovenClean the brass on the front doorAs and When NeededDo the washingDustMopVacuumEach DaySparkle one room.(Put things away in the correct place and have a quick flick round with the hoover or duster.)In our house it's -Monday - the back roomTuesday - the kitchenWednesday - the hall and stairsThursday - a bedroomFriday - a bathroomKeeping to the list ensures that eventually you will have cleaned the whole house.

I had picked up a magazine from the CS and we tore out some pages and stuck them together in a long line. We had 3 strips of 9 pages which we used for wrapping round the sides of the box. the top was covered in 4 pages stuck together.FC was particularly impressed with the shabby chic of the torn pages and the fashion style of the pictures. I had to keep chivvying him along as he kept sitting down perusing the pages and not getting on with the job!Once the box was covered it needed a little glitzing to make the present wrapping complete. From my bits and bobs box I unearthed a fluffy pink feather boa, a pink butterfly hair clip and an off cut of tinsel.Wow, he was impressed.He was so impressed he forgot what was in the parcel and had to ask me.

(It may help.)* Open it out and fold 2 sides down to the crease.* Turn it over and fold the other 2 sides down to the crease.* Now fold the whole shape in half.* Turn it over. See where I've placed the scissors?* Fold the top bit down at this point.* Fold up the little point at the bottom.* Turn it over and there is the tree.I used some glue …… to stick down the springy bits.What next? Why - make umpteen more of course and then decorate them.I just signed the back with a Sharpie pen - no need to put who they are for as they are just a quick greeting for special groups of friends.xxPS You may find this version of instructions easier to follow.I'm linking my Advent Calendar with Julie's Scrapbook."},

{"title": "Favourite (at the Moment) on Friday", "date": "Friday 23 October 2015", "text": "Looking at my old, junior school report, it seems my handwriting must have started off quite well but I've never really found it easy to produce neat writing. My style could be described as messy and untidy or, as I like to think, 'highly creative'. Do you remember the first forays into writing with ink? Again, it was in the fourth year at junior school that we were allowed to write with a fountain pen. My goodness, did we think we were cool! The reality was the pens were a devil to fill from the Quink ink pot, resulting in very blobby blotting paper and/or work and permanent blue fingers. My favourite ink colour was bright blue as opposed to blue/black ink and didn't we welcome the coming of the cartridge pen where the ink was enclosed in a small tube that just slotted into the pen. We still had blue fingers, though, as we were forever squeezing the tubes to make the ink flow.My choice of colour now is black and the design of pens has come a long way since I was in junior school. My favourite pen for writing is this Pilot B2P (bottle to pen). My writing flows beautifully (even though the end result is still untidy) with this roller ball.Another pen, which is a favourite is the Pilot Frixion Ball - I've only just noticed that they are both Pilot pens! I hadn't the faintest idea what a friction pen was until just recently. The ink can be rubbed out with the end of the pen. I use this pen in my 'Bullet Journal' and rub out an awful lot. :)For colour I've chosen …… the Wilko Friendly Fairies glitter roller pens, only for the fact that they produce glittery, shiny pops of colour on a page.And Staedtler triplus fineliners in 'Brilliant Colours'. I've chosen these, only for the fact that they produce 'brilliant colour' on my pages. :} (I also like taking them out of their slot and putting them back in - oh sadness!)The next Friday Favourite will be a favourite plate for meals. I wonder if other people have favourites of the moment.1. teddy2. mug and/or cup3. drinking glass4. pen, pencil or writing or drawing implement5. plate for meals6. shoes and/or clothing suggested by (Mac and Janet)7. hobby8. place suggested by (Rachelradiostar)9. self-indulgent treat suggested by (johnnyjumpsup)xx"},

{"title": "What's in my Filofax? What's not in my Filofax?", "date": "Sunday 11 October 2015", "text": "This notebook is not in my Filofax. It's a handy portable size that fits in my bum bag if needed. In it are just jottings to remind me what I would like to do on a particular day. If I have a sudden brilliant brainwave I can write that in too as well as places I need to go and people I am going to see. The jottings are in the form of a Bullet Journal - there's a whole new notebook world out there - just google Bullet Journal and you will see some of it! It appeared to me a good way of organising my scribbles so I'm having a go and so far it works a treat.It basically is \"... a customizable and forgiving organization system. It can be your to-do list, sketchbook, notebook, and diary, but most likely, it will be all of the above. It will teach you to do more with less.\"The video below is a very quick overview of the system.So far I've started my October pages and have decided on my bullet point key. A few days have been logged and the notebook has been a very helpful source of information I've collected and things we've done and intend to do. As in some organiser 'traditions' I've tried my hand at decorating the pages with a few doodles. You can see how artistic I am!!! The bottom picture is suppose to be a tree which we saw that was full of crab apples.the treethe crab applesSome of the information I'm logging may help in my Filofax home organisation. Here's a quick tour of Filofax 1.My tabs in this organiser are:-HouseActionIdeasInformationPasswordsandAddresses.This organiser is simply a reference section for my daily diary.The house section is divided into:-MonthWeekFoodRoomsFinanceThe Monthly pages have sticky notes with my intentions for that particular month. These goals can be fed into my daily pages so I am motivated to 'get things done'.In the Weekly pages is an overview of suggested tasks for the day which basically boils down to -* necessary as and when tasks - vacuum, laundry, dishwasher stack and empty etc* suggested daily tasks to clean one toilet, one sink and vacuum one room with a choice of either cleaning a shelf, cupboard, drawer, skirting board or picture rail (which I've called swing tasks). I also aim to focus on a very quick overview and tidy of one room each day. The theory is that I'll have sparkling loos and sinks all the time and over time all my cupboards and drawers will be sorted and kept in order. :}The food pages are just a log of freezer and cupboards so I'll use everything I buy.On the rooms pages I've listed parts of the room to clean and these can be ticked off when I've done them. Once they're all ticked I'll either add to the list or 'go round again'. These pages feed in to the weekly task routine.The finance pages just keep a log of supermarket shops and cash expenditure.On the action pages I've listed jobs that could be done under different headings e.g.. Garden, Christmas, Music, Miscellaneous. Again these tasks can be chosen to be done on different days as and when I have time and inclination. It's very satisfying to tick off a task. (Sad, sad)Also in the Action pages is a list of birthdays and cards that need to be made along with ...… further pages detailing the tasks for the run up to Christmas and pages for lists of presents and cards received and sent.My Diary Filofax (number 2) contains a monthly page view where I mark in birthdays, anniversaries, important dates and notes plus '2 page' weekly spreads. On each day I have my Daily tasks listed plus one or more other tasks which will fit in with the day.Here's an example of a week that I've made up. Daily tasks are done from Monday to Friday, appointments written in and any other relevant jottings added. I've also put a quote at the top and the rooms I should concentrate on to get tidy.I've made a handy 'puller outer' on to which I am able to stick a shopping list which I'll then take on my next shop.My bullet notebook has fed in well into my routine and so far all 3 organisers are working well with the house reasonably tidy and clean. I've been able to remember (or been reminded to remember) things and am able to capture thoughts and ideas as soon as they occur.I hope it all lasts!xx"},

I did save an Ebay write-up about a similar panda.Here is a wonderful looking Panda teddy bear, made by Chiltern and dates fromthe 1950's. He is a charming looking bear and comes in great condition. His coatis made from black and white mohair, which has signs of play wear, but to beexpected with such a nice bear. There is obvious wear on his belly, around hisGrowler. His eyes are made from amber and black glass. His nose and mouth havebeen typically stitched into the Chiltern Shield. His head is filled with woodwool, while his body is filled with sub. He has a great working tilt growler inhis belly. He also has a small tail too. He is unjointed but can sit and standeasily. He sadly no longer bears his label, but the is no mistaking hisorigins.

The wool was 50p and the needles and hooks were £2.Following the Christmas theme I spotted a Country Living mag for 20p, Christmas cards for 20p and more ribbon - all 5 for a pound.It looks like I'm getting prepared for next year too as I couldn't resist these Easter cutters for 50p.It was all smiles this morning and the sun shone.I've also managed to weed and cut down in the front garden, clean the brass and wash down the front door and outside downstairs window sills along with the front step.It says in my diary'Day of Rest' so I'm off to sit in the sun room and read my mag.

Fast eaters who were visiting last week had it in their mouths long before they worked out it was not another lump of chicken. That'll teach them to eat properly at my table! They did beg for courgette mercy after 3 days though.Jo28Have you tried Courgette Lasagne? I spotted it on a blog and made a note of the recipe but not whose blog I'd read. They found it on the BBC website:Creamy Courgette LasagneDawn McHughI am doing Piccalilli this week end and courgette is going in that :-)JanI slice them very thinly and saute slowly in a little butter and canola oil together with finely diced onions. I add a few spoonfuls of ketchup and a dash of soy sauce, sprinkle with Italian Seasoning ( or just dried oregano or basil) until very nicely done! Delicious side dish. The zucchini I use are about cucumber size.DaniFound this recipe for your surplus marrows… : Zucchini noodle shrimp scampi with avocado sauceHere are some of my uses that I've recorded elsewhere in the blog.Courgette SurpriseSlice the courgettes and drizzle with olive oil. Season with black pepper and a little salt. Bake in the oven for about 15 to 20 minutes then pop on some tomatoes. Tinned toms can be used if real toms are not available. Place some sliced mushrooms a-top and finish off with grated cheese. Mine was a mature cheddar. Put back in the oven for a further 15 minutes.Grated Courgette sauteed in butter Cook as the title suggests.Added Ingredient to other dishes eg. Shepherd's Pie or CurryAll Sorts Soup* tomatoes from the garden* left over broccoli* stock cube* onion* courgette from the garden* left over beansSaute the onion and courgette.

I watched several videos before I became competent with the four strip plait. Here's the finished product but I thought the colour was a little boring.Plan B - Use different colours. I had no more fleece apart so I thought I'd cut some old T-shirts into strips.The strips weren't very long but I persevered and …dog pull number 2 emerged. The knots had to be pulled really tight.Result - Too small. Now how can I cut the T-shirt to make the strips longer? Hang on, I've got an old fleece jacket. Use that. I couldn't remember how to cut a long strip from a rectangle but by trial and error ...Plan CI made a plan. Fold in half and cut up to the edges.Snip at the appropriate places to make one continuous strip. I rounded off the corners and then set off using two pink strips and two yucky brown strips.The knots have to be pulled really tight and pulling one strip at once was better that pulling opposite pairs. I worked anticlockwise using this method.Now that's much better.When I get four different coloured strips the pattern will be different.The hardest bit was tying the knot at the end. I had quite long strips so the largest pull was fairly easy to knot with longer ends.This video shows how to cut a continuous length and how to braid.

{"title": "Bought or grown?", "date": "Sunday 28 June 2015", "text": "Rachel's comment from yesterday has inspired this post which is basically a list of some of the vegetables we have grown and are growing,  comparing flavour and suitability for a small garden plot.Hi Mum, … .. Those courgettes look mouthwatering and it's true that things taste amazing that you've grown yourself. The only one exception of mine was when I grew broccoli. The plants were MASSIVE. I was on caterpillar watch. The first harvest was plucked, raced down the garden into the kitchen and eaten lightly steamed within 10 minutes. It tasted EXACTLY the same as shop bought!! I was gutted!!I'll start with broccoli.Fruit or vegetable: Broccoli/ CalabreseTaste: I agree with Rachel here. They taste the same as shop bought but are a little more tender.Suitability for a small garden: Not really suitable in my small plot as the plants grow big and it's a faff harvesting the small shoots. If there's a large head then, once harvested, the rest of the plant doesn't produce much and is a waste of space. Butterfly watch is essential and if the eggs are missed then searching for the caterpillars is very off putting because they are exactly the same colour as the plant. I've cooked more than one!*****Fruit or vegetable: TomatoTaste: Absolutely wonderful, especially the first one and they taste nothing like shop bought.Suitability for a small garden: A greenhouse is needed - out door tomatoes take up a lot of room and most need staking. Tumblers are good but I've found the skins tough.*****Fruit or vegetable: AsparagusTaste: Nothing like shop bought. Steamed with butter and water for 10 minutes or so and they are mouthwatering. I add a little bit of salt for extra taste.Suitability for a small garden: They take up quite a bit of room and crop from April to June. I've found that full sun is advantageous. Beware slugs which eat the tops as they peek out from the soil. When we planted ours we had to wait 4 years before the first pick.*****Fruit or vegetable: CabbageTaste: As shop boughtSuitability for a small garden: They are large plants and I don't grow them anymore. We don't eat loads and it's more cost effective to grow smaller plants.*****Fruit or vegetable: StrawberriesTaste: Hmmm! Forget the ones from the shop.Suitability for a small garden: I've just let ours grow in a separate bed from the main plot and give them a haircut at the end of the season. The runners plant themselves. Always cut them in half before eating. There may be a surprise inside.*****Fruit or vegetable: GrapesTaste: Fresh and sweet, totally different from shop boughtSuitability for a small garden: Ours grow in a greenhouse but certain vines can be grown outside.*****I've not listed everything we grow, just a few for our small garden. I wonder if anyone else grows veg. that they have found taste the same as shop bought. One thing I have found is that home grown veg. does not keep as long as shop bought. I wonder what processes they have to go through in order to keep a long shelf life!?Thanks Rachel again for the inspiration. You will note that I haven't mentioned your night time activities!!!!!:)xxWelcome to my new follower."},

{"title": "Replying", "date": "Wednesday 24 June 2015", "text": "Questions answered.Dani asked if I had any tips on pruning grape vines. I have done a post here on my pruning this year. In previous years I only had one main lead and then let shoots grow from that. I have been told that when pruning do not use cutters just pinch the runners off by hand. This year with 2 main runners I've kept the off shoots quite short with only one bunch on each off shoot. I pinch the runner off after the next leaf. I've given it about 3 prunes this season as runners tend to grow very quickly.Cheryl asked if a grapevine would only grow inside. The grapevine we have is for growing inside but its roots are planted outside. I wrote about the type of vine here. There are many varieties that can be grown outside. Here's a link.It's been a glorious day here today. I've walked and danced, baked and cooked and now it's rest time.xx"},

The broad beans have now started to develop pods.We are still eating our way through the potatoes and the onions are fattening up. I'm sure I could start eating them once my shop bought ones are finished.At last the corn is starting to grow properly. In front is the garlic.Sweet peas are taking off up the second frame along with the climbing beans.I wouldn't go under there puss!The asparagus is being allowed to grow but I still harvest one or two spears every now and then.There must be over a hundred bunches of grapes on the vine. I've pruned it again today as it was escaping out of the roof window.Come on the tomatoes. I'm afraid they are being over shadowed by the vine.The chives are putting on a pretty show and poppies are springing up everywhere.I must watch the strawberries now they have started to ripen.Check done, weeding done.

{"title": "One word ...", "date": "Saturday 20 June 2015", "text": "… in Eternally 28's post caught my attention and I thought, 'I wish I could do that'. Waffle!I'm finding it hard now to put words down here. My writing style as you may have noticed is very simple - just say it with no added extras here or there.  I read many blogs, just look to the right, and everyone's writing style is different - matter of fact, descriptive, informative, creative, witty, intelligent. They are a pleasure to read each day. Thank you to Johnnyjumps up and Eternally 28 for sharing their jar storage. Not only Kilner jars have been used but also jam jars and other glass vessels. I bemoaned the fact that we throw away an awful lot of beautifully shaped jars which contain coffee, jam, oils etc.. I'm sure if I thought hard enough I could re-use them as containers. Finding a  place to put them is harder the more I collect though. Plastic bottles also come in great shapes and colours. Isn't it a shame that we buy them and then chuck them. Now would you put a question mark at the end of the previous sentence? I was just stating rather than questioning. My sentences tend to be very short (for the teachers out there I don't think I've passed Level 3 yet). I was never one to talk much and I certainly didn't want to put my private thoughts down on paper for a nosey teacher. Perhaps that's why I preferred sums to words. Yet words intrigue me. They can mean so much in so many ways. What I read in a post may not be the same as another person. I wonder if my idea of a person behind a post is correct if I met that person in real life. Would their personality be the same as the one I have formed in my head from reading the way they put their words down on their blog?Are you the shy one, the introvert, the do-er, the worrier, the family one, the fun loving one or the 'get on with it' one?Would you have put two full stops after etc?There are a lot of 'I wishes' out there, I'm sure. My wishes are very simple. I've tried hard and I think I may have succeeded. Just one word inspired this post. Hope you've lasted to the end. Hope that others write a post on their glass storage containers. Hope that others have some ideas on using throw away glass jars. Please forgive this load of Waffle!PS It's a great word Rachel. Thank you for the inspiration."},

{"title": "Day out ...", "date": "Tuesday 16 June 2015", "text": "toExplore Formbywhich was a National Trust area around the Formby coastline. We went to see the Red Squirrels which live in the trees there and the first we saw was at the entrance where we paid (an awful lot) to go in and park. Beautiful little animals but no photo as I didn't have my camera out. Never mind. Once parked we took a walk around the Squirrel Wood to search for more. Did we see any more squirrels - not one. Not to worry. We went on the Asparagus Trail next to view the asparagus fields where the asparagus is planted in the sand. We had a little bit more luck here and espied the one field. The picking season looks like it's over and the spears are being left to grow into ferns.Various sculptures were dotted around the place.These are rather large spears!Heading back to the car we walked around the Squirrel Wood again and managed to spot the other, sorry, another red squirrel in the distance! Not many people walking around had spotted squirrels. Apparently there was a serious outbreak of squirrel pox in 2008 and the population is only just recovering.Don't look too closely, There is a squirrel up there but I can't find it,no matter how hard I look. It was there, really! Elusive little dears.Next stop on our day out was to Crosby to view Another Place with Anthony Gormley's figures on the coastline. Just our luck - the tide was in and we couldn't see that many. A very expensive ice-cream later and the tide went out enough to go and view a little closer. Each of the figures seem to be exactly the same.Someone had felt sorry for this poor man and dressed him up in a jumper.There were 100 of these figures there but it didn't look that many as they were all spaced great distances apart. We had a good walk along the promenade and the sands.I was more impressed with this superbly designed block of flats at the entrance to the car park than I was with all the figures.xx"},

I took her some bluebells from the garden to cheer her up.A walk back home and a little sit again to read some mags then on to prep for tea which was veggie curry and boiled rice followed by a creme egg (whoops! They did need eating up.) One last walk in the garden before a bath and study session (which may have been interspersed with more crocheting).A little viewing of the big screen before a bedtime read and a zed.Busy day and done good.xx"},

Only one slice for me with Marmite (love it or hate it). Breakfast tray taken - UpstairsBreakfast in bed of course with a cup of tea.Getting up is a leisurely process which, as well as ablutions, involves cleaning sinks and/or toilets and checking E-Mails etc.DownstairsPut breakfast things away and tidy the kitchen of debris, crumbs and last night's supper plates. Time now to take the cat a walk in the garden where I sweep the path  and hoe the weeds which seem to spring up overnight and shoot up very, very quickly after a downpour. The cat tray needs emptying.Inside to put the kettle on for a coffee (him) and hot water with lemon (me). The coffee is taken - Upstairs… to the office after which I goDownstairs… to straighten the cat covers in the back room, sweep the garden room and shake the blanket which is on the sofa. Straighten up the mags and put the newspapers for recycling. Hey there, I've found a little bit of wool on the floor which I can use for my Rainbow blanket. Now to sweep and mop the kitchen floor (note to self: don't have a black kitchen floor next time) and hoover downstairs. Ironing beckons which I always try to get out of the way after a wash is dry. Today it was 3 napkins, 2 large T-shirts (his) and 4 tops (mine) 3 of which were bargain pound rail tops from the CS.Busy tops for busty lady! Let's camouflage!The dried washing also entailed folding up a million Tea towels. I'll just put all these specs in one place so DH knows where to find them. They always tend to go walking just when he needs them.Upstairs… to put away the ironed clothes and tidy the bedroom. Clothes just seem to appear on the floor. Where to put clothes after being worn is always a problem if they are not ready for the wash basket. Should I fold them and put them on the bed, on the floor, hang them over the wardrobe door or what? I tidy a top drawer as I'm putting away and hanging. Considering I don't wear all that many clothes the drawers and wardrobes tend to get into an awful mess. Dust the dressing table, that's a good girl, where does it all come from?Downstairs… to put the kettle on for the next brew.Upstairs… to deliver the coffee. Straighten DD's old room briefly and dust the surfaces. (Note to self: redo the shelves).Downstairs…  to sit in the garden room and drink my lemon and decide on what's for lunch.Lunch is beans on toast (one slice) with Worcester Sauce sprinkled over. Afters is one banana and 2 satsumas. Listen to Moneybox on the radio.Walk the cat and inspect the garden again.Upstairs… to find my crocheting and Downstairs… to sit in the garden room with the cat for a little bit of hooky wooky and to log my day here.xx"},

I have been out weeding, hoeing and planting the sweetcorn plants and French and runner bean seeds. More needs to be done but I'll have another go tomorrow if it's fine.I shall go clockwise today. Straight ahead is the edible garden which is growing, some plants slowly and others a little bit faster. We are still eating the asparagus and will continue to do so until June. After that we'll let the ferns grow. I recall that someone commented that they were planting asparagus this year to eat the next but when we first planted we let it grow for four years before harvesting any in order to get it established. The cut and come again lettuce is ready to harvest and the mange-tout are about 6 inches high. Potatoes are growing along with spring onions, garlic, leeks and strawberries. The apple, pear and plum trees have a few blossoms between them! The grapevine is racing away in the greenhouse and is in need of a haircut again. I'm pinching out the side shoots on the tomatoes and some are flowering. Can you see the pointy plant to the left?Turning right  and there is the collection of 'strange plants' some of which are flowering. The Easter cactus cutting has red flowers on it. The smiley stones are sunning themselves.Here's more foliage.And more.Behind me is the back room. I like seeing the reflections in the window.Round again to the other side and there are some more corn plants on the window sill. These were not big enough to put outside yet. Maybe next week. There are also 2 courgette plants which DH will pot on and keep inside until all danger of frost is past.Here's the pointy plant - a Mother-in-law's tongue. It looks like it's trying to escape.Here are some more pointy bits on my skirt. You can see me coming in this.On my lap now is my rainbow blanket. It's really eating up the yarn and I have to pull out loads of yarn so I can 'flow freely' with my hook. Each colour way is different and reminds me of different things - the circus, winter, summer flowers, ice, rivers, trees, my friend's New Zealand pictures and ...… babies' blankets.Hope you've had a relaxing break this Bank Holiday.xx"},

Still baking bread 2 or 3 times a week.Wealth - still living frugally and gleaning great bargains from the CS so the 'wealth' that we have stays in the bank for just in case savings. I have splashed out on some more Dawgs flip flops because they are so comfortable.Meals - eating out of the freezer and making meals stretch. Had cottage pie tonight and will freeze 2 portions for next week. We're trying to eat less and lose a bit of weight (but not trying too hard).Blogs - reading regularly. Mine needed a kick up the backside so I thank Rachel Radiostar for giving me inspiration and hope she doesn't mind me pinching her bullet point idea! :)Life - pottering on dancing, gardening, volunteering, crocheting, studying, making music, reading and relaxing.

I've read some other books which I've passed on and not commented on so perhaps they are not all that memorable.We're reviewing the Foxtrot at dancing at the moment and our instructor was telling us that the dancing started off on the fourth beat of the bar.

That way I can adjust the strings as the plant grows. I just knot loosely at the bottom to allow for growth.I've planted Orkado, Shirley and tasty Blackpool (our own saving of a particularly tasty tomato that we don't really know the name of).My pruning of the grape vine did not result in the demise of the vine as shoots are starting from every bud. I hope there will be grapes from every shoot. This is the new runner.And this is the main stem.While visiting the nursery where we purchased our vine many years ago we bought a new plant called Cannon Hall which originated here.

Oh my, I've lived here all my life and have never, ever been on one of these. If I had a bucket list this would be on it - I'd like to ride in an open-topped tram. Here it was in all its glory. We must ride this one. Up the stairs we went and sat on the rickety wooden seats. The wind was howling and the sea mist was in full misty force. It was great.… Until the conductor informed us that day passes were not accepted on Heritage trams, so we had to cough up extra money to 'enjoy' the ride. It was worth it though.The visitors wrapped up warm and complained about the slight breeze and fine, wet mist, only jumping once when the trolley pole, which connects the tram to the overhead cables, went fizz buzz and sparks went flying. The conductor rushed up the stairs to reassure all the passengers that this was a normal occurrence and if the trolley pole strayed from the overhead cables it would not come crashing down on our heads.Great fun.

From my seat when I look to the right are the bright pink curtains which were DD's choice. They are staying and pink highlights are now scattered about the revamped room. The old office chair has a throw casually draped over it to hide the ***tt* brown colour. To my left is the old Expedit unit, brought down to this room from the room above, which houses many craft, crochet and sewing supplies as well as things I'm not throwing out just yet. The door to the left is an under stairs cupboard. It's best left not viewed.Opposite the shelves have been tidied and more items are stored.Spot the sherry bottle.Can you also spot the feather head band on top of the mirror? It was made for a 30's evening and a fancy dress party.Here's where I was sitting. DD's bed went with her so in its place is a new sofa bed.

I will keep all new side shoots short so (hopefully) this year's bunches of grapes will grow near to these 2  main stems so giving more light from above for the tomatoes.Old leaves were blown away and side shoots cut back to 2 buds which faced downwards.This vine has been growing years and this close-up shows all the cut backs.There are a few downward facing buds which I hope will produce fruit this year.

The pattern is for the Nola Afghan and I propose to work this as another stained glass pattern using up the brighter colours in my stash.There are some colours in there on cones that were used in one of my first blankets. I really like black as a frame to highlight the different colours.

I have started some of the squares but I've not got enough of all those colours so that blanket is on the back burner at the moment until the majority of the stash has been used.I've also made loads of her granny rose squares.

I was given this yarn by a friend and I already had some in my stash. It's Stylecraft Ragtime and feels really soft and has neon bright bobbles every so often along its length. It knitted up in garter stitch on size 6mm needles and I used 3 x 50g balls. I have plenty left so I may make a matching hat which could be Christmas tree shaped with a glittery pom pom on top! Hmm!I saw a version of this effect on a blog I read and decided to have a stained glass pattern on this scarf which was crocheted from side to side rather than bottom up. The colours were from my stash so are different kinds of yarn but all are DK crocheted with a 4mm hook. It's a really easy pattern and could lend itself to blanket making in jewel colours of course.This yarn was from Liddle-iddle this year and was I think £3.99 for 4 x 50g balls. It was knitted on size 9mm needles and didn't take very long at all. It's an unusual way of knitting - not using it as yarn at all but putting just loops on the needles.Totally different yet totally absorbing in the knitting and crocheting process.There may be more to come.

First was the cards then anything related to Christmas, apart from the tree. So - baubles, garlands, stars, bells, holly, snowmen, Christmas arches and angels were all bagged up ready for next year. Christmas runners, tablecloths, plates and jugs were put back in cupboards.The tree was left until 12th night, strings of lights and anything that signified Winter in any way. My theme for January is white and simple.(Thinks - perhaps I should crochet a shades of white blanket for this time of year!)My Autumn blanket is finished - must take a pic and there's a scarf in progress for next year made with bobbly wool from Liddle-iddle.

The cards were taken down (before the New Year) from various places on picture rails, fireplaces and windows,then sorted into piles.FriendsRelationsColleaguesDancersMusiciansSavedThe cards were then ticked off in on my Christmas card list as being received and then the everlasting ones put into bags for next year. The 'normal' cards were cut into small rectangles for use as shopping lists or telephone jottings and the used portions put in the recycling bag. Any cards that were useful for recycling into new cards were kept. I shall make some more homemade cards later this month ready for next year.The everlasting cards (type the word 'everlasting' in the search box over on the right) were matched up with envelopes and address cards ready for next Christmas. All I have to do then is to sign and address the envelopes which speeds up the process enormously.The 'saved' pile has everlasting cards that have stopped being sent for one reason or another and are put up each year in memory of that person. Other saved cards are ones which I like the look of and don't really want to throw away.xx"},

The beige and red stocking was in the sequin tin.3. The white and tinsel stocking was hanging up on the wall behind the angel's head.4. The orange stocking was behind the angel's right wing in the 3rd angel picture and under her skirt in the 4th.5. The green stocking was in the first pom pom picture hanging up behind the left pom pom by the white jug on the lower shelf.6. The turquoise stocking was just past the 2nd candle up on the right hand side of the last picture.7. The pixie stocking was by Santa.8. The 3 colour stocking was on the shelf just to the side of the angel's head in the first angel picture.9. The speckled red stocking was in both bauble pictures behind the big green bauble.10. The pink stocking was on the chair peeking out under the crocheted blanket.11. The yellow stocking was in the 2nd and 4th pictures under the candles.12. The purple stocking was on the shelf which was reflecting in the mirror just below puss's head.13. The lilac stocking was in between the leaf stems in the large orchid pot.14. The dark blue stocking was by the base of the candle on the mantlepiece.15. The light blue stocking was behind the brown stripy centre parcel.16. The beige stocking was on the second counter picture on the sherry plate under the green stable bauble.17. The yellow stocking was behind the underarm of the glitzy top picture. Only the loop was showing.18. The light turquoise stocking was peeking out behind the large pink stocking on the pussy pic side. It looks quite light.19. The blue stocking was in among the ingredients on the round plate.20. The light blue stocking was behind the Christmas tree on the right of the picture.21. The light green stocking was in the plant - top left centre.22. The 3 colour stocking is in the second bauble picture under the bowl towards the bottom left of the picture.23. The blue stocking is under the top right of the poinsettia plate.24. The brown speckled stocking was under the holly towards the left, lying on top of the books.25. I hope this one is obvious. It's the Santa Clause stocking - red and white.Have a wonderful Christmas and thank you for joining in the fun.xxPS And what were those stripy things?Why elf hats of course.

Why Fleetwood Marsh Nature Park of course. I'd never heard of it before but my friend had and had already partaken of its pleasures.Off the circular carpark are various pathways with the main one heading in the direction of the River Wyre.We passed ponds with an abundance of wildlife.The gulls were all lined up on the bridge before we passed over it.A lovely sculptural archway invited us to explore further.We explored the archway first and ...found all sorts of wildlife there.We viewed places we'd been before from a completely different aspect.There were also wrecks (but nobody drown-ded) and plenty to look at.The sun was shining for our walk and it was quite warm.We walked back along the suggested pathway past the ponds again and back to the carpark.Set into the carpark walls are small works of stone art.Here's a pretty one.Another tip:- don't venture up the muddy slopes. You might slip!xx"},

{"title": "The old cinema", "date": "Monday 10 November 2014", "text": "The old Regent cinema is an imposing, but run down, building situated close to Blackpool centre. In the late 60s it became a Bingo Hall then later on a Snooker Hall.Now it is a Vintage Emporium. We ventured up the stairs to the circle to view more stalls and saw the 'remains' of the cinema.What a sorry state.Paint peeling, rotting seats, ceilings down, steps strewn with debris.Upstairs were more stalls bringing a splash of welcoming colour.We debated buying this teapot set but on closer inspection the handle of the teapot had been glued back on and there was a serious crack in the bottom of the hot water pot so we didn't bother.I hope someone will be bothered in the future to restore this building to its former glory. It's so sad when buildings get into disrepair and there is not enough money to renovate properly.There is more information about the building here and below.

{"title": "Last time", "date": "Saturday 8 November 2014", "text": "Last week a friend and I visited the Fylde Angling underground boat store which was open to the public for one last time before being filled in as part of the new sea defences.There were quite a few underground areas around this part of the coast and this was initially an underground car park.It was a must see and a last see trip to view what will now be a piece of history.It has been flooded a few times and was dark and dingy but definitely atmospheric.The tractors which pull the angling boats out to see are going to be re-housed in a brand new building.The area was vast.These boats will never be stored here again.Many other people came to view.At one end there was an escape hatch to the surface.Back out again into the daylight we meandered over to the Art Deco club building.This building used to be used as changing huts for bathers.The new boathouse will be attached sometime in the future.Around the walls of the club house were pictures of boats which have been wrecked off the coast and outside can be seen the remains of one of these nearly submerged in the sand.Bye bye - soon there will be a brand new coastal promenade here.Here are more pics from a YT video.xxPS My computer is going back to hospital as it's still not right so I'm postponing the 'Virtual Party' until further notice as I don't know when I'll be getting the machine back.

{"title": "Easy Ripple Pattern", "date": "Thursday 23 October 2014", "text": "I cannot find out where this pattern originated so if it belongs to anyone out there please let me know so I can give you credit. I'm sure it's not from a book. I must have taken it from a blog somewhere and I saved it in my pattern files. I have worked out that the foundation chain should have a multiple of 10 stitches plus 6 - e.g. 86 stitches, counting all the chains.I think my blanket started out with 166 chains.Easy Ripple PatternRow 1: 1 treble in 4th chain from hook.I insert my needle in the stitch underneath the v.1 treble in next chain. *1 treble in each of the next 3 chains, Make the valley ( v yarn round hook, insert hook in next chain, yarn round hook, pull yarn through, yarn round hook, pull yarn through 2 loops on hook, leaving 2 loops on hook. Without finishing off this treble, repeat from v in next 2 chains, which gives you 4 chains on the hook. Yarn round hook and pull yarn through all 4 loops to finish this stitch - should look like a triangle). Now 1 treble in each of next 3 chains,Make the mountain3 trebles in the next chain. This completes the pattern. Repeat from * to the end of the row with 2 trebles at the very end.Basically 3 trebles, a valley, 3 trebles, a mountain. The beginning and end of each row are 2 trebles.Row 2: 3 chain (this is the first treble), 1 treble in first stitch then 3 more trebles followed by a valley, 3 trebles followed by a mountain. At the end of the row you should make sure you have 5 trebles.I always crochet in my ends as I go along. Whenever I change a colour I break the yarn by hand rather than scissors so that it will crochet in smoothly.Then I crochet over the top of the end.I hope you find this pattern easy to follow. Once you've completed the first row it's really easy. Just remember that there are always 5 trebles at the beginning and end of each row. The 'mountains' are crocheted on top of the underneath 'mountain' and the valleys are crocheted on top of the underneath valley. I know that's obvious but sometimes it isn't when you've not got the pattern established.Happy Crocheting.xx"},

I'm living dangerously and am tackling the La Vie en Rose blanket using as much wool from my stash as possible.My other sail was a little larger but not complete so it was as useless as the first for sailing around the world.It's another dishcloth with again, more wool from the stash. Pam, your white dishcloth is still going strong and now I'm branching out with other colours of cotton. (Spot the purple creation!)So, sailing round the world in my Very Large Courgette was not an option so I've made more soup with one half using veggie leftovers - peppers, carrot, tomatoes and the other half I'm going to stuff.Same old, same old but I've had a little sailing adventure on the way.xx"},

To process these - chuck out the dead and wilting then cut down and plonk into smaller vases (I used some vases that I haven't used for a while).Number 3 - The corn (which was as high as an elephant's eye). To process these - pick and fill a very large container.Peel off the outer layers.Marvel at the detailing of the cobs.Chop off any yukky bits, put in bags and freeze.Number 4 - The dried seed pods of the mange-tout. To process these - let them linger about in a basket in the sunny conservatory and pick out the dried peas when the fancy takes. Store the dried peas in a container in a drawer ready to plant for next year.Number 5 - A rather tasty part of our friend's tomato. To process this - do not eat all the tomato, even though it is delicious. Leave the remaining part to rot (We will rot you,  rot you, rot you!) in a jam jar. It will go all yukky (good word) and horrible looking. Do not worry. When you find it lingering about the kitchen, thoroughly rotted, separate out the seeds, make sure they are dry and store in kitchen roll tissue,  in a drawers, ready to plant for next year.Number 6 - Excess veg. To process these - chop up into little pieces and put into the hot-pot, made with stewing steak, onions, potatoes, carrots and stock. Stew for a couple of hours and then put a crust on top and bake for half an hour in the oven. Eat with brown sauce and pickled red cabbage.Number 7 - The Very Large, Very Heavy, Glass, Cylindrical Dish (which I'd been admiring for weeks. It was sitting in the CS with my name on it but was rather pricey. Nobody else bought it so I took that to mean that I should rescue it.) To process this - put it on the dining room table and give it a good looking at. Make a mental note of all its possibilities - storage for fruit, vase, receptacle for floating candles … Then leave it on the dining room table until inspiration strikes.xx"},

The first sock I knitted up was very difficult to get on as the top didn't stretch and the sock itself was too small. Back to the drawing board and Youtube to learn elastic cast on. There are quite a few different ways of casting on, aren't there? I chose one and started a new sock, knitting it up in a different size. So far so good - the top seems stretchy and I've made it to the foot part but it's slow going. I'll probably have this sock number 2 finished next week and that will mean that I have 2 odd socks so I'll have to do a sock number 3 to match sock number 2 (Are you following me?) but -I've forgotten which cast on method I used so I may end up with 3 odd socks!It's a good job I've got a lot of the wool left.Now for more Alphabet Blogging please follow the links below.DreamerjohnnyjumpsupKC's CourtCathyNext week's letter is L.Edit: Silly me - should be going backwards.

It was such a shame that there were only a few people visiting. I'm sure they would get many more visitors if they lowered their prices.A video showed the construction of the area.We were then able to view the exhibits from above.A pot of tea for four was very welcome at the end of our visit and we were entertained by the pianist in the cafe area of the Winter Gardens.

The rhubarb grows prolifically in our front garden and it makes super crumbles. I thought I'd try something a bit different with it. I've been watching the Dad's Army series on Youtube and Godfey, one of the home guard veterans has a sister, Cissy, who is always making upside down cakes.There's a link to one of the episodes here and a reference to the upside down cakes at 15 minutes 42 seconds in. I made this one in the microwave, hence its anaemic appearance.Now what's in the bottle?A light rose for the summery evenings or would you prefer a little drop of sherry? So civilised. Try a sip in one of my 'new to me' glasses. (It's only little - really!)I thought I'd show you some of the bric-a-brac that's been donated to the fair. Is there anything you fancy here?a few bits of (dusty) bakelitesome (old) vintage potsa few trinketsa selection of vases and one broken figurine(that can't be put in the fair)You must have some flowers to take home - spring flowers are so delightful and bring such cheer.They are freshly picked from the garden.And finally here's the raffle-prize. Oh, no need to hand over money - this is a virtual raffle. Just refer to the raffle in your comment and I'll enter your name into the basket. I'll draw out a name at the end of the week and who knows you may be a winner.I have 2 copies of this book so I've put one in this virtual raffle. The book is not new but it is a great book to dip into each month, filled with 'Edith Holden's exquisite watercolour paintings of flowers, plants, birds and butterflies'.For more Spring Fair offerings please visit - Pamthrift deluxeandCarol from Spring CottageI'm sure that they will put up their stalls before the day is out.

I re-use plastic bags as bags for bread and then as bags for bin liners.Recyling means that the item is broken down and the component materials reused.eg. I recycle glass, cardboard and tins via the council recycling bins and they are taken to be processed into other items.Repurposing is when unwanted items are used in different ways and made into different things.eg. I repurpose towels to make floorcloths and dusters.Eventually my reused bags will end up in the refuse and my repurposed items will not last forever. Clothing may end up as rags that will become stuffing for mattresses but they too will finally end up as refuse. I suppose with the re-using it stops the consumption of 'new' stuff.

There was also a hat parade.In 2013 we had a Spring Fest (click on the label for more info) which was more of a photo post to show Spring in all its glory.This year I thought we could go back to the stall theme and use the above headings or create some more virtual stalls of our own. What about face painting?  Anything goes really with the headings as a guide. You don't have to set up a stall at all!Here are the Spring Fair Heroines for this year. Would anyone else care to join in or offer more (or different) ideas for the celebration of Spring?Pamthrift deluxeCarol from Spring CottageSaturday 3rd May would give us plenty of time to prepare posts and hopefully we will have spring well under way.xxPS I've decided to change my layout every month, just because I can.

Perhaps that's another job for List 52. Not today, I'm tidying.My theme will be tins so I'll put my pens' tin and my buttons' tin on there with the others. That will free up space elsewhere.They will join the black and white cottons' tin.Do you like my star buttons? They arrived all the way from China in January - rather too late to put on top of my crocheted Christmas trees.The small white box holds my German tree decoration. I couldn't put it in the loft, it's too pretty.These catering tins are very useful for storing felt tips, pens and pencils.I seem to have a collection of scissors too but they always come in handy, don't they. This pair folds up.  I should really attach it to my keyring.There now. Not everything went back. Some items were thrown and some re-housed in other places.

{"title": "Guided Tour ...", "date": "Monday 6 January 2014", "text": "... (as requested by Jo), of the personal organiser. My goodness, there are a host of people out there who rave over these organisers and even put videos on Youtube to show you how they use theirs! (I have not done a video and this is only an overview of what I've got and how I've used it so far.)Being a 'saver of the earth' my organiser is new to me and came from the CS. It's a microfile wallet with filofax inserts.Hey, hey, handy zipped wallet.Hey, hey again - handy calculator. I don't know what I'll keep in the little pockets. Advice welcome.First off are pages of months so I have used these to note down birthdays.Following these are diary pages. If you look closely the year starts with 19__,  and there are no dates so I've had to go through and write them in. I've shown you the pages I've labelled correctly!There are some timetable pages and I've used these to put in dates for dancing, jollies and gym.There's a section for notes ...and some handy little post-it notes.The next sections are different ruled papers - white lined,squared,pink linedand blue lined. On these lined papers I have notes about freezer contents, the money I've spent, the Christmas card list and cards I have to make.I don't think I'll put addresses in as I have these elsewhere.I like this Action section and I can have the joy of crossing out tasks achieved (if I achieve any).At the end of the organiser is another book of notes which I may use for shopping lists.There's my tour. Hope I've not bored you to tears and if anybody out there has other uses for the pages please share. My NYR is to keep organised and I want this to help not hinder me.xxEdit : After watching a few Ytube videos I've now personalised my organiser and brightened it up a bit with colour coded felt tips - e.g. green dots for no spend days, purple for birthdays. I've made some month at a glance inserts and added some colourful address cards. I've also made better dividers so I can find each section easily and I've crocheted a dangly page marker in sparkly wool.Oh dear!xx"},

You can see them all on my bookshelf at the side.Have fresh flowers in the house - most weeks I had fresh flowers but not that many picked from the garden.Don't start new projects until current ones have been completed - I have finished quite a few things - the 2012 blanket that turned into about 4 different blankets, a Tunisian stitch cot blanket, the Advent Calendar, Christmas bells, Poinsettia wreaths, handkerchief case, book mark, handkerchief edging, beer glass cosies, 2 cat baskets, iPod case, a few India cot blankets and a Christmas bauble. Didn't do too badly there but there are still some projects hanging around which may not get finished at all.I think I'll just have one general resolution this year and that is towrite down, record and planin the hopes that those jottings will enable me to be more organised.

{"title": "Snowman Crochet Garland Tutorial", "date": "Wednesday 27 November 2013", "text": "Last year I made a Christmas Tree Garland and the year before a Snowflake Garland. This year it's going to be a Snowman Garland with the basic snowmen made as follows. (UK crochet terms)1.  BODY - Crochet 10 dc into a magic ring. Pull the end and slip stitch into the first stitch to make a circle.2. Crochet 2 dc into each dc. (20 stitches) *3. No need to slip stitch to next round, just continue with [2 dc into the next stitch followed by 1 dc in the next]. Repeat the bracket instructions until you have crocheted 30 stitches. Slip stitch to the next stitch and fasten off. Sew in the ends.4. HEAD - Crochet as for the BODY up to the asterisk * then slip stitch to next stitch and pull about 6 inches of wool through the loop.5. To attach the head to the body put right sides of head and body together and slip stitch into the back of about 4 or 5 stitches. Fasten off and sew in the end.6. BUTTONS - Thread a needle with black yarn and sew 3 French knots for the buttons, wrapping the yarn 4 times round the needle. The pictures show how do sew the French knot. Pull yarn from back to the front and take a small stitchnext to where the yarn comes out. Wrap the yarn 4 timesaround the needle.Holding the wrapped round yarn, pull the needle throughyour fingers so a knot is formed.Pust the needle to the back to secure the knot.Move on to the next button.7. EYES and NOSE - Sew 2 French knots for the eyes but only wrap the yarn round 3 times. The nose is a chain stitch.Yarn up from back to front.

I said that singing The Grand Old Duke of York through twice roughly takes 1 minute - wrong. How do I know this? Simple - because singing it through 6 times is the equivalent of 2 minutes. Therefor I would have to sing it through 3 times not twice to last the 1 minute.Aha, I hear, 'How do you know this?' (Hi, Jill.)Back in the schoolroom days of teaching the topic of Teeth and Eating the class was taught to clean their teeth for 2 minutes and the easiest way of remembering was to have everyone bring in their brushes and toothpaste and clean their teeth. Not everyone has a clock in their bathroom so we sang (with actions) The Grand Old Duke of York until 2 minutes was up. We sang it 6 times through while brushing our teeth! It was a strange sight to behold!Now that I've done my corrections I'll show you some of the teacher comments for today.UntidySpot the plastic bagCould do betterIt IS a working table.Tries hardNever looks the same twice - an ever changing viewGoodWho needs matching mugs?Very creativeDust collectorsGetting thereCheersExcellentPut up jobIt's clear that you have thought this design through.

I use plastic bags to put my bread in then as bin liners so they are recycled at least twice. My drawer was looking pretty untidy with all these extra bags so ...... I remembered that you could fold them to make them very small.Then I had a play about and folded them a different way to end up as a rectangle.1. Fold the bag in half as in the first picture, then roll up the bag from the bottom leaving a little bit of handle showing.2. Turn the bag over and fold one bottom edge to just past the middle.3. Fold the other bottom edge on top. (thirds)4. Roll the handle around the package and tuck in. Voila!5. Both ways took about a minute a bag.

This blanket was supposed to be mine when it started out but the beginning squares ended up as a blanket for DS and DIL and a blanket for DD. So now 552 squares later (100 + 100 + 352) I finally have my blanket. It measures 16 squares by 22 squares and each square is 4 rounds of Stylecraft DK (plus some other DK that found its way into my basket).The dimensions are 6' 2'' by 8' 2''.It drapes down to the ground on our double bed and fits snuggly from the top headboard to the bottom headboard.The grannies are edged with a ripple edging as I didn't want anything too lacy.I did 5 rounds of treble shells then 4 rounds of UK dc hooking into the back of the stitches, followed by a round of half trebles, ch 1. From there I did a 'Lucy' ripple but any gentle ripple row would do. There was no base row for the ripple as I wanted a gently wave to the bottom of the blanket. Each ripple row went into the back stitches of the previous row. The final round was a reverse dc round which gives a ridged edge.Wave, wave.The original idea was on According to Matt's blog, (whose original idea came from Attic 24 Lucy's blog) and the edging I made up as I went along with ideas I'd read about elsewhere.So now what?xx"},

At the wedding she proudly showed me her crochet edged handkerchief and I couldn't get over how fine her work was. (Is that a proper sentence?) I just had to have a go myself, so with the crochet cotton and a 1mm hook this time, I tackled a square of cotton cut out of a napkin (serviette). Following a Youtube video I rolled the edge of the cotton and dc'd all the way round. My next round was also UK dc with 3 dc in the corners and on the 3rd round I did a half treble chain 1 with 3 half trebles in the corners.Another round of dc's followed with a final round of reverse dc's. My first round is a bit skew whiff and the border pulls slightly but I'm hoping that a wash, a stretch and an iron will even it out. If it doesn't it's 'in the bin'!xx"},

At the back you can see my experiment with crackers.I used 1 cup of wholemeal bread flour, a knob of melted butter, a pinch of salt and a pinch of sugar all mixed and kneaded together for 10 minutes. Who needs the gym to get muscles in your arms? I let the dough rest in the fridge for about 20 minutes then rolled it out very, very and more very thin. It was baked in the oven at 240 degrees C for about 5 minutes. I think I read about the recipe from the Keep it Simple blog (see the side bar). Frugal Queen also had a go at making crackers.I shall make these again and experiment more with different flours and toppings.

Perhaps it should be at the top of my list or this pile will hang around getting in the way. I've already had the family videos put on to CD. Now do I bin the videos? Decisions, decisions. I need to get rid of these piles.Here are piles of fabric which 'may come in handy sometime'. There are more piles elsewhere - oh dear.  How many quilts do I need?

I was wondering if I would receive any new followers with all the Bloglovin' promotion going on. Do I need Bloglovin'? I've got all my favourite blogs on my blog pages so each evening I click on their links and 'follow' the postings. Other blogs I've got on Net News Wire but I prefer to look at all the blog not just a small portion of it. Bloglovin' seems to want personal information and their terms and conditions make me a little uneasy. I don't want my information given out to others or for businesses to target me because of my interests. I'm sure by joining there are lots of advantages especially if you make full use of all technology (which I don't).I know many bloggers have signed up to Bloglovin' but I'm not at the moment until I have researched more. I certainly don't want my blog linked to my Facebook page or any other blogs I may have as I like to keep my details and personal life separate.So welcome new followers and thank you for joining this site in whatever way you've joined.

I've been mending so there are cottons, a Kindle and books to read. (I'm still not using a proper book mark.)On top of the trolley are some of my squares and 2 kitties who purr when you stroke them.

The puss cats tend to help with the hobbying. I'm still ploughing through the wool making squares for the 2012/13 summer blanket. The basket of wools is emptying slowly. My pink frock is a new to me - I retrieved a pink chiffon scarf from the rag bag at work (it had a hole in it) to put round my straw hat - very co-ordinated! My feet look very dirty - I have had a bath.To my right is the basket that holds my wools, teddy and a tapestry cushion.

{"title": "Walking the cats", "date": "Tuesday 21 May 2013", "text": "We've always had a cat(s) in the family. We had a cat that was very friendly and inquisitive. She nosed about in a car or a van and ended up being transported to a neighbouring town 5 miles away. We 'lost' her for a week, during which we toured the neighbourhood and searched garages and sheds in the hope of finding her. In the end we contacted the RSPCA who had been notified by a family who had taken her in and luckily we were reunited with our adventurous pet. One cat we had was allowed to roam at will and ended up in a block of flats 'down the road' hiding behind a fridge. Another of our cats kept returning home 'beaten up' with scratches and wounds. He kept trying to win his battle but could not compete with the Toms of the street. We live on a very busy main road and one of our previous cats was run down on this road, so we took the decision to have our present cats as house cats with only supervised access to the outside.'Walkies!' means hey, we're off out into the garden. Our back garden is enclosed by fences and the only  way out is up. The cats are allowed to roam about the garden but not jump up to the top of the fences. They're very good and after a good sniff round they come back inside for 'Treaties!' If we sit out they will come and stay around us and sit in the sun. Brown puss cat turns into a tom outside (even though he's been neutered) and likes to mark the perimeter at various points just to show that he's top cat. White cat chews grass and stalks flies. Both pusscats hate the wind, rain and cold and will not go outside at all if the weather is inclement.They like to play ...... and they like to sleep.And they love a good cuddle and a stroke. Don't we all!xx... reading this series of books since receiving a handout at the library showing all the books available to read with information about the author and stories.This book was another speed read (as it was my friend's library book again) and was as full of action as the last book.

Many scenes are set in and around the Fylde coast where we live, hence the interest. Nick brought all his characters to life with the minimum of detail but the maximum of crime, violence, sex and intrigue. It was an easy read but I feel I should have started at book 1 in the series so I could identify more with the main characters. It was also an easy read because my friend could only find this book in large print in the library! I shall definitely read more."},

{"title": "Spring Fest in Blogland", "date": "Sunday 5 May 2013", "text": "Welcome to Mum's Spring FestTake a seat,Back garden bench and table - bit of a cheat hereas it's a summer picturesit back and read about our celebration of Spring in all its glory. May we offer you some refreshments before we start? How about this ice-cream chocolate sundae that my DS tackled this week? (If you eat this, you can't have any cake later! Decisions, decisions.)Look around and be entertained with sights, sounds and signs of Spring.The latest piece of artwork in our park is a statue of Charlie Cairoli who clowned around at Blackpool Tower Circus for over 40 years. His nose is gold here but I think that it should be red.Visit Spring fairs and enjoy the open air with others. Look there's the bric-a-brac stall. Are there any good bargains to be had?The definition of bric-a-brac from Wikipedia is this:Bric-à-brac or Bric-a-brac (origin French),[1] first used in the Victorian era,[2] refers to lesser objets d'art forming collections of curiosity, such as elaborately decorated teacups and small vases, compositions of feathers or wax flowers under glass domes, decorated eggshells, porcelain figurines, painted miniatures or photographs in stand-up frames, and so on.In middle-class homes bric-à-brac was used as ornament on mantelpieces, cluttered tables, and shelves, or was displayed in curio cabinets: sometimes these cabinets have glass doors to display the items within while protecting them from dust. \"Bric-à-brac\" nowadays refers to a selection of items of modest value, often sold in street markets.Now what have we here? Perhaps some of my bric-a-brac should be on the stall.On my dresser are some 'curiosities' - a box containing a gyroscope, a box containing glass 'medical' equipment, a glass blowing torch and an old telephone. There are old mincers, a coffee grinder and green bean slicer, a large mortar and pestle, an old jelly mould and decorated teacups and small vases (not that elaborate though). Can you spot the 70s soda syphon, the thirties vase, the old map and the old plates and bottles? Each item has a story to tell. I'm afraid they are not under glass and so are not protected from dust - oh dear, don't look too closely at the 'cluttered shelves'!Here's another bit of clutter on the window sill - 30s again and a little bit of early Ditchfield.The toy stall looks interesting. There are plenty of games that can now be played outside now that the weather is becoming warmer. What's there?It's my collection of skipping ropes - a cheapy, an industrial and a vintage. I really must get into skipping 100 skips a day. (I'm already doing the 30 Day Challenge that I read about on Jane and Chris's blog.)****I've just had a try. It's not a good idea to skip without a bra on. I'm a bit battered now!The cake stall will nearly have sold out by now. Here's my cake for the stall.Madeira Cake (from my recipe book)Can you read it? I'll make it clearer for you.175g (6oz) margarine175g (6oz) castor sugar225g (8oz) SR flour1 teasp baking powdergrated rind and juice of 1 lemon3 eggs1. Put in a mixer and process for about 40 seconds.2. Turn into a greased and lined 18cm (7 inch c) cake tin.3. Smooth top with the back of a hot wet spoon.4. Bake at 160 degrees C or 325 degrees F for 1 to 11/4 hours.Note the spring primulas in the background.So many plants and flowers to see in Spring. What's your favourite?Cowslips are one of my favourite flowers.This picture of tulips and primulas was taken in my local park and below is blossom on the trees.Decorations play a part in celebrating seasons. Pretty pastels reflect the colours of spring flowers and blossom.Let's hang up the bunting for our celebration. This is not just a spring craft. Bunting can be hung at any time of year for many celebrations. This bunting was made out of old sheets and pillowcases.What do you celebrate in the spring season? For us it's DH's birthday and the birthdays of several friends.spring storiesI remember singing this song (OK it's not a story!) in infant Sunday School. It's from my Carey Bonner book.Little brown seed, oh! little brown brother,Are you awake in the dark?Here we lie cozily, close to each other:Hark to the song of the lark—\"Waken!\" the lark says, \"waken and dress you,Put on your green coats and gay,Blue sky will shine on you, sunshine caress you—Waken! 'tis morning—'tis May!\"Little brown brother, oh! little brown brother,What kind of flower will you be?I'll be a poppy—all white, like my mother;Do be a poppy like me.What! you're a sunflower? How I shall miss youWhen you're grown golden and high!But I shall send all the bees up to kiss you;Little brown brother, good-by!—EDITH NESBIT.Ahh!The celebration continues on these blogs.

{"title": "Very deep", "date": "Friday 3 May 2013", "text": "Vicky wanted to know what I thought of this book as it is one of her favourites by one of her favourite authors.It took me a while to 'get into' this book, in fact it was nearer to the end than the beginning as I found it difficult to identify with, and really believe in, the characters. The writing was excellent and informative with deep analysis of different human emotions and situations. At the end of the story was an extract from her very first novel which I started to read and which I 'got into' straight away. So, Vicky, I'm afraid it was only 3/5 for this story but I'm sure it will be more for her first one.xx"},

{"title": "Thirty Ways to Save a Pound", "date": "Wednesday 17 April 2013", "text": "I thought I'd join in with the Money Supermarket Challenge to Bloggers so here are my 30 ways to save £1.1. Mend or fix broken items to prolong their life.2. Buy second hand from Charity Shops.3. Swap unwanted items with friends.4. Re-use plastic bags for storing produce, as bin liners, dog poo bags etc5. Sell unwanted items on online selling sites.6. Make use of the library rather than buying books or newspapers.7. Make floor cloths out of old towels.8. Save wrapping paper to use again.9. Make cards and gift tags from recycled items.10. Only shop with a list.11. Don't take any money when you go out for a walk.12. Take your own food when going on a day out rather than buying in cafes.13. Don't throw away left-overs but use again in the next meal e.g. make soup or pies or sandwiches.14. Make sure all containers are empty before you throw them away - e.g. toothpaste tubes, jars of jam, ketchup etc.15. Use less washing up liquid and washing powder.16. Turn your garden, or part of it, into an edible garden and grow your favourite vegetables or fruit.17. Save plastic containers and use for storage.18. Turn off lights and appliances when not in use.19. Make your own compost from kitchen scraps and garden waste.20. Cook from scratch rather than buy ready made meals.21. Make your own 'special meal' rather than go to a restaurant.22. Cut up your credit cards and just use cash.23. Take a shower rather than a bath - to save water.24. Drink water rather than bought sugary drinks.25. Walk shorter distances rather than take the car.26. Make your own bread.27. Make your own cakes and pastries.28. Know what you have in your freezer and cupboards and keep a look out for special offers so you can bulk buy items when they are on offer.29. If an offer sound too good to be true it is so don't be tempted to buy.30. Have some 'no-spend' days and don't be tempted to part with any money. Slowly increase your number of days if you can.Here's an extra one:-When tempted to buy something ask yourself, \"Do I really need this?\" (Generally I don't. I probably have too many of them anyway!)\"Where am I going to put it?\" (I'm trying to de-clutter so I've not got any more room!)\"If I came back tomorrow would I still be tempted?\" (I usually forget what tempted me in the first place!)xx"},

{"title": "Friends' Bloggy Blanket Update", "date": "Saturday 6 April 2013", "text": "Alison has been busy again crocheting squares for the Bloggy Blankets. Here's her email. (Hope you don't mind me putting it out here, Alison. Just say and I'll take it off pronto.)Hi again MumSorry to have been a while, but we have been up in Norfolk setting up the campsite for the start of the season, not that anyone wants to go camping!!  We had a few hardy souls over the Easter weekend, but mostly they were in campervans. Anyway, have finally got round to crocheting some granny squares for the next Bloggy Blanket.  I played around and managed to get the 4ply wool to work up to a 12cm square, which I was really pleased about.  I had brought quite a few different colours from Mum's attic, and thought it would be nice to crochet some stripy ones, using light and dark contrasts in each colour.  Once I started I got quite carried away but could not complete the set as I had no light green on board.  The set did not look right without a green so I cheated and went out locally to buy some light green DK wool; I have also been seduced into making more innocent hats (for the Big Knit 2013) so will use my extra DK wool for that.  We are on the north Norfolk coast which is not particularly well served with craft shops, but can get cheap King Cole and Cygnet DK in Wells, which I think is fine for this type of project.  I was very pleased with the result and even remembered to take a photo to send to you this time.  I am sure there is a design for a bigger afghan using the same technique of contrasting shades in one square, but I am no good at designing. Well, thank you once again for organising the project; like you I have a few projects on the go now (not sure how that happened, I had become quite disciplined about finishing one project before starting another) but if the blankets are still being made in a few months time I am happy to contribute some more squares, just keep updating the pages on the blog.I hope you are ok, I have noticed you do not blog quite so regularly at present, although many bloggers seem to be less active - as many have admitted, there does not seem to be too much 'new' stuff to say!! Thank you for joining in with the Bloggy Blanket. I hope more people will be inspired to join in. I just love those 2 tone squares. Your last paragraph has kick started my brain into creating ideas for new posts, one of which involves more 'joining in' from other Bloggers. Stay tuned!"},

I put in 2 teaspoons of sugar now.4. My second rise is 1 hour - any longer and the dough erupts over the tin onto the surface beneath. It can be rescued at this stage, kneaded again and put back in the tin. Be prepared to get dough everywhere.5. I put the warm water (measure out the cold water and put in the microwave for just over a minute), sugar and yeast together first and leave for about 1/4 of an hour(just to make sure the yeast is active) - tidy the kitchen, take the cat a walk, sweep the floor (no, don't sweep the floor yet!). 6. I put the mixer on slow with the dough hook and spoon in the flour slowly - 500ml of warm water will take about 1kg of flour which is approximately 60 rounded desert spoons. During this process don't forget to put in the salt and a knob of melted butter. (DD always laughs at this. I wonder why!) When you can, lift the dough hook up and if the dough doesn't stick to the bottom of the bowl then it's very close to being ready. I finish off the kneading by hand until the dough feels smooth and not too sticky. Take the dough out and oil the bowl otherwise you need very floury hands to extricate the dough after the first rise. I don't oil the bowl!7. Clean the mixer, work surface, floor, hands and clothes when all is done - oh and clean the oven if the second rise was too long!8. Spend 10 minutes cleaning dough out of your fingernails.9. The loaves should take about 25 minutes to bake at 200 degrees C. Don't forget them or they will burn.Oh sugar ...Toast anyone?"},

For more information look here and for more pictures look here.Lovely artwork based on the sand and shore adorned the walls all the way up the tower. A specially commissioned artwork 'Drift' features throughout the building and is made up of a series of individually designed pieces fashioned from natural materials and textures inspired by the natural patterns from the coastal environment.  It's part of the Mythic Coast artwork trail.There's a camera on top of the tower which can be angled and zoomed from the room at the base. We had great fun zooming in and out watching the people below.There was lots of information about wildlife, volunteer work, exhibitions and walks,plus a cross-section of the tower itself.Working our way up the 64 steps we stopped in the birdwatching room,the coast watch room - where we observed again!and at the very top we went out onto the open air balcony.An ordinary stroll turned into an informative and entertaining morning.

{"title": "Straight Granny", "date": "Thursday 14 February 2013", "text": "Stash busting time (and New Year Resolution busting time) so I started a new blanket to use up some 'bobbly' yarn. It's a cotton mix and was in my donated pile. I thought I'd make a Granny straight blanket. Not sure if this is the correct term but it's not a Granny ripple as the lines of trebles are straight.My dilemma was  - how do I start the new row without adding trebles on to the original number of trebles. Surfing the net was not giving me any clues as I didn't know what kind of Granny I was doing. I read tutorials with treble clusters and tutorials which changed colour each row but I was non the wiser. I started this blanket a few times as it began to expand the more rows I put on. Even with a mathematical brain I just couldn't work it out so ... I decided to try with a smaller sample. Here's my tutorial for a Straight Granny.Work a LOOSE foundation chain for as long as you want your blanket plus 3 extra chains. (My first chain was too tight so the blanket started curving round.)Start trebling in the 4th chain from the end and treble in each 'bobbly bit' (behind the V) for the first row.There are now effectively 8 trebles on this first row. (The chain 3 counts as the first treble.)At the end of the row chain 3 and turn.Now treble in each space.This is where I thought I was putting in an extra treble. Wrong!As you can see I have 8 trebles on the second row.

The plot was built up over different chapters and was gripping right up until the end.Should I tell you which book was which? No, I don't think so - I'm sure that everyone's taste for fiction is different. I've now got 2 more books on the go (one for upstairs and one for downstairs) plus a book on the Kindle.

{"title": "Bloggy Blankets", "date": "Monday 21 January 2013", "text": "Hopefully we now have another volunteer for our Bloggy Blanket. Thank you, Compost Woman. There is information on the Bloggy Blanket pages but I'll just summarise it here. 1. Bloggy Blanket Chain. This is the blanket that I was referring to in my post. The idea was that the blanket started out as one square which was then sent to another blogger. The second person added a second square then sent it on to another blogger and so on. Some bloggers wanted to add more than one square which was great. Knitters can add on a knitted square if they wish to. As the blanket travels around Blog Land it gets bigger and bigger. Once it reaches a suitable size the last person donates it to a  worthy cause or deserving person. eg. Retirement home, hospice etc. In order to join in you just have to show interest via a comment. If this is the blanket you are volunteering for please get in touch with JuliaB over at Peacock Blue and exchange details. She would then send the blanket on to you for you to add your squares. From there you would keep hold of it until we find another volunteer. Details of the size of square are on the appropriate page. I log all the Blanket activity on a separate page so that everyone can see the blanket grow.Pros = fun watching the blanket growno stress or hassle because there is no time limitCons = cost of posting the growing blanket on to the next person2. Friends' Bloggy Blanket. If you wish to join in with this blanket all you do is crochet as many squares as you wish and then send them off to Fostermummy at My Beautiful Life who stitches them all together and donates them to charitable causes. Fostermummy also shows off the finished blanket on her blog posts.Pros = fun noseying other bloggers' creativityno stress or hassle because there is no time limitCons = cost of postage3. The squares that I have been crocheting together are sent over to India via a contact I have in a second hand shop that I frequent. She has a few old ladies who knit squares for her but they cannot see closely to join them together. Whenever I call in I sometimes receive a bag of assorted squares (most are different sizes!) which I join together in my spare time. When I have completed a blanket I just take it back to the second hand shop and my contact takes them to her church to hand over to a doctor who goes over to India regularly to tend to some of the poorer people in different areas. These little blankets are destined for cots for the poorly babies. If you wish to knit or crochet some squares for this, or indeed sew or crochet them together yourself to make a cot blanket then you need to contact me for my details.Pros = fun working out colour combinations and which squares will fit togetherno stress or hassle because there is no time limitCons = none for me but postage cost if you wish to send me some squares4. If you don't want to do any of the above due to cost of postage then I'm sure that there are places in your area who would be willing to receive your squares. Only recently I was given an article about a local hospice who wanted colourful homemade blankets for the ends of their beds. Local Old Folks' Homes also use lap blankets for their clients.Pros = fun organising your own squares or blanketsfun organising other people in your area to contribute their crafty knowhowno stress or hassle because there is no time limitCons = none reallyHope this helps and thank you again, Compost Woman, for your generosity. You should be able to get to my email address through my profile page if you have any more queries. Just let me know which blanket or blankets you wish to join in with. (Whoops! Never end a sentence with a preposition!)Welcome to my new follower - a very talented crafter (including knitting and crochet!)xxAdded later.

I read Dan's blog at Frugal Living and he has passed it on aswell.Long live Common Sense!Obituary in the London TimesToday we mourn the passing of a beloved old friend, Common Sense,who has been with us for many years. No one knows for sure how old he was,since his birth records were long ago lost in bureaucratic red tape. He willbe remembered as having cultivated such valuable lessons as: - Knowing when to come in out of the rain; - Why the early bird gets the worm; - Life isn't always fair; - And maybe it was my fault. Common Sense lived by simple, sound financial policies (don't spendmore than you can earn) and reliable strategies (adults, not children, arein charge).His health began to deteriorate rapidly when well-intentioned butoverbearing regulations were set in place. Reports of a 6-year-old boycharged with sexual harassment for kissing a classmate; teens suspended fromschool for using mouthwash after lunch; and a teacher fired for reprimandingan unruly student, only worsened his condition. Common Sense lost ground when parents attacked teachers for doingthe job that they themselves had failed to do in disciplining their unrulychildren. He declined even further when schools were required to get parentalconsent to administer sun lotion or an aspirin to a student; but could notinform parents when a student became pregnant and wanted to have an abortion. Common Sense lost the will to live as the churches became businesses; and criminals receivedbetter treatment than their victims. Common Sense took a beating when you couldn't defend yourself from a burglar in your own homeand the burglar could sue you for assault. Common Sense finally gave up the will to live, after a woman failedto realize that a steaming cup of coffee was hot. She spilled a little inher lap, and was promptly awarded a huge settlement. Common Sense was preceded in death,-by his parents, Truth and Trust,-by his wife, Discretion,-by his daughter, Responsibility,-and by his son, Reason. He is survived by his 5 stepbrothers; - I Know My Rights - I Want It Now - Someone Else Is To Blame - I'm A Victim- Pay me for Doing Nothing Not many attended his funeral because so few realized he was gone. If you still remember him, pass this on. If not, join the majorityand do nothing."},

Fix tree to stand and cut off netting with the scissors.2. Put tree on large tub to gain height - too tall. Take it off large tub, walk to garage to get milk crates and repeat with crates - decide on one crate and take large tub and other crate back to garage. Adjust tree to vertical and break stand.Go to garage to find last year's stand or mend first stand. Attach stand to tree with nails. (OH leaves the room - his task is done.)4. Untangle 5 sets of lights to find the set that was put on the tree last year. Plug in lights BEFORE PUTTING ON TREE.5. Put on 2 sets of lights then take one set off - try again with another set that's long enough.6. Put on the silver decorations then decide to use the gold, green and red ones instead - take off the silver decorations.7. Decide to put flowers on the tree and walk upstairs to the loft to find them.8. Put tinsel back in bag because you've used the flowers instead.9. Walk upstairs to find the angel for the top of the tree.10. Use the sweeping brush to position the angel.11. Use sweeping brush and dustpan and brush to brush up the pine needles.12.

{"title": "Mum's Advent Calendar 1, Days Left 24", "date": "Saturday 1 December 2012", "text": "As promised here is the tutorial for my Christmas Tree Granny Square, which I'm incorporating into my Christmas Zig Zag blanket. This square can be done a number of ways. Here's one way with UK crochet terms.The first round is just like a normal granny.With green chain 3 and join to form a ring with a slip stitch. Ch 3, 2 trebles, ch 23 trebles, ch 23 trebles, ch 23 trebles, ch 1Join to first treble (the first ch 3) with a dc. In space below ch 3 (first treble), 2 trebles, ch 2, 3 trebles, ch 2In next and 3rd corner space do the same.Join brown (I knot it to the green and crochet in the end) and complete the second round. Fasten off the brown.In space between the last brown shell and the first green, join the white and work one shell. Join green.Work all the way round to the 3rd corner then join in the white.Work one shell then join the brown, ch 1, 3 treble, ch 2, 3 treble, ch 1 and join to the first white shell. Fasten off the brown.The last round is done in white and you should end up with a completed granny tree square.Another way of doing this square is to work all the green in one go, then all the brown. The white would still have to be joined and finished a couple of times before the final round. Here's one I did this way.With green chain 3 and join to form a ring with a slip stitch. Ch 3, 2 trebles, ch 23 trebles, ch 23 trebles, ch 23 trebles, ch 2Join to first treble (the first ch 3) with a slip stitch, ch 3. Turn.In same chain 2 space, 2 trebles ch 2, 3 trebles ch 1.In next chain space 3 trebles ch 2, 3 trebles ch 1.In next 2 chain space 3 trebles, ch 2, 3 trebles. Turn.Slip stitch across the top of the treble shell to the 2 chain space then ch 3.In same space work 2 trebles, ch 2, 3 trebles.Work your way round to the 3rd corner as a normal granny square and fasten off the green.Join the brown in the centre 2 chain space on the long side (hypotenuse).Ch 3, 2 treble, ch 2, 3 treble. Turn.Slip stitch to the 2 chain space and Ch 3, 2 treble, ch 2, 3 treble. Fasten off the brown.This next bit is the fiddly part to put in 2 white treble shells. Join the white on the 3rd treble as shown below. Dc into the first brown treble then ch 3. Turn.Ch 1 and slip stitch into the first green treble. Turn.Slip stitch across the white shell then ch 1 and slip stitch onto the brown trunk.Repeat for the other white shell.All that is required now is the final round in white.Hope all these instructions make sense and I've not made any mistakes in writing them down. Let me know if I have.I'm also putting into the blanket a poinsettia granny square which I'll show you in another post.xxPS Did you spot the Advent Christmas Tree?Click on the Advent Calendar label for more reading and on my December posts for last year for the Snowflake Calendar."},

I've already had this post ready to blog for a few weeks as Granny Taught Me to Crochet also tagged me with the Eleven Tag.On looking back at the history of this tag, I see that it appears to be the Leibster Award, (see my awards label), but the title seemed to have got lost along the way. Never mind - I'll tackle it anyway. Here are the rules according to GTMTC.The Rules:Each tagged person must post 11 random facts about themselves.Answer the 11 questions set by previous blogger.Create 11 more questions.Tag 11 more blogs, with less than 200 followers.Inform the blogs they've been tagged! Here are 11 random facts about myself.1. I'm vertically challenged! I look up to most people.2. I play the piano.3. I play with Lego!4. I like a cup of tea in bed in the morning before I get up.5. I can't sing in tune.6. One of my New Year's Resolutions is to embrace the numbers 4 and 13 because I don't particularly like the number 4 and everybody thinks 13 is unlucky. This year I thought I'd face my superstitions so I now don't avoid these numbers. e.g. when cutting up a banana I used to cut it into 12 or 14 but not 13 bits. This year I don't mind 13. I could go on but you might think me ...7. ... slightly silly!8. My favourite subject at school was Maths.9. I had a heart attack about 6 years ago so I now try to keep very active.10. My cup is always half full rather than half empty.11. I like to read blogs especially the blogs of followers and commenters. :)BTW welcome to another new follower.And here are GTMTC's 11 'questions'.You have to make a soundtrack to your life. You have 11 songs and they all have a theme. What do you chose and why?I presumed I had to find a song for each of the categories so here's my interpretation.1. You - Perhaps I have too rosy an outlook on the world. Imagine by John Lennon2. Getting ready - The only one I could think of was Putting on my Top Hat. Mine's more of a swirly dress when I go out dancing.3. Crafting - This one's difficult too. Perhaps I'll throw this one open to readers.4. Christmas - No Christmas is complete without this playing.  I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas5. Party - I don't party often but when family or friends get together \"This is where the party is.\" I can do it by the Rubettes6. Family - Everyone jogs along in life at at certain moments come 'next chapters' such as new job, new home etc. Turn, turn, turn7. Friends - Many friends are made along the way. I've made quite a few while learning my dancing at the ballroom. Other friends have been there for many years, friends from childhood and friends from work. Lean on Me - Bill Withers8. Old Memory - So many memories when I was 16. I'm not telling you them, though. You're 16 by Ringo Starr or Young Girl by Gary Puckett and the Union Gap9. New Memory - DS and partner are planning to buy a house - a very big step in life's journey. Bless This House10. Romance - It's Getting Better by Cass Elliot11. The Future - Who knows? - Enjoy the moment while you can. Melting Pot by Blue MinkMBL's rules are similar and here are her questions. These are easier to answer.1. In which month is your birthday?January2. What is your favourite colour?Was red, now green3. What one thing do you wish you could change in your life?For me - nose, legs, height, teethFor others - inequality to equality4. What is your biggest regretNo regrets really but I would have liked to have had dancing lessons when I was little.5. What do you feel is your Christmas tradition?Eating Christmas dinner in the dining room with family, conking out (full) in the lounge and listening to the Queen's speech.6. Which part of your body do you dislike the most?See above7. Which celebrity would you take out for dinner, and why?I'd stay in for dinner - not the sociable type really.8. Who was your favourite teacher at school, and why?I really didn't have a favourite teacher but I, along with others, did fancy the Chemistry teacher. He fancied himself aswell!9. What do you like to do in your spare time?Crochet, read, play10. I'm coming for dinner: What will you cook for us to eat?Ooh-er - egg, chips and tinned tomatoes with mushrooms followed by lemon meringue pie (I'll have to practice making one of these.)11. What are you planning for your garden next year?I was planning to lawn it over and put in a pond because we didn't have much of a harvest this year but I'm sure we'll have veggies again. Can't have 2 rotten seasons, can we?I'm altering the rules here seeing as GTMTC altered them.

It's a motley selection of colours but I've managed to make quite a large blanket with these left overs.I've succumbed and ordered some wool for a Christmas Ripple Blanket. (Call it a Christmas present to me.) I've a few ideas buzzing in my head and just guessed the number of balls of yarn I would need. Red, white and green will be the colours for this blanket which certainly won't be finished by Christmas. I still have one shepherd to complete for my crochet Nativity and I'm plodding along with my Summer blanket squares, adding more colours to the original 17. I'll just keep the squares coming until I've finished the wool.Swimming tomorrow as part of my fitness regime! I wonder how many lengths I'll be able to do!

{"title": "Mum's Virtual Tea Party", "date": "Sunday 28 October 2012", "text": "Welcome everybody to Mum's Virtual Tea Party. What a treat we have in store for you. Your favourite bloggers have been busy baking, assembling and titivating to bring you a Tea Party to remember. Please come in and share our hospitality.Where shall we have our Tea Party? At the Tea Dance?This is the Empress Ballroom at the Winter Gardens.Very posh.A little bit too large for us, I think. We were rattling round like peas in a jam jar that day. There's another bash at Christmas. I'll have to talk a few more friends into going. I think we'll even get a mince pie!Or should we host the party here?Intimate surroundings. Now where would you like to sit?Lovely mis-matched china.A new conservatory area just opened. Can you see the chandelier? I wonder if I should get one for the greenhouse!And check out this wonderful cake stand. It must have been owned once by a Miss Havisham!What tea set shall we have today. Here are a couple which were for sale at the CS. This set of 5 cups and saucers was £2.50. They had the word Gainsborough underneath.This set was £5 and was Royal Vale with cups, saucers, plates and milk jug and sugar bowl.And this bowl was so pretty.I hope they go to good homes.What do you think of the table decoration? No expense spared here. This work of art took all of 30 seconds to make. Don't you think the word 'shuck' is an excellent word?Here's my offering for the cakes today. The recipes are from the BeRo recipe book. First of all, scones. I've substituted butter for the lard and margarine and you could add cream with your egg instead of milk to make them richer. Looks like the egg landed on the page, not in the bowl!Doesn't baking make a mess of the kitchen.Anyone for a scone? There's more cream and jam here somewhere.Talking of jam - this is one ingredient in this. These are very more-ish so just have one for the moment until you've sampled everyone else's contribution to the tea party.I've served your jam cake on my favourite plate.It's Royal Albert Trillium. You can read more about it here and here.There was another of these Royal Albert tea sets at the CS. It was called Lavender Rose. How could I resist! Can't show it you today though as I thought I ought to have it as a Christmas present.Enjoy your stay at the Party. If our contributors don't have their Tea Party post up yet do call back later.Bad Penny from the Hen House has her linen all ironed ready for this big day.MummyHen - Whatever you bring to the tea party will be a delight.Crafty in the Med You'll love these unusual delights served on vintage tableware.Bonsaimum You are very welcome. I adore your cake, it's a shame to cut into it.Penny Wise If you like chocolate then stop here awhile.Liz Yeah! Yeah! Year! Let's hear it for the teapots! We'll certainly need them.Op Shop Mama Hi, Iris, how are you doing? You lay a beautiful table. Save a cake for me!Lazy Daisy Jones my most recent follower and great crocheter is joining us today. I wonder if she's crocheted us some cakes? I know she's made a Christmas pudding. Here's my attempt. Ah no! Willow go over right now to view her table!Can you eat a whole one with your cup of tea?Carole and mum have made a huge cake for us today. Take a look.Please read the comments as there may be other bloggers joining in today. I'll try to keep this post up to date.I do hope you have enjoyed your visit today.

{"title": "Mum's bread", "date": "Saturday 20 October 2012", "text": "This is the way I make our daily bread - except I don't make it every day - perhaps about every 2 - 3 days. I measure out about 500ml of cold water and blast it in the microwave for 1 minute. While that is doing I put 1 level tsp of dried yeast (pesky Tesky's) and 2 tsp of sugar into the bowl of my mixer. The flour I use mostly is Tesco and Lydl bread flour. I occasionally mix in some granary, rye or wholemeal. Once the water is warm I pour it into the bowl and give it all a stir. Leave for about 15 minutes to froth a bit.Blast a 'knob' of butter in the microwave until it's just melted - not hot.Put the oven on to 60 degrees Celsius. Add some flour to the bowl, then a 'pinch' of salt. I only use less than a level tsp. for 2 loaves.Put the mixer on the lowest speed with the dough hook attached. If you have no mixer, stir it round with a spoon. Keep adding more flour a desert spoon at a time while the mixer is going. Add the melted butter aswell. If doing this by hand you will have to use your hands as the mixture gets stiffer.The mixture below is too sloppy, more flour needed.Now the dough is coming away from the sides but still sticking to the bottom. More flour needed.Now the mixture has come away from the sides and the bottom. The mixer has been running 8 - 10 minutes at low speed.I now dive in with a floured hand, to finish off the kneading, by adding a little bit more flour until the mixture is not too sticky. It should feel silky and smooth.Here it is ready. Now cover the bowl with a towel, turn off the oven and put the bowl in the oven. Forget about it until a few hours later. My dough usually rises to nearly the top of the bowl.Once the dough has risen (turn on the oven again to 60 degrees) take it out of the bowl using floured hands (messy), cut in half with a bread knife and mould into 2 loaves. Put into 2 loaf tins and put back in the oven to rise again. This time it will take an hour to rise. Take out of the oven and turn oven on to 200 degrees. Once hot bake the loaves for 20 - 25 mins.Here's the finished result. I normally freeze one so I don't have to make bread everyday. Everyone who makes their own bread eventually settles down into a routine that suits them. I sort the yeast out, take the cats a walk, come in and make the bread, forget about it till mid afternoon, do a second rise and bake in the oven just before tea time, when the oven may be on for making our meal. This way suits me and this is the way I make our daily bread."},

Dc in blue square, ch 2. Continue in this way 1dc, 2ch until you reach the other side of the square.Join to the pink corner with a dc, then ch1 and dc into the blue corner. Now just repeat with the other squares.Here it is again. The right side of the striped square is in the pic and the wrong side of the turquoise square. I did a dc on the striped square, ch 1 then a dc on the turquoise square. Ch 2 then dc on the striped, ch 2 then dc on the turquoise until the end of the squares.Here I did one dc on the striped, ch 1, then one dc on the turquoise.To get across to the next 2 squares, ch 1 then repeat the process.Hope this makes sense.Here's the complete blanket.

It took me ages to learn how to quickly change feet. (hutchy up!*)Tayside Tango - how's your twinkle and wing?Waltz - whisk, wing, chasse, turn. Such a lot of different terms to remember. I can do a very basic waltz. My toes are still getting in the way.Viennese Waltz - this is a great workout. I can go one way but need to master going the other way. (Just tried it in the kitchen and went dizzy. I'll stick to one way round for now.)Foxtrot - slow and not so slow. Each partner seems to do the foxtrot differently, hence many trodden on toes. I just try and follow a partner who 'knows' what they are doing so my head seems to be always looking down at feet! The slow foxtrot starts off slow and ends up a race - more practice needed. I'm not too keen on the foxtrot at the moment. It feels like I'm treading precariously through hot coals!Quickstep - still at the basic steps stage. I can turn and swivel.These will take some time to perfect! ...Jive - step back, triple, triple so the Youtube video goes.Rock 'n' Roll - triple, triple, step, step? Sounds like the Jive to me! I need a partner who 'knows' what they are doing. Even then I can't see how those steps fit to the music.My dance sessions keep me active and are a great workout plus they definitely keep the brain active!!* my dance termPS Further research shows another jive which is jiggling hands and arms about, swirling and turning and letting the feet look after themselves - I  like this one."},

I'm pleased to say that our first Bloggy Blanket has been donated to an Old Folks' Home. Well done to those who donated squares for FM to join together. New followers, may I invite you to join in this Bloggy Blanket Friends' endeavour. Just click on the bloggy blanket page links at the top to find out more info. Basically, if you can crochet or knit a granny square you can join our little band 'doing' our small bit for others less fortunate. Our Bloggy Blanket Chain is a slightly different variation which involves sending one 'blanket in progress' around the blogosphere with bloggers adding one or more squares to it. Eventually it should end up a complete blanket which can be donated to a worthy cause - the last recipient decides which. Do look at the BB pages and if you are able to do even a small bit of crochet to help it would be much appreciated.xx"},

The white bits in the ceiling are lights.Light streams into this building through windows set within stone frames.Mosaics cover the pillars ...... and are set into the floor.Most of the church is in shades of white - a white altar ...... with white angels... and white pews.It does need restoring but peace and tranquility could be seen and felt in every area. Window shapes were so simple yet so beautiful.Door shapes too.Let's hope that grants are secured to resurrect this lovely building.Even the outside was serene.More information can be found here and here.It's such a shame that vandals stole the copper off the roof a while ago.

I included the word 'lovely' in comments on these blogs so they formed my list this time.1. GTMTC2. Trudies Cottage3. The Tightwad Telegraph4. Shortbread and Ginger5. Marmalade and Catmint6. SFT7. Ungardened Moments8. Living a Slow and Simple Life9.  Where Beechmast Falls10. Frugal Living UK11. Op Shop Mama12. Thrifty MummyHen13. Jo - The Good Life14. Jo - Through the Keyhole15. Maple Syrup MobAnd now my 10 questions for the Sunshine Award. I googled '10 personal questions' and found a few there and the rest I just made up myself. It's about time I thought for myself - I'm a big girl now.1. What do you have on your bedside table? Telephone, tablets, radio, headphones, light, magazines, book, cat catcher, nail file and notebook and pen. On my hobby room bedside table I've got telephone, books, vase I made when I was 11 containing sweetie wrapper flowers made by DD, light jar, lamp, basket containing crochet hooks, scissors, glasses, pens, nail file and bits and bobs, a pile of granny squares, a candle holder (I threw the bendy candle away when I tidied up.) and various calling cards. Underneath is a basket of fir cones, note books, a knitting bag containing crochet projects and a Shaun the Sheep bag.2. How old do you feel inside? 16 (Pity I don't look 16 outside.)3. Do you dream often? I dream most nights. I heard it said once that if you dream a lot of very interesting dreams at night you must be the most boring person during the day. Hmmm!4. What is your favourite form of exercise? Dancing. When I was 7 I was given the choice of having dancing lessons or piano lessons. I wish I could have chosen both but piano won.5. What do you miss most about being a child? I could say  - nothing I still am a child. On the other hand I could say - skipping down the street. I can do it but it wouldn't look good!6. What are you wearing now? A brown spotted dress - that's it!7. Where are you now? Sitting on a bed in 'my' upstairs room with 2 cats sprawled out in front of me and the laptop resting on an upturned basket because it's too hot for my lap. Seagulls are calling outside the window and the sun is streaming in. It's very hot. Also on the bed are 100 crochet squares, a crochet hook, 4 cushions and a phone.8. What time do you go to bed? I usually crash out an hour after I've taken my 'restless leg pill'. Yeh, you can get a pill for restless legs!9. When did you last have a cold? Should I answer this one or not? OK, touch wood, I can't remember when I last had a cold. Blow your nose every time you go to the loo and do a yoga 'Lion' each day and colds could be a thing of the past for you. (This is not a proven medical opinion.) I should own up and say that I don't do the 'Lion' everyday - for reasons which will become obvious when you view this.10. What's the one of the best things about retirement? Being able to wake up when you want and turn over and go back to sleep if you wish.Doing what you want, when you want.Smiling a lot.Not worrying about what other people think.Going out for 'jollies' with friends.Not going out at all.Wearing what I want.Viewing the world at a slower pace.Sorry I did more than one there.I wrote this post last night and I hope I'm up to date now!PS I love reading all your blogs.xxPPS Keep crocheting those squares.PPS I've had other ideas for my Summer Blanket.PPPS I'm off to do the washing now.xx"},

Check out her crocheted rug - really lovely.Moving on I visited Court and Spark. This blog documents many crafting activities. I think I'm on a crafting journey now.Next stop was Hen's Teeth. I recall visiting this blog before. I really enjoyed reading about her visit to Bryan's Ground.Onward to Pantry Violets which is a shared blog. Here is the blog description.\"Pantry Violets\" are women who met by chance in the Dordogne in France. We came from many different places and walks of life with as many different experiences - each of us knowing that for some reason we needed to be there. Through the course of 6 days, we swam in a salt water pool, ate magnificent food prepared by our hosts, strolled the beautiful grounds, stitched as it drizzled and danced in the sun, rummaged through brocantes, shared stories and ideas, secrets and dreams. We found friendship, inspiration, laughter, tears, simplicity, peace and a strong common bond. We embraced the creative spirit we found in one another and allowed our own to soar. It came to be much more than a workshop. We found new \"life long\" friends and true, kindred spirits.We have created this blog to challenge and inspire one another and to continue to look at life and creativity in a whole new way, from a different perspective. We will continue to share our thoughts and feelings and bring our affection for each other to this venue.Wow, what a really inspirational blog.From this blog I flitted to the first contributer who had a blog list and I arrived at Evangeline Beulah in New Zealand who has recycled some of her collection of corks into a really cool sign.Top of her blog list was Tiny Happy. I've been here before. Look at these spectacular pics of her garden from her site.Alas my trail stopped here as I could not find a blog list on her site.

Thank the person who nominated you on their blog - Thank you so much, Kate.b. Tell 7 things about yourself - What do you want to know? I've already told you 7 things about myself here.OK here's 7 more.1. I have a very large stash of Lego (from DS's and DD's childhood days) that I'm reluctant to part with. My excuse for not de-cluttering the Lego was \"When I retire I'll make all the models again.\" I did retire and I've not! Yet! I must give you a peep sometime. I love Lego. This lot's quite vintage now.2. I had a heart attack 5 years ago which makes every day now a day worth living. (Take care of your diet and keep up the exercise.)3. I like picking scabs! (Better than picking one's nose, I suppose.)4. I love having a bubble bath.5. I've still got the tier stands from my wedding cake - we've just had our 38th wedding anniversary.6. When I fold my arms my left hand shows and when I clasp my hands my right thumb is over the top of my left.Gosh, this is hard.7. My stash of wool runs to 2 large drawers full, 2 smaller drawers full and 3 baskets full. Hmmm!c. Nominate 15 blogs and then tell them of their nomination - This is difficult aswell. Lovely to me? Lovely to look at? Lovely coochy, coochy coo?All your blogs are lovely. I know - if I put 'lovely' in a comment on your blog please accept a 'One Lovely Blog Award' from me. I'll keep a note of the blogs and then list them later. That's another fact about me - I'd rather tackle a job in small steps rather than try to do it all at once. More successes that way.Hi Amanda and MummyHen. I thought I'd answer your queries here in a post. Firstly the Bloggy Blanket Chain - this will require people to post a growing blanket on to other bloggers so only volunteer if you are prepared to do this. I envisage a smallish lap blanket, hopefully, at the end which can be donated to a suitable recipient. I'll put both your names on the Chain Blanket page and if Arwedd is prepared to send it to Amanda then Amanda can add to it and send it on to Mummyhen. I'll leave you to get in touch with each other.Now to the Friends' Bloggy Blanket. This is not as complicated. Any squares you make you send to Fostermummy who will sew them all together to make a blanket. Again this or these blankets can be donated to a worthy cause. Squares should be 12cm x 12cm and either crocheted or knitted.Again, look at each page for details.Happy hooking and clicking."},

I don't really think I've got it in me. :)TranslationA sultry sun shone down on the crops below, onto plants dishevelled by constant rain and biting winds. (It was sunny so I thought I'd better clear the mange tout to give me room to plant the leeks.) The time had come as it did every year. Death to one plant so life could be given to another. (Can't leave dead plants lying around. The garden looked a bit of a mess.) Droplets of water fell to the earth as she passed the drenched leaves, (I should have done this later in the day because I got sopping wet!) leaving her dress clinging damply to her body. (!!!!!) The crop was dying, its job done, having fed the family for many days but it was necessary and good husbandry that she utilise all that the plants had to offer. (I don't have to buy it if I've grown it. I like to save my pennies.) As each plant was torn from the ground, it's tentrils resisting stubbornly, she pulled off any edible remains, tossing the dying parts into one bucket, the pods into another. Back breaking work indeed but she toiled on, fighting the desire to just clear the land as quickly as she could before the rains came again. She could not countenance wasting one morsel of precious food having spent many backbreaking hours nurturing the vines. (I planted it and I'll make sure we eat all of it - no waste here.) Every few minutes she tramped to the edge of the field to add the contents of her heavily laden bucket to other dead and decaying plants forming a huge mound of sweet smelling organic matter which would help to make her small plot fertile for the next season. (The bits without slugs and snails went in our compost bins, the ones with slugs and snails went to the great compost bin in the sky - the council recycling bin.) It seemed hours had passed by until the last of the plants was wrenched from its moorings (about 20 minutes) but her work was not over as each old pod had to be stripped of its bounty. Tearing apart the outer covering revealed the glorious beauty of each green, lush, polished pea. Hour after hour she toiled until her task was done (Actually this took a heck of a long time) and she could relax in the knowledge that she could feed her family for another meal.Not much to show for all that work.

Fostermummy has been busy sewing squares together (May we have a pic of work in progress FM?) and thanks to all who have contributed squares so far. More squares are needed so if you have any scrap DK wool that you can crochet or knit into a 12cm x 12cm square to send to FM we would be extremely pleased. For full details of the Bloggy Friends' Blanket click on the Bloggy Friends' Bloggy Blanket page.These squares from my current blanket will soon be on their way to FM.The Bloggy Blanket Chain never really got off the ground. (Mrs. T. I think you sent that first square to FM) so I'll start another one if anyone is interested. For this blanket I'll send one square to one blogger who will add (sew) one or more squares to it and then send it off to another blogger. Each blogger will add one or more squares until a full blanket is completed. The end volunteer is then free to donate the Bloggy Blanket to a worthy recipient. For full details please see the Bloggy Blanket Chain page.Here's the square that will start off this blanket.Who would like to receive it? I think I'll also send a small giveaway pressie with this first square just to help it along. Please leave a comment here or on the Bloggy Blanket Chain page. Let's hope this one has a terrific journey around the Blogosphere and we can follow its progress."},
{"title": "Not Knott End at all", "date": "Thursday 12 July 2012", "text": "No - this time it was Blackpool's south promenade. We took a tram to Starr Gate and then walked back towards South Pier. We passed the Mirror Ball and ...the Solarium, where we stopped for a cup of tea and a look around the art display.Photographs of 'old' Blackpool were on show.It wasn't as packed today as it was here even thought the weather was fine.Coming out of the Solarium we continued along the prom.One of our largest attractions is the Pleasure Beach. Here you can see the Big One. Want to go for a ride?Various works of 'art' are scattered along the walkway. They are called the Great Promenade Show.This pier is not my favourite. The boards wobble causing sensitive souls like me to feel a little queasy and the rides blast forth very loud music.There are wonderful views of the coast line though.The seating arrangements are not as grand as North Pier but have the requisite sea side theme.This is the back of the Sandcastle - another attraction.I had to walk to the very end of the pier but my friend didn't dare. It was very un-nerving to see the beach umpteen feet below.I made it and looked back towards the prom.You can be relieved of your money very easily in Blackpool."},

{"title": "Multi-tasking", "date": "Saturday 7 July 2012", "text": "The dough for the bread is made in the morning and left to rise until the afternoon. In the afternoon it has its second rise and is then baked. Another of my morning jobs is to pick these.I can easily pick 3 or 4 tubs of mange-tout each day at the moment. Up until now we've eaten them raw, as a side veg or I've put them in the freezer.Time for some alternatives. I googled mange-tout soup and then concocted my own simple version. Dead easy.3 take away tubs of mange-tout (about 500 - 600g)5 small or 2 medium potatoes, diced (I used 5 new potatoes.)1 litre of stock (I used a chicken stock cube.)salt and pepper to taste (I only used black pepper.)1 onion finely chopped.Bung it all in a saucepan bring to the boil and simmer for about 20 minutes or until all the veg have cooked through. Whizz with a whizzer and it's done. The soup can be served hot or cold. There are many variations of this soup out there. This version tasted delish. The 2 resulting take away tubs of soup will now be put in the freezer.My next alternative way of using the pods was in a stir fry. DH was having steak so I pinched a little bit, thinly sliced it and stir fried the strips for a few minutes. The meat was then put to one side and I stir fried mange-tout and broccoli. (We're ploughing our way through all these plants aswell - all the heads have arrived at once.)Also in the mix was garlic and chilli. (Mine was dried chilli.)Once everything was cooked through and the meat put back in the mix, I added this sachet which I purchased today from B&M Bargains for 29p. Noodles were quickly boiled up and added.Voila!This portion will be eaten tomorrow.DD and I ate our own take away while DH had steak, and boiled broccoli and mange-tout with mushrooms.During the afternoon as well as preparing veg, trotting down the road to the shop and cooking the tea I also baked the bread. I duly set my phone alarm to beep to remind me to take the bread out. I need the alarm to remind me of the time especially when I'm doing a few jobs at the same time. It beeped at the required time and I carried on with my creative cookery in the kitchen very pleased that I was so organised. What? You want to see a picture of the bread? No, sorry, no can do. I'm afraid the alarm went off and I gaily turned it off and carried on stir frying, forgetting totally to take the bread out of the oven. Today's bread has a very crisp crust! Ah well, win some, lose some.Welcome to my new follower - I hope you enjoy your visits."},

These were blogs that have recently been updated (Monday 2nd July). My list will not stop at 10 and so it shouldn't. I read blogs which interest me even though I don't necessarily follow everyone else's interests. All of these blogs have inspired me in some way. It's comforting to know that other people feel the same way as I do, have some of the same interests as me and are living in the 'real' world. If you are reading this blog of mine or are a follower or are on my favourites listor have received a comment from me on your blogplease accept the Sunshine Award from me because you have positively inspired me in some way. If you  are an award free zone please accept a 'very well done' from me and thank you for being there.Sunshine Award List from my blog reading tonight.1. Sft - for indirectly giving me the jolt I needed to embrace travel - not that I'm going to make it a hobby!2. Anne from Ungardened Moments for taking me on a wonderful bloggy tour of Europe.3. Bunnymummy for inspirational observations of nature and great ideas for crochet and patchwork.4. Lucy from Attic 24 for inspirational crochet work which spurs my creative endeavours.5. Vix from Vintage Vixen for inspiring me to be more adventurous in my choice of clothes.7.  Ladyhawthorne from Canterbury Cottage who has inspired me with this quote on her blog.To live content with small means; to seek elegance rather than luxury, and refinement rather than fashion; to be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy, not, rich; to listen to stars and birds, babes and sages, with open heart; to study hard; to think quietly, act frankly, talk gently, await occasions, hurry never; in a word, to let the spiritual, unbidden and unconscious, grow up through the common--this is my symphony.William Henry Channing 1810-1884 8. Kay and Sime from Just Human Beings. They are so full of life and make inspirational meals packed full of goodness.9. Froogs of course from Frugal in Cornwall has inspired many of us with her frugal tips and her generosity.10. And last but not least Jill from Land of the Big Sky. She really makes my day when she posts. Cheers Jill. Have one on me."},
{"title": "The Sunshine Award", "date": "Monday 2 July 2012", "text": "Hey, hey, hey - I've been awarded the Sunshine Award by Sandie from Sandie's Patch. The Sunshine Award is an orange flower (marigold) that is given by bloggers to \"bloggers who positively and creatively inspire others in the blogosphere\".Thank you, Sandie. I wonder who else I've inspired?Here are the things I must do now.Thank the person who gave the award - done.Answer 10 questions about yourself - see below. These questions seem to change on different blogs. I've used the majority of Sandie's questions and some of my own.Pass on the award to 10 other deserving and inspiring bloggers, inform them and link to their blogs. I'm going to inform you here and you will find the links in the side bar or the followers list. It took me ages last time to work through everybody.Here goes:-1. What is your favourite animal?This obviously has to be a cat (or rather 2 cats).2. What is your favourite number?I've always liked the number 6 - don't know why. I've never liked the number 4 because when I was little we had a set of playing cards and the 4 of hearts had a smeary, dirty mark on it. (Silly me.) I've not been enamoured by the number 4 since. I've always avoided the number 13 aswell. However this year, as one of my resolutions, I decided to embrace all numbers. eg I can cut up my banana into 13 pieces and not bat an eyelid! I can shave my leg with 13 strokes of the razor and not worry about anything untoward happening - apart from a nick on the leg! I also can spill salt (this is nothing to do with the question, I know) and not throw a little bit over my shoulder to get rid of the devil. How's about that, then!3. What are your Passions?I read this question many ways. Here are a few answers.1. I'm not telling you any of my passions!!!2. A huge Italian ice-cream fruit sundae I had while on holiday. It had every fruit you could imagine in it with ice-cream and ooh, ooh, ooh frozen banana puree. Each spoonful - after I'd eaten the fruit bowl around the top of the dish - was a deeee-light.It only looks small but it wasginormous!I ate it all up.3. Enjoying each day.4. See my Labels4. Do you enjoy Giving or Getting?Both - equal satisfaction doing both.5. What is your Favourite Pattern?Changing patterns - eg granny squares with different colours or crochet stitches.Natural patterns - eg found on pine cones, vegetables and plants. Just type Fibonacci into Google to find out more.I do have a few stripey T shirts and jumpers.6. What is your Favourite Day of the Week?Used to be Saturday and Sunday when I worked. Now I've retired it could be any day.\"What day is it?\" asked Pooh.\"It's today, \"squeaked Piglet.\"My favourite day,\" said Pooh.- A. A. Milne7. What is your Favourite Flower?Depends on the season. Snowdrop - white, simple and innocentBluebell - A herald of SpringRose - beautiful perfumeBut if you look closely every flower is beautiful.8. What is your Favourite Country?It has to be the country where I live but I'm sure where you live is equally as good. Just like the flowers each country has its own share of wonderful places. I really enjoyed travelling around Europe with Anne. England is my favourite country because it is my home.9. What is your Favourite Colour?GreenWe have more than our fair share of green carpets, green painted walls in the Sun room and a green painted house.10. What is your Favourite Meal?Egg, chips and tinned tomatoes with 2 slices of bread to mop up. I'm going to read blogs now and make my list which I'll post later on in the week. I know I've been inspired creatively by many of you. Thank you for being out there and sharing your talents.Another blogger tried to trace the origin of this award and landed here. The person they received the award from now has a private blog so we can't go back any further but if you read the post there is no mention of answering any questions. Perhaps I should make an award of my own to offer to other bloggers. Hmm now there's a thought."},

The blanket is about 5' x 3' and I've used stash wool mostly from car boots or charity shops. The wools are all different - acrylic, mohair, wool so washing it should be fun.The pattern is in one of my other posts and was very easy once I'd counted the first chain and done the first row. It was easy stress busting, mind numbing work.I like the stripes of little white flowers between the colours.The edge is a single crochet followed by half doubles (US terms).It's not staying on the couch or chair. At the moment it's just a spare lap blanket. As usual while crocheting ideas come into my head as to what to do next - (there's already 3 WIPs). Angela has just crocheted a granny blanket and is using it for a lap blanket and also as a cushion so that gave me the idea of granny cushion covers to contain the lap blankets.I may use my granny rose squares, (click on the granny rose label for more information), or I may decide on something else.

See the first idea here.Finish off in the normal way by slip stitching into the third chain and drawing the thread through the  loops on the hook. Yarn over, cut off the wool then draw the end through the loop.Turn the square to the wrong side and weave the end in the back of the Vs (ie the side nearest you). Weave through about five stitches.By just weaving in the back stitches the edge of the square looks unaltered.When I start a new colour I also try to get rid of the loose end. Pull a loop through where you want to start. No need to knot.Work your first three chain but crochet in the loose end aswell.Another six squares done. I'm aiming for 360! Still a few a lot to go.PS Thank you for your help in identifying the flowers. I'm going to hunt for my flower book this afternoon.xx"},

{"title": "Thank you", "date": "Wednesday 2 May 2012", "text": "Thank you for all your lovely comments about my 2012 blanket. Considering it was made from an assortment of balls of unwanted wool it turned out not too badly. Blue has never been a favourite colour for me and I wanted to use up my blue wools so I teamed them with green as I so admired this blanket's colours.Thank you to those of you who haven't commented here before. It's great to know that you are there and I really appreciate your views.In reply to a question, my blanket was started at the beginning of the year. One New Year resolution was to crochet a square a day but I got a little carried away. There was no real plan in mind I just went with the flow, knowing that I wanted a blanket that was 'different'. I did not know how big the blanket was going to be, I just stopped when I thought it was big enough and the patterns just worked themselves out. Not having enough blues and greens I incorporated other cold colours plus any whites I had lurking around. Information on how to crochet the different shapes can be found on Youtube or on this blog. There was only one small shape that was really odd that I had to crochet to fit.I've crocheted some more of the rose squares, just because I wanted to. I've no idea what I'll be doing with them yet. My idea at the moment is to have as many different coloured roses as possible. It's a start, anyhow. I wonder how this one will turn out!"},
{"title": "And finally ...", "date": "Tuesday 1 May 2012", "text": "... the complete 2012 blanket. Here's one quarter. This is made up of squares of different sizes and rectangles with a turquoise, blue and white border.The next quarter is a log cabin pattern starting with a square and continuing round with rectangles, again surrounded with a border. I really enjoyed doing the rectangles - very stress relieving.The next quarter is the odds and sods quarter. There are various experimental squares. Can you spot the granny spiral, circular centres and the moving corner square?The last quarter was the hardest to put together as it contains odd shaped grannies plus rectangles and squares.The centre of the blanket is a large square with a centre of equilateral triangles. I've shown you this before in an earlier post.Around the edge of the whole blanket are granny rhombi. I didn't intersperse these with triangles as I was rapidly running out of wool. Here's the blanket draped over our couch and foot stools in the sun room.You can see the edging a bit better now. It really is rather large and easily fits over a double bed.To see the story of the blanket just click on the 2012 blanket label."},
{"title": "Nearly there", "date": "Monday 30 April 2012", "text": "I've been avoiding 'the blanket', the reason being - the edge and the unfinished bits. There's still one piece to concoct and one piece that doesn't look quite right because it's a solid block of colour. This will involve 'unpicking' - another task which I avoid.I can never decide where to stop an edge and always keep going round and round until I feel I should stop. Then there is the agonising decision of how to 'finish off'. I don't particularly like fancy edging but wanted to do something I'd not tackled before. Whilst blog browsing I came across a simple picot edge that didn't look too flouncy but I'm afraid I wasted a little bit more time avoiding the blanket again and started something new. Here's the edging. It is taking me just over half an hour to complete each side. Now I've only two sides to go.And here is the reason for my delay in finishing.These are Granny Rose Squares. I found the pattern 'here' (via a circuitous route through Tangled Happy blog) whilst researching edging for blankets. Week 5 shows the picot edging I used. There is a link to Apple Blossom Dreams blog which shows  the squares being used to make a picot edged cushion. Once I started on one square I couldn't stop.I don't know what I'm going to make with them yet.

{"title": "Bloggy Blanket after discussion", "date": "Monday 2 April 2012", "text": "Jo's and Alison's idea of sending one or more squares to one person is a sensible solution to the cost of postage problem and Foster mummy very kindly said that she would sew them all together. Juliab also suggested more than one square eg a block of 4.Sew, sorry, so let's give it a go for a Bloggy Blanket.Campfire was interested in the fancy squares so I'm sure we can mix lots of different squares in the same blanket. Likewise Helen, the knitter, could have her knitted squares in there too. Each square should turn out 12cm x 12cm.Mrs. T's idea of smaller lap blankets would make the posting of the final blanket less costly and Mrs. T would you like to be the final recipient as I'm sure that as a carer you can find a very good home for our offering?Right girls, and anyone else who wishes to join in - to the knitting needles and crochet hooks.Make a granny square or squares - fancy or plain (4mm hook, double knitting, 5 rounds, 12cm x 12cm - at least mine turned out 12cm x 12cm)Send to Foster mummy and Foster mummy send 1st lap blanket to Mrs. T. You'll all have to organise addresses with each other via email.Here are my first offerings.Foster mummy are you able to find homes for any subsequent blankets?And please shout when you've 'had enough' and maybe we could find another volunteer to do the sewing.Sew, sorry, so what about the original idea? I'd still like to give it a go to see if it can be done. You would need to have crochet contacts on your blog to find 'the next one along' and sew, sorry, so on. I'll call this Bloggy Blanket Chain. I've set up some pages to log the progress.Mrs. Tightwad, would you like to receive the first square, add to it, then pass it on so that you can be in on the action from the word go?  If so, will you email me your address and I will send it to you post haste!"},

First of all on the Homemade stall I'm going to put my little angel - this month's Nativity character.Homemade Fancy some knitted garments?Visit Cathy at Still Waters. Oh Cathy, you've been so busy creating beautiful clothes and scarves - so many to choose from.For contributions to sewing and food visit Debbie. This is one very talented lady.On to the Home Baking stall now. I can't leave my cake here as part of it was consumed as soon as it came out of the oven. (That's my excuse, anyway!)Home Baking(Dreamer from Dreaming of a Simple Life)Oh my, you'll never want to leave this stall!including the Decorate a Fairy Cake table(Shara from Mama's Mission)I can tell you that all these fairy cakes are winners with their Spring colours.

I don't think anyone will virtually buy these!DH does better with orchids.I'll leave a few sticks of rhubarb, too, as it's growing pretty well at the moment.Plants (Anne from Azza's Blather)(Sorry this stall is closed. Thank you to the stall holder. Hope to see you soon.)Now for the Bric a Brac. I've got far too much of this. Time to off-load so someone else can virtually enjoy. Jill might fancy this lady. She's been hanging around for some time. She holds the jewelry that I don't wear. Perhaps I'll donate that too! Jill  from Land of the Big Sky could put the lady on top of her barn in the middle of nowhere.I don't know whether she's standing on the world or just hanging about the Universe.I think her wheel or cog is broken. She's got a bit of an evil eye, too.Bric a Brac(Sorry this stall is closed. Thank you to the stall holder. Hope to see you soon.)I think I'd better stop at this next stall for a manicure. Gardening isn't too kind on the hands. I daren't show you a picture of my nails!Manicure/Nail(Willow92 from Willows World)You will be spoilt for choice here - I'd opt for a different style and colour on each nail and then you can admire the 'handiwork'!

Lovely creativity.Ah - let's stop a while at the sewing stall. A friend off-loaded 2, yes 2 sewing machines, that she'd inherited, on to me after my machine died. I really ought to start this quilting lark. There aren't enough hours in the day, are there? So many things to learn, so many things to do.Sewing(Sarah from The Little Family of Three)She's been so busy sewing for this stall. I'm sure you will find something here that will take your fancy, I did.GamesI thought we could have a 'Name the Teddy'  but he's a little too big to post to the winner and DD would not be very pleased if he suddenly disappeared.Let's just play this one.Hook a DuckWhat about a raffle?

Crochets a granny square with 5 rounds using DK and a 4mm crochet hook.2. Attaches it to the other square.3. Writes a post about it on their blog and asks for someone to continue the blanket.4. Sends it off to another blogger volunteer.5. Write a comment on my blog (adding the next Bloggy Blanket volunteer) and I will add their link to a Bloggy Blanket Page.Repeat the process until the blanket has 120 squares (10 x12).Then1. The next blogger does one round of edging.2. Sends it off to another blogger.3. Writes posts about it on their blog, linking to the next blog.4. Writes a comment on my blog and I will add their link to the Bloggy Blanket Page.Until 5 rounds of edging have been done.Then1. The final blogger does a final edge of his or her own choice.2. They find a suitable person or cause and donate the blanket. There are many links on the web which list worthy causes.3. They write posts about it on their blog.4. They write a comment on my blog and I will add their link to a Bloggy Blanket Page with a congratulations for a completed Bloggy Blanket and undetailed details of the recipient or charity.Now this can either end up like Chinese Whispers - as complete gobble de gook with lost parcels of crocheted squares or will end up as a blanket that is appreciated by a person in need. There would also be a list of links on the Bloggy Blanket Page showing each step of the work in progress.Either way the thought is there and the task is not too onerous for like minded crochet people.Now who wants to receive the first square? If more than one person says 'yes' then we could have more than one blanket. What do you think? We could do a knitted one for the knitters or fancy squares to show off our versatility. (There are plenty of 'Versatile' bloggers out there.)Please be aware of the postage costs involved of sending a working granny blanket in progress around the world. This is the only drawback. I think we'd have to keep it in the UK only but there's nothing to stop other bloggers in other countries doing a Bloggy Blanket and linking back here.Can it be done or not?"},
{"title": "If I can help somebody ...", "date": "Thursday 22 March 2012", "text": "This is for Lesley.Hope it helps!xxI started with 3 clusters then went up the side of the first cluster and just carried on going round and round. I wanted just to do clusters, no corners as such just grannying along without having to stop and join or sort out a corner. I aim to use up all those 'tiddly bits' of wool so when I've finished the red I'll choose another colour and keep on grannying along. In order to keep it flat, which it is doing so far, I just pretend I'm in a corner and do 2 clusters joined with 2 chain to get me nearer to the next cluster. There's no maths involved here. If it won't granny straight away, call it a corner then carry on. That's the theory anyway.I wonder what shape it will be when I've finished it? Will I finish it? Will this be another blanket! Is this free form crochet? Stay tuned."},

Would you be willing to showcase your decorated cup cake for all to see? I don't think it would be fair to judge the best decorated because I'm sure they all would be the best but we could all drool and coo over all the ideas. Could we make this happen or not?

Here are my choices. They may not appeal to all and they may offend some. Enjoy the ones you like and pass over the ones you don't.1What a Wonderful World by Louis ArmstrongI love Louis' rendition of these beautiful lyrics, plus it was featured at the end of the television version of Hitch-hikers' Guide to the Galaxy.2I Love to Boogie by T. RexIt just makes me want to dance.3Whispering Grass by Windsor Davis and Don EstelleDon Estelle's voice is haunting.4Living Doll by Cliff RichardLike Anne's Donny Osmond and David Cassidy, teenagers of my era either liked Cliff Richard or Adam Faith. Most of my friends took a shine to Cliff and I felt sorry for poor old Adam so I said I fancied him more! I also liked Cliff. He liked him aswell!5What Do You Want if You Don't Want Money by Adam Faith6Imagine by John LennonI love the lyrics to this one too.7Go West by the Pet Shop BoysThis is such a stirring song, which ever way you interpret it.8I'd Rather Be Dead by Harry NilssonThis is not everyone's cup of tea but I like it. A large group of elderly people made up the backing group.My luxury would be a small glass of sherry to be taken just before an afternoon nap. It does get rather hot on a desert island so I would need a siesta.My book would be:-I would be able to sing to my heart's content (good exercise for the lungs) and I could learn all the words to the songs (good exercise for the brain - stop me going crazy!) and I could dance to the song once I'd learnt all the words (good exercise for the body). This would mean that I would be in pretty good shape for when I would be rescued.

I don't want to overdo things.)There's method in the madness!Welcome aboard, Amber, I hope we don't get shipwrecked or you may think I am mad!Altogether now."},

Quick, look it upon Google. I can't seem to find the origin of this award. Looks like it's a 'does the rounds and spreads' kind of award. Lovely to be nominated, thank you Anne and in order to 'pass it on' I have to look at the rules.Rules1. Thank the person who gave you this award. (done)2. Include a link to their blog. (done)3. Select 15 blogs/bloggers that you've recently discovered or follow regularly and nominate them for this award.(Gosh, this one's difficult. Every blog I follow is an excellent read. Give me time for this one.)4. Finally tell the person who nominated you 7 things about yourself. (Right, thinking cap on again.)Seeing as this is a 'Versatile' award I shall try to think of bloggers who can be described with this adjective.adjective1. capable of or adapted for turning easily from one to another of various tasks, fields of endeavour, etc.: a versatile writer.2. having or capable of many uses: a versatile tool.3. Botany. attached at or near the middle so as to swing freely, as an anther.4. Zoology. turning either forward or backward: a versatile toe.5. variable or changeable, as in feeling, purpose, or policy: versatile moods.So here's the first list with one observation of the blogger's versatility.1. A Blessed Life - This lady can turn her work into an enjoyable outing with her family. A very loving lady.2. Land of the Big Sky - This lady can turn her love of art into a practical and enjoyable experience for children. A very observant lady.3. Frugal Living UK - This gentleman can turn a run down house into a home. A man with a plan.*4. Unbought Delicacies - This lady can turn wool into wonderful creations. A thoughtful and talented lady.5. The Smiths on Tour - This couple have decided to eliminate all fats, oils and processed foods from their diet. Wow!6. Hardup Hester - This lady can juggle life, work and family with humour and love. In her words 'my life lurches from calm to chaotic'. Brilliant.7. Meanqueen This lady is capable of 'many uses' - walking dogs, looking after cats, caring for the community, juggling finances. Capable and Caring - wonderful lady.8. Oh, I give up now - every blog on my list and every follower following me has a person who is versatile behind it. I hearby award you all with the Versatile Blogger Award. Please feel free to pass it on and list some blogs of your own choosing showcasing the versatility of the blogger.Now for the second list - 7 (versatile) facts about me. I think I'll tell everyone, not just Anne.1. I can put my right foot round the back of my head.2. I can swing one arm by my side in a clockwise direction whilst swinging the other in an anti-clockwise direction and then change directions without stopping.3. My second toe is longer than my big toe.4. I can recite the alphabet backwards.5. (Pity I didn't check my punctuation.)6. I can breathe in deeply and then hum continuously for 30 seconds.7. I can touch the end of my nose with the tip of my tongue.Now own up, how many of you have just:-- contorted your arm or leg- taken off your socks and inspected your feet- pictured the alphabet in your head- read through the note on the picture again- picked up a pencil and paper- hummed to no-one in particular- and wiped spit off your top lip?*One last thing (she says going off at a tangent) here is a very long palindrome.amanaplanacanalpanama"},

I work 5 rounds usually but you can make them whatever size you wish.Here's the back of the small square.

Slip the hook under the first V. There should be 2 strands of wool you can see on top of the hook and one strand (the bobbly bit) beneath.Holding the first 2 chains wrap the wool around the hook as shown and pull a loop through the V.Keep pulling through the loop already on your hook.You have now 'slip stitched to form a ring'. There should be a hole in the middle. I've put another crochet hook through mine. This hole is important so make sure you know where it is.Holding the 'ring', you are now going to chain 3. I work in the tail with the wool. You don't have to but it is one way of weaving it in.Above is the work after chain 3 and I've used up all the tail.

It's very difficult taking them with one hand. As you can see this lesson has the same title as Lesson No. 1.Lesson No. 2  - Becoming Familiar with the Chain.Items needed - one ball of wool and a crochet hook. Any wool and any size hook will do for now. I'm using a 4.5 mm which is not too small and not too large. The wool is double knitting.Make a slip stitch with the wool.Put your hook through the loop and wrap the ball end of wool round the hook.Hook the wool and pull it through the loop. (Remember last time it was your fingers that grabbed the wool through the loop. Now it's the hook.)The hook is now through another loop. Push it through a little bit more and hook another piece of wool.Drag that through the loop. Keep repeating until you can chain really quickly and you are confident holding the wool and the hook.  (It's underlined because that's an important bit.) You can keep pulling your chain out and starting again otherwise you'll end up with a very long chain!This is the way I hold the wool. If you Google 'how to crochet' you will find that there are many different ways of holding the wool and the hook so that the wool is held fairly taut and the chain is held securely. Fingers, hook and wool should be firmly controlled. (Another important bit because this creates an even tension.) Experiment until you find a hold that is right for you.Here's one way of holding the hook. I usually hold it like a soup spoon. (By the way, I am not resting on a bottom!)Your chain (after practice) should look like this from above - just like a lot of little Vs.If you turn the chain sideways it should look like this with loopy bobbles along the bottom.Do you like all the technical terms? Here's a real one to learn - Ch.Ch for Chain.If you look at the last 2 pictures you can see I have completed 6 chain. Don't count the first V but do count the loop on the hook.Evaluation needed for Lesson 1 (and links, if you wish to your Easy Peasy Finger Chain) please and welcome if you've just joined our Granny Along.Lesson 1PS Welcome New Follower.

Now join to the top of the first chain 4 with a slip stitch.Fasten off.Join the next colour in any chain 1 space. I started in the space before the first corner.Work 3 trebles in the spaces on the sides and the corner group of stitches in each corner.You can see it more clearly in the picture below.There you have it - a granny rhombus. If your pointy corners curl up slightly chain 2 instead of chain 1 to overcome this.Now how can I incorporate these into my current granny blanket?The following tutorial is for Vicky and Anne who wanted to know how to crochet a granny rectangle.Welcome to my new follower.

To celebrate this centenary, (this sounds like a speech), and seeing as we live in this virtual world, do you think it would be possible to get to know each other a little bit more? Do you think we could try an experiment which wouldn't take up too much of your time? Please join in so I know you are all out there in cyberspace.Meet my neighbours1. Leave a comment saying 'hello' to the 2 other followers either side of your thumbnail picture in the Delightful People list on the side bar.2. Visit the 2 followers and, if they have blogs, leave a comment on their blog. You might enjoy their posts and find yourself new reading material.3. If you don't have a blog yourself consider setting one up. You don't have to 'go public', it could just be for your eyes only but you never  know you may meet other 'virtual people' who identify with your interests.Finally I have a confession to make. In my early days of blogging I managed to inadvertently add myself to my own followers' list so really I've only got 99 followers not 100. Oh, but never mind I'll play the game aswell and say hello to my neighbours on the list."},

Butter or oil a 23cm x 30cm x 4cm traybake tin.2. Whisk together the eggs, sugar and oil in a large bowl, then stir in the flour, followed by the cocoa solution. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 30 - 40 minutes until risen and firm. A skewer inserted into the centre should come out clean. Run a knife around the edge of the cake and leave it to cool in the tin.3. Gently melt the chocolate with the golden syrup and cream in a bowl set over a pan with a little simmering water in it, whisking until the mixture is glossy and smooth. (I melted it in the microwave.)Drizzle this over the cake. Scatter over the Toblerone slices, arrange the cherries here and there, and leave for a couple of hours to set. Cut the cake into squares to serve. This will keep well in an airtight container for several days. (It didn't last that long!)Makes 15 - 20 squaresWe went to a 'real' Tea Party yesterday.

If not let me introduce you.AnneAnneSftdreamerFrugal Down UnderChristine (Sorry but Christine's brilliant contribution is no longer online.)RainbowchildCatherineClaire(I do hope everybody's here. Please excuse me if I've not introduced you.)Would you like a cup of tea? Would anyone like to 'do the honours'?This is a dolls' tea-set. It might not hold enough tea for you.Please enjoy the scones and sandwiches.Yes, lovely tableclothes aren't they? It took an age to iron them.The detailing is divine. Not too keen on tea? Would you prefer something a little stronger, perhaps?To finish off do have a little piece of the cake. It's delicious. Hope you've found something to take your fancy. This one's a Lime and Raspberry traybake.You may need a spoon to eat it. It's rather crumbly.  Here's the recipe. It's from Country Living magazine 2007.Raspberry and Lime Coconut Squares100g (4 oz) butter200g (7 oz) sr flour50g (2 oz) caster sugar2 medium egg yolkszest and juice of 1 lime150g (5 oz) rasberry jamicing sugar to dustTopping3 egg whites100g (4 oz) caster sugarzest of 1 lime125g (4 1/2 oz) desiccated coconut20cm (8 inch) square baking tin1. Whizz the butter, flour, sugar, egg yolks and the lime zest and juice in a food processor.2. Gather into a soft dough and press evenly into the base of the baking tin, then spread the raspberry jam on top. ( I used damson jam.)3. In a clean bowl whisk the egg whites to soft peaks and fold in the caster sugar, zest and coconut.4. Spread the mixture on top of the jam.5. Bake in a pre-heated oven for 25 minutes - 180 degrees C or 160 degrees C for a fan oven. Leave to cool in the tin then cut into squares. I made 16 squares.Oh yes, there's biscuits, too. Would you care for a chocolate one. These were practice cookies for Christmas presents. Here's the recipe. It makes between 30 to 40 cookies. I put raisins in instead of nuts and they tasted just fine.And these ones are shortbread, very buttery! More Christmas gifts with these I think. Because they freeze well I can make them in advance. I got the recipe from this blog.The table decorations are fabulous aren't they? This one's an Autumnal theme.And don't you just love the flowers.Please stay awhile, visit and comment on our guests' blogs. They may not be in until later in the day so don't worry if they are not there now. Hope you find something of interest. I'll be popping by at 6.30ish this evening (GMT) to chat to anyone who's around. Please say 'hello' even if you are just passing.

(Rhonda will be proud of me.) I also needed to type up some tray bake recipes found in magazines. (Hmm, might bake one for the Tea Party.)There were also various bits of paper to sort out - receipts and lottery ticket - no I didn't win!

Let's start a list.List: - Make dainty sandwiches and put on your blog. - Make scones and show your recipe. - Make a cake. (Missy would like a Victoria Sponge but I think any kind of cake or dainty pastry would add variety, don't you think? Show your recipe on your blog.) - Pick a favourite table cloth and show on your blog. - Pick out favourite napkins or serviettes. Maybe napkin holders as well. - Pick your favourite china to put on the table. - Add interest to the table with a table setting or place holders - flowers (real or artificial). What about knitted or crocheted flowers? - What about a jug for the milk and a bowl for the sugar? - How shall we decorate the room? - What about etiquette? - Perhaps you could invite a friend to join us. - Oh, and we'll have to dress up too, I think.What else do you think we could do for the tea party? (I've got a tea-cosy already.)Shall we have a good time?This depends on you really. I shall have a lovely time looking at your simply delightful blogs on the 1st November, imagining tasting all the treats, collecting all your recipes, having a go at making your table settings and looking at all your decorations.Does anyone else want to come and play?"},

Now I'm going to pass the award along to blogs that I have been reading.The first is the Tightwad Gazette. I follow this blog as Mrs. Tightwad's interests are very similar to mine. She also has another blog Amkitty International. This blog is wonderful if you're a knitter. Her output is amazing and the quality of her knitting is superb. I'm sure this award can go to this second blog aswell.My third award goes to ... (This sounds like the Oscars doesn't it?) ... Isobel from The Cosy Corner. I loved reading about her visit to Cornwall.Next one to The Vintage Knitter who enjoys (obviously!) knitting and also delights in other crafts.Shirl from The White House enjoys the 'abundance of life on a shoe string'. I couldn't agree more - so do I.I enjoy reading The House of Jones. I don't know how many followers follow this blog but I'd like to include her in my list.

This 'graveyard' has just been planted with French beans.Here we have chives and a bay.These herbs are lime bazil, marjoram and thyme.The strawberries are just waiting to ripen. I hope we can get to them first before the birds.Here are the outdoor tomatoes safely enclosed from the wind.The mangetout are just beginning to form from their white flowers. In the trough are mixed lettuce leaves. The trough is on copper legs (copper plumbing pipe) to prevent the slugs from climbing up and eating our lunch. There's lavender in the black pot.This parsley seeded itself from last year - or possibly the year before. Behind is the corn.Here are the courgettes which have just been planted out and are a bit wind blown. Beneath the wigwam  are runner beans. Behind are compost bins (not the retired Daleks).I've never been very good at growing radish. They always seem to bolt.We like to protect our crops and these broccoli and calebrese are behind netting so the slugs can't get to them. That's the idea any way.The carrots are protected from the dreaded carrot root fly.These little plants are swede. I grew too many last year so this year I only planted a few.We've a second lot of mangetout (I hope to be really organised and pick everyday, freezing the excess - ha, ha!) and some beetroot.The parsnips just stay in the ground until they get eaten.These garlic look like they're ready now.Inside the greenhouse are more tomatoes, the grape-vine and cucumbers,while these peppers keep getting transplanted to larger and larger pots to eventually end up in our sun room so I can just 'snip off' the peppers I need for the day.Finally here are 2 sacks of potatoes! Here's to enjoying and eating the garden!Just like Vintage Knitter I love fresh flowers. These Sweet William were from Tesco - reduced because I think they'd run out of water. They soon revived though.These were from the garden. The poppies only last a day.I also love fresh veg from our edible back garden. These salad leaves we had with mixed peppers, onion and tomato for a 'grass' lunch. Our own tomatoes are growing nicely in the greenhouse and outside our pepper plants are coming along well. DH has transplanted them into bigger pots.I like to have a walk every day. Sometimes they are long walks and sometimes they a just a short walk. One of my favourite walks is along the beach.I felt sorry for these poor jelly fish.They had such beautiful colours.Sand, sea, fresh air and fun and of course - donkeys!There were quite a few people out today.

{"title": "Stuart's choice", "date": "Friday 25 March 2011", "text": "Stuart’s choice: “Go placidly”Go placidly amid the noise and haste, and remember what peace there may be in silence.As far as possible, without surrender, be on good terms with all persons. Speak your truth quietly and clearly; and listen to others, even to the dull and the ignorant, they too have their story. Avoid loud and aggressive persons, they are vexations to the spirit.If you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter; for always there will be greater and lesser persons than yourself. Enjoy your achievements as well as your plans. Keep interested in your own career, however humble; it is a real possession in the changing fortunes of time.Exercise caution in your business affairs, for the world is full of trickery. But let this not blind you to what virtue there is; many persons strive for high ideals, and everywhere life is full of heroism. Be yourself. Especially, do not feign affection. Neither be cynical about love, for in the face of all aridity and disenchantment it is perennial as the grass.Take kindly to the counsel of the years, gracefully surrendering the things of youth. Nurture strength of spirit to shield you in sudden misfortune. But do not distress yourself with imaginings. Many fears are born of fatigue and loneliness.Beyond a wholesome discipline, be gentle with yourself. You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here. And whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be, and whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul.With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world.Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.Max Ehrmann c.1920Night, night, sleep tight. See you Stu."},

Then I turned the car round and promptly ran over the phone - whoops!It should have every colour of the rainbow on it.Here's what we've done so far. Dad planted the seeds. We've got calabrese ....and broccoli.This land cress was planted last year in one of the troughs that dad made. It's got brass (plumbing pipe) legs so the slugs can't get in. Land cress is similar to water cress but you don't need the running water to grow it - just soil.The pea frames are up. Dad made them from old tent poles and chicken wire. I don't know where we found them - we tend to pick things up that will come in useful sometime. It could have been a car-boot, Freecycle or the tip. The other troughs are in front. They will have lettuce sown in them throughout the season. The herbs that are there in this picture I have planted down the side of the garden.Here are parsnips left over from last year's planting. I need to make parsnip soup or parsnip chips or put them into a stir fry maybe. The young leaves behind are garlic which was planted at the beginning of the year.Here  we are in the greenhouse again and this is the grapevine. I pruned it earlier on this year and new buds are now starting to form.Here's the other pea frame. We grow mange-tout as it saves you podding the peas. This side of the frame is the asparagus bed. Nothing is coming up yet but Dad said he saw one just coming through. I haven't seen it yet though! The other side of the frame is planted with one row of parsnips.Here's the other side. You can also see another planted row - beetroot.This parsley is a left over from last year.That's it so far I think."},

Gauge: 7.5 - 8 stitches = 1 inch in stocking stitch  Abbreviations:  K knit  P purl  Sl1p slip 1 as if to purl  K2togknit 2 together  P2togpurl 2 together  SSK slip one stitch as if to knit, slip the next stitch as if to purl; put both stitches back on the left hand needle and knit them  together  Before starting, measure the foot length of the recipient. This is an important measurement.  Total foot length required: ________________ inches.  Let’s Start  Cast on 64 (68) stitches. Divide stitches evenly on three needles. Join in a circle, being careful not to twist stitches. (Hint: make sure  you have an even number of stitches on each needle; it makes working the ribbing much easier.)  Work in ribbing (Knit 1, purl 1 across the round) for 1½  inches. Begin knitting in stocking stitch. (Hint: when working in the round,  stocking stitch is working the knit stitch all the way around, every row.) Continue working in stocking stitch until sock measures about  6 (7) inches, or length desired.  Divide for the heel:  (In this section, we’ll refer to the three working needles as needle 1, needle 2 and needle 3. Needle 1 is where you begin the round;  Needle 2 will hold your instep stitches; Needle 3 is the end of the round.)  Knit 16 (17) stitches from Needle 1. Transfer the remaining stitches from Needle 1 to Needle 2 (or if you prefer, put the next 32 (34)  stitches onto waste yarn so they’re not in your way). There should be 16 (17) stitches left on Needle 3; knit across Needle 3, then knit  the stitches from Needle 1 onto the end of Needle 3. (You may find it easier to work this next section if you divide the 32 (34) stitches  that are on needle 2 on to two needles or onto a piece of waste yarn)  Heel Flap  (The heel flap will be worked only on half of your total stitches and will be worked back and forth.)  With wrong side facing, slip the first stitch as if to purl, then purl across the 32 (34) heel stitches. Then work the heel flap as follows:  (right side facing)  Row 1: Sl1p, *k1, sl1p; repeat from * to end of row  Row 2: Sl1p, purl to end of row  Repeat these two rows until the heel flap measures 2½ inches.  Turn the heel  With right side facing  Row 1: sl1p, knit 17, SSK, k1, turn  Row 2: sl1p, purl 5, p2tog, p1, turn  Row 3: sl1p, knit 6, SSK, k1, turn Row 4: sl1p, purl 7, p2tog, p1, turn  Row 5: sl1p1, knit 8, SSK, k1, turn  Row 6: sl1p, purl 9, p2tog, p1, turn  Row 7: sl1p, knit 10, SSK, k1, turn  Row 8: sl1p, purl 11, p2tog, p1, turn  Row 9: sl1p, knit 12, SSK, k1, turn  Row 10: sl1p, purl 13, p2tog, p1, turn  Row 11: sl1p, knit 14, SSK, k1, turn  Row 12: sl1p, purl 15, p2tog, p1, turn  Row 13: sl1p, knit 16, SSK, turn  Row 14: sl1p, purl 16, turn (18 sts remaining)  (You’ll notice that when you SSK or p2tog, you’re working one stitch from before the gap left on the previous row and one stitch from  after the gap.)  The Gusset  With the right side facing, Knit 9 stitches. (This will now become Needle 3)  Using another needle, Knit the remaining 9 heel stitches (This will now be Needle 1). Pick up and knit 20 stitches along the side of the  heel flap. (29 stitches on Needle 1)  With Needle 2, knit across the 32 (34) instep stitches. With another needle, pick up and knit 20 stitches along the second side of the  heel flap, then knit the 9 stitches from Needle 3. (You should now have 29 stitches on Needle 1, 32(34) stitches on Needle 2 and 29  stitches on Needle 3.)  Work the gusset as follows:  Round 1: Needle 1, knit to last 3 stitches, k2tog, k1; Knit across Needle 2; Needle 3, k1, SSK, knit to end of round  Round 2: Knit  Repeat these two rounds until 64(68) stitches remain. Continue working in stocking stitch, without shaping until the foot measures 2  inches shorter than the total length required.  (Hint: For instance, if your total foot length is 10 inches, work the foot until the sock, measured from the back of the heel, measure 8  inches.)  When the foot has been worked to the length required, begin the toe shaping as follows:  Round 1:  Needle 1: knit to last 3 stitches; k2tog, k1  Needle 2: k1, SSK; knit to last 3 stitches; k2tog, k1  Needle 3: k1, SSK, knit to end of round  Round 2: Knit  Repeat these 2 rounds until 32 (34) stitches remain. Work Round 1 only until 16  stitches remain. On the final round, knit the stitches  from Needle 1 onto the end of Needle 3. The stitches should be divided evenly on two needles. Use the Kitchener stitch to graft the  toes closed.

These are small cucumbers. It's a good job because I'm getting hundreds of them. Cucumber sandwiches with grapes anyone?I like beetroot aswell. Straight from the ground, boiled to death then eaten. These leeks should last us over winter.The corn took a while to get going and it's still not looking too good. We'll have to grow the plants in the greenhouse first next year rather than sowing straight into the ground.The bay tree needs a trim or it will take over the path.Here's a view from back door to the garden. Walk under the pergola to get there. Lily of the valley is at one side and a clematis on the other.The large plant that is leaning over is a bishop's hat chilli plant. The cat is a Tonkinese.Wood is good. The juke box is aswell with all our favourite records to dance to.These are a few of my favourite things.I like to change displays to suit the seasons."},
