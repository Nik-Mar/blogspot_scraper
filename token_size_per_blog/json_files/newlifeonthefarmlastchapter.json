Although we have both spent a lot of time in Yosemite it has been quite a while. If when you visit and come in on Hwy 140 and enter at the North entrance you are greeted by amazing rock facing that will take your breath away.What's new buttercup? Why sheep my friends. I can now add Shepherdess to my other hats. Although these are not my first sheep but a start to a small spinner's flock. Peter and Paul are Shetland withers about 18 months old.  A friend and I brought them home about two weeks ago so they are still in the \"getting to know you\" stage. Both are friendly but Peter on the left makes it easier to bribe . Paul is coming around nicely. The end goal is they will be in the barn before winter with the goats and dogs with access to the acre pasture. More sheep to be added next year. BBboy is the last kitten added to our family via the hay barn at about 4 weeks. He has grown into a handsome cat. Short but sweet for now. Still impossible to add photos from my iPhone to my blog without going back and forth to place them correctly. Suggestions welcome as always."},

{"title": "Autumn is coming !", "date": "Saturday, August 5, 2023", "text": "All the quirky weather we have had in the last several years shows no signs of stopping. To date we really had a very mild summer and no one will hear me complain. Autumn is showing itself in the casting of longer shadows , cooler mornings and not the traditional periodic heat waves that are typical of July and August . I must admit I am still trying to get over being stuck in daylight stupid time without even a by your leave by the government of our county. It must be nice to play God. Thank you I feel much better but my clocks are  and will be set on \"standard\" time forever. I just do the math if needed.  I had the delivery of 58 bales of alfalfa the winter hay for the goats. Last year I was able to stretch the same number of bales at about 125 pounds each last for October through June  and expect the same effect this year. Of course the big thrill was the price was down to $18 a bale. These are the coffee table rectangle bales. Nice to shave a bit off the price to go to other items. Such as fire wood. As some of you know, heat  with a wood stove. After eight years of having 42 acres for our wood needs it seems strange to have to purchase wood . But it was my choice to buy my wood and not pay PGE for it and the propane delivery. As I was only two years into  a new stove much more effective than the older one I loved but was very old and large in the cabin from the last owner.  All in all despite our crazy wet, snowy very cold winter I burnt only about 3 cords total. I have a bit of pine left over and will buy 2 cords of oak and 1 cord of pine to get through this winter. I also have the remains of the oak trees that died this winter to the amount of rain, melted snow and low temps to use also.      The present garden at the junction of the new fence is going to the right.           First section of the new fencing going down hill in the next photo.Down hill run past the Blue Aptos and the drive in gate just past the left over fencing After the gate is the L turn that goes a bit out with a potential pen with shelter.This is the current garden . My Black mission fig is happy in its home . Has a dozen figs developing on it . This is its third year and for a Mediterranean loving tree I am amazed it made it through the winter!The garden is plugging along. It is by no means a huge amount in fact not enough for even canning. But it was started three times due to two false starts when winter decided to hang around and now yes, the cooler temps this summer. The great news is I got my fencing guy to fence off an L shape and hope for a relocation for the garden this coming year. I will keep some of the existing raised beds in the original garden such as my first year asparagus where they are. Redesign it for all creatures veggie wise that do well in not needing full sun and more herbs. I am thinking about putting down the ground cover of a variety that can be walked on but doesn't require constant watering and no mowing. Also able to withstand walking on. There are several types just have to decide.  The barn still needs to have some weather proofing on the SW end. The way our storms come in I need to have two more barn doors larger but the same design as the one I had put in on the tact room entry which also gives access to all four stalls.  Since the previous owners had both of the ends open when the winter winds hit from the SW it blows right through the front stalls and out the backs of the back two stalls. I have finally decided that since they had horses and only lived here for 13 years before myself that the was a period when the state was in drought and the weather much tamer in the winter and much hotter in the summer. Other than that I would like to think they would have protected their horses from the 65 MPH winds we now get.The above photo shows the sliding barn door I hope to add for the SW end of the barn giving an easy slide to cover the end keeping the weather out of the barn this winter."},

{"title": "So Much Has Changed Here", "date": "Sunday, July 2, 2023", "text": "This is what happens when you don’t blog in almost a year, except for blurbs here and there. When Sherman crossed the Bridge it left a hole for two and four paw creatures. I was determined not to make a quick decision and it was almost September with a lot of seasonal items to fill the coming months. Please remember this is the woman who said I don't want a puppy. However when I got an email from my friend and whose family have raised Great Pyrenees for at least 60 years asking if I knew of anyone who wanted a working pup all that went into the dish water. I got both Spinner and Sherman from Angie . I still had Sherman's bonded partner Yarrow at the age of eleven she was looking at retirement in the face or at least slowing down. \"Well what are the lines?\" Angie began to rattle off  a pedigree that had some very familiar names. This litter had Sherman's litter in the background. I hesitated to get a single puppy as Yarrow expected life span is 3 years , possibly 4 years tops. If I only got one then in a few years I would be looking for a buddy that one who was bonded to Yarrow. Deep breath knowing there was an outside possibility the pup could out-live me. I am not planning on it but I like to cover all bases when it comes to my critters . I feel it is the responsible thing to do . Another deep breath \" Angie would you let me take two males?\" So here I am going from no puppies to two. Apparently I had lost my mind. Well of course she would and that is a wonderful idea. So the contract was ironed out I would neuter them as I had no interest in breeding and as Angie has done for so many years she agreed to take the boys back if for any reason I could no longer care for them. They are AKC  and have fancy names  but their call names are Storm and Cirrus as the litter was whelped in a January snow storm . Therefore the litters theme was winter weather. I picked them up at 3 months and they are now almost 7 months. They are typical teenage male Pyrenees full of this and that . Know a laundry list of commands and expectations. They are geniuses one day and the next day I toss out a command and they look at each other as if  they are thinking \"do you know what she wants? I have no clue oh well!\" More photos will crop up including previous ones at younger stages.    And here they are more recently having a good chew in front of the new barn door that I had installed the Spring. And I’m going to let this go for right now and I will be back. I know you’ve heard those words before there were a lot of events this year. A lot of incredible things a lot of amazing things and I think I’m going to walk backwards in time and share them with you but for now welcome to my world Great Pyrenees Central. 💕"},
{"title": "Time For Autumn! ", "date": "Thursday, September 22, 2022", "text": "Look what we got!  Over 1 inch of rain in 24 hours. What a treat it was and we benefited from lower temperatures  created by a late summer heat wave. My garden went nuts. As you may know for us to get rain from June to October is not considered normal. But I had just about a month earlier put in the front runners of my Fall/Winter garden. The broccoli, brussel sprouts and cabbage thought they went to heaven. The tomatoes knew they had gone to the arctic circle and were none too happy about the highs in the 50's and low 60's. With lows in the high 40's and low 50's had them calling room service for an extra blanket.   I milked Nutmeg until her big boys weaned and with all the summer activities and the one woman show around the farm I let it go . She is 9 years old and wasn't producing as much so I simply dried her off at that point. Not before I got in several cheeses and some soap made. This coming November I am hoping to catch Little Trouble and daughter Willa in heat and will breed them to Sundance Kid aka Buddy. Both he and Longfellow just came into rut and not as strong as past years. Longfellow will be 14 in the Spring and Buddy will be 12. I am pleased but surprised the Longfellow is still with us. I am hoping for a couple of doe kids. Presenting my new arrangement for Autumn. The vase is my mother - in - laws and I always loved it. I think she would approve. This photo was taken on the first day of the Oak fire here in Mariposa county. It is from my front porch. I am always amazed at the beauty in fire as well as the destruction. I have been through  the last fifteen years almost as many major wildfires. How I have been so fortunate to never have had to evacuate nor lost anything or anyone to them I don't know. However this year the fires were sat on just as quickly as they began. This fire burned almost 20,000 acres and destroyed over 100 homes. The last of a tradition. The fellow on the left is my son and the young lady on his right is his youngest daughter. You may have seen her in another post as she spent a lot of time with me during the pandemic. The two girls (her older sister) their Dad and Aunt (my daughter) all have letter jackets from the same high school. Dad for basketball and tennis Valley Champions that year! His sister for band.Daughter #2 for Cheer and  her sister for Cheer.The Dude is two years old and still find this knucklehead sleeping in the strangest positions in the oddest places. Everyone who has hung in with me over the last many years knows these two. The little one is Callie who is now 10 years old and much larger. Her buddy behind her is Sherman who adored her then and as recently as this September. Sherman was a crowd favorite he was a clown and a people Pyrenees. Sherman was one half of a bonded pair who kept watch on their goats and more. Sherman always made me laugh each and every day. Sadly he crossed the bridge a month ago and left a hole as big as Texas in my heart."},

Born first day of Spring at mid morning.After a week of mid night checks.  They are sired by Longfellow my handsome home grown buck who appraised excellent by ADGA (American Dairy Goat Association) as a three year old and retained that placement to now as a 13 year old. Have yet to decide what to do with them. I may keep them intact or castrate one and keep the other as a buck. The difficult part of having well bred genetic’s is it makes those decisions more difficult. Longfellow really stamps his offspring with his traits and excellent temperament.No names yet as I am calling them Thing One and Thing Two. Dam Nutmeg is also a lovely doe and at 9 years has held up well. Looking forward to milk , cheese and soap. First fermentation in years. Sauerkraut from a very small cabbage. But has turned out well and I will make a point of  adding cabbage to the new raised bed. Emily grand girl  #3 gifted me with the chicken planter at Christmas. I took advantage and added a Spider plant cutting from Jessica who is a great friend and pretty much family.Have spent some time on trying to perfect my sourdough. It is coming along. We have had mild Spring weather mixed with some cooler days with rain. The photo belowIs looking down the drive with the shop to the left.Love the rainbow no filters used. From the front porch with the street beyond. Again no filters just nature showing off how beautiful the central Sierra Nevada range can be.  Trust you enjoy the catch up.

{"title": "IF A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS ARE SEVEN WORTH SEVEN THOUSAND?", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2022", "text": "Sometimes photos give a false image because how the mind sees it.                           Yarrow at first glance has an awfully long tail? Enlarge the photo and                               take a better look. But between the length of her tail and she is holding                         her paws very close together it may appear longer than it really is.Trouble is a sweet doe and on first look because the large appearance of her head and that she is standing with her left shoulder to the back opps! Where is the rest of her left side?                                         Dude is exactly what he appears to be. A ginger cat chilling at the cats favorite gopher hunting grounds. He is maybe not as close to the hay covered by tarps as you would think.Say \"hello\" to Nutmeg . Nutty is a nine year old doe  She appears larger on her right side than her left. Opps again. She is larger on the left as she is facing us . Our mind tends to want us to believe that it is right , right? Or maybe it is our right? Having your right side almost as large as your left gives us the illusionthat her rumen may be larger than normal. Should we be worrying about her since she is fussing over it and licking. MMMMM could be a sign of painand bloat???!Well now that is better or is it? If a goat indeed carries her rumen on her left what could possibly be going on to make her look symmetrical?? This is Mama Cat. She is both Dude and Esmeralda's mother. Mama cat as you can see is a very limited view of life under the milk stand. She is reminding us that things aren't always howwe see them or interpret it. Mama says think outside of the box.Could a rumen full of frothy bloat push so hard that the other organs are being moved into the the right? Not likely because if it was we would have a doe in a world of hurt  and most likelya down doe also. The more likely cause is a happy ending. The rumenis more pronounced because, drum roll please.

{"title": "The Last Week Of July Was A Weird One Maybe We Are In A New Normal?", "date": "Friday, July 30, 2021", "text": "The week was pretty good up to Tuesday when it got way too busy . Something every day until today and I was just feeling \"ADR\" as Dr. D my long time mobile goat and what ever else you got vet would say. For those who are scratching their head that would be \"ain't doing right.\" I kept plugging away as the weather would be fairly decent mid nineties with lows in the high sixties. In addition to the once a day leave home for how ever long it took to get it done. Little stuff like picking up the repaired stock trailer to hoisting Sherman into the truck for a visit to the vet. Tuesday night at about 5:00 PM PDT an alert was issued for high winds, potential flooding and thunder storms for 48 hours. I had known I had a large hole in the hay tarp and figuring we don't get wet weather of any kind in the summer I back burner that nasty, dusty chore as far out as I could. Hay  Hey it is hot dealing even with tarps with  holes. So as I watched the thunder heads gather I am balancing on ladder in the wind trying to make the proper adjustments between gust and then applying the new bandaid tarp around the largest holes. All the time for hour and one half thinking stinking thoughts not of gratitude to the NOAA for not sending an alert out earlier. Finally got everything done and back in house while adjusting my cranky attitude and switching my intent to gratitude that even if it doesn't materialize that I won't be up at two in the morning climbing around in the dark because it sneaked up on us.So how did that work? Dry. Even with another weather alert issued again we never got a drop . It apparently decided it liked the high country better and stayed in place with the bulk of it in Yosemite Park and elevations above that. Once in awhile good intentions and plans do come together. This is one of those. Ya'll have listened to me whine and wiggle about jump starting my weaving. Getting back to that part of my life enabled me to go to a place that detoxed me. That took me on vacation without leaving home. Kind of like those middle of the night kidding's in the barn. I got started and stopped on the restart. Or sometimes I just had to vocalize it I guess to not let myself forget that once upon a time this fiber life fed a place in me through spinning, weaving , knitting and dying fiber that everything else in my life no matter how cathartic to my soul didn't touch. I finally decided to accomplish that goal was to buy myself a present. I bought a 36 inch rigid heddle Ashford floor loom. Technically a table loom but I purchased the floor stand so I could be more comfortable when seated in front of hit. So with this goal now in sight I found the best fiber with glitter and bling to jump start the project. The best part of this project is there was none. I just sat and spun daily until I had a pound of two ply  yarn done and figured that the project would revile itself in my minds eye eventually.                                I will happily share the project now but not the recipient as I don't want the cat out of the bag. On the loom is a scarf/shawl . It will be when finished approximately 55 inches long and 14 inches wide. In addition a twisted fringe in the warp yarn will be added to each end. Which will add about 7 inches to the length on  each end. Let us cover as much territory as we can in this post. After all one never knows when I will become derailed by something that sparkles. Isn't he/she lovely? This is the year of the tomato worm apparently. I had none, nada , no last year. This year they are becoming plentiful. Bless their little squishy hearts. But I have to admit they are lovely. That is what the chickens said as I toss them over the fence to them. Ah chickens that is the word. Another reveal in my world. My friend and I are going partners in the very first batch of meat birds on Walnetto Farm ever. Now the reason for that is I always knew someone who raised their own meat birds and would be happy to sell off extras to friends. So I couldn't see the logic in adding one more chore to my list. But I have bottomed out at the new location. Lots of folks doing it but not sharing. So my friend Jessica who I have known since she was two and her hubby are going in halves with me both in labor and $$. We will get 25 Cornish Boilers on October 14th and the grow is on. We will not be processing yet. Since this was a last minute act of insanity we choose to go with a processor who is available to us at decent rate and drop off in the morning pick up the next day. If all goes well we should be set up for processing the next batch in the Spring.There are a couple of other potential items not quite to the reveal stage. I feel it best to QT these items just in case something changes in plans. So that gives you something to look forward to in the Fall. Cracker Jack and the pulletsMiss. Kitty and the GopherFlame"},
{"title": "Nothing Stays The Same But Change", "date": "Saturday, July 17, 2021", "text": "I often think about people who say \"I haven't changed I am the same as always.\" My silent thought is \"well then you must be dead or stagnant for life produces change . \" With that said more change here at Walnetto Farm in July. If you saw my last published post with the backhoe visit you know that I had some ground work done. Part of my reasoning was to take a prepared action for one of my mostly aging herd of LaMancha dairy goats passing. I now confess I knew that time was coming on us faster with each passing day. On Monday last Walnetto Farm 2 Cute 2 Be Bad or as I called her KC when she returned to me from the 4H'er who had both bought and named her as a kid took her leave from the farm.  She was ten  years old but she had taken a turn last Fall for the worst. And nothing I could toss out to her was going to change the outcome of her  journey.  I have a few photos of her but they are a filed way back in Google land and I haven't got my skills up to speed yet on the Chromebook to find them. She was a large correct pure white doe with a lovely udder. She had a even disposition and was never pushy or mean to her herd mates. Some of you may remember Tubby Tabby shown above with her partner in barn cat antics Snowy River. Both Tubs and Snowy were stray kittens brought in at the SPCA where I worked as a vet tech during cat/kitten season. They found a home with me and made the move from the Golden Westside of Fresno county to Mendocino county , Shasta county where Snowy passed on and Tabs made the trip to the new homestead in Mariposa county marking her fourth barn to run in her 16 years. Tabs was a herpes kitten as so many street kittens are and with age her episodes became more intense and more frequent. The last intense heat event we had last weekend came on a collision course with her most trying event. She took her leave on Monday also and has earned a place in front of her favorite tree where she always laid out her lines of tolerance to any new recruits that were added to the barn patrol since we moved to the cabin. Let me add Tabs always ran a tight ship and brooked no nonsense from any of the new crew but seemed to have a soft spot for the Dude.                                          The barn is now in the capable paws of Mama Cat and Essi her daughter and Dude's sister . They are joined during the day by the Dude and our newest recruit Miss. Kitty . All of my cats over the last 20 years have all been stray turn ins either to the shelter or to a rescue . I find it interesting that I have caught all of the current barn patrol resting on Tab's grave by her tree at one point or the other in the last week. And when I gave Sherman and Yarrow and opportunity to see her before she was laid on a bed of Pyr hair and straw her favorite mattress that lined her red cow mineral container that doubled as a bed for her when empty. Yarrow kept sniffing her and Sherman went manly on me with a quick sniff , a quizzical look in my eyes and walked away. For the most part I entertain the livestock and working dogs and cats as valued employees. But like employees tend to do they become family. They deserve respect and gratitude for the services they provide us and the companionship they give us. Some leave larger paw or hoof prints in out hearts but they are always shown kindness , gratitude and are part of the family. They will be missed."},
{"title": "Here Is One I Bet You Didn't Know.", "date": "Monday, June 28, 2021", "text": "What does this large hole in the ground have to do with ants? Also what do ants have to do with not having water for almost 24 hours? Anyone? As macabre as this may sound it really was a case of preparing for the worse. Ever since I moved here  in the back of my mind was the thought of what would I do if one of my small herd were to die ? If I had no one to help me how would I possibly hand dig a hole large enough for an adult doe or worse yet one of the two bucks? Geoffrey was a stickler for doing things what he considered old fashioned. I considered it just pretty much stupid as we had now \"modern \" tractors, backhoes, etc. However for the most part he did all the work and if that was his choice who was I to tell him come into the 20/21 century mister? Therefore my concern with what could become a big , stinky issue was pretty much justified. It was always in the back of my mind and finally I found a fellow with a backhoe about twenty minutes from me to come over and for an extremely reasonable amount dig a hole large enough to accommodate multiple deceased when using the bottom up method . Used very successfully in many places looking to accommodate everyone in rapidly becoming crowded cemeteries . Engine started the earth rumbled and the digging began. That is until on about the third bite the bucket snagged what appeared to be a DIY waterline. Confirmed by a loud sound of moving water which indicated a strong potential for the pipe breaking several feet up the line. All of that because no water was visible in the area below us. I began to sing \"gotta love multi owned old houses that no previous owner made note of what they did.\" Now the race was on to the front yard (my house has three meters for electric in place this one was in front. It services the pump and the shop.) to shut off the water main and the electric to the pump. Beginning to see the light? The tall lady in the back hollers \"but what about the ants?\" Ahh yes the ants. When Bob opened the breaker box to shut off the breaker we encountered ants. Yes it is summer and yes I have ants but no I have never checked my breaker boxes for ants before. I ran for my spray bottle of Bac Out. Yes it is disinfectant as I had no ant spray handy and if you look closely note the word disinfectant has the root word ant in it.  I am only joking I know that is not really the root of the problem. HaHa!So ants abated and water line capped off project was finished and we proceeded to turn back on the water and of course flip the switch. I checked the hose closest to the pump as I leave nothing to chance. Good  thing I did no water. I checked several more and determined no water anywhere. SIGH. Bob couldn't get the breaker to stay on nor could he get it to come loose of its attachment to the box. I thanked both Bob and his lovely wife Tammy who had run down earlier to bring him the cap and gluing compound for the broken line. Decided to call my electrician leaving a message for him to call me asap in the AM. Lance called me at 6:30 prompt and after a short conversation at his urging I called my pump guy because logic dictates that if it was more than just the breaker and included something going wrong in the process of trying to right this caused an issue with the electrical workings of the pump they could address that also. Not to mention but I will because my electrician is a super guy he had his entire crew committed to a job at the other end of the county. He would come if the pump guy couldn't but not until after his full day work. What a guy!On close examination there were even more ants in the box when Beau got here than were there the night before . He hit it with serious ant spray and gave me a detailed lesson on how and why ants have caused more than one electrical issue . I am well educated , the ants are ding dong dead and gone, the pump is fine and I can take care of and wrangle this issue if and when this ever happens again. I am also happy to report that currently all goats are still standing and Bob very generously offered to come by if one should met their maker and bring the backhoe to cover them up. Of course leaving an appropriate amount of social distancing for the next victim deceased."},

{"title": "Yes We Have Chicks  Plus  This, That and The Next Thing", "date": "Wednesday, June 16, 2021", "text": "I was a slacker when the chicks arrived right on time.  I got organized and took a few photos and then poof be  gone. I will share my small offerings above. I will also after the loggers leave go out and  take some adolescent photos of the nuggets.Loggers? Yes I had loggers today. I realized in early Fall that the three  eucalyptus trees close to the common fence line were not doing well. They were losing leaves and small branches that begun to look very dead.  I watched them through the winter and they continued to decline. I have always figured that with the height that they had the trees were at least as old as the cabin which went up in 1981. It took awhile to find someone to come out with the all the downed trees from late winter and the early Spring Mono winds events the need was great. I didn't mind at all taking a back seat to my neighbors in the our county who had trees literally in their kitchens, bedrooms etc.I finally located a family who were 3+ generations in out county .  I like dealing local and especially the ones other highly respected their work and work ethic. So today was the big day the trees went down. Three eucalyptus and two incense Cedars that were planted by the previous owner .They were younger trees but unfortunately they were planted in the wrong place. Incense Cedars don't do well at elevations lower than 2000 feet and need full sun. So they went also and dead branches hanging over PGE lines that are deemed my responsibility were also removed.  They did an amazing job and at a very fair price. I am hopeful that in late winter we will light the burn pile and roast some marshmallows.I will not use the eucalyptus to burn in the wood stove as the oils increase creosote and the chance of chimney fire. So I now have a huge burn pile patiently waiting for next February or so for the availability to burn without setting the world on fire. June has become  bnb month at my cabin.  It actually started with Genna over Memorial Day weekend. Next was my daughter in love , Genna's mama, Robin. We had a great time spending a day in Sonora and Jamestown. Had a great lunch at the Diamondback Cafe in Sonora if you are ever in the area great food at a great price. Next up a day trip this Friday from my sister , Annie my daughter the end of the following week . Potentially and old friend from True Northern California the last few days of June. I have a feeling that come July and August I will be my own best company! To say our weather has been wonky is an understatement. Cooled off beautifully after a week long warm spell and now we are marching back into a  heat up again. My garden is so confused it doesn't know if it is supposed to be setting veggies or going to seed. I snapped a few photos today . This garden has been in the ground since I believe late April? I didn't put last years in the ground until late May last year. Just flippin' crazy I say.The bare root fruit trees I set in January are doing great. But I know until they are in ground for two years not to expect fruit or assume they all will live to tell about it. I am just delighted that they don't look like dead sticks I paid a nice sum for at this point! Need to get back at it. I will pop in again with more to share as it happens."},

No I don't know if he is any Maine Coon but I do know he weights 15 to 20 pounds . Trust me when I heft him my back protest loudly. He is NOT FAT he is solid as a rock at a bit over a year old. He is also a amazing hunter most likely due to his early months  living in a feral colony. But he loves me intensely and his favorite spot at night is on my lap getting a paw massage. Pathetic ? Yes but who cares not me!I don't believe I ever posted  a photo of the new wood stove. It is from Pacific Energy and AMAZING. Am I excited? You bet it heats up to 2000 square feet and my living area have migrated up into the 72 degree range with repeated accuracy .  It also has a fan which pretty much manages to push the heat around my stubborn corner that goes around the kitchen island and then down the short hall to my bedroom.  Since installment wasn't until early March I haven't used it as much as I would if the weather was colder. But the times it has I give it an A+.Flowers are a Spring passion. The wreath on the front door ( please note mat below) was one of a two piece set on sale for 50% off at Creekside Nursery in Mariposa. The nursery is one of my happy places.The kitchen window cuties are from one of my stops to Trader Joe's when I happen to be in Fresno for appointments. Good price and very fresh. They have become a picker upper for me . I will eventually plant flowers galore but this year there are other fish to fry.In descending order geraniums and the planter also Creekside Nursery. The planter another 50% off end of season find.  The signage is of course family and was made by Aubrey grandgirl number one. The adorable piggy sponge was in a basket of fun from one of my sweet \"adoptive \" grandgirls from long time friends.                  My new hummer feeder that hangs in the garden in progress with one of my hummer family                                                                                   giving it a go.Another surprise in store  mid May. You have most likely guessed but wait till you see who is coming.The two photos above is what you don't want to see when you open your stock trailer door. This is not my first rodeo with this issue. It is a good trailer but the company should have made adjustments to the style of hinges they used for a door that large. That is all I am saying as I look for a welder who can handle aluminum.New orchard! Front is an Arkansas Black and behind it a Johnathan . The Stella cherry tree. Two tiny bare root peaches an Elberta Peach.Lastly a Black Mission Fig. With guarded optimism I am calling the orchard a success for now. As we all know anything can and will happen in the orchard and garden!Speaking of garden. Spring sprung early this year . We have cool to chilly nights still but days are in low to mid seventies. I need to do confession time now. No false advertising here. I added a new above ground planter. I needed more space and with all going on at this point something had to go. I found the lovely 48 square inches at the nursery. The price was good but it is p-l-a-s-t-i-c. The price of wood has shot up exponentially and I have just about used most of my left over pieces so I purchased it for a fraction of what wood would have cost to make it. I also gave myself some grace and and purchased starter plants for the most part. There I have confessed my cheating ways now I can sleep tonight. There is more much more. Which is partially why I have been a flake of late. More on that later. Hope you enjoy the update and that my momentum doesn't fail me now. Enjoy the coming week!"},

And allow me to be the first to say so long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen ,good night.  Ok I may be jumping the gun but no more than whoever it was on new years day this said \"Wow , 2020 already? What could possibly go wrong?\" I am sure they didn't realize probably due to heavy imbibing  too much adult beverage that in that brief moment they changed the history of the world and off we went.Top of my post this wonderful excessively smoke filled ash laden day is a updated fire report. And again I will repeat \"better to have the smoke than the fire.\"  However after over 30 days of this going on my throat is begging for some clean air. The Creek fire as it has come to be known by Cal Fire is another amazing monster. It had a meager beginning in the forest by Big Creek on Friday September 4th  within 48 hours it had become a raging , roaring inferno of 135,300 acres and today currently is 5 days active now in two counties  Fresno (starter county) and Madera.  The fire has now consumed 175,893 acres with 0% containment. Losing 60 residences and damaging 6.  Mixed commercial/residential 0 damaged with 277 destroyed. Nonresidential commercial 2 damaged 4 destroyed. Minor structures 1 damaged and 20 destroyed.                                         View this morning about 7 AM from my front porch.Now why am I sharing all this less than pleasant news? I am not jumping on the drama rama team . Two fold because this is my life and life is what we post about. If  the fire goes into Madera county physically , right now they have called mandatory evacuations as a precaution, then  we are the next county in its line . Also because I feel that as a whole the media has done such a poor job of becoming the new Facebook that often the information we get sounds more like the National Inquirer than fact. Lastly because this year the number of wildfires is so unprecedented that out of 28 national forest in this state 18 of them are involved and the forest service recently closed the remaining 10 parks to protect them. The state I have lived in my entire life is going up in flames. And by the way remember the picturesque town of Paradise? Without going into rehashing the details of the 2018 fire is again in the line of fire from the Bear Fire.    Clucking good signage. My sister gifted me with this new sign and after I cleaned the coop last week for the winter season it has a home. Not a gate but it works. Let us take a look at what the Lil' Dude Marmalade is up to. SleepingSleepingSleeping Pretty much yup. I must say he is the most incredibly creative sleeping cat I have ever seen. He does get out of his X pen several times a day. He sits on the porch with me, on the sofa with me and also does garden and chicken checks with me. But because he is not neutered yet until that day (Oct. 14th) I cannot give him free range . Open doors pose problems with a loose cat around . Especially as fast as this one is. Last but not least Fall planting began. I planted kale, spinach , assortment of salad lettuce, beans, peas and lastly radishes. The photo is of the bean planting and each row of anything planted got a nice layer of finely crushed egg shell to grow on.  I keep my shells and ever so often when I have enough I run them through my Cuisinart to use in the garden in some manner.  I still have one tomato plant Indigo Rose , herbs, a lingering honeydew maturing and a pepper plant that took forever to go from seed to mature. Now it has multiple small white flowers on it and we shall see. I don't give up easily so no harm no foul ."},

But today I removed all but the Sun Gold Cherry tomato, the Indigo Rose tomato, the melon as one was picked and another needs just a bit more time. Oh and my loved Persian cucumber mostly heat/smoke damaged removed but a few blossoms coming on and heck yes I will baby it on for a bit longer.It also appears that my herbs continue to do well except my peppermint who were healthy and growing like crazy until the fires covered the sky daily and now it it a mess of black little dry leaves. This comes as no surprise in Spring of 2019 I found that four of seven of my lovely rose bushes had fallen to not the heat but smoke laced air from the Carr fire 2018 . Remember this?Air like this day after day makes it difficult for plants to breath add high temperatures and it will take a toll. But as so many are doing daily we get up and  get going and hope this country rights itself and that the sun will come out tomorrow and it is only a day away. So carry and I look forward to less smoke, less fire and lower temperatures.  Toss in renewed growing area and a Fall garden with some goodies to hold us over until the orchard gets started and the Spring garden gets going. I didn't go looking for him. But he called and then came and now well meet Lil' Dude Marmalade a 5 month old orange boy cat who is the epidemy of what my sisters friend calls a \"lucky ginger cat\". He went to the vet on Monday was declared healthy, wormed and confirmed he has a pair. A snip and chip will be held in October to remedy that. He was one of three at my sisters little country school. His loving ways set him up for a quick catch and now he is an indoor kid until after the chip and snip in October . Then he will be slowly integrated into a indoor outdoor kid. Right now his favorite activities are eating, sleeping, eating , sleeping and hugs with lots of purrs tossed in.  How could I say \"no\"?Only 27 days to Autumn and I must say I for one am looking forward to a change. I apologize for the unfinished appearance to this post.

Let it suffice to say the flames were almost on the freeway and just shortly after that stretch of interstate was closed to traffic. The 2:00PM sun yesterday        Somehow the critters manage to play in the smoke pretty much oblivious to any potential danger. For now our biggest issues are thick smoke and heavy cover that is a bit uncomfortable. We do have a fire at 2800 acres last I looked that crossed county boundaries and an evacuation center was opened at the local fairgrounds.We have had a fire advisory warning in place the last almost 24 hours.

They are at that weird stage where their bodies and legs don't match but they are becoming very good at zooming in on the scratch goodies in the morning and evening and on occasion just about taking it out of one of the elders mouths.  I have taken to giving the coop yard a good soaking under the eucalyptus trees every morning as it creates a nice cooling effect for Mama hen and the Chicklets plus the other chickens that makes it easier for them to make it through the hot afternoons until the early evening cool offs. These ladies are digging it literally.And Mr. Newman struts his stuff in his avian Speedo's.My  pickings from my Sun Gold this morning . The larger one in the lower left is an Indigo Rose that is very ripe.  See the elongated Sun Gold to the upper right of  it?  I am finding more and more of these since last end of week when our toasty heat wave began.  It is almost as they are morphing in shape potentially the high heat sucking the moisture right out of them? I picked all that were ripe today as I have found if I don't I end up with tomato raisins from the elevated temps. And they are indeed long, wrinkled and the water leaves the sugars concentrated and the resulting effect is very chewy and super sweet. The herbs are all doing remarkably well  and are growing up a storm.The cukes and zucchini not so well. In fact I will be pulling them up on the next cool morning. I am certain their time is past. Not a lack of water just too many days of triple digits.Take note of the green to the left of the zucchini. It is my little Patio Baby Eggplant. Still producing its little eggplants. Why? I think because of its leaning toward Mediterranean climate. Which is known to be in abundance here.    My lovely Persian cucumbers not so much but I still have one in the fridge.I will hope that my Sun Gold along with the Indigo Rose tomato make it through the next few days and both of them along with the eggplant continue to produce a bit longer. The beans are walking out the gate as I type this post. But I do have a lovely  almost ripe Honeydew melon waiting for me.  I am hopeful that the ground squirrels continue to respect the boundaries and the dogs.  In years past I have seen a group of ground squirrels carry off pretty good sized watermelon and cantaloupe."},

Please engage your imagination because it is the soon to come orchard.above is how they were placed after each trip of a four hour cleaning projectIn the beginning there was old straw, old shavings and an amazing amount of goat berries. And this was just the right side of the barn .  It took about four hours to get to what you see below. Not because I am slow or take frequent breaks but because photos are deceiving and it was plenty thick and in places very wet down under.                               So now clean, layered with DE and then pine shavings.    Oh back to the orchard. I have planned my orchard , gone to a favored nursery and spent a fair amount of time figuring out which trees were the best for my location and needs. I will clean out two more stalls the same size as the one today and each layer will be laid on  top of the other. They will then be watered periodically until the rains begin . I have already added a large amount of crushed egg shells to the first layer. The anticipated effect will be by Jan/Feb when the bare roots go into the ground there will be a mass of  nutrients in place to sustain them as they continue to grow . I still have a bit more research to do on care and feeding of bare root stock. I will be putting up fencing but note that in the first photo you can see a common fence with the current garden area. So only three sides and a gate to go! I anticipate using 99% of materials repurposed from what I have. We shall see how that works out.Trees chosen are all dwarf  and as follows apple, cherry, navel orange, already in possession meyer lemon, peach and possibly a pecan or walnut.

Homesteading wasn't a choice for them it was a necessity. And the levels of \"homesteading\" including the reasons they are chosen are sometimes light years from we modern day homesteaders. We run the gambit of urban even apartment living homesteading to the Kilcher Family Homestead.  And wait despite the \"reality\" show twist this was an amazing family venture from the 1940's. And all fashions and locations in between the two examples. But I think homesteaders have a few traits in common. Do it the best we can, with the least waste and in the appropriate amount of time. Also we all seem to be looking for a way to make it better more suited to the purpose and most beneficial to the cause as a whole. After this introduction here is my dilemma . I am , as so many of us are, living in the present but our minds are a season or two ahead. Because our lifestyle often requires thinking ahead as things aren't as simple as a drive to the big box store down the mountain.I planted my first solo garden here at the new farm. I had a bit of small raised bed experience and growing in pots through the years. But the garden the real deal for many years was the responsibility of my late husband. I was the cook, canner and animal care. The three C's.  Existing Site AThis was fenced for the dogs and not a garden. However it makes a perfect area  for a garden except it only gets full sun about 5 hour to 6 hours a day. However I do have a water source at hand and the area is completely fenced in.If I were to keep this area the plan would be as follows. I would remove the raised beds and stock tanks. I would fence the inner area going from the corner of the dog kennel closest to the front giving a 20 ft width. I would extend the fencing back (to the right side) to the perimeter fencing. With that done I would have a 20’x40’ area. I would then run my rows length wise given me up to 8 rows 2.5 ft wide. Or less if desired. They would be raised up 12-18 inches with 2 ft wide hardware cloth on the ground as we have horrible gophers. The inside fencing would be 48” high and a gate for access. The pups would still maintain the 20x10 kennel area and a yard section to the front of the fence that would be about 15’ wide and 40’ long. Which they can occupy when I am gone from home. Leaving the pups still in the area as predator control. Potential Site BSquint hard and look past the perimeter back fence toward the livestock trailer. The same sized or larger space could be put in as above and fenced as above. The garden would then enjoy more hours of direct sunlight. However doing this would require more fencing since the fencing to the left by the large eucalyptus tree is field fencing with squares large enough to accommodate an elephant.  OK I exaggerate a bit lol.Plus there is currently no working water source in the area but one could be put in. Remember I live in an area where hoses are our best friends. Also there are no dogs any where near that area and I know from this year having the pups in the area does deter the ground squirrels.So with all that said is it site A or site B the only advantage is more full sun through the day? I feel confident rearranging the A site I will be able to have enough plants of multiple varieties I can fill my pantry. However that will be true with site B but with more work and more initial cash outlay. Please give reasons and any suggestions in your reply."},

These are gentle on my tummy and apparently a good variety for pickling, A good number on the plant at various stages of maturity. Getting anxious! Another Patio Eggplant coming on. This little gem of a plant produces a mini eggplant that is 2-3 inches long when harvested and has a very tender edible skin. I enjoy them cut in about 1/8 inch slice and sautéed in olive oil with whatever other veggies cross my mind. I have harvested for almost a month at this date and enjoyed a couple of times a week. Even sent home some for my sister to try out. This great little plant will be in my garden next year!  Another little bell ringer is the Indigo Rose Tomato. The VW Bug of the tomato family. Compact and more like a bush the tomato's are about the size of a small apricot when ripe for eating and very mild . It is very prolific or just likes it here.  The standby Sun Golds. Prolific and very nice balance between sweet and acid. Sorry the fruit in the photo is not that lovely gold hue but at my garden those don't linger on the vine for very long. 😊Itsy bitsy radishes coming up . I have several itsy Honey Dews growing. It will be interesting as they grow to see what kind of support system I come up with . I am hoping for those large spectacular  melons I get at the summer farmers market. Perhaps I shall give Miss. Dolly Parton a holler to see if she can send me any of her unmentionables to support my melons.East side of front porch latticework done by my handy man on Friday.Since we worked with as much of  product I had on hand a bit of creative thinking came into play.The large rocks in front aren't holding up the add on . But at photo time hadn't been removed.The far side of steps on back porch. the fronts of the top two are purchased redwood and the lower face was a redwood board in my shop stash left by the previous owner. The paving steps were there already just rearranged. The last one was installed this morning after photos yesterday.  Same porch only SE view. The blueberries live in the pots . I got a nice little first year crop. The berry plants will get larger pots this summer to give room to go. Due to the gopher issue here I will continue to grow my blueberries in pots as I did in Shasta county. Only up in Shasta the goal of the pots was to be able to grow on my deck with more traffic so the birds became shy about cleaning them off lol.The other project this weekend was my handyman's uncle hauling over his large wood splitter and making short work of the seven trees that PGE took down at their cost in October. The arbor company that did the harvesting kindly left them cut in 24 inch long logs and stacked them for curing. The trees are white oak and the curing is more rapid than the live oak we had in Shasta. Now that they are split in August and September we will be moving them to the new log area into a temporary storage situation. Unless I somehow manage to get the wood shed put up before then. It is toasty today but I have managed to limit the use of the air conditioner by closing up all windows and blinds angled to provide light but discourage blazing sunlight. On the back of the cabin I have the same lovely shades we had in Shasta. They deter 96% of the UV rays and drop the house temperature by six degrees or more. Right now it is 102 outside with 17 % humidity and 6mph SW winds. Inside it is 83 with 30% humidity with my three ceiling fans one in the kitchen dinning area, living room and top of the stairwell which influences the rooms upstairs. So far I have only run the AC mid June three very  humid (for us) and hot days. And  only a few hours setting it to go on only after it hit 80 degrees and then maintain that temperature. I try to keep all my windows open at night and until about 8 AM to 10 AM in the morning. So much for this and that. Have a great weekend and make time for a day of rest."},

The bottom of the laundry basket was always Helen's go to place when she wasn't feeling well or when she was just done. I am beginning to think about looking on Amazon to see if they have laundry baskets in my size. I am about done with a laundry list of things but life was easier when producing a blog was more comfortable.Mt. Lassen from my deck on Ash Creek. Yesterday my sister and I had lunch at a sweet little restaurant up the mountain a bit in a small town that is shrinking as years go by but seems to keep reinventing itself. We then took almost the rest of the drive to the entrance of Yosemite turning back a bit before the entrance as we knew we couldn't get into the park without a reservation per the new restrictions. But a nice day none the less when on the way back my sister asked the $50 question. Did I miss my life in Shasta? I think some what to her surprised I answered yes. I miss the topography. I miss my land and my fiber friends. I assured that her that I really do value and enjoy my new land and home . But there are some things that just can't be replaced. Such as living on a large acreage in the middle of free range cattle land. Or barely getting started on a journey that was in in the future for so long and suddenly wasn't in the cards anymore.  I shared with  Emily the second oldest Grandgirl after she asked \"why didn't you stay there and were you scared?\" I didn't stay because it wasn't practical and it wasn't fair to my family to be so far away. That sometimes you have to just , as Susan says, pull up those PGP and press on. You have to do what is best for herd and not what you want . And you get past the scared part when you get to the other side of the journey when you realize you can do it and you survived. And while  thinking about all this I think I tripped right over why , at least in part, blogging has become hard to do. I am finding my way in this new journey and just like the fourteen year old  who is still growing into their new size 10 boots life sometimes just gets uncomfortable. Getting used to the new protocol of blogging isn't helping my cause. Pictures won't load to my account and all the new icons feel weird. Like anything else a tincture of time will cure all the ills real or imagined and things will flow again. Just a shot in the dark when it is \"normal\" feet will fit into those boots that seemed so big and a rhythm will take place."},

This little one was sitting on the screen on one of my bedroom windows this morning in a small space of  sunshine on a 51 degree morning.  48 hours earlier he wasn't there as the low temperature for Saturday at 5:30 AM was 72. I am certain he was out and about looking for breakfast. Today he just wanted to stay warm.I thought about blogging on the new generator but since gardens are the number one topic in blogland I decided to jump in with the rest of you .  I am grateful to be able to pick the brains of multiple seasoned gardeners and/or homesteaders to bounce ideas off of. I as some of you know was not the gardener of our family. I dappled and did a few small gardens on Ash Creek (the off gird homestead) the last year or two prior to Geoffrey passing. I also did two small raised beds last Spring of 2019 to occupy myself while selling our 42 Acres of Paradise after he passed. But Geoffrey was the official \"master\" gardener for  all the years the children were at home and after. I was the \"master\" food preserver and goat herder.Last Fall I got a wild hair and grew some snap peas, kale and spinach. With fairly decent results and since our winter was without snow on the ground and no days of continuous freezing I pretty much had fresh goodies through until mid spring when I evicted them with thoughts of a summer garden taking their place.During a long weekend visit with a my friends middle daughter Moriah we constructed these 2X8 foot above ground containers of shelving the seller had left in the shop when he moved out. They went together nicely. I put a layer of hardware cloth on the bottom to gopher proof them before I filled them with soil. I also put to use the two 60 gallon stock tanks that were left behind as they didn't hold water well .In the beginning when the plants were littles.A cart that was used on the left behind riding mower became a herb garden when the mover died and it was left by the side of my barn road since I could no longer pull it to move yard waste and more. There has been funky weather periods of Spring is here and no it is not . Winters back wood stove is chugging along and then opps summer is here. Another several combinations there of until we pretty much have stabilized in  a moderate zone or so \"they\" say. Let us not forget the most recent 21 degree differential in only 48 hours.The plants went in late April and early May. So were are we now almost in July? Tomatoes Indigo Rose getting bigger daily and the plant is full of different stages.A stock tank full of happy mixed beans. Life is an experiment! My favorite basil Lavender and it grows in a perfect dome shape. Co-existing with a honey dew melon . I may have to move the basil soon to give the honey dew more room. Another crazy experiment.Lemon grass a first for me and I guess I need to brush up on my Thai recipes.Sun Gold plant loaded and the first almost fully ripened tomato.Below is the top of the same plant just going skyward.What I didn't picture a fully loaded eggplant, zucchini, cucumber and a pumpkin. I figure I will get what I get but learn a lot and spend some quality time with the plants. So much fun to go out in the morning and see them grow exponentially overnight!  I am finally beginning to understand the Jack and the bean stock concept lol!"},
{"title": "I Intended To Write Another Post But It  Wasn’t This One", "date": "Sunday, June 21, 2020", "text": "This is the SE end of my front porch. At least the top part of it. Look more familiar now?Oh wait what is that at the top. Chinking ? Nope. Not cabin chinking but garden burlap dipped in peppermint essential oil. Scratching your head “Boy this gal has lost her mind. Poor dear.”Let me share my morning coffee on the porch. Coffee check, cinnamon toast check , glasses check and phone. About half way through coffee whoa Nellie what is all over that end of the porch? If those are mice they are big poopers . Just so happens a few days ago I was scanning an article about how many folks think they have mice but on closer inspection you realize not rodent poop but the darling of the fertilizer world  quano more specifically bat quano.  There are days I adore my iPhone not many but this was one of them. I learned today that bats aren’t crazy about eucalyptus oil. Frantic search of soap making EO stock yikes all out. However recalling another article that said mice and bats share some preferences. So with a backlog of info fighting mice in my barns I grabbed the bottle of peppermint EO. Added it to a dilution of about 1:10 with water in my garden sprayer and marched back to the porch hollering “it is Evac time 🦇.”It began slowly. Then in earnest they came large , small young, and old. By the time total Evac was achieved I felt at least 100 numbered this colony. One of the young ones got a tiny wing caught between two porch boards. I worked gently with the soft end of a broom to help free it. I relocated a few of all sizes who were too stressed to leave on wing to a darker cooler area to wait out the day. My goal was to move them out not kill them. Yes bats can transmit disease but my goal was to discourage them from colonizing on my porch. Also they are very helpful in many ways. I have had a long list since I moved in that includes bat boxes . After this morning that will be sooner than later. The burlap is a stop gap measure and may not work . But until I can get another body up here it is all I can do.  Ultimately I may need to get a snap board in place plus the bat boxes we should be good.Oh the other post? Next time soon and I mean in the next day or two. Pinky swear 🙃"},

I was living in a time warp. In nine months I became a widow, lived through lots of weather , put a house on 42 acres on sale, sold same with 45 day escrow (it was the livestock clause lol) , purchased a house I had never seen in person but my family had . Everyone needs a good posse bless them :-). Moved this entire farm for the third time  in 13 years. All in the same amount of time I could have brought another child into the world. Just a comparison mind you.So I also feel very absentee here in blog land. I know I have kicked  a few \"shorts\" out to y'all and blathered about just wait until you see what is next. But I will be darned if I ever got that far. And I am now at the other side of the tunnel and still am not sure what caused my lack of follow through. I can compile a list of reasons  excuses but what the heck no.I even contemplated riding off into the sunset on Longfellow ( my 12 year old still stunning as ever buck boy)  but it never happened. I could see the news with photos at eleven . Gently geriatric woman and aged LaMancha ride into sunset during pandemic and OMG  both sans mask ! But it gets quiet enough around here and what would I do without you all? I even tossed social distancing and started occasionally posting on Instagram. But I felt as if I am cheating on friends. Sigh. . .So I will pick up where I left off and sort out photos while I tackle the last 10 months which encompassed three major projects although I believe I pretty much did justice to the huge fencing project . I will begin with the whole house generator  have even had to use it twice since it was put in place. I love it <3I promise to then regale you in the log cabin restoration , moving of the laundry room from the bedroom closet to the shop. The chicken coop and coop yard you have seen but a few doodads  have been added as recently as last Sunday.Helen 2005-2020Blind but brave the most amazing cat I have been blessed to share life with.Little one you certainly proved by how you lived your life that attitude is everything. Inspired all who knew you and your story."},

The mountains of the central California Sierra Nevada's in my little county managed to avoid any cases of the virus making the rounds now but not the periodic disappearance of Spring.I happily plodded along with visions of my first garden in my new home even with the wood stove blasting sometimes or just pushing around a bit of wood to \"take the chill off.\" All the time starting seeds while wondering if they would see light of day or eventually make it to the garden I have planned. In the beginning. Looking betterThen veggies on steroids appearedThen suddenly literally overnight the zucchini explosion requiring the babies to each have their own red solo cup.Everyone sing along. And if you missed the referencejust ask me.Next the cukes were giving me a run for the door. They were issued blue solo cups. For easy distribution with the zucchini to unsuspecting family and friends.Trust me no one needs 12 zucchini plants if they live alone!This is the salad bowl planting of lettuces that Genna and I started the day before she went home.  They are coming along and are currently at 6 days taller and wider. Looking forward to having some nice greens the next trip she makes up to see me.The trouble is it is still too cool for any of these lovely's to hit the above ground garden even if I had it organized tomorrow (fat chance) I will not take a chance on it until we get warmer nights consistently . Hopeful that after Moriah visits this coming weekend we will get the garden framing done and the  hardware cloth put under the frames. Then filled with a foot and half of fill soil from my pile and a top foot of mixed soil and garden soil added to the top.  I am hopeful I will find some worms to add as I have found some in the soil but not as many as I would like to see. This first garden will be a learning experience to be sure!Look what packed up my  hill to the top by the barn! Can you say \"hay!\"Yummy , 120 pound three twine alfalfa. Sixth cutting in late October it is soft, well stored and the goats love it. The two fellows from the feed store made short work of it and returned at seven the next morning with the rest.  I was able to purchase 80 bales of it so we are set for at least another seven to eight months. I like very much the fact that this feed store has a long time relationship with this particular grower. It keeps continuity and limits surprises of the not so nice kind .End of the post cuteness. The orange and white are males and the two grays are females. It is a long story but the two girls may end up on rodent control sometime in June. They will be spayed and properly contained for a month or so . Want them to be capable of  taking care of themselves , being good mousers and establishing a working relationship with Tabby . Tabby has been a barn cat for 14 years beginning with the first move she has a lot of knowledge to pass on."},

Genna , grandgirl number four , and I attended outdoor drive in services. We sang , prayed and enjoyed the service from the back of the vehicle. I am imagining that a lot of small churches in small areas got creative to stay within the limits of  what is to be believed by their local governments.Action shot. Tossing that sourdough out! Genna's first loft of sourdough ever with Gammie's supervision. This is a sourdough starter no yeast recipe and it takes about 36  hours from feeding your starter to finished product. It turned out amazing and yummy now this girl has a new skill to feed herself with.Meal number one chicken /cheese enchiladas with pilaf and guacamole. All from scratch .Pizza anyone? Another lesson in how something great can take more time than calling \"takeout\".  Pizza with ground beef pepperoni, cheeses, olives and home made crust. Prep time including yeast crust  roughly 6 hours. In addition baked on a pizza stone new concept for my girl. Critique ? Delicious ! Four  slices went home to her family to share as did the sourdough loaf.   Next new skill is weaving . I have a small wooden mug rug loom that is used with a plastic needle as the the shuttle. Genna enjoyed the steps in this one from choosing colors (she is my design girl and already has good sense of color) to learning why she won't be washing this rug in hot water as it is 100% wool in the weft. She learned about how a soak in cold water created fulling making the finished project looking great!  A small project such as this gave her a chance to decide if next visit she wanted to try a  more advanced project on either a table loom with multiple reeds or perhaps a rigid heddle.  And she does!What else did this Next Gen girl do? After a sit on the porch for a beverage and snack and wiggling those bunny socks. Took the string mower and the weed eater for a spin I must say she was a natural. We planted a salad garden in one of my big red cattle mineral container recycled  for this project. Collected  eggs , cared for house dogs and chickens. House work too.And last but not least prepared , fueled up the burn and attended while burning . It was a great week at Walnetto Farm for the Next Gen girl!"},

I slept amazingly well as the night before the coyotes decided to party all night which meant Yarrow and Sherman were on high alert all night and my sleep broken at best and not totaling enough to write home about.I had a long list to choose from as I had been away both Tuesday and Wednesday. Tuesday was “home spinning” day for my guild Motherlode Spinners and Weavers. The last Tuesday of every month a free spin in at a hostess’s home. Bring your own lunch, beverages and a treat are hostess provided. That day we met in a home in the small Gold Rush town of Columbia steeped in history and wonderful little shops.If that weren’t enough on my way home I visited the Soap and Candle shop bringing home a lovely sage fragrance candle and multiple guest soaps of amazing fragrance and colors and goat milk too. Always nice to support other soapers. Then on to a highly endorsed family apple orchard with I was assured by locals had the best cider ever. They weren’t kidding and a half gallon followed me home. Along with a corner piece of equally delicious Apple crisp. And a apple walnut pull apart bread Icouldn’t resist at 30% off.     The does watching a neighbor work her way through a free lunch just below the neighbors fenceWednesday was  a split a few have to do errands down the hill plus a fun stop at Hobby Lobby. Yes more home decor found its way into the back of the Envoy.So today was laundry, house work and my first mow lawn day of the year. The chickens were beside themselves. And it smells heavenly now. My “grass” is native grasses and some other volunteers I am getting to know. It wasn’t awfully high but I know from Ash Creek if one does a bit each time weather permits then you aren’t likely to be found draped over your string mower in the late spring dead.Humbled by what you may ask. After that I figured I earned a break. One thick slice of apple bread and a drip coffee with cream . The most recent issue of Spin Off magazine and to the back porch. The cool breeze and clouds were welcome. The smell of someone’s freshly fired up wood stove and the amazing view of the valley below me with Owens creek dancing through it was comforting  . Felt very thankful and blessed to be in a place where I feel completely relaxed for so long of being on call.

A lot is going on since the move .  Was a time when I would be posting crazy since I had so much material to work with. Well . . . I have a ton of material, more than ever but it is as I said to Susan \" it is as if your house is such a mess you just don't know where to start.\" The harder I tried the tighter it got. So now I will try again and maybe with a change of the blog dress so to speak I will find my way through still unpacked boxes and the abundance of blogging material and procrastination will take a back seat.We as a family had a rough spot or two or three over the Christmas holiday. The top of the list was the totally unexpected death of my brother in laws father. The second contender was Emily granddaughter number two in a accident (not her fault) resulting in her truck being totaled and her bits and pieces extremely sore and bruised. But not broken. The time involved especially with the former as he passed on Christmas Day and add life in general made for a weird few weeks.Number three (so maybe we are done for awhile?) is Chloe. My 18 year old calico who we found on the downside of renal failure. So subcutaneous fluids have been started every other day. Not a cure but she still enjoys like and if that helps for a bit we are game.  But we are  mending and it was great to have family support through both.Fences make good neighbors and places for crazy house dogs to roam.  Also two Great Pyrenees and their goats! Disclaimer is the video I downloaded from my phone if it doesn't play I owe y'all.Yes folks the fencing is now finished. Next up on the list is the front gate. Not the gate itself at this point but the gate controls. I have spent many a year opening and closing a gate in the weather. It is wet, hot, cold or \"it has been a long day and I am tired of climbing in and out of my truck.\" So in the last 7 years being blessed with an automatic driveway gate I am spoiled. We all have our creature comforts. The old controls bit the dust. So on the first Saturday of February I will be the proud owner of once again an automatic gate which will also afford my family and friends the ability to have their own passwords , a handy dandy gate keypad accessible from the drivers window, It will also be timed to close after vehicle entry (something the other gates weren't programmed to do) and upon leaving a universal button mounted on a pole accessible again for the driver that will open for exit and self close.  Almost better than first cutting alfalfa! Gate is below . And the structure to the right above it is the shop not the cabin. The cabin is another 50 feet up to the right.Remember the old oven which was the age of the house? That would be 38 years. It died and no \"new\" replacement part was to be found. Imagine that! So the whole house insurance the seller paid for came through. And a local contractor removed the old, inserted the new and created more cabinet space which is at a premium in my country kitchen.  Yes it now has knobs same style and color as the original to the kitchen and I am baking my little heart out even if it is electric. I do have to say it is a sweet little oven . Things have changed in 38 years lol.The time has come for home decor. I fell head over heals in love with the signage above. It nailed what my heart feels every single time I walk through the front door.This beauty was gifted me by my son and his family. Again couldn't be better. I am having such fun finding pieces here and there . A few more are scattered up and downstairs I will add them as I can. This little gem below was featured in an earlier post but earns another spot in this one. It applies to all of us (he and she) in many situations you think?Claire number 3 grand girl who is turning 18 and graduating high school this year. Please don't ask me how that could possibly be as I don't know. We did some wood splitting for old times sake and had home made hot cocoa with whipped cream after dinner as a reward.Photo number one was taken about 10 days ago when the meteorologist missed the mark with the snowfall level by a bit over 2000 ft . So we got this and my drive home from a neighboring town took 1.5 hours when it it is usually 30 at the most. It caught a lot of folks with \"their pants down\" including our snow plows who hit the road just about the time I did. It was icy, heavy snow and actually fun. Yes it has been almost a year since I have driven in a heavy snow event.This little guy and its friends lived through the storm and I am looking forward to more on the way since it has dried up a bit and we see the great orb in the sky more often.I will try to communicate more often. I think I may have my motivation back and now with Spring around the corner   mountain more of these and other projects are on to beginning and / or completion."},

When one buys a 38 year old home one expects there to be ahem, issues. Lucky for me the seller purchased a whole house policy good for one year. I can renew it if I choose to but most likely won't .  Back to the oven. I found that my oven original to the house did not cook at a consistent temperature. Burnt frozen pizza, cookies, homemade sourdough and a lasagna all crisper then needed no matter how I adjusted the temperature.  The plan is to replace the older electric oven with a propane one built into the cupboard space under the propane stove top when the electric one dives into the abyss.  So while I await the decision of if a new thermostat can be located I improvised.

I am not a wealthy woman except in family and critters but I am planning well to make this home what I feel is appropriate to it.Old Faithful making lots of trips from the wood stack to the back porch that I will use as a \"wood shed\" this winter. Next year will see a proper wood shed where the stack itself is this year and apparently years past for the folks I purchased it from."},

So here is to the folks who answer the phones , walk the lines and keep things running as smoothly as a large electrical company can. And they can’t ever be held responsible for what happens in the back room.But whining and tossing around opinions aren’t going to change what it is. But let me give it a go. If you run a public utility company your top priority should be keeping your equipment up to snuff and not I repeat NOT awarding massive bonuses to the upper crust . You don’t avoid legitimate responsibilities like being sure your equipment is in good working order and then passing that responsibility down to the ones who really write your bonuses and paychecks the public.Let us look at it this way. If my truck has faulty brakes and because I put repairing them on hold when I can’t stop and plow into a group of people I will be held accountable for operating faulty equipment and I will reap the ramifications of such. Apparently this is not the case if one is a multimillion bizillon corporation.So here I sit lap littered with cats dogs at my feet. Munching my toffee chocolate bar and sipping red wine by lantern light.I have added water to the stock  tank from two gallon containers I picked up at the market today. I have feed everyone and had an inprov shower. Spent the day today with a dear friend with lunch out and some thrift store shopping and a quilt store visit on the valley floor.I knew what I could potentially be set up for when I came off my mountain and back on the grid. I was hoping for the grace of one winter to get the water holding tank and generator in place. But greed allows no luxuries except for those who create it. So until I can do my homework and get the numbers crunched we will be as prepared as possible. By the by the first warning was sent by text at 7:05 AM. The lights went out and at 2PM same day.

{"title": "Good Fences Make Good Neighbors When You Can Get One Built.", "date": "Monday, October 14, 2019", "text": "Moving is always a chore. No matter if you are moving from a tiny house to a ranch or to a smaller space from a larger one. If you bring goldfish or Angus it will present challenges that nothing else does.Moving from Ash Creek property in Shasta county comprised of 40 acres totally relying on totally  solar to the new farm on 3.64 acres back on the grid was no exception. Bringing livestock with me (goats, chickens, dogs and cats) presented its own set of issues. First was all the fencing needed to be replaced as it was either not Pyrenees, goat or Border Collie strong. It was old for the most part some I swear us from the time the pioneers came through. Much of one stretch is almost none existent let alone sufficient.  I cannot lie both the street side and the common fence between my property and my closest neighbor was ok. But there is more to the story on that.So when I had to move in a \"greyhound\" fashion I had to plan for keeping everyone safe and healthy as I knew the fencing would take awhile. That involved improvising with corral panels left to me on the property. The previous owner had horses so to make them work for goats and Pyrs each one we used had to be reinforced with a 16' ft long 5 ft tall cattle panel. Corral panels are usually 10 - 12 feet long and are a pipe construction making them stand alone when linked to each other . Cattle panels cannot stand alone and need support from either T post or being attached to another panel such as corral panels. The photo below shows part of the area we did to give the dogs and goats a reasonable space in addition to the custom build \"mare motel\" that came with the property. But only temporary. Like all well planned parades something always goes sideways and this theory proved to be no exception. I couldn't find anyone to start the fencing prior to my taking possession of the property. In our first move to Mendocino county we were able to do so with a hold harmless clause but no one in our new area was willing to jump into that potential snake pit. I can't say I blame them as litigation has just about become a spectator sport in last 25 or so years. Then I found as I called company after company that apparently a large part of this central California foothill community had fencing done this year. So the wait time was a unheard of 3 - 5 months. With the stress of moving plus into spaces smaller then usual this wasn't acceptable.So I continued on my search and found a seasoned fence guy but with one draw back . His real job is with Cal Fire. I was content to go with him even knowing the process may be slower but a better shot than the options. That was until the fire opps. Although he has been able to do several equipment drops the \"real\" job totally took him away beginning October 6th to the fire lines of the Briceburg Fire . https://fire.ca.gov/incidents/2019/10/6/briceburg-fire/At this point my anticipated finish date of end of November for all the livestock fencing is realistically now the end of December. The critters are doing well even though our day to day routine is limited. With the bad western fence none of the dogs can leave the barn / pen area without being on lead. The house dogs haven't left the house without the same restriction.  The last thing we need is search and rescue on any of them. Do I trust them yes with some hesitation on the house dogs as we have too many cottontails and squirrels to make it a very tempting opportunity. So everyone gets at least one walk about a day . The house dogs have a 10 x 20  ft kennel they can use to be off lead outside and since they love me so much they like to be where I am and they can see me from their kennel if I am out doing chores, yard work and so forth.For now we will patiently wait and continue on as best we can manage. Knowing this is not forever makes it easier and in a few months it will all be a distant memory.Stay tuned. I am hoping to churn out a post today or in a few with the debut  of  the best kept secret of the month \"Do my neighbors have coop envy?\""},

{"title": "Adopted By A Wild Tom ", "date": "Friday, September 27, 2019", "text": "As time goes on I think of blogging but my big projects I am saving to post with start to finish photos. That would be the chicken coop and the fencing. So I am left with bits and pieces a little cheese making, soap making and more. Like being adopted by this boy.He was resting by the current chicken coop when I rounded the corner from the hay barn and sent him into a frantic burst of something between a jog and a lope if such a mismatched fellow could. He took off last night and returned sometime this morning while and the house dogs were busy doing other things. He then proceeded to cruise down the west side of the barn road taking time to grab snacks from the wild oats that I mowed down a few days ago.As if having this big guy was around wasn't enough of up close and real wild life Sherman and Yarrow began about one in the AM to go off like fire crackers. I tried to ignore it think it would (whatever it was ) pass by and we could all go back to sleep. I was the fool as it continue on momentum increasing. By the time I made my third trip to the back porch that is in close proximity to the barn it was apparent something was somewhere near and wasn't leaving any time soon.I know my dogs pretty well but ever so often when I can't see or hear another dog in the valley barking or coyotes singing I kind of question their sanity. But after a few minutes in the barn with the goats looking at me (must of been my Owl jammies) as if to say \"it has finally happened those two fluff balls have lost it\". That I took my third trip around the whole barn scouring  the west side but when I finally turned my gaze and flashlight skyward I had a moment and looked again. The oak tree closest to the barn had eyes. Three sets to be exact. This is about two feet from the barn side and in an area that isn't sheathed with plywood yet. then the eyes had faces. OMG we have bandits in those branches.A very ample adult (most likely Mom) and two older juveniles about ten feet off the ground and weren't leaving the safety of the tree for nothing. I knew sooner or later we would encounter the bandits of the forest as we have a seasonal creek at the bottom of our pasture and everyone knows where there is water there are raccoons.   I shut down the light and went back into the barn killed the lights there and waited about ten minutes. Walked around the side just in time to see the adult (this critter hadn't missed a  meal lately) pacing the bottom of the sagging , loose really old three foot field fencing looking for a space that would accommodate her girth. The kids (yes they were darn cute) kept poking their little faces out between the leaves. But even with me tossing sticks at them they weren't budging. They had a good look at the Pyrs and I can say I would of probably would have paused to think on that option myself.So back to the barn calling Sherman and Yarrow into the tack area and shut down the barn lights again . The three of us with Tubby Tabby the barn cat waited about a half hour. I was hearing twigs and acorns hit the roof and finally slipped back out the door to check if any progress had been made by the young ones. Scanned the tree and the immediate area to find they had made their escape and were most likely with Mom waddling down to the creek or neighbors cat food.I only heard from my two fluff balls a few more times before the sun came up. And when I did it was accompanied  by  multiple other dogs in the valley or the coyotes up the hill in the cow field. I grabbed a few more hours of sleep and the Pyr's? No worries there they have been snoozing all day."},
{"title": "Domino Effect ", "date": "Thursday, August 29, 2019", "text": "Tubby Tabby in front of empty food bowl. Don't buy into that pity party look. Today she has already had a half can of wet food, an ample saucer of fresh milked goat milk and out of the cameras eye is a good sized bowl of Taste of The Wild dry food which is never let to diminish past a certain level. It is feline drama at its finest.The domino effect is in full force at the farm.  While there are still a considerable amount of  boxes in the garage aka shop quite a few have  been unpacked, broken down and are now currently waiting to be take to the transfer station for recycling. Apparently finishing one task around here is going to constitute the birth of another job. That is the domino effect.Another example is the fence building is reviving up for the beginning it too comes in bits and pieces. First we had the fence guy come out estimates made and offered and accepted. Next he will come out and do a layout on the dirt with bright orange spray paint. Then the next time he comes he will have gotten 1/3 of his contracted fee with materials in hand and commence to sink some post. Then on his next day off from his full time job (that would be working for Cal Fire) he will continue on. After fire season is over , about the time the fat lady sings, he will be out on a more consistent schedule and hopeful it will be finished by end of October  or earlier.That fencing most likely has the largest domino effect. When done the goat area will have increased in size exponentially meaning much happy goats but especially Pyrenees. They aren't suffering but it isn't their normal size and they don't get as much exercise as I would like to see.  Also it means the Ari and Callie can go off lead and have their own area with house access. Did I mention that we have a herd of cottontails here? Well we do and between them and the ground squirrels (altho not as numerous as on Ash Creek)   I can only imagine what a race would be on with them off lead.Another domino effect. The weather has been warmer and with warmer weather plus winds the fire risk has risen. With a cooling trend on the way the risk will be lower and I can now with confidence and a long hose start string mowing the dry weeds from the last growth down. This will be helpful in the domino sequence with the fencing as getting those small dry weeds down will help in keeping the fire risk low during periods of welding on the fence.Next consideration is in a few weeks I will leave midday and end up in Shasta county to pack the truck and part of the trailer with as much of what was on Dallas's trailer as possible. Get some sleep and the next morning loading up the boys and delivering them to yet another half way home but only an hour from the new home,After dropping the boys off and heading home I find myself full circle on the Domino effect. As I unpack the trailer and add to the existing boxes to those from the latest pickup run.Flame on the left a red sex link in the center and Mr. Paul Newman on the right.  All of them plus those out of camera are excited to hear that the \"real\" chicken coop may be breaking ground sooner than anticipated. And we all know  what that means. Get the coop up the chickens moved and the ply wood can come off the walls exposing the stall and with a bit of fencing for a run maybe Longfellow and Sundance may come home sooner then we thought. So put your left foot in and your right foot out and you might get the domino effect.PSSince everyone is very busy with wrapping up summer the drawing for our first month anniversary will be put on hold. So now y'all need to read the next installments so you won't miss out!"},

The view above is from my front porch. Oh it gets better to be sure but this is for starters. Moving is like getting a \"new starter\" kit. But it is also similar to one of my favorite Mary Engelbreit quote's \"wherever you go there you are.\"So after a 7 hour drive looking like a gypsy caravan Walnetto Farm has landed. A dear friend of many years and her husband have been incredibly helpful before, during and after the move. Donna drove Geoffrey's vehicle loaded with 4 house cats and Tubby Tabby the barn cat in crates and anything else we could stuff in. Believe me that was a lot of stuff. I hauled my livestock trailer with 6 goats  and Sherman /Yarrow  (who really counted as 2 more goats) with them. The chickens including my beloved Flame had a shaded pen squished in between more stuff in the truck bed.Did we forget anyone ? No. Ari the English setter and Calli the resident Border Collie Aussie were strategically placed with more stuff in the truck cab.  And when we pulled in we were all accounted for and alive except for one ginger hen. Even with the provisions that were made to shelter them from sun, wind and a very warm day she was dead upon our arrival. Last checked at the halfway fuel stop and she was fine. But sometimes transporting animals doesn't end well despite having crossed all one's T's and dotted one's I's.This lovely doe made the trip without missing a beat or a milking. She is now giving a gallon once a day on a regular basis even with the move and has blossomed into a lovely two year old. You may remember her looking more like this. Even as a senior kid always on the run I knew Miss. Willa had potential.A familiar chair with a familiar quilt gifted to me by Pamela my good friend adds home to the new living room. What is to be a summer kitchen or a winter BBQ area. With some modifications from my \"things to do list\"  Tubby Tabby the barn cat knows a good thing on a warm afternoon. Got the tact area in the barn aka Mare   Doe Motel cleaned up and organized yesterday.Some of the does who reside in the area . A copious amount of fencing is being planned and contracted as I type. Since Geoffrey passed I have to find good local help to do what he used to do that I can't.This is the delightful garden area with a fire pit , gates on either side , a Hibiscus tree and lavender. More herbs to come in time. Plus a brick pathway perhaps next year? We have been here for almost three weeks. Donna stayed the first ten days with us and helped a lot. I will pop up on your blogs or here  with more frequency but still have copious amounts of boxes and appointments coming up .  Seeing family of one sort or another on a weekly basis which makes my heart sing. If you want to be included in a drawing to celebrate our first month here please submit your contact with your comment.

So when I got a call from my realtor during dinner and the latest episode of Barnwood Builders ( one of few shows on real TV I watch) I almost swallowed my plate whole. We had a showing scheduled within an hour or two of the whole thing going live as it is now called on the internet. https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/25550-Ash-Creek-Rd_Anderson_CA_96007_M29335-44960 Just in case you have been dying to know what my place looks like - NOT!At any rate after having sold a house in the great reality disaster of 2006 I sorta kinda know my stuff and the drill. To be technical that house went on the market in 2008 as some of you may know of one needs to wait two years after the purchase to market it as to avoid the capital gains taxes. And then it sat and it sat and it sat. Not selling until 2011 with a huge hit to our pocket book. Because no we didn't get even close to what we paid for it. Sigh, let us not talk of that now.Marketing a house is something close to living in purgatory even with a good realtor.  One's whole life revolves around showing and keeping it clean to show. So if we include my current journey I will have danced this dance 3 times in 12 years since we sold the Fresno farm to current. I WILL NOT HAVE TO DANCE THIS DANCE AGAIN EVER. Just wanted to make that clear as I was cleaning bathrooms prior to my shower at 9:30 PM . And setting my internal alarm to wake prior to even when the recycle truck rumba's down our street pre 5 AM. So I could do touch ups after regular chores and let myself breath.So interested buyers arrived twenty minutes early thank God I planned for some down time so I was ready when my 16 paws alert went off.  They were here for thirty minutes. It will be interesting to see what comes of this.The real estate folks know all this stuff to a T. Short visit are likely to garner little to none, long visits may but may also just be looky lues or folks who aren't even in the market they were just bored that day. Or \"Gee Fred I have never seen a totally off grid home let's go check it out!\" If they only know what a responsible home owner drags themselves through to make sure their home is ready to really shine. If you don't believe me ask the goats whose barn cleaning (and I mean close to having the health department show up) has been delayed either from rain, getting the initial pre marketing stuff done or as in today losing a barn day to make sure all is at the ready.Then there is all the home showing etiquette. Owners are basically expected to greet at door and then exit away from showing as not to intimidate potential buyers. Today is a good example of that when I mentioned I had a blind cat and would they please be mindful not to let the cat out the wife asked wide eyed \"you have cats?\" To with I replied with a smile \"I am a vet tech I have just about one of everything. But I do have 3 house cats.\"  Eyes still wide \" I am allergic to cats really bad.\" Ok I was good I didn't reply with something like \" And it never once entered your mind you may encounter cats while visiting potential homes?\" I smiled and simply said \" Well they are all hiding out and I cleaned as if it was the second coming just for you.\" OK I didn't say quite that but you get the idea.They did appear to be nice folks and if this home tickles their fancy I hope they know I plan to hire a team of professional cleaners on my dime to make their new home safe for them."},

Actually it is the third I have started but the only one I managed to see through a winter. And considering that this winter offered up 100 year floods for our area and unprecedented snowfall I would say we have a bell ringer. Why Lilac? Because in the house I grew up in from 1955 until I finally left for the last time in 1967 had Lilac bushes that were my Mama's pride and joy. Interestingly enough when my youngest sister and I came together and forged a new relationship as adults in 2015 when our Daddy passed , I noted she too had a Lilac bush in her yard.So here is the thing. I am a now single woman living on 42 acres (that outnumbers me right there) and I have livestock, I have the usual assortment of canine and feline companions and working dogs. I have chickens. I am now at the tender age of 70 years old ( not young for I have forged ahead and earned each one thank you!) the captain of this ship. I now can hand split wood by hand to keep warm, weed whack, string mow , run a two inverters multi solar panel off grid unit that has its own barn, birth kids ok I cheated I have um multiple years of practice on that one. Keep everyone warm, fed, healthy and pump 1,320. gallons of water from under my house on my new gas run pump. I am also exhausted more often than not (and fire season isn't here yet) I am understaffed and over worked . No not under paid as purrs, crazy kids jumping on my lap and dog kisses are high scale pay you know. And I am without a support group closer than the 5 and one half hours it takes for a sister, kiddos or grand girls to get here.So the heartbreaking ( I won't lie here) choice was made to , a gasp from the crowd, sell my beloved \"42 Acres of Paradise\". I am figuring if the worst thing in my life is moving back to the central California area then perhaps I am doing alright. I am looking for a smaller, much smaller place in the foothills of Fresno county. I will be no more than an hour from my family. I will take every critter with me as I am responsible for 90% of them being on this earth to begin with and the rest through choice. I will continue to as life permits pursue the life of sustainability I love. I will have goats but they will more likely than not be glorified lawn ornaments only, chickens will come too . What would I do without my Flame? Of course Sherman and Yarrow will be needed to keep everyone safe from those wiley  coyotes . Ari and Calli need to keep me in line and the cats too.I will miss my land , my fiber friends, the amazing events which have forged who I am today. But on the flip side I will have easy access sister time on a regular basis, enjoying my son and daughter. And the grandgirls? Oh yes that is part of the plan. \"Aubrey and Emily you two are the oldest could you come and stay at Gammie's for a week in October to feed while I go to Idaho to visit friends?\"What could possibly go wrong???!  😉"},

Apparently her Mama , one of my two Rhode Island Reds dropped her eggs and exited stage right. Next occupant of the nesting box was one of three Buff Orpingtons.  Who happily felt broody and sat down to finish the task at hand.As you can see Flame has blossomed into a lovely hen and eats scratch out of my hand twice daily. She is a precious joy to me as she and her Mama were great diversions during times of multiple wildfires and the journey to my becoming a widow. Three guesses. OK I will enable you all. My new toy that I purchased during the torrential rains prior to the generous snow. This marvelous piece of equipment , a gas fueled pump, empties my \"swimming pool\" under the house in about half an hour when it is full. And yes I am in the process of getting up close and personal with an excavator operator concerning putting in a French drain after the rainy season has gone wherever rainy seasons go. The most destructive issue currently. It is in the buck pen and the bug eyed boys act as if nothing has occurred. This tree has lived in harmony for the 7 years we have been here. Until the more than generous amount of snowfall we recently received. Now not so much, sigh. It did land perfectly and to my amazement didn't do nearly the damage it could have done. I will have to take down the dead oak and will replace the 16 foot cattle panel it dented in several places. But the caveat here is it left the \"extra\" panel attached in front of it unscathed. So bingo, replacement panel at no cost. Well  o.k. it was a few bucks about two years ago. But right not it is considered free of charge.This puppy knocked my 48 inch high field fence down to 24 inches. I walk all four dogs in the back 21 daily this is not acceptable. This is my daughter Annie who worked with me , three bow saws, one wedge and a sledge mallet to take it down. As if nothing ever happened.  Thanks baby girl you are a blessing! And serendipitous at the Chiropractors office on FridayNow to wait out the next few days of winter storm number , well, I think I am loosing count !"},

We got slammed even on the valley floor they got a good amount. It has slowed Shasta and parts of Tehama county to a crawl. Courts and schools closed. I can't leave my property as the plows that were so diligent in 2013 with the \"Arctic Freeze\" of three weeks are busier at lower elevations."},

{"title": "Not Another Post!", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2018", "text": "Yes yet another post .  After the fiasco of  a technical nature I needed to experiment. I had written a post and previewed it then set it for release into the ether at 1 AM. Apparently somewhere in its travel the font shrunk. Wisp of Words kindly brought it to my attention. So I snagged it and turned it every which but loose to no avail. No matter how much finagling I did with the font it always reverted to the way it showed up after being flung into the ether in dark o'clock. I then said to myself \"self you must do another post and lunch it in real time for any kind of a solid conclusion to your assumption.\"  And I did. To be sure this works in all ways let us take a stroll around the farm for some photos. Just for you Mama Pea look what I found in my strawberry pot today! It had three friends also.  If you click on photo above you can see this honey bees wings in action .  Longfellow \"Would you please pass the Alfalfa?\" Mama of Flame in the rear with her juvenile delinquent off spring in the lead.   The east end of the coop all snugged up in anticipation of wind, rain and cooler temperatures.  The \"man\" of the flock Mr. Paul Newman who asked \"what you looking at?\" This Moe. She is one of three pullets that are the Aruacana sisters.   Manny(far left)  and Jack to the left of the red sex link.

Your allegiance is appreciated and the next check for your services is in the mail . Seriously folks where would I be without you? What I meant to say you are aware how I have struggled with getting a new look together and wow here it is in all its glory or lack of for you to enjoy. Gentle comments appreciated. I am hoping that this will be two things. The last time I change my complete blog look and the last home of Walnetto Farm on the internet. I am not leaving either the internet, blogger in specific or this good earth anytime soon but I am thinking this is the last homestead. It is a thought I have had for a long time now just haven't verbalized it much. Look at this. A blast from the past with wonderful alfalfa and Snowy River in the back with Tubby Tabby front and forward. So typically Tabby. Monkee one of the tripod cats here. He was a talker too. You may remember that he would stand by the laundry room door to the garage and command your attention when one of the other cats was waiting to come in. And he was always right. Miss this chatter box feline.The big snow of 2013  that came with an Arctic freeze and subzero temperatures that lasted almost three weeks . Lovely to look at and so much fun. But it also came with frozen hoses and finally even frozen house pipes. Fun but maybe when it snows next it won't bring quite so much fun with it?New kids Waylon on the right and Willa on the left. Little Trouble who got the award for the goat mama of the year.  Baby Goat Bums what is not to love?What I  always said to my kids. And it did! It is good to be home again. Please come to visit and don't forget to hit the follow link if you want me to automatically show up on your end when I post. Good morning  I went out about half an hour ago to turn out the two withers and the two does in the pen next to them and Miss Willa was acting like she was in heat again and I’m thinking you’re crazy it’s only been almost two weeks since I tried to breed her twice and she wanted nothing to do with it.So I got the four of them out to the field and she was being very sweet to the bucks at the fence it was  like I’m your new best friend.  I watched for a while and I thought man I just you know you’re there but I don’t know and you just supposedly had a heat but maybe you didn’t maybe you’re just adjusting, maybe you were pretending would  think after 35 years I would know something wouldn’t you ,guess not? So as I stood there watching them and she was communing with her father through the fence and I was looking at him saying I don’t think so. I noticed that her brother who is the wither is mounting her and she’s looks back at him and goes back to talking to her Dad so I’m thinking OK well maybe we have something here.So don’t judge me but there still is not a collar on this doe .I keep trying to sneak it on her and she adamantly doesn’t want it and I really don’t have the energy at this point to hogtie her so I figure eventually it’ll happen but with that said the only way to proceed is to get her back into the barn. Without a collar or lead rope this took some fancy footwork on my part I got her back into the barn left everybody else in the field went over and got Longfellow with a lead rope on him and he’s knows where she is he’s looking straight at her and what does he proceeded to do ?So I figure OK I’m not gonna lose him he is going to run 20 feet to the gate and I’ll let him in. Does he run 20 feet to the gate?  No he takes off and runs to the far side of the fence line and starts smoozing her through the fence down there. You really don’t want to know what I said when that happened.  The dogs were barking ,the cats were running  and the air was turning blue around my head.Got my hands on the old boy using a few choice phrases in his direction dragging him back to the other end got him within eye shot what does he do ? I had left the panel that divide the gates out and he walks on the wrong side of the panel and starts snorting at his son mercy! At this point I’m thinking maybe at nine he’s too old to find his way out of a paper bag but we persevered. I got him on the rope took him over to the fence he took one look at Willa and said “oh there you are” I just shook my head I was done. I open the gate put him in she kind of danced around him.He said “oh let me follow you at 200 miles an hour “and they ran and they were off and I just let it happen. I just said “OK God this is your hand you take care of this I’m done.”I hope it isn’t a sin to pray about goat sex because I was praying. I was praying she didn’t run into a fence and break her neck and blah blah blah but then I noticed something. She was running but she was looking over her shoulder all the time and finally I got them in the barn in a smaller area and she went “oh “and stood still and he went” awe moment of opportunity. “ And it happened.They had a moment and then she promptly  peed I wanted to strangle her.  In the back of my head I keep thinking “you’re not going to be here tomorrow you have to be gone to the chiropractor and errands no breeding repeats tomorrow “so I just left them together for a while and he covered her again and she was more accepting. But all I could think about when all this was going on and I was dashing from here to there and everywhere and the dogs are going nuts and the cats are going crazy and the chickens are wondering what was happening to their world was my obituary going to hit the paper and it’s going to say something to the effect of elderly woman dies while trying to breed buck to doe. So I’ll cross my fingers for Ellie you cross  your fingers for Willa and we’ll see what happens just wanted to share this excitement with you."}
