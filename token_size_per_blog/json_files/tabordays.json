{"title": "When the Ceiling is Starting to Fall", "date": "Sunday, January 28, 2024", "text": "Imagine that when you get up in the morning the ceiling to your abode looks about 1/4 inch lower.  You do not notice it at first, but something is wrong and you know it, even though you cannot put your finger on it. You go to an Architect and he looks at the ceiling and says not to worry because it seems just fine to him. The next morning you get up and you are sure that the ceiling has moved, but you have a busy week ahead and you ignore that.    A few months go by and you notice the ceiling is almost 1/2 inch lower. Still, it is smooth and no paint is chipped, and it seems that when people come to visit they do not notice, or the change is so small they politely ignore it. There are no cracks where it joins the wall. Odd?  You wait a few more months and then make an appointment with a building engineer.  He comes by and shakes his head in agreement.  He says he has seen this before.  \"Not much you can do, but keep an eye on it.\"  He gives you a gallon of lighter-colored paint to make the ceiling look higher.  It seems cosmetic, but you do it anyway. A year passes and the ceiling is definitely lower and looking looming!  You have been working at other activities ignoring it, but did move down the drapery rods so that they no longer touch the top of the ceiling.  The engineer says you are lucky that you built the house with such high ceilings because those homes with lower or regular ceilings have less flexibility in dealing with the changes. As the months pass you realize that just moving drapery rods is the smallest of sacrifices that are going to be made in the months and perhaps, years ahead.  The windows themselves may soon get pressure and then be dangerous!  Yes, you can crawl on your hands and knees for a while, but eventually, the house will collapse and you will have to move.  If you live with someone who cannot crawl, that will have to be fixed!Well, if you have followed me this far, I appreciate your stubborn tenacity.  Above is a rather weak analogy, and yet something that came to me when I was having a man who had been laid off and needed money come to add some trim to my bookcases and paint the cracks in my house.  It took three days of living in spackle dust and chair covers and a lack of privacy.  It was surprisingly stressful.Above is the story of how looming pressure affects those of us who live with someone who has dementia.  Days go by and you do not notice.  Then one morning he asks you the same question three times within a half hour.  At dinner, he thinks he is eating a salad of tomatoes and avocados and it is a salad of orange slices and avocados.  During a busy day, he may interrupt me 5 to ten times to help him with an email, a phone call, or to find something important.Please do not praise me for my patience.  I have no patience.  It is tax season, and there is a big project being set up (ANOTHER LONG TEDIOUS STORY), and we have a two-week cruise in March with lots of details.  My family is going on this cruise, so we really want to join them as it may very well be the last time we are all together.I have cajoled and argued and sighed on the worst days, and then a week of normal goes by and I forget where I am in the grand scheme of things.  Yes, there are lots of tools and helpful procedures and I have started to use a few.  I also think writing about it is helpful to me, while perhaps annoying to my readers."},
{"title": "Catch!", "date": "Wednesday, January 24, 2024", "text": "My breath that is...I am just trying to catch... my...breath.  I was looking forward to a break after the holidays, maybe daily bubble baths, maybe reading some books from a series...actually re-reading them.  Sipping a bourbon and soda while watching a Britbox mystery.But even before the first cold snap of January, I found that my weeks were filling once again.  Doctor's appointments for both me and my husband,  a volunteer thank-you luncheon at the mission center, and pick up the Grand-dog in the city for a four-day visit.This was followed by my laptop refusing to work and the purchase of a new laptop.  They are NEVER plug and play, so some of the stuff did not transfer as well as other stuff.  That meant a day (or more) of working out the bugs.The next week was playing tag with a chatbot and various appliance repair people to have them fix the wheels on my freezer shelf which was still under warranty.  Then my sis-in-law suggested we add two days to the front end of our upcoming trip in March (that will be for the next blog) and I find have little patience for dealing with airplane websites...but ended up paying someone to assist.  That only took TWO DAYS.  Then I had to find the hotel and call them to cancel a reservation and make a new one two days earlier.Master gardener meetings and an educational seminar, etc. filled the evenings.This week is stuffed with planning excursions for our March trip, assisting my husband with a talk he insists on giving at the Senior Center, and finally being around for a friend who has been laid off and needs a job, and thus I have lots of painting and patching for him to do in this not-so-old house.Oh, one thing I forgot was I am starting to label some of our light switches.  Hubby's dementia means he spends time flipping switches but forgets to flip back if they are not what he wants.  He still drives, but when that ends, my life as I know it will be very full as he loves getting out and about.Ok, your turn.  And you had better come up with something less tedious."},
{"title": "Some Trivia and There Will NOT Be a Test.", "date": "Thursday, January 11, 2024", "text": "2024 arrived here with several days of heavy rain and winds.  Cities to the north are flooded, but they lie close to the Bay and usually flood when rains are this heavy and tides this high.  We sit on a small hill that is about 18-20 feet above high tide and thus should be dry until we move or pass on.  The water did wash over our dock.    We went up to the daughter's house for Christmas.  We arrived the night before and did the traditional drive-by of the neighborhood light shows and then came home to eat dinner and watch \"The Polar Express.\"  This is a tradition hardened over the years and cannot be broken.    In the morning we sorted gifts but did not open, waiting for my son and his family. After virtual Christmas mass from the TV, the guys watched football and the gals and the grandson home from RIT watched a comedy romance in the kitchen while we waited for the breakfast casseroles to heat up.  It was NOT that cold.  Just this family is always big in wraps.            Then when my son and his wife and the toddler arrived everything broke into celebratory chaos.          It was lovely with the 4 grandchildren and both of my children and their spouses.  I did not cook a single thing and my daughter prepared easy meals.  The gift opening is my least favorite part of the day.  I usually forget what I had wrapped and I usually worry that I have no idea what they will want!  (I of course have absolutely everything I could ever want on this day, so gifts for me are an aside.) We have a toddler now, and she stole the show.  She still does not know what the holiday is all about but she had fun tearing off wrapping paper.    It was exhausting and then the son and his wife and the toddler joined us here at my house for the garden in the lights display that is put up every year the week before New Year.  This is a big deal and a good money maker for the sculpture garden.  It takes them days to cover the two acres with lights.          The event had a perfect ending when we found a stuffed toy turtle on a stick in the gift shop and my granddaughter \"walked\" it all the way to the car!  She had just watched a cartoon movie about turtles the night before.And above toddler's hand prints on my deck door was the perfect ending."},

I have my son and DIL and their little girl coming down this evening.  We will be going to a \"Festival in the Lights' on the evening of New Year's Day.  It is a precious time and I have filled the freezer and refrigerator with pre-made foods.  I am nursing a very mild virus (not acting like a cold and not acting like the flu), but certainly makes me feel tired and want to drink hot toddies all day and then sleep.  I will be recharged by the time they arrive tonight.  We finished all the homemade chicken soup I made two days ago, so I am heating up store-bought.  Hubby has no longer moved into cooking with his dementia.I have no reason to feel sorry for myself.  I certainly am a privileged old soul.  I can afford crappy pre-made food that tastes better than what many consume elsewhere.  Above is a photo of us returning after the traditional light drive by.My DIL said her parents were coming, but then her father came down with COVID and they were not...and now I see photos of them at her house celebrating a belated Christmas in texts, so I really do not know how many guests I will have.Maybe they are coming?? Maybe not?I have learned to go with the flow.  Hubby and I will eat store-bought chicken pot pies tonight because the guests are arriving after 8:00PM.  Hubby is out with our electrician, all day today, fixing the dock electric line.  I am lying in bed and reading Obama's first title on his book list, \"The Heaven and Earth Grocery Store\".  It is good if not great. My Christmas was fine with all of the Grands getting something they wanted.  A hand strengthener for my rock climber grandson, a 3-D printer for the younger grandson ( which he proceeded to get chemicals in his eyes while setting it up!), and lots of clothes, jewelry, and cosmetics for my granddaughter.It is all a little busy for me.  I look forward to January.  I hope all fell into a casual place with your Christmas.  I actually attended a Catholic Mass...virtually.  I also liked the sermon which is a generous review."},

{"title": "Sometimes We Get More Than We Need", "date": "Wednesday, November 22, 2023", "text": "In the United States, we have the beginning of the 'holiday season' which means some families can panic even more about their budget for gifts, some retirees will spend outside their budget limit for the grandchildren in order to be loved, some people will eat too much and be outside their calorie budget for most of the winter, some folks will be under their climate limit and wishfully want to move south, and some will second guess everything about what they have done with this one precious life thus far. I suggest that all those thoughts above be written down on a piece of paper and burned.  Yes, some of us will be lonely and think others are having much more fun and getting more love.  Yes, some of us will regret the lifestyle that led to health issues this month.   Yes, some of us will be in sad mode for those we have lost and wish were by our side.This is the time to think about the wonderful times we had with those whom we loved and who are gone.  What a blessing to have had that bit of time with them!  This is the time to enjoy that mouthful of pumpkin pie with whipped cream and put all thoughts of calories away.  This is the time to be thankful that our grandchildren will remember our smile and our hugs and not that stupid expensive toy.  This is the time to remember the great days in our latitude with a better attitude.Yes, the weather is cold and gray and your house may be quiet.  But put on a favorite sweater or throw and grab your book, sketch pad, or puzzle, and put on that great music you like and enjoy the gray afternoon.  When you are calm, call someone and ask how they are doing.  When the weather allows take a short walk like I do with a camera in hand and see if I can \"frame\" my life a little differently.To all of my blog readers, thank you, thank you, for reminding me I am not alone in the world.Four days ago we had the best morning sun!"},
{"title": "Not an Imelda, This One", "date": "Thursday, November 16, 2023", "text": "The onset of dementia in someone you love is very much like a mosquito that you think has moved on.  It gets bothering to the point of you wanting to smash it against a wall somewhere and then it disappears for hours or perhaps days, and you hurry to forget it was ever there.  But it never dies or leaves for good and comes back demanding your attention once again.    The last few trips we have taken, either up to our son's house or further to an out-of-state place, hubby packs his own bags.  On each of those trips, he has come up with an extra pair of shoes that do not match!  He ends up having to wear the shoes that he has on for the week or weekend.Yesterday while cleaning the closet I found these above.  Two lefts and a right with no partners.  I have no idea where the partners have gone and I have asked various relatives to keep an eye out.  I have asked hubby to use a shoe bag, but he throws them in the back and I am afraid as he pulls out suitcases they have been left on the parking lots of various hotels.Nobody tells you about this in the books on dementia.I am not a patient person and I think what little patience I had I used when nurturing my children.  Children will change and learn or understand what you want.  Sadly forgetting does not change.As fall moves on he has less to do.  His volunteering in the food garden as well as work in our own vegetable garden keeps him busy in the good weather, but this time of year, things begin to be put to rest.  He is a very energetic person.  My mother-in-law had dementia which grew quite bad over the years.  But she was a lovely quiet lady who liked TV and looking out the window and eating food.  She never felt an urge to go somewhere, although we did take her on day trips with us.My husband needs tasks and chores. and sadly, he is not of the engineering mind or the artistic soul.   I do suggest simple things around the house and he says he will do them, but he forgets and then spends time trying to find something to do!I am thankful for his excellent sense of direction and his ability to still drive.  I am thankful for his desire to watch the same programs that I like on television and for his desire to read which I also love.  We still can canoe and boat. (Except for the motor on the boat...another story for another day.)He can still fry an egg omelet (lightly brown) for his breakfast, or fix a bowl of cereal.If I accept the two or three questioning interruptions in my life each day, he is able to use the cell phone and his laptop, and I pray they quit changing the interfaces of APPs!  We do spend time looking for his cell phone, but we have done that for years!Thanks for letting me vent (share) or write about this as I find my way throught he forest."},
{"title": "It is a Hallmark", "date": "Saturday, November 11, 2023", "text": "I visited the dentist a few days ago.  I had a chipped crown and was not looking forward to the replacement.  As I waited in the chair, I formulated a plan.  The crown replacement would come to over $1,000 much of which I would have to pay.  I was in no pain and I thought maybe he could just fill in the chipped area.  I suggested that and he agreed and I ended up getting a small filling on the side of the molar and ended up only paying $40.00!  But that is not what this post is about.During the appointment, I sat in the chair and looked up at the TV.  On the TV was a Christmas movie...on the Hallmark Channel, of course.  Have you ever wondered what the word Hallmark actually means? In the United States, it is affiliated with a greeting card company and while people use the traditional mail less and less these days, we still send holiday and regular greetings with a fancy card.  (At least some of us do.) We also have a cable television channel that is called Hallmark.  It is owned by Hallmark Media which is affiliated with Hallmark Cards.  The stories are usually about beautiful people (sometimes but rarely physically handicapped and I have not seen an elder romance, but they might have those). They meet up and engage frictionally throughout as well as meet unexpected delays and challenges in their relationship before they fall in love forever.  This network is affiliated with the American Christian Television System.  I do not watch it because I find the stories predictable, sappy, and unrealistic. Don't get me wrong, I do like a good love story but I have outgrown the \"Jane Austen\" format.  (I love Jane Austen.)In 2020 the network was criticised for not having people from the LBGTQ community.  Well, I guess that Christian leadership either got woke or saw a way to make more money because they now feature a small amount of those stories.  I have not watched them, so I cannot write whether they are similarly sappy and unrealistic.  The movie sets are gorgeous and the actors can carry their roles pretty well (challenging?).  Now that Christmas is around the corner they are in full swing with new Holiday love stories. What does \"Hallmark\" mean?  According to the Internet, it is \"A mark indicating quality or excellence. A mark used in Great Britain to stamp gold, silver, and platinum articles that meet established standards of purity. Any of various authorized marks stamped on gold, silver, and platinum articles to indicate where, when, or by whom they were made or assayed.\"    Enjoy all the holiday movies that you want.  Anything to brighten and inspire our days is recommended."},

I actually do very little paddling because I am married to a man who lets me sit as the queen and take photos.  There is no current, so sometimes he can paddle and drop a fishing line at the same time.  We did not fish this time, but we like to head to the back part of the river because huge catfish, large stingrays, and sometimes other interesting water mysteries are about.    The above is a wood duck box that someone has installed.  I hope that wood ducks take advantage in the spring!  We soon come to the end where the highway crosses.  It is a country paved road, so little traffic except in the mornings and evenings when people are off to work.  As we turn around we see a lovely dogwood(?) that has fallen but adjusted in its beauty to growing sideways!  As we move further along I see two wood dragons arguing at the water's edge and this is followed by more fall color and then a bit of a lucky shot as I capture our belted Kingfisher on a branch and later one of our Blue Herons.All in all, I would say it was a lovely morning."},

The leaves had not changed to that beautiful fall by then but were just showing their potential.  But the cooler early morning air was \"breathtaking.\"  A canoe is a quiet way to glide and move.We had not been out in months.  The summer humid air was too hot and humid and as an elder, it is hard to take.  But then, the fall weather arrived overnight and the next morning we got up early, packed a light lunch, and set out in eagerness to see nature.  We skirted the shoreline where the neighborhood is trying to develop an oyster reef at the point in the photo below.  The water was a mirror.A small group of deer were grazing on the ridge.  One of the neighbors has set up a deer blind and it is rare to see deer now and these stay at the far end of the point.  We did startle a blue heron as we turned the corner.The sun had barely crested the trees on the opposite side of the river, but when the rays hit the shoreline, they revealed that autumn was coming.We were the only boaters out and about.  All was pristine and quiet.  We love that we can do that by getting up earlier in the fall mornings. The serious fisherpeople had left hours earlier and were out at the Bay or the wider mouth of the river where the bigger fish are more available.  Our more prosperous neighbors had begun to tuck their toys back in for warmer days.I caught a very blurry photo of a red-bellied woodpecker.  This was cropped quite a bit as he was high in a far tree.  He is on the big trunk on the left side.  If you cannot see him, that is OK.The sun got brighter as we turned facing east. And then we turned into the darker finger that was at the end where our river comes to a small highway bridge and we watched the sun touch that side.There isa bit more before we turned home and I will make that Part II."},

I wake up at dawn thinking it is early, but the morning has already showered and dressed and is on its way as industrious humans head to places of work. I start the water pot for coffee.   I am inside watching a show on the incineration of a hospital far, far away.  I can barely watch it, but it is important.  According to the news, Americans in the United States are looking for someone to lead with a shouting and testosterone-filled voice rather than a gentle grandfather voice. They do not care what he says, but how he says it. They do not want a female to lead because she cannot talk in a loud voice without sounding shrill and females are not willing to kill relentlessly.  The corner of my eye catches the moment a bright white kite sails over the river. It is one of our resident seagulls looking for breakfast and drifting above our little finger of the river.  Our leaves have not changed, although my sugar maple (not native and planted by me for the \"fall orange crush\" which, by the way, is not anything like pumpkin spice) is just beginning to blush.  Autumn is a time for changing how we eat and bringing out the stews and hearty soups and I search the Internet for something new.  I make a ham and bean soup and take it up to my son and his wife with the toddler. Sliding down Mother GooseChecking out the photos.Sadly, I took a fall over a baby gate 12 days ago while visiting. (Yes I do seem to be falling more but in my defense there was a bar across the very last step of the stairs giving the person only 4 or 5 inches on the last step, which I missed and stepped onto the floor!).  I have been sitting more to avoid the pain of movement from the back side of my butt.  I am also using fire and ice. I could not have fallen safer or better because I landed on the fattest part of my body as I grabbed the post of the stairway and swung backward! The RA says if the pain does not reduce in 4 or 5 more days, I should get an X-ray for fractures, but he feels I am in not enough pain for it to be bone damage. Good thing I lift ankle weights where I have grown some muscle butt. No flat backside for this old lady.    Yes, I swear more these days, but they are just words and not actions, so get over it.We actually took a fall leaf peeping trip last weekend in spite of my injury and I will post on that.Now I will go and read some posts."},

She is a young noblewoman of Denmark, the daughter of Polonius, sister of Laertes, and potential wife of Prince Hamlet, who, due to Hamlet's actions, ends up in a state of madness that ultimately leads to her drowning.\"An appropriate name for the latest tropical storm that hit our area over the weekend.  Many of the low-lying shops and low-lying streets in our coastal towns were flooded by about a foot to two feet of water.  The population prepared, so no tragedies!  At least 48 hours of rain and winds up to 50 miles per hour.We had to head up to the city to Grand-sit this past weekend because my daughter and her husband were headed to the Eastern Shore beaches for a 50th birthday party for a friend.  So we were stuck inside with the teenagers (only two since one is away at college) and my daughter was at the Eastern shore facing walls of wind and rain.  I am sure they spent most of their celebratory time at the restaurants and bar!The youngest boy was easy to entertain and watch (12 years old).  We took some dog walks and saw a movie.  The older girl was a real reminder about teenagers and teenage love.  Her grades had been low and since she failed to update her parents on that situation she was grounded for the weekend except for being able to cheer at the football game.  (The love of her life is a football player).Photos were taken with my new Pixel phone since I did not take my camera due to the possible torrents of rain (which did not happen).One of the sweet young things below is my granddaughter cheering her high school team and her boyfriend on.Seems that when we got home she had to go back outside about 9:30 to meet her boyfriend who was dropping off a jacket!  After 15 minutes we had to go out and get her back in the house.  According to her mother who was on the Eastern Shore she is able to track her location and it seems she snuck out after we went to bed!  I was listening carefully for noises but fell asleep at midnight.  If I had not trusted her, I would have slept on the living room sofa and stopped her, but alas, I failed.  My daughter did not think us old grandparents were at fault, but thanks to technology you can track your kids.  They can even track their college kid and see where he is on the campus several states away!Alas, teenage love is so beautiful and so dangerous."},
{"title": "Time", "date": "Saturday, September 16, 2023", "text": "I wonder as I age about the (my) concept of time.  One definition I found on that vast and scary Internet is \"the indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole:\" The indefinite part is not totally accurate.  Time does move on and new things begin while old things end.  That is NOT indefinite.  The actual when and where may be indefinite.  My husband's dementia is with us every day.  It moves forward very slowly but even that is a frightening pace of movement.  My body and its aging fight me tooth and nail.  If I fail to exercise both brain and body for any length of time I become some stiff robot crossing the room.One gift from aging is perspective.  My first grandchild is in his first year of college and I wish I could dump on him tons of wisdom.  But one cannot force-feed a young adult who is already being bombarded with all kinds of demands, events, new situations, and challenges.  I think all of us elders wish we could pass along perspective.  Maybe in the future that can be done with technology, but actually, that does sound a bit scary.  Lessons learned from a lack of perspective can be valuable.I sent him a box of cookies and candy and Halloween stuff.  He texted back:Thanks so much for the package!  I just received it and I love the Halloween stuff.  I just realized that I have no decorations so this will be useful.  College so far has been very fun and I've been finding my people.  I've been addicted to the rock climbing gym here and I'm also really enjoying the food.  The workload had been a little annoying but I'm sure I'll get used to it....I would like to be him.  He has a better attitude toward college than I did.  He is an introvert but realizes that he must make an effort for friendships.  I did not realize that either.This cup in the photo above is something that he gave me many Christmases ago.  I have several from each of the grandchildren and their worth is beyond any amount of money I could ever get.  I was once told the story of the two on either side of the highway on the cup but sadly forgot.  That is something I may ask again.  Just looking at that cup really takes my breath away.  It is time travel.  It is its own time machine."},

I spent an afternoon in the small  tourist town of Lahaina touring with my husband.  We were just walking  around, visiting a local bar for lunch and a drink and walking around under the famous Banyan tree...the oldest in the U.S. We got a nice view of the tree from our lunch table as well.After lunch, we spent time talking  to a lovely local lady who was the greeter at a historic missionary property nearby (the Baldwin Home that had been preserved in the small tourist town).  We talked about a lot of stuff with her as she was social.  We learned how she had integrated herself (she might have been African American) into the Hawaiian culture when she married a Hawaiian and found that she was not expected to cook and that her husband did most of the cooking as did all the men in his family. Then we toured the small and well-preserved missionary house for some time. It was a four-bedroom single-level structure.  It was small and much like you would expect and I wish I had taken photos. The home had been built in 1834 and the brochure said it was the oldest house still standing.  \"The home was deeded to the Lahaina Restoration Foundation in 1967 and was restored to its 1850 design based on careful documentation and archaeological research.\" I have no idea if the dear lady we talked to is still there and survived the fire but I am sure the missionary house is gone. I had not visited there for more than a few decades and as an interested history buff, I was able to really absorb Lahaina and its local atmosphere around me. I had lived in the Pacific and understood the missionary impact, the whaling impact, etc.  The great whaling port went through ups and downs in an economy that affected so many small indigenous groups while the European white man overharvests and becomes rich. I remember a sweet and religious young lady that Ubered us down to Lahaina that afternoon and talked about the closeness of the Maui community.  She was not Polynesian but one of those women who did multiple jobs to make ends meet.  I do not know if she is still alive as well.Hawaii does have an actual friendly and neighborly culture from the Polynesians and other Asians who live there. It is not some fake personality they put on for the tourists.  Polynesians, Filipinos, and others live and work there and are very generous of heart and mind.     We toured a very small and local animal farm on a hillside on the island with my baby granddaughter.  I have no idea if it is still there because it was midway between Lahaina and where we stayed.  The farm, open by appointment only, was mostly rescue animals and run by a lady whose love of animals clouded the realistic view of caring for so many different animals.  \"Ditzy\" was the word my husband and son used for her, I was thinking she was a bit clouded by the love of animals.  She had recently broken her ankle and was hobbling around.    The day we toured the farm, she said that a small brush fire had started at the driveway down the hillside and the fire station had called her as a warning.  It was put out by the time she arrived. This whole tragedy brought back memories of my life on a small farm in Colorado. My father had ten acres of farmland which he really no longer farmed except for some alfalfa for our milk cow and vegetables which my mother canned.  There were about 4 aces that were left untouched and which grew only grasses and weeds.  Because this acreage was on a downward hill and faced the railroad tracks, my father would mow it low every year because he was afraid some spark from the train would start a brush fire.  Colorado, like the Lahaina side of Maui, is very dry and sometimes windy and nurtures wild fires."},
{"title": "MCD#1", "date": "Sunday, July 30, 2023", "text": "My husband was diagnosed with \"mild cognitive impairment\" over a year ago.  Why did we go in for a diagnosis?  His mother had dementia in her last years.  He was forgetting more than usual.  Adding one plus one meant we should at the very least get a referral for a neurologist.  This is my first post about this challenge because I did not want my blog to be singularly focused on this new challenge and I really did not know what to write.The neurologist ran a number of tests, completed an MRI, and had him do a sleep study at a sleep study center.  They then diagnosed \"mild cognitive impairment.\"  We saw the neurologist on a monthly or bi-monthly basis until we realized that he usually sent his assistant, with her piles of disorganized papers on her lap, to ask us a bunch of the same questions and ask him to perform the same physical tests and then send us home.  We eventually realized it was just \"data collection\" on their end and they were not being honest about that.  So he now has a new doctor who at least is honest in not needing to see us very often---even though he is Chinese American and almost impossible to understand!  Hubby takes a medicine that is supposed to slow or arrest plaque development...but it is NOT the new medicine. Medical professionals will not tell you that:    There is not much they can do.    Everyone proceeds toward brain impairment at a different pace.    Not everything is or leads to Alzheimer's.And if, like my husband, you are still pretty functional, they really want to focus on those who are not. Symptoms of dementia depend on the type a person has, but they typically include: memory problemsasking the same question repeatedly difficulty finding or understanding words feeling confused in an unfamiliar environment problems dealing with money and numbers anxiety and withdrawal difficulty planning and carrying out tasks mood changes personality and behavioral changes sleep disturbances changes in social awareness, such as making inappropriate jokes obsessive tendenciesHubby once or three times a week asks the same question.  He has very mild difficulty finding words, but since he once had a huge vocabulary and completed a Ph.D., this is noticeable.  I usually do the ticket at the restaurant as he has difficulty with numbers.  He is a pleasant soul and like his mother will probably never have unusual anxiety or withdrawal or dramatic mood changes.  He sleeps like a log for about 10 hours, something I wish I could do.  He is only obsessive about keeping busy and running errands and he can still drive.  He has trouble with facial recognition when we are watching TV shows.I dread the day when I will have to be the one to take him around to his projects and friends.  It will mean several hours out of every day.  But there are worse things to dread in life.I mentioned to his Doctor that I was going to be on the lookout for paranoia (wondering if he was going to think I was hiding things!) when the doctor turned to me and said I had to worry about me being paranoid.  I had to realize that he was not pretending to forget stuff so that he did not have to do it.  And the doctor was correct!  It is hardest for me to be calm about stuff!  I am working on it."},

My daughter and son-in-law went out while we ate with the others. Activities also included my son's anniversary dinner for the two of them. We babysat for the anniversary dinner so that they could go to some lovely overpriced place and have quiet time.  And, of course, a fire dance Luau.  That was some of the good stuff. I think my best breakfast was at Western Cafe in Honolulu which has a souffle pancake that melts in your mouth.    And there is (sadly) always room for the rest of the story.  Our flight home was not without the passionate and unpredictable Madame Pele giving a shove off.  Due to hubby's dementia, he had put down his backpack while we went through security, and as they allowed us through I did not see it in front of my suitcase.  So when I went to pass through the final gate I tripped and fell face down over the bag and brought down my carryon beside me.  He had just turned to make sure he had not forgotten anything, but it was too late for me.  I was more embarrassed than anything as the young TSA agents helped me to my feet.  We did go on ahead a bit stunned.  As an afterthought, I was thankful that I had worn the compression stockings for the long flight back as the bruising and swelling on my knee and shin were greatly reduced and I had no trouble walking! But Madame Pele was not finished with me yet! As we boarded the plane a young man was having trouble fitting his carry-on in the overhead bin and I showed him a place behind me that had more room. As he turned to see the place his bag fell out of the overhead compartment where it was precariously balanced and hit me on the forehead pushing my glasses down my nose!  It was a very mild hit considering! Needless to say, I only left my seat once to use the bathroom figuring I had pushed my luck as far as it would go."},
{"title": "Can You Accept What is Out of Your Control or Do You Just Bitch?", "date": "Monday, July 17, 2023", "text": "Yes, I have returned from my twelve-day jaunt to Oahu, Kauai, and Maui.  If you recalled this was something that our children insisted upon when we had to cancel our original 50-year anniversary trip plans during the COVID year.  My husband and I were graduate students at the University of Hawaii and met there and married there.As I have written, I was not excited or thrilled about his trip and it was mostly due to my pessimism toward projects when others have great expectations and for which there are lots of details.  There were so very many details in moving eleven people from island to island and making sure there were reservations when needed for restaurants, boats, or even helicopters.So how did it go (?) you may ask.  Reasonably well I may answer considering all the moving parts.  It was not outstanding because there were a number of hiccups throughout.The night before our arrival in Denver to change planes on the first leg of the journey, there were some serious thunderstorms across the mid-US which led to over 1,100 plane cancellations.  Some say this was the biggest mess of the travel season in the U.S.  No, our flights were not among the canceled, but it did mean the airport was filled to capacity with passengers trying to make new connections.  We were stuck on the lower floor of the airport where the shuttle trains broke down and could not run to bring people to their gates for at least 30-minute intervals.  Some were stuck in those shuttle trains shoulder to shoulder with the doors closed, while the rest of us stood outside waiting for the trains to move so a new train that was empty would appear and let us get on.There was much shouting and cheering and when we finally caught our 6.5-hour flight to Honolulu I was exhausted.  We checked into our hotel on Waikiki Beach, walked around a bit, ate a light dinner, and then collapsed in our hotel room.  When I got up the next morning, I was still tired and thinking it was jet lag, pushed myself to Mount Tantelus for a familiar view and a brief hike.  We did not rent a car and found ourselves Ubering everywhere.  Even with the limited cell service up Mount Tantalus, we were able to get an Uber back after a short hike through the forest.   We then visited our Alma Mater, the University of Hawaii.I was surprised that my old Hall did not look the same and the library had changed quite a bit from over 50 years ago.  My husband could not visit his office building without a code so we peeked through the door and talked to some graduate students outside.  The trees on the campus were 50 years older and provided much-beloved shade while the footprint of the campus seemed smaller somehow ;-).Hubby had gotten a blister on Oahu and we literally got lost at the gigantic Ala Moana Shopping Center looking for an athletic shoe store.  People must get lost there every day.  Terrible design, very few maps, and way too many stores for the rich people!Two days later I was still not feeling better and took a COVID test, and sure enough, I had caught COVID, probably in Denver.I was not coughing or sneezing, just tired and achy.  This is my second bout with this virus.  I started wearing a mask and did not cancel my flight to Kauai to meet up with my family.  I told them and they were disappointed both for me and also disappointed that I could not babysit the little one while the parents took a helicopter flight over the island.  My daughter took my place, but it was tough because the baby was cranky and jet-lagged.Most of my time was spent in the hotel room and out of the lovely pools.  I did finally get a negative result and could re-enter the family at the same time that the baby got sick.  Perhaps with COVID, but we will never know as it was a 48-hour fever and then she was back to normal.  We stayed in only the nicest places because it was a once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  Too bad I was hotel bound mostly.In the middle of the trip when we took our vows on the beach and went out to a fancy dinner we were all well.  The vows were beautiful but the dinner was served 45 minutes late!  Another hiccup.One of the evenings my crazy daughter thought we should visit the Food Truck park in Maui where dozens of vendors provide all kinds of food.  The food was delicious and varied, BUT as in ALL of the Hawaiian islands these days near tourist places, non-indigenous and very aggressive birds hang out to steal anything you may drop.  The picnic tables were covered in bird poop...COVERED!  I was the only one that seemed to be bothered.  Even at the fancy resort on Maui a nasty Myna attacked my infant granddaughter to eat some rice she had in her hand during our outdoor breakfast.  If you do not believe me about these invasives, go here!  Mynas do carry salmonella and bird flu.Well, I must wind this down and perhaps will post some of the best parts of the trip in the future.  Yes, there are always good parts and we must focus on that."},
{"title": "How Friendly Are You?", "date": "Friday, June 23, 2023", "text": "My husband is a very social person.  He makes friends wherever he goes.  He can be a bit overbearing and intense, but since he is pushing 80 most people forgive that energy, probably wishing they had that much energy themselves.  The first year we moved here people would say \"hi\" to him by name and I never knew who they were.  He volunteers in the community because he likes to get out of the house.  He has been diagnosed with Mild Cognitive Impairment which may move to dementia (or not).  We are pushing for the \"or not.\"  Anyway, he seems to know dozens of folks and they remember him.As I have mentioned in prior posts, I am a bit of an introvert.  While I volunteer in the community I am not out and about that much.  I can socialize and frequently am good at drawing people out about their interests and their backgrounds.  I do this because I am actually interested in the lives of people.  I am not just trying to be nice.  About 50% of the time they remember my name.I realize that I need to be more social.  If (when) I became widowed, I would sit at home and read, watch TV, exercise, garden, and maybe only use my voice to answer that rare phone call.  I might even become so desperate to talk to someone that I would answer a sales call about my car warranty.I also should point out that I think people do not like me all that much.  No, really!  I am not looking for sympathy, but I could list a number of incidents in my life that make me question my personality as seen by others and also made me regret opening my mouth.  I am a 'little' outspoken, but I try to curb that.  Honesty is not always the best policy and I have to keep re-learning that.Elders have trouble with their social circle as good friends move on or pass on as do family members, and soon you find your social circle very small since you no longer include work colleagues.  There are those elders, though, who remain well-loved and part of a stable social circle.  Maybe it has to do with church attendance, an energetic personality, and/or long-term hobbies that are social?I was thinking about what I like in a friendship or personality that makes me want to spend time in their company.  What traits do I have that would make someone want to be my friend?  What do you seek out in a friendship?  What do you like in a person?  Do you take the leadership role in scheduling lunch or an activity or are you the one that goes along?  How stable is your circle of friends?  How close are your friendships?Ok, enough questions.  Hope your weekend is friendly."},

I am trying to not fret because my daughter and my son have scheduled so much to do!  I am trying not to fret since it is a busy tourist season at airports.  I am trying not to fret as my elder mind and hubby's dementia make this a bit stressful.  This trip is a renewal of marriage vows, a celebration of my son-in-law's birthday, and a celebration of my son and his wife's anniversary.  The children, including the 14-month-old, are going!  It is a horrendously long flight.  We are leaving 4 days early, before the rest of the family, in order to adjust to the big time change.  So we are not able to fly with the two families as well as my daughter's mother-in-law and to assist with the little babe who is learning to walk!I realized last week, that while hubby and I have been to and through the Hawaiian Isles many times and once even took a trip with my son and his wife before their new baby, the other side (my daughter's family) has not ever been there.  This will be a special trip for them...much more so than us.I hate tourists and crowds and all and will try to be nice at the luau and the boat trip.  I hate artificially manufactured fun.  But I also realize this will be a good opportunity for candid photos on my part. (My dream of a vacation these days is a cabin on a lake and a small stack of books and UBEReats and watching wild animals from a distance.)I did schedule a photographer for the renewal ceremony, at some expense, because I am of the belief that photographs are priceless in this ever-changing and rapidly disappearing world.I am vain enough that I have upgraded my exercise routine since I will be spending some time in a swimsuit which I have not done for years.  I actually ran 3.6 miles on the elliptical yesterday!  No, I do not think someone in their late 70s can look sexy in a swimsuit, but they can look and be healthy.I also purchased the e-version of Louise Penny's 11th book in her Three Pines murder mystery series of 17 books.  Yes, I am hooked and will slowly buy the set!  Amazon Prime smashed a few of her books into a TV series months ago, and while the casting was great, they missed so much.  Louse Penny is a bit of a poet, historian, and psychologist, so all of that goes into her books and is not conveyed in a shortened version of the mysteries on the screen.  Anyway, if we ever take time to sit on a beach, I may be able to read my new download.I have pre-written a post on my other blog for later publishing and may have time to also write one more...I will see.In the meantime I will leave you with this Hawaiian proverb, \"In the end...we will take care of only what we love; We will love only what we understand; We will understand only what we are taught.'"},

( I have great respect for our law-enforcement folks, but like our medical professionals and our public education professionals, they are overworked and in some cases underpaid.)  I mentioned to her that was awful and since he was young it would just embolden him until he gets killed.Her response was, \"He did get killed weeks later.\"Anyway, she found that she could not get over the trauma as she had hoped  (no duh!).  She decided to use EMDR and said it really worked!  I will keep this in mind.  Our brain is a really amazing conglomeration of electricity!Well, hopefully, my next post will be more uplifting on my other blog about Fred and Ethel as they now have a least one little one!  I have to work on that, after I read some blogs."},

I am starting to move TWO decades past that, and the message is truly clear.  I am OLD. I have talked with my doctor, but since  I am not depressed or manic  or even measurable,  he is not concerned.  He has recommended I reduced my nerve/cough dose and while I am doing that, I find the cough sometimes comes back irregularly after over a  year of peace!  I just returned from a 3-day trip to Chicago with my daughter.  She  has a  strong friendship  with a distant cousin that she met on Ancestry  and over the years we have watched this distant cousin grow from being a bulemic  and very quiet teenager to getting her Doctorate in  nursing and then marrying a  nice young neuroscientist and recently having a precious new little girl!  Such a  journey and I like to think my daughter's support had some role in that.  Daughter and I also took in a spa morning at a fancy old-world place in Chicago, which is certainly not my usual routine.  The weather was perfect!This cousin we met is even more unusual as she explained that two of her brothers recently came out as  Gay.   I suspected this about one of the brothers years ago when  I met him.  Their mother is a nurse and one can only wonder if she expected this or not and how she deals with it.  Then prior to this her second daughter came out as lesbian!  Four children and only one of them is heterosexual!Heading off this Saturday to help open a contest for young children to plant  tomatoes in canvas bags and attempt to win prizes at the end of summer based on their growing  skills after they take the plant home.   I will be on my feet 10:30 AM until  3:00 PM and tired when  I  get home.  Sunday I  am off to another gardening event where we staff a booth with activities for children who come to a park to see tractor pulls, bands, craft stuff, etc.  I will be on my feet from 8:00 until 5:00 most likely and totally wiped for Monday.  But we are going out for dinner that night with some new friends and hopefully, that will not be stressful and I will not fall face down into my dinner plate!  I do see old people do that, but it is usually in a rest home."},

They didn't really want to get to  know me, and I finally gave up and with my head down began my work.  Where this dream came from, I  do  not  know.  Anyway, I am now awake around 5:00am and got up for my coffee.  The sky was just beginning to lighten and the lights across the waters (my neighbors all feel that security and decorative lighting is necessary) sparkled golden in the reflection on the river.  By the time I had made my coffee, I saw that the high fog had moved in.  By the time I was drinking my coffee, the fog had lowered across the river and all was milky white.The birds were just finishing their morning songs.  I like the way the charcoal silhouettes of the trees look like watercolor paintings in the fog.  While sipping my coffee the ghostly silhouette of a solitary buzzard glides every so quietly above my head sailing to the river.  It is beautiful in its grace.Today will be a quiet day.  Sunday was my granddaughter's first birthday and it was filled with all the business that entails when the party was given by parents who never thought they would be successful in having a child.  She is precious to us all, and hopefully, we will temper our spoiling with some common sense.  But love tends to throw common sense out the window. Some photos of that celebration of a miracle may appear in a future post as I left my camera up there!This prior Wednesday was a long day of plant work with others for our garden sale.  Then Thursday was plant work for other plants at home for the plant sale.  Friday was baking for the plant sale.  Saturdays were the plant sale and being on my feet from  6:30 in the morning to about 2:30 in the afternoon chatting up buyers!  We are mostly old people and while we raised  10K,  many were hobbling and toddling by mid-afternoon.Monday was a doctor's appointment for me.  I think it went well and he agrees that it may be possible for me to wean myself off the nerve medicine I had been taking for the cough.  Tuesday was a luncheon with people we had never met.  My sister was on a plane returning from a wine tour in France and she sat across from an elderly couple returning from a Safari and they got to chatting on the long flight back to the States. (Yes, this does sound  like the start  of  some murder movie.)  Anyway, she found that they were living in the same small town that we are!  She sent me their email and gave them ours.  The woman was also a retired librarian!  A package of coincidences that was sort of surprising.  Tuesday, months later, we finally met up for lunch.  They seem very nice and have suggested a dinner soon to meet a young friend of theirs who is trying to get into the marine biology field which is my husband's forte.  After lunch, we had to run some errands and came home exhausted.   Such a busy social week has left me exhausted, the introvert that I am.Wednesday, today, is a blank day for me although hubby has a dental appointment.  I have some leftover seedlings to get into the yard and some plants to dig up for my son as we are going back up to see him on Sunday after a Mother's Day meet-up with my daughter on Saturday.  Yes, a bit of a busy weekend. again.  You can see many of my seeds failed due to the torrential rains while we were gone.Well, enough about me.  How about you?"},

I am not procrastinating because the Blog is on my mind several times a day, sometimes even before I drift off to sleep.  I think of something and then wonder if it would be a good theme for the blog. Of course, by morning the only thing on my mind is COFFEE!    As I fill the electric kettle I gaze out the kitchen window and see my neighbor's house. When I took this photo the leaves were not on the trees except for the ever-green hollys.  I took it a month ago.  I think about our (mankind's) footprint on this earth when I see that mansion.  The house has another wing behind the big tree trunk on the left, a three-car garage below, a swimming pool, five bedrooms, a dock, and a water view.  There is only one 79-year-old lady living in it.  She does not own a boat.  She bought the house two years ago.  I am not saying she does not deserve to live in a beautiful home, but it seems such a waste of space.  She is a nice millionaire.When we built our house, we were thinking of only two bedrooms, but then we realized with three grandchildren that would be a mistake and added another as well as a small room in the basement that can be used as a bedroom.  All of these rooms have come in handy over the years.  The weather has finally been nice enough to get out in the canoe.      I am learning that getting into a canoe at the beginning of the day is easy, but getting out of the canoe after 4 or 5 hours is very difficult.  I am working on my deep knee bends, but it seems that my body has a mind of its own.We did go to Emerald Isle, North Carolina for a week with my son and daughter-in-law, and grandchild.  A wonderful, if exhausting, trip.  Granddaughter is that age where everything is interesting and while she cannot yet walk, she crawls like a speed demon.    While it was still spring and the weather cool and cloudy and sometimes rainy, we had the whole beach to ourselves all of the time.  That is peaceful when you have a dog and a crawling babe.We rented a house and did most of our own cooking to avoid having to deal with an infant in a restaurant.  But we did give the \"kids\" a few afternoons and nights out: a massage, a movie, a dinner, and a morning of canoeing.Just before all this hubby had eye surgery.  It seems that if you are an elder you can get an eye lift through insurance if you are having trouble seeing and reading.  He passed that test and got the eyebrow lift.  It does not make him look younger, but recovery was very fast and the minimal scar is hidden in his Scottish eyebrows.  He also finds reading at night much easier.  On the medical side, my daughter is trying to talk me into a face laser resurfacing treatment which would not be covered by insurance.  She has had it done and loves it.  Sigh!Now back to the real world.  I will go read your blogs over the coming days and leave comments."},

I even wrote a blog about that, printed it out on paper, and then deleted the blog. The move itself helped us filter our junk.  There are always boxes of stuff that you save and no longer use.  Also boxes of duplicates or backups of stuff you have never needed.  Then when you empty the drawers and empty the closet shelves you realize that life can get cluttered with so much more \"stuff\" than any human ever needs.People who are always on the move, perhaps news photographers or people who work from ships such as international doctors, have just basic essentials and may store just a bit of memory \"stuff\" in a closet or rental unit somewhere. Their life activity and memories are their \"junk\".This line of thinking all started with my search for my wedding dress (really a muumuu) and I have not been able to find it...at all.  Did I get rid of that thinking I would never be able to get into it?  Did I actually give it away??  I have no clue because I can still see it in the box with the tissue.  I did find the shoe box below with the label:  SEEDS GLASS JUNKWhen I took off the lid I saw this below:In the jar at the very top of the box is a collection of sea glass.  That brown bone-like structure in the upper middle is a piece of really interesting wood that has been worn down.  It looks like a fish skeleton, doesn't it?  Bits of seeds and feathers and all.  And, I will not throw out this box.  I collect stuff like this all the time!  I will leave it to my kids to dump into the bin after I leave this planet.

I have emails from a florist in Kauai, a photographer in Kauai, and my daughter in the city to the north of us, and they all require attention. My husband and I had planned to go  to  Hawaii where we met AND married to celebrate our  50th anniversary two years ago.  But COVID spread its contagious and frightening germs and we were forced to cancel. Hubby and I had met in Honolulu so many years ago with both  of us in graduate school at the University.  We married there just three months after meeting and headed out to  the island of Palau, Micronesia where  water and electricity were precious and sometimes scarce for our tiny two-bedroom apartment.  With no supermarkets and incoming mail only three days weekly, we faced challenges.  It was a good match if the first year of marriage can survive life on a remote Pacific island. (Oh my, who are those naive and young people?)Our children were not happy that we had to cancel this remembrance.  Of course, we had just planned a visit to some old haunts, and visit some friends on Oahu and that would be it.  Instead, the kids took over and wanted to turn this into a mini-event before we die.  (I mean that very literally)  We will be on Oahu for 3 days visiting old friends and then onto Kauai which is a lovely island to visit.  Our children and their children and one mother-in-law will be joining us.  This simple trip has now morphed into flowers, a photographer, a small renewal of vows, and who knows what else.  I am trying to assist in the coordination of all with my daughter.  This does not happen on the island where we married or even the day or month that we married, but alas, we are plunging ahead.  We are then going on to Maui because that is where my daughter's family wants to spend time.  We will be there for a week, and I am letting them all plan that.  This takes place the first week of  July when everyone's schedules blend.My upcoming schedule also includes helping my husband plan a PowerPoint presentation at the local library this Saturday on shoreline preservation!  His mild dementia means I have some editing to do.  Sunday, we get together with my daughter's family to visit the aquarium in Baltimore and eat a family lunch.  A Christmas gift we are just getting around to opening.  Then we drive down to spend the night in Annapolis for an overnight as my husband has surgery (a therapeutic eyelift) on the following Monday!  Are you keeping up?In the following two weeks as hubby is resting, I may get caught up.  My first job is to help plan a week's vacation with my son, his wife, and their baby at a rental home on Emerald Isle in North Carolina during the last week of April, which is not far away on the calendar.  I have a feeling we will be doing lots of babysitting.I  realize that I am blessed to be able to afford these trips (barely)  and am blessed to have a family so close that wants to be with us.  But  I am tired and running out of steam.  Send me energy."},
{"title": "Contrast", "date": "Saturday, February 18, 2023", "text": "As we age, the contrast of events in our current life or memories from our past life seem greater or maybe lesser.  What do you think? For instance, I am so emotionally high with my grandchildren.  While I love my children, I do not remember my heart bursting with joy every time I saw them.  Perhaps that was, because I saw my children every day and the reality is you see them clean and dirty, calm and emotional, happy and angry, energetic and tired?  They see you the same and are not always willing to share or even want to spend time with you.My grandchildren, in my case, are seen maybe every other month, and the older ones are  on their best behavior (lucky me).  The baby is most times, but even when crying she is precious and vulnerable.  She also changes dramatically from week to week and she now crawls around the room.As for long-ago memories, I remember bits and pieces while my husband, who has been diagnosed with \"mild cognitive impairment\", remembers every detail of his youth...or it seems that way.Also, my personality wants to slow down, and maybe think on past memories, while my husband wants passionately to make new ones while talking endlessly about past events.We had a visit from a friend this past week who we have known for many years.  She came with her second husband who has been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and for whom a two-hour car trip  (which this was) is a big challenge.  He was quiet and pleasant, which is the same as his former peonality.  He is slow and unstable.  She is full of plans, building her next new house and running her small farm with a new chicken house being built, and training her dogs for dog shows, which is the same as her former personality.  Yet, they live happily on these two planes of existence and seem to be able to meet in the middle.I do think age has given me a clearer perspective on time and the passage o time and my life in that spectrum.  Perhaps.  (These sunsets were taken last night as a big acold front moved in.  That high cloud makes for great light bounce.)"},

Two people from our Master Gardeners group of 40 or so also passed. Hubby was sick for a week with a cold or flu.  Not badly sick, just annoying fatigue.  Son and daughter-in-law visited with the sweet baby who was NOT sick for a change, but their dog did vomit on my carpet!  And they have my carpet cleaner up at their house!  I seem to be having brief dizziness when I move too quickly and I do monitor my blood pressure which does not seem unusually high.  Yes, this means I probably should call the Doc.  This is all in January which is not even past.Today we are driving up to my daughter's house to exchange Christmas gifts.  It was either this Monday in late January or we wait until the end of March!  Their calendars are terribly full with all three children in activities and hubby involved in golf.  This will all come to an abrupt end in a few years and I hope my daughter is ready for the sudden end to running around!I try very hard to focus away from the chaos that this world is going to be in for the next ten years, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.  I have been reading Yeats, Mary Oliver, and Elizabeth Strout.  I did not like Olive Kitteridge by Strout as the people in the book are the kind of people that I avoid and possibly why I am an introvert.  I did find Lucy by the Sea and Oh, William! more redeeming.I have included a few winter sunsets taken from my back deck.  I know, QUITCHER BITCHEN!May your 2023 be filled with honest love, restorative peace, and forgivable errors."},

I at least fold them on the chair that I have in the closet.  I think to myself, what if for some reason, a car accident or heart attack, I do not make it home and my daughter has to come down here to get my clothes and then sees how messy I live? (Sort of like that mom telling you to always wear clean underwear in the event you are in a car accident?)I hate plastic but I still compulsively buy ziplock bags.  Most of my stuff is stored in glass-lidded containers, so why do I keep ziplock bags?  Some day I will make a list of when I use them and think of alternatives.I put stuff away before the housecleaner comes so that all the surfaces are neat and tidy...it does make it easier for her to clean or dust.I save all those stupid holiday catalogs thinking I will need them and stack them neatly on the couch near where I sit.  That stack stays unmoved for weeks, and I have never ordered from any of them!Each night I tell myself that I will be more proactive in getting things done the next day and it happens... about one out of every 8 days.

I always pictured (hoped) that I would become the stylish, skinny, and upper-middle-class grandma; the one that was sharp as a tack and that everyone loved to talk to for a brief time.Ha!  I wish I was skinny, certainly no longer upper middle class with this inflation, and while some days, I am sharp as a tack, other days I wander around in a fog trying to remember what I was planning on finishing before starting dinner.  Stylish is something I attempt about two or three times a year.  Most days I wander around in old sweatsuits, or jeans and a sweatshirt.Yesterday we had to drive up to the city to visit our financial advisor at my husband's insistence even though I wanted to wait until after the holidays.  Hubby's dementia meant he could follow very little of what happened at the hour-long meeting, but hubby was right in that we had not met face-to-face in a few years and it did help personalize our relationship with our advisor.  This advisor is the son of our original advisor and has now taken over our account.  His father has retired and is now taking care of his wife through a long-term illness, sadly.  Hubby also was right in that we got to meet up for a quick lunch with our son and his wife.  Sadly we did not see the baby who was in daycare.Since this filled the whole day, I moved my list of holiday and other things to do, to today.  Unbeknownst to me, hubby had volunteered to give a presentation in February as part of our Master Gardeners projects for the public.  They are given at the library.  I got cc'd in an email from the coordinator since hubby had not been responding to her emails and that is how I learned about the commitment.  I explained to him that I could not help with this before the holidays as I just had too much on my list.  That was never going to happen as he insisted he had to start the presentation and download the photos from his phone today.  Well, there went the better part of the day!  I started to work on downloading photos from his phone (a different model and make than mine) and then have him attach them in an email to himself since my USB connection did not work with his phone.  I selected 8 or 10 photos and then asked him to go through that list and delete down to four in the attachment since the email provider would not transfer more than that.  An hour later, I thought he was deleting but he had spiraled down to somewhere else and was back selecting photos, or something as he would not show me! I am afraid I lost my patience as I had so wanted this day to get myself a little better organized.  I just now left him with his computer and then heard him calling someone on the phone asking how to get emails off of his phone onto his computer.  It may be my busy son who is working from home, I do not know.  But he will patiently take him through screen after screen,... perhaps.  Or he will tell him to call tonight.Part of this anger is resentment, I know.  Resentment that he does not participate in any of the holiday preparation.  He says he \"hates\" shopping and therefore, never buys any gifts for anyone and has never done so even before his dementia.   He says he is not able to wrap gifts, either.  He is not a cook, but with dementia, I do not think he should be attempting any of the holiday cooking anyway.  Each year I have asked him to help with the holiday greetings that we mail, although I pull together the card design, and the list of addresses, and set him up at the table.  I have done this for years and he loves writing a message to friends and family.  Fingers crossed this year.One would think I would be adjusting to this change by now!!  And those of you who are wondering why I am taking time to blog when I have so much to do...who knows...guess it is my therapy for the day.Well, done venting, thank you for listening and I know...I know...the font is off again!!"},
{"title": "Are the Holidays a Wind-up?", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2022", "text": "I sit this morning in the early dark drinking my strong black coffee with just enough sweetened cream to take the edge off.  I slept over seven hours which is my regular routine. While my sleep is filled with dreams these days, I do feel rested.  Hubby is still deep in slumber and will sleep closer to ten hours.  He is an energizer bunny with projects during the day and that activity coupled with his slight dementia means he will sleep through a long night.The home across the river and a few houses up from us already has its holiday lights along the dock.  The weather has been cold for days with just enough of a breeze to make it feel much colder.  We have been putting off stringing the outside holiday lights hoping the weather will moderate somewhat.  While we have no snow and do not face the drama and hard work the folks north of us have endured, we are older and feeling it in our bones more each year.Today I have to plan which pies I will bring to my daughter's house for Thanksgiving.  My three grandchildren and my son-in-law do not like fruit pies and so I am left to make some cloying sweet pies such as an Oreo cookie monster.  I will probably go ahead and make a key lime pie because I have a dozen kafir limes from my tree that need to be used while they are somewhat fresh.  I will also bring a side dish of sausage stuffing which they claim to like and which I make each year with Italian sausage and lots of herbs.  My daughter is ordering the rest from the local grocery.  We seem to be doing it lighter each year.We cannot arrive the night before since my daughter has close friends that are using their guest room as a stopping place on their way north to visit their own family for the holidays.  So, we will arrive mid-morning and quickly say hello and goodbye to the guests which we know, eat our Thanksgiving dinner with the family, and then head back home mid-afternoon because my daughter and her family are then heading north for Thanksgiving with the in-laws the rest of the weekend.  My daughter's father-in-law has a form of MS which now requires he be placed in a care facility.  It is a sad time for all.  My son and his wife are spending Thanksgiving out of state with his wife's family this year, so our long weekend will be quieter.Ooops, my son just texted and said they may not be heading through the nasty snow to Erie after all.  Their little baby is fighting a long-term cold.  I invited them to join us at my daughter's and then come down here for the weekend where I can wait on them.  Seems everything is up in the air.  I am an old lady and will certainly handle it all with aplomb (that is still a word, right?) as I am not going without electricity like those in Ukraine, and I am not facing grief like those who lost a child, significant other, or brother or sister in Colorado in the recent \"mass shooting\", and I am not spending the day in a holding shelter like so many that are homeless or those around the world who are refugees waiting for a reprieve.  I am winding up my one precious and privileged life slowly, ever so slowly.I look for the light because the perception of where we are and who we are and where we are going is dependent upon finding light each day."},
{"title": "And...the Rest of the Story", "date": "Wednesday, November 16, 2022", "text": "My prior post on our trip to Pittsburgh provided a quick overview of a city that was once part of \"America's Rust Belt\".  Pittsburgh was referred to as the steel city because Andrew Carnegie developed a process to make steel both durably and inexpensively.  There were many blue-collar jobs available at the turn of the 20th Century.  This is also why it was called the city of bridges which are so loved; produced through locally made steel.  The steel industry is also why their professional football team is called the Steelers.  Along with this industrial success, there came tremendous water and air pollution.  Today the air is clear to the eye, but unseen microparticulate still causes days when breathing the air is unhealthy and they struggle to keep their air healthy.The city has moved its economy to self-driving car manufacturing, robotics, and medical advances.While we were there we stayed in the downtown area next to the convention center.  Our hotel was on a busy street next door to a Charter school for elementary children.  We saw them walking from one building to another on a mid-day break and all were minority children.  Full of energy.  If you want to know what a Charter School is go here.We took an Uber to the botanical gardens on the second day and upon our return mid-afternoon, the Uber driver could not drive down the block to our hotel.  We waited a few minutes and then he made a U-Turn and went around a block to drop us off just South of our hotel.  It was only a block away, so we had no problem.As I walked to the hotel, I saw the following:At first, I thought someone famous must be staying at our hotel which is across the street from this news photographer.  But nope.  When I asked, it seems there had been a couple of shots fired into one of the buildings across the street.  Perhaps the building between the school and our hotel?  Needless to say the local pedestrians did not seem at all concern as they wheeled their toddler into the restaurant and we asked the policeman if we could cross the red tape into our hotel...which he let us do.  City life in America is indeed strange."},
{"title": "Like a Bad (But Shiny) Penny", "date": "Saturday, November 05, 2022", "text": "I returned over a week ago from our Pennsylvania/Michigan car trip.  The primary reason for the trip was to help my husband's stepsister celebrate her 94th birthday.  They have not met face-to-face in over a decade.  Blended families can be that way and since his father remarried (to my husband's mother) they spent little time growing up together.  As often happens with  old people, reconnection (this time hours by phone) meant they wanted to see each other as the years are getting more valuable. Since it was fall, I was looking forward to such a car trip and was rewarded with lovely hardwood trees and bright dry grasses and golden farm fields with traditional barns, and nice weather except for one day of rain.  We first visited Pittsburgh for the reason that it made a nice stop on the way north.  We were there for three days.  The walk from our hotel downtown made me think that Pittsburgh was nothing but mediocre restaurants and kitschy stalls selling Steelers merchandise.  The small crowds were a bit loud and later in the day a bit drunk.  The service at the mid-cost restaurants was very good, though.  In the beginning, I was not impressed.I was glad that I had booked a tour for each of the two full days we were there.  Driving around on our own would have meant we missed so much to say nothing of the difficulty in finding parking in a city.  The tour helped me see how rich Pittsburgh was in history and heroes.  Mr. RogersMr. Rogers of children's TV fame was a native and had his own statue on the river in downtown.  This was funded by Bunny Mellon of the rich Mellon family.  Bunny was a friend of his.  We toured the city itself to learn that both sports stadiums were horseshoe shaped to allow fans to see the river as well as the game. I learned about the famous \"immaculate reception\" of player, Franco Harris, which helped the Pittsburgh Steelers win their first playoff game in franchise history in 1972. Historian, David McCullough, was also a native with a bridge dedicated in his honor.  The city is really beautiful despite the few homeless tents along the river walk.  Two rivers come together which helped spur the city's growth in its early history when water was the primary form of transportation for moving and processing steel.  Taken from the hilltop at the end of a cable car ride.And then we traveled on to visit the famous Falling Waters house of Frank Lloyd Wright fame just outside the city.  I was not able to get reservations inside, but the outside was inspiring.  There is another architectural wonder, Kentuck  Nob, but that has to wait for another trip.This is a very short version of the trip but perhaps wets your taste to travel to a smaller city that you do not know enough about and that has a reputation that is rougher than it deserves."},
{"title": "Aging and Patience (but not Birds)", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2022", "text": "Have I ever been a patient person? Well, of course, I must have been at one time because I raised two children.  You cannot survive that without some patience.  Raising children requires slowing your pace to their interests and play and work as much as you can.  Of course, with small children, you have to be able to shift gears smoothly and change the pace dramatically.  When we first moved to this area and we wanted to meet the community ( we do not go to church) I signed up for a local Audubon class.  It met at the local community college about 20 minutes from the house in the evenings.  When my husband and I arrived the large classroom was empty except for one gray little man, the teacher.  We waited 5 or 10 minutes and then a younger, slightly attractive woman with an air of determination whisked in and sat next to us.  With only three students the man began to discuss local birds of the area and provided some information on being able to recognize similar but different species.  It was an interesting, if not exciting, class. We met again the next week and the woman did not show.  Was she impatient at the pace of the class?  Was she disappointed that more people of the opposite sex closer to her age were not in attendance?  She clearly did not have the perseverance needed.I continued to attend the 6 or so classes and am not really sure if it was due to my patience in expecting to learn something or perhaps my sensitivity to the poor man trying hard to create some community among local bird people.  The thought of him showing up to an empty classroom was harsh.But back to patience.  In the event above, perhaps it was perseverance which is another word for patience.  I have been married for OVER 50 years.  Is that due to endurance, grit, self-control, and leniency,  which are all synonyms for patience? Or is it due to imperturbability, passiveness, or moxie...also listed as synonyms for patience?Love, caring, and responsibility are not listed there.I have just spent two hours making reservations at two hotels and also making reservations for two separate tours as we head up to Pittsburgh and then on to Detroit.  It is EXTREMELY rare these days to talk to anyone when doing this.  It is all done by computers or \"bots.\"  For this, I have NO patience.After hours passed, I got a follow-up text from someone who texted \"This is AYS with a question.\"  I was tired and mad and apologetically admit that I typed back \"Who in the hell is AYS?\"  This was followed by me texting \"Ooops!\"  The message that came back was \"I'm sorry.  I'm a bot and I'm still learning.  Ask your questions and then navigate by selecting the buttons presented.\"A bot that uses contractions and can sense when you are mad via text.  I am not ready for this new world.  Thinking about traveling less.(And, yes, I know the font went wacky...I don't care...html is just outer space test.)"},

While my husband and I had finished two vaccinations and one booster and were waiting to schedule the new bivalent booster, we caught COVID as I wrote in the prior posts.  We reviewed our activities and the most recent was an outdoor festival where we met with people interested in gardening.  Outdoors and mostly 4 to 6 feet away (but no masks) and we talked to close to 80 or more adults and children.  This virus is very, very, very contagious and it gave me new insight into those who have health issues and must avoid the virus at all costs!I was sick for about 5 days and felt weak for a few more.  Sick being a fever and fatigued.  No coughing, no chest congestion, no loss of smell or taste, but certainly shortness of breath.  I finally tested negative on the 7th day. Hubby was very similar, but his similar symptoms lasted 14 days before testing negative.  Yes, we are very lucky that the vaccines work!Now we must wait for two to three months before we can get the new bivalent booster as our immune system is triggered (I guess).We have planned a trip up north to Michigan to visit my husband's half-sister who will be celebrating her 94th birthday.  He has not seen her in decades although they talk on the phone.  We will wear masks if the family gathers in significant numbers or there is concern about our germs.  Another road trip and at least this time we should not get COVID as I hope our immune system has rallied us.  This does not mean we cannot be carriers, I will have to research.The good thing about it all is that while I was forced to stay home I was able to complete a bunch of to-do things on that list that some of us keep and then ignore, such as cleaning out that nasty corner of my closet.    I also finished reading a number of books:  \"The Personal Librarian\"(historical fiction about the personal librarian to J.P. Morgan), \"Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe\", and almost finished \"The Book of Joy:  Lasting Happiness in a Changing World.\"  It is about the friendship between Archbishop Desmon Tutu and the Dalai Lama.  As you can see I am bored easily and do have eclectic tastes.I wish you all well and will now try to catch up on blogs.  I also hope to document those I cannot comment on. but think I have figured that out."},

But I have an excuse or two or three.      Yes, we did leave to go see the elk and I will post a few of those photos on my outdoor blog \"Room Without Walls\" but first I want to explain why there are so few photos.We left on a Tuesday two weeks ago.  The trip up was uneventful in that the traffic got less heavy as we headed for state roads far from cities.  There was one enormous truckers intersection that was a nest of signs and turns, but we managed to navigate and head on further north to the elk preserve.We checked into a traditional hotel that was about 20 minutes outside the preserve.  This area wild area produced some of the best ships masts from the white pine forests in the logging area of the preserve back in the 1800s.  Pennsylvania has a 2.2 million acre forest system.  Twenty state forests are located here and comprise 13 percent of the total forest land.  No wonder it was called Pennsylvania.  There are areas where you can do any number of outdoor activities.We checked into a traditional hotel that was about 20 minutes outside the preserve.  Various state parks intersected and crossed and wound up and down the sides of hills making the preserved area confusing to navigate and signs were sparse and hard to see but we made it up to the elk visitor center as did about 80 other old-timers like us.  We could hear the elk calling and it was dramatic and heart-stopping as dusk crept up, but the crowds got too large and we decided to find another lookout.  We left too early as we heard that several large bull elk had finally emerged into the open area to test their testosterone.We later did see some of the smaller elk, but tired from the drive headed back to our hotel to venture out with fresher energy the next day.  That evening I had acid reflux or some indigestion (thinking it was from a fresh lemon gin and tonic I had the night before) and tried to sleep.  I woke up unrested but we headed out to explore and my acid reflux weakened.  By mid-afternoon, I felt weaker and somewhat feverish and not even in the mood for a rather over-heavy country dinner that we got at a local woodland restaurant.  I coughed all that night.In the morning I realized I was sick and took a COVID test from the kit I had packed in my suitcase a long time ago.  Yes, I was positive!  We threw our clothes into the suitcase and checked out a day early telling them that I was COVID positive.  Hubby was feeling fine and had no problem heading home.Sadly his old Chevy had been acting up and the dash lights and gages went blank when we were about 200 miles from home.  We had filled up on gasoline the night before, so knew we could make it the whole way.It never rains but pours when things go wrong.  We are weathered warriors and kept our minds focused.By the time we made it home, I collapsed in the upstairs bedroom with medicines and water and was in a fog for the next five days.  On the sixth day, I got my first negative test and went for a walk along the neighborhood on a beautiful fall day, and while feeling weak, it was the first day I did not feel shortness of breath.  I never had chest congestion, so was surprised when I would get out of breath going upstairs or across the room!  I picked some soft wild persimmons that grew along the drive and washed them and ate one small one.  Hubby was starting his illness by this time.In a few hours, I found that my pants felt unbearably tight even though I was wearing elastic pants.  By mid-afternoon, I was in extreme abdominal pain.  It felt as if my diaphragm was being pushed into my chest and stretching unbearably tight.  I had never felt this before.  In an hour I got up and emptied the contents of my stomach (only some pinkish liquid and acid) and projectile vomited for a bit.  What on earth??  Then the next morning, I felt fine and realized that it was the wild persimmon that had caused that incident because that was really the only thing I had eaten.!  I have no idea why as I had eaten them before!  Hubby was ready to take me to the hospital, but I fought it because we both had COVID!Then he got sick and was bedridden for days, and is still testing positive but hs more energy.  Of course, it did not help that the remains of Ian came through with 40 MPH wind and rain and we lost electricity several times last night.  Our new generator kicks in right away, even though it does not run the whole house.  Waiting for the 6ht or 7th shoe to drop."},

Annoying, but glad it is not an unsolvable glitch on my log-in to Blogger.We are off this morning to go shoot elk in Pennsylvania.  NOT shoot with a gun, but shoot with a camera.  Our old age is making us want to get out and fill the bucket list more.  It is autumn and the elk are bugling.  If you have not heard that call of the male elk, you have missed an interesting natural phenomenon.  Our elk in this country have been wiped out in many areas and have had to be reintroduced.  There are now at least two large managed herds in the Eastern part of the U.S. and a larger herd in the Rocky Mountains and smaller herds elsewhere across the U.S.  There is a hunting season for them as well.The males are entering their mating season and bugle to attract females and warn males.  Some do it so much that they lose their voices.   They can best be seen at dawn and dusk and I am stealing myself for crowds...hoping to find spaces away from all of those (like me) who are nature lovers.It will be a five-hour drive and we will take several overnights in a local hotel.  We have outgrown the tent camping experience and the cabins are full.  The cheaper hotels are pretty rustic.  There will be no cell service in many parts of the large park and restaurants are only in certain areas.  Thus it will be a bit of a challenge for old folks who are used to things going their way.We will head back home on Friday.  And in the following days I will have fun  culling and editing my photos and will share any if they are intersting.  Lokoing forward to the fall color as well as the great wild outdoors."},
{"title": "Riding the Current", "date": "Friday, September 09, 2022", "text": "I blinked and suddenly it was fall outside.  Cooler weather means I will have the energy to vacuum and wash my little car.  (It has been months--actually maybe the entire year!).  My husband's nephew left last weekend.  He paid to have his brother fly up from Florida to drive the big trailer back down with him.  The broken collarbone does seem to be healing.  He has had two visits with the local osteopath up here and the day he plans on getting home he has a visit with his local GP who will refer him to the bone doc down there.While it was challenging having someone living in the house (someone we really did NOT know well) for over a month and having to lend our bathroom as it had a walk-in shower, it was also a good exercise in growth for all of us.  I actually now miss him.  I would see him up every morning before me and I get up early!  It was a test having someone chatter away while I had my first and second cup of coffee.  He, like my husband, is a talker!!  He would walk two miles every morning and then watch his favorite TV shows which were all car racing or car repair things.  Something that bores my husband and me.  Sometimes he would watch downstairs while we watched a British mystery upstairs.He never complained about the fact that he could not do much to help but it did frustrate him.  He is one of those people who likes to help others.  He was a former engineer as a defense contractor and knew his electronics.  It was very useful having him here while the propane company installed our backup generator (which means we will never have another storm that takes out our electricity 😉).  He was a polite oversight to the various workers that drifted in and out for the four days, which was useful as the supervisory electrician they sent was a grumpy sort.We had to leave him alone for a week while we took our oldest grandson down to Andros to get his dive certification.  That was also a challenge as I worried about him being alone in our house and having an accident.  We took him food shopping before we left and gave him our neighbor's phone number just in case.  He downloaded the UBER app as well.  Our Bahamas trip was another challenge, as we stayed at a rustic lodge at the end of nowhere.  It was also very hot, but the people were very very nice and the food was mostly good.  Grandson passed with flying colors and got his certification.  I will treasure that time with him before he leaves for college next year as most precious.I have not written too much about my husband's memory challenges during this time, and maybe when I have finished riding the current toward autumn I will reflect on that.  If you are on the cusp of spring, be sure to smell the flowers, and if like me, you are on the cusp of fall, avoid sneezing."},
{"title": "Only Up From Here", "date": "Tuesday, August 16, 2022", "text": "I had to come back home late last week because I was having trouble getting into our TSA (Transportation Security Administration) database to get our KTN (Known Travel Number) so that we can go through the \"fast\" line at the airport next week.  After an hour's drive up to the DMV Office where the Security people are located, we discussed why my husband and I were not in the database and the lady there was able to circumvent the tragic telephone tree where you never reach anyone and talk to a real person!  It appears that there is a space between the letters of our last name (which is European) and I did not enter the space between the letters.  It does appear that way on our passport, but I never noticed!  Load off of my mind on that.Hubby in his frustration with his dementia wants so badly to go diving with his grandson who is 17 this year as one of his bucket list items.  So I am accompanying them to the Caribbean island for a week of lessons, etc.  I will not be diving.  I have not done SCUBA for years and find that just snorkeling is enough for me.Our houseguest, my hubby's nephew, will remain here alone in the house and I am hoping he is careful on the stairs!!  I gave him our neighbor's cell phone if he needs anything because he has been told not to drive.  He will remain with us another week after we get back, and then his brother is flying up to drive him back home, if the Doctor gives his approval.  Below is a photo taken before the fall on the boat!I will be so glad when the world slows down in September and the cool fall weather is back and I actually have time to read blogs.  Good days ahead!"},
{"title": "Ten Minute Breather", "date": "Monday, August 08, 2022", "text": "Up early this morning and after a quick tea, changed the baby and then played with her for an hour hoping she would go back  to sleep but no luck.  She is a very sweet baby (now at 3 months) and even sweet when she is cranky.  We are wearing N95 masks whenever we are close to  her just to protect her from any asymptomatic COVID.   Wearing these masks  most of the time in the house  and all of the time we are around her, really gives me perspective on how difficult it  is to wear them for  long periods of time!  I now have empathy for those who protested, but  not enough to wave their ignorance.Wearing this  mask and hauling laundry up and down narrow stairs  from the top  floor to the basement also makes me  realize I need to find some other exercises to give me more stability.  It does  not  help  when the mask pushes my trifocals out  of alignment either or the basket moves off my hip and locks my view.My son is still running a fever of 99+ on the third day and hiding out in the dark basement which is his  sound studio.  It is cramped and full of electronic gear but has a bathroom  all  to himself.  Hopefully now that Monday has arrived, he can get an appointment with his  doctor and see about  geting Paxlovid.  I am  not sure how  contagious he will remain even after that.  It seems it took a  President  to show  us there is no magic bullet.  We will depend on tests.  I made him go sit outside for 10 minutes for  some change of scenery.  It is so hot and humid but maybe he got some vitamin D.Their dog also demands walking and feeding times.  He  is too big for me to walk and he has to be fed sharply at 6:00 AM.  I think he has them well-trained, but it  does present problems when you then have a child!Ah well, they are learning  the hard way.  I have an important appointment with the TSA in  a few days and hope that my daughter-in-laws mother can come down and help for  a while.It is amazing  how much time is taken up with feeding, entertaining and changing a 3-month-old, making sure the dog is happy, doing laundry and helping with cooking in  a kitchen that  is not  mine.Regarding our houseguest which I  mentioned in the prior post, it appears he  has broken his collar bone and hubby is trying to get a follow-up appointment with a specialist today.  Looks like we will have him with us for a few weeks (months?) more.  He drove up in a big truck pulling an airstream, so  he is not going to be able to make a getaway any time  soon.Send thoughts  to  the powers that be for  good energies  here to  keep baby safe and  speed up healing  for those who are ill.  Thanks."},
{"title": "Jekyll and  Sapelo  Islands and 16 Children", "date": "Sunday, August 07, 2022", "text": "Putting aside the reality and seriousness of this world this morning, I  will reminisce about my recent trip to the East Coast of Georgia with my  husband and my 11-year-old grandson.  Hubby and  I have been boosted twice and grandson once.  We we cautious but felt this opportunity was too important to postpone.  Every time a grandchild turns 10 we take them on a trip of their choosing somewhere in  the US. My grandson is  11, so we have postponed it  once  already. It is an opportunity for us to really get some  one-on-one time, except, it is usually heavily scheduled. I apologize  for the length  of this post without photos, but it  is  what it  is. Our  trip  out was  a bit of chaos.  We picked up C. at a restaurant midway between homes, where we had lunch with his mother.  We got back  to  our  house about  3:00 and as I sat down at the computer and checked my calendar, I realized that our drive down was supposed to have started that morning!  It is a little  over 11 hours and we broke it up into two days. Thus, we were already a few hours behind! We threw our  gear into the car (all  had been  prepacked) and we headed out as I called ahead to the hotel to tell  them  we would check  in after 10:00 that night.  I was busy making sure that my grandson's gear was correctly stowed and that we had packed drinks and snacks.  I had moved my two suitcases and small bag to the driver's side of  the driveway for  hubby to load.  He was getting his suitcase from the house, so I  moved in  my large suitcase to  the  trunk  while  I  pulled out some stuff to make more room and moved grandsons' stuff to the backseat.  Then I got into the  car and made  the call  to the hotel  as we  backed out.  I  asked hubby if  he  had loaded everything, and he said yes. Lesson learned here is that if your husband has beginning dementia, you must follow through  on your own for everything.  When we got to the hotel I  saw that he had walked right by the two small bags of  mine sitting by the car and got  into the car and started out!  I was panicked,  because my camera was one of the small bags and my toiletries, pajamas and medicine were in  the other.  I was angry and frustrated.  All could be replaced except  we  had left in pouring  rain and my camera bag would be soaked and I certainly needed my medicine for my chronic cough. In the hotel room  as I  opened my big  bag to find something to sleep in, I saw  I HAD  packed my medicines in a small pocket.  Relief passed over me as I accepted that a quick run to the  nearby Target the next morning would replace the PJs, make-up, hair dryer, sunscreen, bug spray, and other stuff that had been left behind.   I had  failed to take my small camera out of my purse, so it would have to be the substitute.  I also had my phone camera, but I  have never like trying to take photos with it, although it does a fair job.  (There are no photos to post as I  am up at my son's house right now which another whole  story.)  The next day we ate breakfast, shopped quickly and completed the second leg of our journey to Jekyll Island, Georgia.      The hotel where Road Scholar had  us  pre-booked was a lovely old  historic  building sprawling across acres of grass and old trees with a croquet area, a swimming pool, trails  to nearby historic sites,  etc.  We soon met up  with our group.  Most of the children were not ten, but eleven  and  twelve.  There were 8 boys and 8 girls.  Because  of this, perhaps, the rest of the trip was filled with giggling  and roughhousing, etc. as they showed off for  each other.  There were a few times that they did not pay attention and  when  they wanted to have  a table  all to themselves without grandparents at dinner, this chaos lasted only one evening.  A few of the young boys had ADHD and that added to the chaos.  My grandson  was  not  at all interested in  the wild  behavior.  I am  sure that some  of  the grandparents  thought he was shy and nerdy with his  glasses, etc., but he actually was not  interested in  crazy behavior but interested in  a nice  dinner with us.  It certainly made our  job easier. As a result we did enjoy the trip very much. Some of  the grandparents were singles,  some had serious health issues that required bravery on their  part to keep  up with  the  tours  and stairs  and sometimes odd seating. After a walk across  a  meadow that  was supposed  to house gopher tortoises and an  arrival at the  canal  where the children would use  dipnets  to catch  creatures for looking at under the microscope, one of the grandmothers  leaned  against a wooden fence over the  canal in exhaustion and the  fence gave way!  It took several  people to pull her back  up before  she  completely fell in, and it did frighten her husband.  Another grandfather who  was trying every single day to  keep up  did take a nasty fall adding  cuts  and  bruises.  One of  the visits was to an old lighthouse where we could  go all  the way to the top, about 129 steps.  I made it up in the  heat and humidity,  but the  next day my femor muscles were hurting with every other staircase  I  took  on that day.  We also  had a private show by some of the Gullah Geechee singers in which our grandchildren got to participate.  This might have been my favorite activity.    The children also went on a small shrimp trawler where they were able to look at and even handle some of the creatures in the waters of the sound such as stingrays, sharks and spot fish.    All in all, it was a fulfilling trip and I learned much. This post is getting waaay too long so I will not talk  about  the  scary near miss car  accident on the drive home doing 70 to keep up with traffic on the  freeway.  Suffice it to say we missed any damage.    I am posting no pictures, because  I have had to rush to my son's house to help with  the babysitting, as my son seems to have contracted  COVID and his wife has to start work  again and they need baby support.  My husband  is back home entertaining our house guest from Florida (his nephew) which is another story in itself as they ended up  in the emergency room last  night!  Does this never end????"},

My first comment is to post my thankfulness for Blogger allowing me to meet Mage in person several times.  We were strangers and have little in common and have so much in common.  She loves life as do I.  She loves history as do I.  She has fun with photography as do I.  She is an adventurer and I like to think I am but in a different way. She is more sophisticated than I as she came from a name family while I came from a farming family.  She is on the journey to another place.  That journey sounds painful and stressful and also hard on George, her husband, now. That journey that we all will make at some time.  I am so glad I was brave enough to meet her and George when she came to the city near me.  I will miss the insight she has on so many things.  I am so glad that her family is close with her now.  My second comment is that I am home from the Roads Scholar trip that I took with my second-to-youngest grandson.  We explored the islands of Georgia.  We experienced the culture, nature, and each other.  The trip started with a small disaster that could have been more difficult but we managed to survive.  They survived my anger and I survived all else.  There were other dangerous surprises.  I will post a brief review if you are interested.My saga of dead appliances continues.  The dishwasher that died is still not replaced because the brand I selected is not available at any time in the future.  Since I ordered from Best Buy, the college student that helped me failed to tell me that!  I finally had to go back and cancel and order another brand.  In between, there were a number of failed appointments regarding disconnect and removal in an installation that ruined the week.  I realize that the supply lines are heavily compromised, but retail outlets have to communicate that and not let you find out weeks later!  I also had issues with the electrician who came this week to preview our electrical panel for the installation of our backup generator.  With the more dramatic weather, we decided it was a good investment(?).Not checking my privilege, I will also complain about having to replace both boat lift motors this month as well.  Our nest egg that my husband was concerned about just sitting in a small non-interest bearing account is somewhat depleted and I am glad I did not let him invest it elsewhere.We have a step-cousin on a visit in a few days.  He is not close to my husband but we are happy to have him stay on a planned overnight.  Then the next weekend my son and his daughter and new baby are coming for a two-day visit.I have been working for hours trying to find out why our process for getting a renewed TSA (Transportation Security Administration) KTN number is not working.  There is absolutely no way to talk to a living person except by scheduling another appointment and driving up 30 miles and I dread that the lady there will say she has no power over that database even though they took my $140.00 for a five-year renewal within days after our first appointment with her.  If those of you who live outside this privileged country think this makes this sound like a bureaucratic nightmare you have NO idea.Summer days are hot and humid and that is why I have posted photos that make you think it is nicer here than it really is!"},
{"title": "Lost in Thought?", "date": "Saturday, July 02, 2022", "text": "Came across the word \"Compartmentalizing\" the other day.  (the Brits spell it with an 's'.)  I remember first hearing-reading that word many years ago when they were describing former President Clinton and his approach to discussing issues.  I wasn't sure if they were denigrating or admiring him for this skill.I guess it is important if you want to keep from going emotionally crazy.  Oh, Merriam-Webster's definition is\" to separate into isolated compartments or categories. \"  That definition is not really in-depth enough unless you think about it in context.I found this on the web which has a bit darker definition:  \"In psychology, compartmentalization is a defense mechanism our brains use to shut out traumatic events.\"Wikipedia- \"It may be a form of mild dissociation; example scenarios that suggest compartmentalization include acting in an isolated moment in a way that logically defies one's own moral code, or dividing one's unpleasant work duties from one's desires to relax.

Just got back from volunteering in the Children's Garden where the last of the spring produce was harvested and taken to the Food Pantry.  It was not much to bring, sadly.  We are in that time between seasonal crops, but lots of herbs.The installation team came for two whole days to install our new HVAC system which does run much more quietly and has all those bells and whistles, like being able to control it from your phone while you are lounging by the pool in that distant hotel!  The screen even controls the humidity very closely and tells me the temp and humidity outside.  It also came with the price tag of a used car in excellent condition!On the same day, our young electrician friend (Who made some major error as a supervisor with our local electrical company and is now again unemployed!) came and helped us fix the hanging ceiling in the basement and restore the shorted wire.  It looks almost new once again.  I think hubby paid him $25 an hour which will probably not provide food for the week!  The ceiling above was not damp and the wood not wet, so odd that the tiles absorbed it all.I managed to squeeze in time to get my haircut, but I am growing tired of the style and thinking of letting it grow out...maybe wait until fall.The luncheon with our 96-year-old friend was delightful.  She is still very sharp although slowing down physically and unable to do stairs.  We are going to try to make this luncheon a regular thing because her daughters took away her car on her birthday.  She has not had an accident, but they felt it was time.  One of the daughters is a psychotherapist...Ahem.  All three daughters live an hour or more from her.  She lives in a retirement community where there is lots of assistance and easy transport, but she said not having a car makes her feel isolated.My daughter and the two grandchildren arrive tomorrow night for an overnight and morning visit the next day for Father's Day.  I have no idea what to cook and am thinking of ordering out.  I will make a ricotta cheesecake this afternoon.I have a high school friend arriving next week with her husband from the midwest.  They will be staying elsewhere with relatives but want to meet up for one day during the week.  When we made this plan my week was pretty open.  Now I only have Tuesday really free.I also have to drive up on Wednesday to the city to babysit my new grandchild and then stay overnight and come back on Thursday.  There is a farewell dinner for a friend that we are going to that Thursday early evening!  I am going to bring a fruit platter as I have no time for a potluck casserole!Thus far I have nothing on the Friday and Saturday that is to come, but with my luck, my gregarious husband will book something!(Oh, the biopsies were both benign, but they want to squeeze my mammary glands more often in the future!  I laughed at the Doctor's notes...\" procedure was tolerated well by the patient.\"  That is a matter of opinion as I screamed bloody murder at least twice during the hour. )For those of you missing your fathers, you are lucky to have had such love, and for those who still have fathers, take them their favorite food or make a date to share time in the future."},

Which is it? Let me see, looking at my calendar: I have had a \"personal interview\" to renew and update my TSA number for traveling.  TSA stands for Transportation Security Administration. That is a 40-minute drive from my house to the Vehicle Administration Building.  I am still waiting for the number as it will take 10 or more days to get the number to be able to move into the \"faster\" line at the airport.  No removing of shoes, etc.  This luxury costs about $100 and lasts about(?) five years. I helped with the crowds of visitors at the Master Gardener Booth at the Children's garden.  That was at least five hours of talking and taking promo photos and transplanting free native plants to give away. My granddaughter got a new job so we had to postpone our trip to later on that Saturday.So, on the same day later in the afternoon, I went up to the city and took my granddaughter on a clothes shopping trip for a belated birthday.  After a few hours of enlightenment on what teenagers are wearing these days---not much (I really could not tell the difference between bras and \"outer\" tops!) .  I also learned that my daughter and granddaughter's favorite perfume is $300 a bottle!  Not buying that for her birthday.  I did learn that all of the most popular items at the make-up store were not available.  We are continuing to suffer from transportation issues due to the WAR and COVID.Long lines to try on clothes.  Yes, this is an upper-middle-class mall.Using the screens to scroll through hundreds of stores.The very next afternoon, I helped with another Master Gardener booth at a nearby museum and historic mansion.  Over 800 visitors!  That evening I was wiped or whipped like fine cream and really wanted a reprieve, but....The VERY NEXT day I headed up to the local radiology center (another 30-minute drive) and had not one but two breast biopsies.  This time I asked for some Xanax as my biopsy over two decades ago was pretty traumatic.  It was still extremely painful.  Hubby drove me up and back.  I learn later today the results.  This time she nicked an artery and my left boob looks like ...well never mind...it is not pleasant.I relaxed last week after all the above.  This week I have the repair people coming to replace the HVAC system which will take two full days, maybe lots of noise, and a large closing payment.  Living without AC is no longer possible in this climate-changing world.  The rest of the basement ceiling tiles that had absorbed water finally gave way this week and now, I need an electrician and a handyman.On Thursday I got up my energy (remember I am an introvert) to call a 96-year-old friend I have not seen since before COVID and am taking her out to lunch at a local restaurant.  She is a little hard of hearing and I can tell by talking to her on the phone that she is slowing down, so I am gearing down.  She is a brilliant nutritionist, so it is hard for me to see this.Then on Friday my daughter and maybe some of the grands are coming down for a Father's Day visit.  Only the evening and perhaps a bit of the morning on Saturday.  They are SO VERY BUSY.  They really are.  Just following their few posts on FB makes me exhausted.Well, that gets me through this next week.  At least I have an excuse for failing to update my blog.  I hope those of you that celebrate real Father's Day and Volunteer Father's Day have it full of hugs and gentle memories.  And aren't you jealous at how busy I am...EGAD."},
{"title": "Pouring/Spilling Water", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2022", "text": "An early morning boat trip that I will write about on my other blog...soon  Yesterday we brought down the bird feeders.  We had not been filling them for a couple of weeks, but it was time to wash them to remove any mold, fungus, or diseases so we could use them next fall.  A small percentage of my finches carry eye disease and I do not want to spread it to the other birds.  Birds rarely come to the feeders this time of year anyway because the bugs that are flying and crawling about are much higher nutrition and also the type of thing that is digestible to the baby fledglings.  I have a deep sink in the laundry room and sprayed the feeders with a pet rug spray. (It really works wonders, something I bought when we fostered that dog.)  I then add a cap of bleach to the water in the sink and soak the feeders for an hour.  I went on my merry way to do so many other chores that had been piling up but had to go back to the laundry room a while later to drop off some laundry.  I was dismayed to find that the faucet had not been turned off completely and water was sneaking over the counter and down onto the linoleum floor as well as behind the doubled stacked washer and dryer and then into the floor vent!  This was when I learned that my laundry room deep sink does NOT have an overflow drain!  It was just a small bit of water running, but that can add up in no time.                It took 30 minutes to mop up, move the heavy rug on the floor and wring out the rags I was using.  I had stopped the water from flowing across the floor from behind the washer to the floor vent, but next had to check the basement.The water was dripping rapidly from ceiling tiles ( a dropped ceiling) and flooded the tiled floor to hubby's office and his boat gear room.  I had him help me carry out the dripping rug to the table on the patio and then went back to put a bucket under the main area where water was dripping and to mop and dry the rest of the floor with a portable fan.At least 8 ceiling tiles in the basement are stained and will have to be replaced.  Since I avoid going on ladders, I will need to find a helper!This was most annoying because earlier this week our heat pump in the attic had frozen coils which filled the aluminum pan beneath the unit and then dripped water out the corner of the trim to the attic stairway and onto the wooden floor and side of the oriental rug in the guest bedroom.  Hubby and I were in bed and the evening rain had started.  At first, I thought that was the sound of rain on the roof, but realized the rhythm was weird.  Fortunately, we caught that \"spilled\" water in a few minutes and turned off the heat pump as hubby sopped up the water from the drain pan with a sponge and I cleaned up the floor and put down a bucket.  (The repairman recommended replacing both AC/Heat units as they are 18-years-old!)I know that pouring water is a ritual in many spiritual communities, but I had to look up \"spilled\" water.  It seems that in most cases it means a change to good fortune or good luck---don't we all need that! I am waiting... guess it happens after the fortune we have to pay for two new HVAC units.  Since I keep spilling a small bit of water when filling my coffee maker in the same place, one article said it was a spirit that was trying to get my attention! Do you have any water issues that you confront?"},

Now she has been home for almost three weeks and parents are slowly descending from cloud 9 to that period where you sit exhausted between chores, errands, feedings, and changings and wonder if you will survive.  They are in their 40's, so \"survival\" is a bit larger challenge.I find that night-time thoughts go to dark places and I really must work on meditation or unwinding or more artwork to displace this.  Thoughts about things I said or did years ago that were unkind, thoughts about my carelessness with life, thoughts about all the dangers my loved ones will encounter as they move forward in their lives.  I worry about the medical challenges many of my friends are facing.  I do not think this mind wandering is due to COVID or Wars or even aging chemistry because I remember when my own little ones were growing I kept being sad about when they would move into adulthood and leave. Yes, a bit of an odd duck am I.  It is just the way my brain is wired.  Be thankful you have balanced electricity in that gray matter up there. Crossed wires can be exhausting.Do not worry for me.  I am strong and realize I have no control over the universe, even though I think I could face that challenge.  I feel I could do a bit of a better job at it...much less suffering, please!Now I am going to go downstairs and run on the elliptical.  I have not done that in almost nine days.  LAZY ME!"},

Just felt like sitting in front of the TV after a short nap.  Hubby slept the entire day! Yes, we are elders and no one should be surprised. I was surprised as my first two vaccines and the first Booster did not give me any side effects.   I was pretty non-reactive.Today I feel as if I am in some cottage garden in England.  It is misty and foggy on the river and there is no sun because the gray clouds are drizzling spring rain everywhere.  This should be posted on my other blog about the great outdoors, but I started here on this blog!Spring rains and an abundance of flowers.  Below is our native geranium.Above my \"rose arbor\" just like the flowers in Midsomer.Poor Iris always want to bloom when the rains are so heavy!The yard is full of columbine that scatter their seeds EVERYWHERE.And below is a photo of one side of my house, that I think DOES look a bit of a Midsomer Garden...wonder if there is a body down that foggy hill to the river?"},

Surely that is not the reason. Could it be because I have my electrician friend here working on a mercurial outlet on the deck that jumps the fuse that also goes to my new freezer in the basement?  Could it be my concern because this dear man has lost his job with a big utility company because he failed to follow up and inspect a job that he had assigned to an underling and that meant some customers went without electricity for 30 minutes?  He was the man I wrote about earlier who helped us and we helped him as he got out of jail and reunited with his family for new beginnings. I am exhausted. Could it be because I wanted to take a nap after my shots and now I cannot because he showed up?I am exhausted.  Could it be because I was lifting moving and standing the former two days on my feet setting up, being available, and taking down the plant sale for the County Master Gardeners and being outside one whole day in the cold and drizzly rain--- a sale that brought in more money than ever this year?I am exhausted.  Could it be because the very next day, Sunday, I was summoned up early that morning by my son whose wife gave early birth to a new baby girl, 4 weeks early, who is now in NICU but should be released in a few days? (So lovely!)I am exhausted.  Could it be because last week I invited over a friend for lunch that we had not seen in years due to COVID and I ran around trying to make everything hunky-dory instead of just relaxing and enjoying company?  She is an excellent baker and I did feel intimidated.I am exhausted.  Could it be the lovely post Mother's Day dinner I had with my daughter and granddaughter at the lovely Mediterranean restaurant near their house?  Followed by the very long drive back home.I am exhausted and I know spring is getting away from me.  Still so much weeding and planting to do!  I need an 8 or 9-day week!Sorry, I am not going to read your blogs to catch up.  I now have to find a manual for my electrician."},
{"title": "Procrastination, Parties and Preserving Food", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2022", "text": "My world has been crowded with events and procrastination has been at the top of my list of things to do.  Blogging has been tapping on my shoulder and I have felt guilty but ignored it rather successfully.First I lost my upright freezer and at least half of the contents.   It was an old freezer that we had purchased from a neighbor when they moved. The rest of the food was given away or re-frozen in my now super packed little freezer below my refrigerator.  The lesson learned is that:1.  I freeze way too much stuff for two old people. One could say this is depression-era syndrome but I am NOT that old.2.  I bake too much stuff for us to eat and all that baking isn't healthy eating anyway.  I split it into smaller bags, but all have to be frozen.3.  Hubby processes all his tomatoes into dried tomatoes and thinks we can go through tons of that in one year.4.  Hubby makes huge batches of freezer jam...and jam is not all that healthy either.This drawer above to my refrigerator freezer now only closes if we mash everything hard!We bought another upright freezer (delivered today) and I moved it to the basement instead of the garage where the other freezer was plugged in.  The new freezer is about 60% the size of the old freezer and I am sure we will fill it fully in no time!!Hubby wanted to invite our neighbor (\"Martha Stewart\") over for an oyster dinner.  She told him she had never eaten broiled oysters(!)  Hubby invited her that very day and said he would do all the planning and cooking and I would not have to worry.  Needless to say, he got to talking and talking to our guest and I had to cook everything except the oysters which he put in the oven to bake for about 8 minutes before he realized he had not turned on the broiler!  The meal went well in spite of all the craziness.  She is super polite and a perfect politician.  (Never having eaten a broiled oyster after living in this state most of her life. Ha! ) I had apologized to her that we did not have seafood forks for the oysters.  We probably could have used the crab forks, but we enjoyed the oysters and store-bought veggies and cake and the meal went pretty well, although I felt out of my depth in the hostess department.A few days later I came home to find on our front porch a small gift bag filled with tissue paper and these:      She seems to have the perfect hostess gift for any occasion.  I do feel a little intimidated that for every one thing we do for her she responds with at least two things!Along with the above events are the Master Gardeners' activities, which are in full swing with lots of meetings and planning.  That crowds my calendar and I am trying to get out of much of it.And the cherry on the \"Too Much to Do\" cake for this month was my daughter-in-law and son's baby shower.  I helped my daughter move chairs and tables and helped with menu planning and shopping and brownie making, etc.  It was outdoors and for 40 people.  She and her husband - ever the host and hostess - did the games.  The crowd were people in their 40's so it was much more different than an age 20 baby shower.  It went very well, I was in charge of photos and we were not entirely exhausted when we delivered all the chairs and tables back to my daughter's neighbors throughout her neighborhood.  Early afternoon the weather was lovely and then it turned a bit cold.Today I am supposed to pay bills and exercise.  Sigh.  I think I will read blogs instead."},

{"title": "Playing Tourist", "date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2022", "text": "How lucky I am to be able to play tourist in my own country.  Yes, COVID Cousin waits to rear its ugly head down the road.  Yes, inflation has cut dramatically into our budget. Yes, the war in Ukraine gets uglier and uglier as that awful dictator tries to bomb them back to the dark ages.  But, I have to turn my face to the sun and pretend, for a while, that my life is going on somewhat regularly. The conference planners had expected 3,000 scientists, environmentalists, and policy planners from around the globe.  They got 2200, which was still a pretty good number.  Most, but not all, wore masks, as required by the rules.  There was a PCR testing room off to the side and as I walked by I saw 3 people inside.  I think they were testers.  This conference in actuality was one of three regional member meetings that allowed easier travel for all of the scientists around the globe.  One meeting in San Diego, one a few months later in Mexico, and a final one a few months after that in Singapore.  Some scientists will go to all three.Below is the bar/gathering area outside the conference registration building up in Mission Valley outside of San Diego.  It was early in the day.  Scientists can fill a bar when needed.I went to the conference two of the days.  Hubby's talk did not go as smoothly as he hoped because the slides were out of order and some were missing.  He was not embarrassed but went on with his talking anyway.  I had asked him several times to go through it with me, but he was tinkering with it until the very last minute.  He did get an opportunity to meet all of his old friends and also made some plans with Nature Conservancy contacts for work on a project.  So all in all it was worthwhile.The other days I played tourist.  San Diego has a special city park called Balboa Park.  It began in 1868 as a city park on a high mesa overlooking San Diego.  It has got to be the best location of any city park!  Over 17 museums and historic venues to see.  Naturally one of my afternoons there I saw just a tiny bit. (I must come back.) When we had visited years ago with Mage and George we got a private tour of the car museum, which is the best way to get a tour!I am not the best map reader and had trouble finding the Japanese Friendship Garden along with a few other tourists that I followed!  (The Botanical Gardens were closed, sadly.)  The Friendship Garden held new meaning for me in these times.Then I toured the desert garden and missed the Rose Garden, sadly.Finally, I visited the many art shops at the Spanish Village Art Center and did not buy anything because that time in my life has passed.  In fact, I went through my craft closet and gave some stuff to Mage that had been sitting there unused for some time!  Nothing like dumping your stuff on others!Artists village.  Photo was taken before it opened mid-afternoon.I also toured the Mingei International Museum which was filled with marvelous arts and crafts items from famous and non-famous and maybe infamous.  The museum had a half-dozen explorers other than me and arts and crafts are one of my favorite things to view.  I spent over an hour there as I had no one else to worry about!  I was so enthralled that I failed to take many photos.  Below the wall of Indonesian wax Tjaps which are copper designs that carry melted wax to resist the dyes when making batik fabric.  I have one or two which I use as trivets.We did spend a small fortune on food, but since we have not eaten out in nice restaurants for almost three years, we felt justified.  We got to places early since we were on East Coast time and had our choice of tables. Plenty of good seafood in the tourist areas of the city.  Seafood is always healthy, even if smothered in butter, right?Needless to say, almost all is ala carte in the tourist areas which makes it so much more expensive.Since I did a lot of walking I also ordered my share of desserts.  On our get-together with two of my favorite bloggers, Hubby and George ordered some chocolate-cake concoction the size of a small cat, and Mage and I ordered a mutual favorite, creme brulee.  The creme brulee had fresh fruit on top and that has to count for something!  I will skip writing the narrative on the huge mistake I made in getting the meet-up location correct as that is almost a blog post by itself!  At least we finally met up!I hope this showed that the world is moving on timidly.  Stay safe in your travels."},
{"title": "Traveling by Air Once Again", "date": "Saturday, March 12, 2022", "text": "Certainly, aging changes travel skills.  I usually return exhausted and ready to get back to my normal routines.  This time I was much more emotional and sort of \"out of time\".  I felt lost at times during the day and actually had problems remembering where I had stored stuff before I left.  I did sleep like a hibernating bear on the trip and at home which I do love after my problems with coughing last year.The actual flights, scheduling, and going through security were extremely efficient.  We flew United and have their credit card and they made it so easy to check in at home or at the hotel in San Diego or at my sister's house each time we needed boarding passes.  Many people used their phones to show the QR code, but I found that at least a few times the airport reader would not work as easily with the phone screen as it did for those of us with our paper printed codes!  (I also always worry about having a phone with no power.)  We were able to check in our bags at the kiosks very easily as well.Due to hubby's memory issues, I have found that I have taken over all the scheduling and checking in.  BUT he made all the reservations before we left!  I think that when he is stressed, his memory fails him more and there is nothing more stressful than standing in an airport line or waiting for a taxi.Our airports were relatively empty during the times and days we traveled.  We were off the pre-TSA list as we had not flown for years, and were no longer subscribed.  Therefore we did not have the luxury of being pre-checked with TSA.  The security lines had different rules at Dulles, San Diego, and Denver.  None required shoe removal if you are over 75.  All required removal of electronics. Two required removals of my DSLR camera.   One required me and hubby to go through the body scanner while the other two did not.It was hard to wear masks during the entire time you were at the airports (unless eating) and during the entire flight, although you could remove them if you were eating the snacks and drinking as long as you replaced the mask between sips and bites.  It was hot and if you were dragging luggage from one end of a large airport to another, the mask did reduce oxygen intake! We encountered no mask idiots on the flight thankfully.  99% of the travelers followed the rules.We stayed in the Gaslight District in San Diego.  Very touristy, expensive food and only touristy stores to shop.  But since I live in the country, these were all treated as temporary issues.  It was within walking distance of the parks near the water.  The architecture was certainly varied.And, as you can see there were no crowds!We got some great sunsets from our hotel room which looked over the water in front of the Convention Center.  (Hubby's conference was up in Mission Valley instead of the large center here.)We Ubered everywhere and that cost $19 to $30 depending on the trip.  Considering the cost of gas and the luxury of not having to find parking for a rental car, we thought this was quite acceptable.  I downloaded the UBER app to hubby's phone and he was able to navigate back and forth by himself on the two days that I did not go to the conference.  He hates phone apps, but when motivated...I took a few hundred photos and will not bore you with them all.  In the next post I will add some stuff about botanical visits, hubby's speech and include our visit with Mage and George since I know that bloggers love to read about others' travels...not.  Thanks for bearing with me."},
{"title": "Being Brave", "date": "Friday, February 25, 2022", "text": "We are off on an airplane this Sunday. We drive up to my daughter's house on Saturday to spend the night since it is closer to the airport and we can leave our car in her neighborhood.  She and her husband are off to dinner and a play and will not have much time to spend with us and the grands have various plans as well.  It cannot be helped that they are in the prime of their life! Hubby is giving a presentation at an international conference in San Diego.  We are brave to go to such a large and exposed meeting with people from all over the world.  It is good for him to prove to himself that he can still do this and while many will not find his speech important, it is important to him!  It is only 10 minutes long with a few minutes allowed for questions and he has been working on it for months!  He will print out a copy for me to review and then go down and make changes before I can even read it!  He would normally have it memorized by now.  I may be the one changing the slides on the screen.We will be exposing ourselves on long plane flights and then he will be exposed at the meetings.  We will be wearing masks and I have packed some quick Covid tests in the event we need them.  Sadly we have to go on living our lives and it seems such a small danger compared to places around the world right now that are in the middle of a war. I hope to meet up with Mage (and George) as well as tour a few places in the city that I have not seen for years.  We met as bloggers when they came to my nearby city and then I went to theirs and now I am returning! I hope to eat in nicer restaurants; I hope to find wonderful things to photograph; I hope to avoid COVID.After five days we are flying on to Colorado and meeting with family and praying we are not carrying germs to them although several of them have been traveling recently as well.Life is moving on.  I guess it has to or why are we living?(Apologies for the odd font size.  Blogger spends most of its time reducing my font size!)"},
{"title": "Are Roller Coaster Rides Good for Your Health?", "date": "Monday, February 21, 2022", "text": "The saga of the dog is in three parts, and this is the last.  If you are not a pet person or animal person or in the mood, I am guessing that reading this is a waste of time.  But since it was an important lesson learned in my life, I have to document it. For a few years now, since we have retired, Hubby has been telling me we should get a dog. We have owned at least six dogs in our lifetime. I love dogs but not the ticks that are so dangerous.  Yes, they give dogs poison but I have seen live ticks crawling on the granddogs that I babysit during some summers.It has been good that the Shelters have been open by appointment only for the last two years due to COVID as I could avoid the issue more easily.  Our local \"limited kill\" shelter finally opened on Saturdays for three hours for an open house and Hubby wanted us to go.  We did.    He immediately fell in love with a 3-year-old foxhound called Birdie and they let her out for us to visit in a side room.  The dog was loving and exploring and calm.  Hubby felt sure that since she was the only dog not barking in the kennels she was a real \"Lady\" and he called her that.  He wanted to take her home immediately!  I had to calm him and explain we needed to dog-proof the house (and talk about such a big step.) We worked on the house and a week later emailed the shelter for an appointment to take Lady.  Since the manager saw our division in the enthusiasm she wisely suggested we foster to adopt.    Those of you who have read the previous two blog entries know that this is exactly what we did.  The second post shows the adventure we were exposed to and it helped me talk Hubby into returning this dog.  I had hoped he would play a bigger role in the dog's care and in watching her, but he has a number of projects and is not good with details, such as when and how to give the dog medications.  It is not his early dementia, as he has always left the details of life to me.  He did take her on the long walks.  While she initially sat with him while he watched TV, Lady related to me mostly, insisting on sitting in my lap during my morning coffee on the sofa.        She was very needy in demanding that I rub her tummy for a 15 minute morning session as I drank my coffee and watched the news.  She would take her paw under my arm and push it down.  I did not mind as she was warm for my cold hands and I realized that such vulnerable love was something that was in very short supply in her chaotic life.  She was clearly trusting.  She followed me everywhere.In about two weeks she was able to sleep in her kennel, was housebroken and rang the bells hanging on the door to go out, and actually started \"talking\" and \"arguing\" with me over treats in a very human way.She even liked/tolerated(?) baths.  She slept in her kennel every night without any bother and waited for me to get up in the early morning to feed her and let her outside! No barking. Perfect, right? Then came the tragic evening that I wrote about in my last post.  Such a scary thrill ride! I had imagined her dead on the road from a traffic accident, dead from the gunshot of a nearby hunter, or coming home with all kinds of health issues and broken bones to add to the ones she already had! It was not hubby's fault that she escaped, but it was/is a problem in that he cannot watch her and start a BBQ at the same time.  His focus is singular. We took her back yesterday.  The people at the shelter were polite and friendly, but I saw they were somewhat cold in taking her back.  I brought lots of extra food I had purchased and snacks and other stuff in a bag as well as all the food she did not eat.   I still felt a failure.Do I miss seeing that soft brown face in the morning-YESDo I miss tripping over her as I make my way to sit down for my coffee--NODo I miss taking her outside several times a day-MAYBEDo I miss her ability to drag me down the steps in the early morning before she can be controlled-NODo I miss her warm head in my lap-YESDo I miss all the dog hair on the furniture-NODo I miss having to negotiate my every move in the kitchen-NODo I miss Dog bags of poo-NODo I miss her enthusiasm for life-PerhapsDo I miss her watching birds with me in my weekly count for Cornell-YESWill we try for another dog-Probably not for a long time."},
{"title": "Not So Boring Stuff About a Dog", "date": "Thursday, February 17, 2022", "text": "This past week has been busy and I cannot remember why our shoulder lamb chops  in the fridge could not be eaten until this last night. We felt caught up  finally on many things in our life and these shoulder chops are my husband's  favorite which he can now eat since his Alphagal allergy has ended!  He  wanted them barbequed and went out to the Egg smoker on the back deck to get  started.    I did not have much in the way of side dishes and so heated a few rolls,    put some leftover green beans in the microwave to reheat, and made a tomato    and avocado salad before the avocado got too ripe to eat.  Our Lady dog was watching hubby working through the deck window.  I asked him    to move the storage bench across the stairway to the back yard blocking any getaway and I would let Lady out so she    could be with him and enjoy the milder late afternoon early evening    temperatures. She wandered the deck and explored every BBQ tool and watched him start the    smoker.  I returned to the kitchen.     Everything was fine for about 5 to 10 minutes when I heard Hubby shout      out.  Lady had pushed aside the heavy storage bench while Hubby was distracted with some task and she had run down the      stairs and was eating the birdseed under the feeder in the back      yard.  We both called her to come but just minutes later she must have smelled      deer!  Sure enough, she ran down to the dock where the deer trail crosses the back yard and flushed a few deer      out in the verbena by the river, and off everyone went into the      woods.  She was on a run and barking gleefully.  She managed to      cross the woods in each ravine and the back yards of all of our neighbors      for a least a half-mile down the peninsula chasing the deer and bouncing like a kangaroo.I ran inside to get a leash and some kibble while Hubby made his way      through all the woodland calling her.    I got down to culdesac at the end of the main neighborhood out front and heard her barking repeatedly. I called and      called in as joyful and welcoming a voice as I could.  I turned to      the right and saw hubby in the distance.  We came together and I gave him the leash and some of the      kibble.  He went to the tip of the land by the river and I waited by      the road in the opposite direction.  I followed her voice and soon I saw her behind me running      across the road to the other side.  I called and bent down and begged      her to come.  I rattled the kibble bag which was always a failsafe in      getting her to come up to me and sit waiting.  She was about 50 feet      away, saw me and grinned (actually), and darted off like a fawn away      into the woods.  Then I saw her a half-mile up our street darting      back across the road the other way, truly an energizer bunny.   I called and called.  Hubby and I followed her bark up and down the peninsula but could not get      near her.  The sun was beginning to set and with the diminishing sun      came some pretty cold air that would drop into the 30'sF.  Hubby and I walked back to the house,      knowing she was miles away by now as we could no longer hear her bark.  He got in the car and headed up      toward the main road as that was where we heard her last.  He went      down the road that had a barn and leaned out and called.  An old lady      was doing something there and asked if he was looking for a dog.  He      said yes, and she pointed on up the hill toward other woods and houses and      said she saw her streaking like a dart.  Back at home, I went out to the Egg smoker and saw the coals were perfect      and red and so I shut the top and closed the damper, mostly hoping I could      keep the coal fires burning for another hour!  I put on my down coat      and went back outside to the end of our road and walked up the hill and called and      called.  I stood there until dark and with freezing hands came back      to the house, but left a trail of kibble down our driveway on the off      chance she would find her way home. Even so, I remembered that this was how she      had been found before in her life, skinny and lost.  I was sad, but      oddly, not devastated.  I was mad but oddly not angry.  It was our fault but it was also Lady's wildness.  I did not want to think about her trying to find someplace warm and dry to sleep the night, because nothing like that existed in the woods.    After another 20 minutes, Hubby returned in the car and said he could hear      her sharp high bark miles away, but he had no luck.  We became resigned.    We left the gate to the yard open, left open the garage door, and hoped      for the best.    The BBQ temp had held and was perfect for the chops and so we made dinner, sat down and      ate, and talked about how she was willing to miss her dinner to run and      chase the deer.  She was a wild one and I thought to myself if she      does not return, gets lost, and gets returned to the shelter (her ID was still on her) I      was going to tell them she was too much for us.  I had never had a      dog who was so gentle, slept on my lap, ate from my hand, and then totally      went wild outside.  It was her dinner hour and she had no      interest in coming to us.  I thought that most dogs will eventually come when they are      exhausted.    During dinner, I went outside to the front door every 10 minutes and      called her.  We finished dinner, cleaned up the plates, and turned on      the TV for some distraction.  In over an hour we heard something outside on the porch, and Hubby went to open the front door.  There she sat, so happy to see us!  She came inside, gulped some      water, and I took her bowl of kibble with her medicine from the      refrigerator and put it down.  (Mistake on my part, but more about      that later.)  She ate but with a calm sedateness that was      unusual.  Then she went to her favorite sofa and sat and looked at us      through half-closed eyes as if she was exhausted trying to stay awake.  Later she came and      sat next to me trembling every once in a while.  I thought she had      gotten chilled, but soon she got up and started pacing and we took her      outside where she threw up some food. About 15 minutes later she threw up on a rug by the door and I recognized the kibble    and her blue medicine capsule.  Perhaps the food was too cold.  Not exactly.    She went outside several times more throwing up and then burying the    vomited mass in the leaves of my flower beds!  We brought her back and    this process of rejecting food went on for some time.  Finally close to ten o'clock we were tired and ready for bed.  I had to push her into    her kennel and I knew she did not want to go in because she was still    sick!    I slept through the night not wanting to think about it all.  Just before 7:00 AM I got up and came out to release    her for a break outside and then breakfast, keeping the thought away from the back of my mind that she might be dead!  But relieved that she sat up and looked at me normally.  In her kennel piled neatly    all around the side like a 2-inch ridge of dirt was some strange dry black vomit.     She looked miserable, but had kept the center where she slept clean!  I    took her outside and she peed but then just wanted to sit and watch the    morning sun-rise which I allowed.  The weather was really nice, not too    chilly and quiet except for the Canadian geese down near the water having a    battle over who was going to get to use the osprey nest.  I wanted to go back inside, but knew she needed this and so tried to meditate a bit(!).  As we    returned to the house she was very determined to get her \"cache\" of vomit    she had buried under the leaves and it took my strong hand to get her back inside.     I brought her inside and went to give her some dry kibble, but only half or even    less than her normal serving.  She ate eagerly, but not crazily like    she usually does.  This gave me time to clean her bedding and look at    the vomit that I had thrown outside on the deck.  Below is a photo I took.  Yes, maybe some    grain of some sort, thank goodness it was not poisonous left out by a farmer for    some varmints.   Farmers are usually careful around here because we have had Bald Eagle die-offs due to poisoning left for wild animals.Yes, that is a lot considering she threw up several times before we put her in her kennel.  It looks like a grain of some kind.    Yes, we are so lucky she did not bloat and die from the intestinal blockage as well, and we    are lucky that it was not something terribly poisonous.  It is very dry.  She looked so miserable and we can hope she learned her lesson and we learned ours!  This is going to be a much calmer day with her while she mends.She is not totally back to herself by this afternoon, but I can deal with the lack of enthusiasm.  She ate a lunch of a handful of kibble in chicken broth and is now sleeping.  Of all the dogs we have owned I realize that we got them as pups or under a year.  Adopting a three-year-old is much more challenging."},
{"title": "Boring Stuff About a Dog---Not Your Dog", "date": "Monday, February 14, 2022", "text": "Where was my brain when I agreed to take in this dog? I am sure I am losing weight as I rarely can sit for any length of time.  Always checking on where she is and what she is up to.  I do kennel her 3 hours in the middle of the day as I really need some downtime...or a nap!  When I leave the kennel door open, she goes in on her own sometimes to nap.  We have always had puppies and that seems so much easier?  (The red plaid blanket and bed were given to us by the shelter.  I have two sleeping cushions above the kennel to rotate when washing stuff.  She never plays with the expensive dogs' toys we bought!)Yes, she is growing on me, but she is exhausting in terms of making sure we get her to pee outside.  She is on steroids and thus drinking lots of water and having to pee lots.  She manages to go 90% outside, but it is that 10% that means rugs have to be cleaned and deodorized.  I have read her a few times and realize she just HAS to pee and does not hurry to the front door but squats nearby. We are trying the bell method, and rolling up the throw rugs.She is basically pretty manageable. We can let her out without her leash in the early cold morning and she will pee and then come trotting back.  Usually, I go with her out of habit. After meals, she will pace the house looking for kibble and knows everywhere that I have it stored in containers for behavior modification...such as the laundry room where we have a dog shower.  She has gotten two baths and not been too upset by them; I think she likes the warm water.  Due to her skin itching, we are trying a non itch shampoo for dogs. Thus far she has not tried to take stuff off of the counters, but I am sure if we were gone she would be into everything in no time.  She gets fed before our dinner and does not beg when we sit down to eat, although she does stand or sit nearby.She is very loving and insists on sleeping with her head on my lap in the early afternoon.  The rest of the time she sleeps on the covered sofa or in her kennel. Hubby has trained her to heel when walking most of the time.  She does not feel a need to eat every stick or dead frog along the walk!  She will come back and sit, but mostly for kibble.  Although we try to alternate with lots of loving and no kibble.  She does not bark when the neighborhood German shepherds do their morning barking.  I have heard her bay only once, so that is not an issue.She learned the sit command in a few days but not the stay command if there is food coming up.  She did a soft snap at me once when I was trying to get her up in the evening to go to her kennel.  I had not touched her but was moving in toward her.  She was scolded severely (no hitting - just me in an angry voice) and I am guessing she was used to being on her own when sleeping or people had been mean to her after waking?  She clearly was feeling bad about it.  She also barked at hubby when he came to the sofa and bent to hold my head in his hands and kiss me and then try to do the similar to her.  All other times she has been very gentle and obedient.  I will ask when we return her to the kennel if this might mean she would not be safe around a small child...although they probably cannot get me a definitive answer.I have read mixed reviews on personality changes in a female dog after spaying and that is what they will do before we can officially adopt her."},
{"title": "Not Back to Normal", "date": "Wednesday, February 09, 2022", "text": "Normalcy, if I ever could lay claim to such, has flown out the window.  I gave in and agreed to my husband's desire to foster the dog from the shelter but did make him wait a week while we prepared the house with gates, spaces, etc., and bought a bunch of pet stuff!  This is a bit long so you have to bear with me.I should have been more careful because my husband's dementia means that I am totally responsible for feeding and watching the dog when she is inside.  She has had a few peeing accidents and we are trying to get her to use the bell hanging from the door, as well as take her out several times morning and afternoon and before bed.  I also can remember the amount of feed as well as the medicine regime. Hubby is very good at walking and exercising the dog.  We have had her for 11 days.  She is not a chewer, probably because she is 3 years old.  She is crazy for food.  She has Lymes and heartworm and is on medicines for that and if I put them in a \"pill pocket\" she will gulp them down in a second.  (Actually she will do almost anything for food.)The first night we put her in a kennel in our bedroom, but her scratching and chewing kept us awake.  I moved the kennel to the living room, got an itching spray, bathed her with a shampoo and conditioner that was supposed to reduce dryness and itching, and also applied cream to a few areas.  Below she sits nicely in her kennel while drying in the sun. About the fourth night, she woke us up around midnight with a deep and frightening growl followed by the baying that only Hounds can do.  We later learned that our neighbor across the ravine was getting raccoons out of his garage.  We never would have heard any of that.It is like having a new baby in the house.  I had to call the shelter (since we are fostering we have to use their vet referral) when I noticed two areas of serious sores.  One under her neck and one on her backside.  I put a cream there before she walks so that she would not lick it off.  They thought it might be the kibble they gave us which was something new to her.  She also was crabby when I tried to get her to stop chewing and only offering a rawhide chew worked.They asked us to bring her up.  When they saw the issue they made an appointment with their vet for late afternoon.  Since they are 30 minutes from our house and the vet hospital is another 15 minutes from them, this meant driving back home at noon and waiting for the appointment time, and then driving the 45 minutes back up at 4:00 PM.  Bonus, she does not mind riding in a car in the kennel!  The shelter also gave a bag of new kibble that has no corn or wheat and is mostly meat.  The visit to the vet took almost two hours between waiting and diagnosis.  We now have her on steroids and then an additional monthly medication for possible mites.   She behaved well at the vet hospital and even let them stick stuff in her ears!  The vet gave us as well some spray for the sore areas AND an ear spray!  We are hoping it is not allergies as I understand that is harder to treat and determine.  If it is mites we have no clue where she got them as it is my understanding that the animal shelters are very sterile and we have no pets here.It was a very long day and when we got back and after we fed her and then after we took her out for a 15-minute walk, we put her in the kennel and went for out for our dinner!!  I was exhausted, and I still have not attempted putting in the medicine for her ears that they wanted us to do!!She will go back to the shelter before our trip at the end of February and probably forget what little training we have been able to give her.  At least this will give us a break to decide if we have the energy for this.  If she did not have the skin problem, we could certainly work with her.  Hubby has fallen in love, of course!"},

If  I  was  religious I would pray and ask God to  find a cure for  all of us on this journey. My husband's mother was living alone with this memory loss  in her early 80's and came to live with us about 4 years later.  We had  to take her to a rest home a few years after that, but mostly due to a series  of  small  strokes she had.  Her memory had diminished greatly by then, so the evidence of the strokes was mostly shown in  her  instability when trying to get around.  If I looked  forward and see that this is  where I would see my husband,  who is now full of life and enthusiasm, it can be greatly discouraging.  He has been forgetful about small things all of his life and I just tolerated that.  Now we will discuss something in the morning and he will ask me again in the afternoon about it.  He will ask about things that worry his mind again and again.I am not patient!!  I do need to work on that.  I need to meditate and read more on how to improve one's emotional state.  I have not developed the habit of following him around to see if he puts stuff away so that the new dog does not get into it.Now we may add a new grandchild who will never see the grandfather that the others saw and played with.My son  and his wife have had problems with several pregnancies before this recent one which seems to be healthy.  My daughter-in-law is in her 40's which is late for having  a child. She  also has some small heart valve problems.  This  child could be born with a number of complications, or  not  born  at all.  Why look forward? I will just live with  this hope on a day-to-day basis that they have a wonderful life.  We are ahead of the game as my husband does not and never has smoked or drank alcohol.  (I do get two bourbon and sodas or glasses of wine before dinner most nights, but do not crave more than that.)  He loves being active and getting out and about, far more than I do.  His general health is good as is his kindness, although he is very frustrated many days.Well, we got the big car loaded with the crib a few days ago before that heavy rain followed today by super cold weather!  Taking it up this morning.Our new dog which has been with us a week will have to be in a crate for the four hours we are gone.  She does not mind the crate and sleeps in it all night.  She cannot be trusted to have the run of the house yet!  We will be rushed to get back and take her on a long walk before we leave.Every day is a new foggy challenge and I am not up to it...yet."},

I may no longer die! I might just get really really sick for a week.  Boy, have I lowered my concerns.  I remember those days, although I must admit I have not had even a cold for years!  When my grandchildren were young, I would get cold after 50% of the visits. We also are preparing for a trip to San Diego at the end of the month.  This will be a grand last call for hubby.  He is losing his memory ever so slowly and giving a speech to an international crowd has him elated and nervous.  I told him to type out the whole speech, but we will see!  We will stop and visit my relatives in Colorado, whom I do not see nearly enough, on the way back! My brother, who is a few years younger, has also been diagnosed with encroaching dementia.  My brother is an extremely quiet man, so we would never have known until his car accident.  We are slowly working on accepting these issuese, and maybe in the future when I feel stronger of character, I can share.Now, since we really are not so busy (!) we have also decided to foster a foxhound mix from the local shelter with a plan to perhaps adopt permanently.  This dog has several health issues which are being treated and she also is 3 years old.  We have had only puppies so actually training a full-grown adult to live in our house will be a challenge.  She will return to the shelter when we head to San Diego and by then we will decide whether to take her back on a permanent basis.  My husband is already in love!        We are already attempting to make our home (which used to seem so much larger) more accomodating for a dog!  Everything I read about aging says to take on challenges...but I think they are supposed to be small challenges and also spread out over our limited years remaining.Please wish us luck and I am open to any advice on any of these challenges ahead.  The snow has melted from the bench, but the cushions are still wet, so please bring snow pants when you sit down to chat."},

I have lots of time on my hands, although I see February and March trying to clutter my calendar with some stuff.  I worked many years to be able to have days that I can own and fill as I choose.  I am trying to stay healthy, both physically and mentally, but I do find that both exercise and being social are challenges as I love wasting time: reading, birdwatching, blogging, taking pictures.Above is a one-thousand-piece puzzle that my husband bought years ago and which I ignored until I cleaned out a closet and found it.  I bought myself a puzzle table for a Christmas gift from me (hubby is not into buying gifts over the holidays) and I set it up in my bedroom where there is good light.  It is mostly in soothing shades of blue, as you can see, and I am working on it daily.  Usually an hour or so in the morning.  Above you can see that a few days later and I have really been 'ripping' along.  It took me most of one morning just to sort out the straight edges and sort certain colors/patterns into plastic bags!  The perfect activity for the anal-retentive.Perhaps my readers have watched the British mystery series called Wallendar, which was adapted from books written by Sweden's Henning Mankell.  Oddly this activity reminds me of  Detective Wallender's father who in great senility ended up painting almost identical tree scenes again and again.  We self-soothe in many ways. Accomplishment is very important in old age.I also just finished reading the first in a series of spy books written by Dorothy Gilman about a 50 something woman with no spy skills called Mrs. Pollifax.  I will probably not read more after this first book because, while a fun read, it just did not flow for me and was a bit old-fashioned.  Anyway, our middle-aged spy spends parts of her capture playing game after game of solitaire which helps soothe her.What do you do regularly to pass the time?  Do you ever do anything that others would consider a waste of time but which you find helpful getting you through your week, your day?"},

And 2022 has not been shy.  He/She(they?) arrived on time and semi-quietly in my neighborhood.  I arose early since I was too rude and lazy to greet it at midnight.  The neighborhood was quiet and actually not too cold. I was surprised to see roses still in bloom.  And the hellebores were forming buds just a bit early.Unknown to me 2022 had invited a jet stream of cold air just to the north waiting to collide with the warmer rainy air that we were getting.2022 could hardly wait to say \"Boom!  Gotcha!\"  The snow was fast and heavy and powerful and up to 2 inches an hour. (\"Betcha wish 2021 had stayed longer!\")My neighbors to the north got 8 inches.  We got 5.  And by mid-morning, we also lost power.  I had not bothered to fill the buckets with water.  Since we are on well water that is pumped by an electric pump, what does this mean?  Having lived many years overseas with periodic power outages, I knew and quickly put stickers on all the toilet seats.We have a wood fireplace and can keep reasonably warm, except for the fancy high ceilings which we designed into our major living space!  We have a gas range and can cook food in pots when needed.  I made soup.  We were without power for 24 hours.  A baby inconvenience from when we were out of power for almost a week due to a hurricane many years ago when we lived in the city.2022 got bored with our neighborhood and stranded hundreds of automobiles for well over 30 hours on a major highway north of us.  People were stuck in their vehicles in the cold, many without water, food, medications, and warmer clothing.  One truck was a bread truck and the owner told the driver to distribute the bread!My daughter and her family made it home from Colorado the night before the storm, so I guess 2022 was distracted and decided not to strand her for hours in that Denver airport that is so dysfunctional in so many ways.Yesterday our friend who is a local nurse called to tell us the COVID-Omecron wave had hit big in our little county and the hospitals were packed.  She insisted we stay home as much as possible as this new version was 3 times as infective even with the milder version. Yes, there is another snowstorm about half the strength on its way tonight.  My holly trees have lost their crowns in the weight and my neighbor just got a mid-sized tree off the back of her truck.  At least the sun shining on the fresh snow is beautiful.  2022 is not done with us yet as it is only(early) January.The winter is still beautiful with all its dangers."},

Therefore be at peace with God, whatever you conceive Him to be. And whatever your labors and aspirations, in the noisy confusion of life, keep peace in your soul. With all its sham, drudgery and broken dreams, it is still a beautiful world. Be cheerful. Strive to be happy.  Desiderata by Max EhrmannAnd as I venture into 2022 and I will work on my attitude."},
{"title": "Today and Long Ago Yesterday", "date": "Tuesday, December 21, 2021", "text": "Today is my birthday and I have made it to 3/4 of a century.  I certainly never thought about that, although I hoped to live a long and healthy life.  My cough has been suppressed with the medicine and I have been sleeping like a baby for months! While the new variant of COVID has us a bit concerned we are taking all the precautions and going forward a month after our last booster using masks and sanitizers. We are eating out and taking that chance, but it has been such a long pandemic season.    We headed up to Lancaster, PA last week to shop for a canoe as a Christmas/Birthday gift for our son.  He has been trying to save up for one and both families decided to help him out.  The canoe inventory in our area, including several nearby cities, was very sparse.  The largest inventory we found was way up in a tiny community in Lancaster.  We were surprised at how hard it was to pick a size, model, brand, etc. once we got there.  But we got him a nice canoe, did some Christmas gift buying in the Amish market and stores, and ate at a fancy restaurant owned by a former White House Chef who served under both Bushes and Clinton.  The food was very good, if not the exotic or excellence I was expecting.  The restaurant was designed like an Inn and that coziness along with the Christmas decorations and some wonderful holiday cocktails made it something we had not had the chance to experience since we are out in the rural area of our state. This area has lots of churches of various denominations with some historic cemeteries.  This one below has some connections to William Penn, a member of the Quakers who emigrated from England and was the founder of the province (now a state) of Pennsylvania.  Penn first called the area \"New Wales\", then \"Sylvania\" (Latin for \"forests\" or \"woods\"), which King Charles II changed to \"Pennsylvania\" in honor of the elder Penn.        This area is also the heart of an Amish religious sect.  The Amish had split from the Swiss and Alsatian Mennonite Anabaptists in 1693 in Switzerland.  They are very conservative and avoid modern technologies as much as possible. My husband has been involved in business with our Amish down here and the man is very difficult to reach as he has no phone and has to walk a mile to another farm to use theirs...which seems to me odd.  Either use technology or not. They do not like to have their photos taken and this one was a snap from our car as we drove down the road.  They go about by carriage.        There are vast farms with little on no electricity.  We found a number of great places to get ice cream made from their dairy farms.  They still grow tobacco for their personal use and hang it to dry in tobacco barns like they did hundreds of years ago.  Yet I saw some pretty fancy and expensive farm equipment being driven by Amish farmers.        The only bakery we have where I live here is that found in the large supermarkets.  They are good but not outstanding like the European bakeries.  We enjoyed window shopping at the local bakeries.  Below is an Amish bakery and we did buy just a half dozen pastries, although everything was so tempting.        The brief vacation was a nice respite from our hungered-down lifestyle.  It was just a bit disconcerting to see how many fractious factions of Christianity evolved over time, especially of note during the holy day season.  It reminded me once again that Jesus was not a Christian."},

The entire harvest arrives in less than two weeks and if we are efficient we can get to them before the raccoons.  They cannot be eaten until fully ripe as they are very astringent when firm.  So we harvest and let them sit out until they are quite soft to the touch and almost translucent in appearance.  The tree itself has showy fall color.            Once they are as soft as a firm pudding I can puree them for recipes.        ...such as persimmon cookies.  Some for the freezer and others for the cookies jar.  I now have too much puree.  I am going to try adding them to pre-packaged lemon and orange cake mixes as an experiment.  I have brought my citrus trees inside to the tiny corner of my kitchen and they have gone crazy with both blossoms and fruit at the same time!  Below are my kaffir lime tree and my Meyer lemon tree.  The harvested kaffir are the size of golf balls.

I knew she was going to come dressed as if setting out for a trip to shop in the city or looking like she was going on a country fox hunt without the riding boots. I pulled over my roomy black chenille top which fit me like a box cover.  It was large and warm and could be used for exercise later in the day if I could talk myself into that.  I was not going to dress up for a neighbor visit! As I passed out through the bathroom I glanced at the large mirror over my sink and admitted I needed to at least apply a little make-up and brush my crazy, wild, gray hair.  My eyebrows have gone pale gray, and as a result, I have a little expression on my face if I don't draw them in with a dark charcoal brush.  Martha's haircut is that perfect trim that matches those who have been on television...which, of course, she had in years past.  My hair is cut into a shag-pixie something or other.  It doesn't hurt that Martha has the facial bone structure of a blueblood and has that delicate beauty that some women are able to hang on to when they age.  Like me, she is pushing 80.It took her over an hour to arrive and I filled the nervous time straightening the living room and moving the folded clothes to the bedroom.  I was still barefoot and put on some winter socks.  This is the first time she will actually be in the house as COVID has prevented us from really welcoming her to our home and also the neighborhood.  If you remember she bought the mansion across the ravine.She finally arrives in slim gray pants and one of those down jackets in a baby pink that matches her lipstick and some large disk earrings.  She apologizes as she had received a call from the local museum and its concern about the depletion of their reserve accounts due to COVID and since she was on the board, she had to respond.  I have never been on a board, and I have never been asked but it makes me think of bored.Hubby jabbers as he often does around charming people, but finally, I get her to move through the living room down to the dock.  She studies how hubby has tied the ropes to the pilings and then tied the outdoor holiday lights to the rope.  We got a reindeer on discount (still expensive) at the hardware store and plugged it in at the end of the rope.  It needs a bow and/or a red nose!

Oh, the food.  Don't forget about the food.Maybe you are in the sunshine near a beach or maybe you are documenting the first heavy snowfall of the year.  One hundred years ago people had to wait maybe a week to read the adventures of someone they knew.  While personal Post Office Boxes were finally more common, it still was an adventure getting mail.  Catalogs were something that many looked forward to reading over the holiday season for gift ideas.  I don't know about you, but I throw away a half dozen each day!Anyway, I do not blog on a regular schedule.  I do not deliver text predictably.  I may be a little busier on Facebook with people that I personally know, but my bloggers are like penpals.  I have met very few of you.  You do not want or need to read every detail of my life.  Yet, we read each other like some serial novel.I am back home after a week away.  My mailbox was stuffed, my fridge (A new one) was empty and I was comfortably tired.  The schedule worked out such that I saw both sets of my children's in-laws (at different times in different homes).  I am so lucky that my children married into nice and tolerable families.  Yes, they are both Republicans, but they both are embarrassed by Trump and even voted liberal in the most recent election.  They do not think vaccines are a statement of belief but a scientific tool to keep themselves and those they love healthy.  (No, we did NOT talk politics.)  They believe that our tax money is wasted on social programs...but the disagreement with us is more a statement of method rather than philosophy.We spent Thanksgiving in my son and his wife's tiny house.  She is a memory hoarder and has way too much '\"stuff\" on shelves and in cupboards and stacked in boxes.  They have a nice yard to expand the house but do not have the money right now to do so.  The meal was ordered in and it was not great.  The turkey was dry and we messed up on the heating.  The homemade sweet potatoes and mashed potatoes were delicious.  The green beans and other vegetables were ok.  The pies came from a local bakery and were very good.  We four sat around a tiny table.I tried to help in the tiny kitchen and it worked, barely.  My DIL seemed distracted.  They had asked that we stay through the day after TG to welcome her parents that made a five-hour drive down.  We agreed as we had not seen them in some long time!  The six of us ate a pizza lunch together and then son and DIL said they wanted a photo of all of us on the couch.  No problem.  Son spent some time setting up the camera.  He kept changing the timing...or something but finally sat down and joined us for some still shots.  Then he said he wanted a video of us all??!  We agreed and joined on the couch again while he and his wife counted out 1-2-3.  I thought they were going to shout Happy Thanksgiving, but instead, they shouted out \"We're having a baby!\"  All of the parents were shocked and weeping and so happy.  This couple has had a difficult marriage.  Without going into lots of details, my son had some serious medical issues and the marriage was very strained.  But they both were strong and overcame those issues and now, while they spent two years using fertility treatments and trying so hard to have a child and being disappointed each time...they are now blessed.So this Thanksgiving was very special for all of us!  Yes, the fetus is only 3 months old, but we are so hopeful."},
{"title": "I Have Not Dropped a Ball, Yet", "date": "Wednesday, November 24, 2021", "text": "It is a very quiet morning at my daughter's house the day before TG.  Daughter  and husband are overseas enjoying beaches and pools and sun.  The three grands are sleeping in, enjoying the fact that they have no school today.  We got each of them set the last two mornings to their three different schools with three different times, each 30 minutes apart!  The dog was picked up last night by the dog sitter to be watched while we leave for my son's house today and the other set of grandparents arrive to take the TG shift.  I think that they will spend one night here, so I  will get the guest room sheets changed, once hubby is up and about. Then they drive them  up to cousins' for TG and somehow or other they get back to the parents that fly in on Sunday.  I am  glad  I  do not have to worry about that airport connection. When they left last weekend, my daughter forgot her phone and hubby had to rushed out to the airport before  their flight!  Fortunately, they were there 2 hours early and the phone drop off went smoothly. We  did some dog walking over the week and an actual trip to a Mall for lunch and that has exhausted us a bit also with all the scheduling to follow. Now that school is out and the dog is gone, this morning is pretty peaceful.  We did miss the little dog sleeping at our feet last night.  He totally adopts me when I come to visit and follows me everywhere. We also took in a Smithsonian exhibit yesterday while the grands were in school and I will post on that interesting activity in another post when we get home on Friday.  We are staying Friday morning to greet my daugther-in-law's parents and then changing the sheets once again in this other guest bedroom so that they can have the weekend (birthday for DIL) at her house.  Both of these houses have only one 'small' guest bedroom, so it does require shuffling.My daughter has a Nespresso machine and I had my coffee from that two mornings.  I do not really like all the foam and glad I could try it here, because my single coffee maker is broken and needs to be replaced and I might have shelled out the money for that expensive unit and then been so disappointed.  The foam is supposed to enhance the taste but it was too cloying for me.  I will continue to see what machine I might like when I go home.    My daughter-in-law has ordered the pre-cooked TG dinner from the store and thus we both should feel free  to just put on calories...definitely going to exercise when I get back home (she writes with the best of intentions).    I have found the week exhausting, emotional, and wonderful.  I was able to really get to observe the grands  in their environment instead of  always running out the door. My SIL and daughter have done a very good job of raising smart, polite and easy-going children.  They get along wonderfully and no temper tantrums even  those  the eldest was taking the \"fake\" SAT via computer while  we  were here.    I will sort the  few photos I have taken when I get home and maybe post  on some other things. This laptop  is a bear to type on!!  Looking forward  to being at my desk with my computer  again.    Have a wonderful rest of the week, whether you celebrate eating bountiful food or not.   Stay away from the  news...it must get better soon."},

Our lives are spent mostly close to home, although we will be taking our first airplane flight in a long time at the end of this coming February. This past weekend we spent a 5-hour drive north to Rochester Institute of Technology.  I am not enrolling in graduate school, but  that  is not because I would not want to.  As much as I was intimidated by college, coming from a poor family in a small farming community, I still loved all the information that was revealed in my struggle to get my Bachelor's in education at the state college.Grandson #1 will be applying to colleges next year.  He comes from a wealthy family (the ones who will be taxed in Biden's new bill) and he has a tutor already to help him with SATs!  I love this child and want him to have every opportunity, but I also am sad for those poorer children with talent and passion who do not have access to such tools. He is looking into IT work on gaming.  I keep trying to pressure him to look at gaming that would help in the health care industry or the education industry rather than the kind that just makes money.  I try.It was a five-hour drive, and overnight in a hotel, and due to COVID we were not able to take the student tour.  Only one parent in the labs, library, classes, etc.  The daughter sent us videos of their tours while we toured outside the campus.  It was cold and a bit rainy and even sleeting by mid-day.The campus has some nice wooded trails.  It is fairly new...maybe 15-20 years old.  I found joy in being around the few young people on campus.  It was a Saturday, so most were hunkered down, but we saw a few joggers and walkers.We ate lunch in downtown Rochester at some 'favorite\" hot dog place that was wooden tables, metal chairs, and cheap food.  It was meh...but I am not a hotdog fan.The trip was a stretch, but I am glad we went along.  My days to enjoy stuff like this are numbered.  We are packing today to head up to our schedule of supervising the Grands while they are in school and then turning them over Wednesday to the other set of Grandparents who will drive them up North for Thanksgiving.  My daughter printed out three pages of the schedule...who has to be where...what there is to eat...when the dog is being picked up by the sitter...etc.I am revving my engines."},
{"title": "More on the Saga of TG", "date": "Tuesday, November 09, 2021", "text": "I realize that most of you do not need to read about family dramas over the holidays.  Who wants to hear about families juggling holidays? I told my children, each after they were married, that they did not have to feel obligated to come to my house over major holidays.  They could celebrate as they wished and where they wished as long as they saw us sometime during those months.This post is to clarify these events based on what has followed, and see that I have had good times as well as stressful ones.My daughter said after her second child (of eventually three) was born that she wanted to celebrate Christmas at her house so that she could start her own traditions.  I think she has done this most Christmases and we drive up there for the day (or sometimes the night before) to enjoy the day with them.  Sometimes the other set of parents joins us.She as well as my son and his wife usually try to alternate TG between us and their respective in-laws.  Below is our Hawaii Thanksgiving a few years ago, which was certainly special.Unfortunately, as the years have passed, we have been lax in trying to find who was doing what and slower in inviting them down here.  My daughter, as I have written before, leads an EXTREMELY busy life with her job and three children and I have reduced my efforts to fit into such a hectic schedule.ANYWAY, my Son-in Law's mother, Lili (not her name), called me on Sunday to talk about our roles in this crazy scenario.  It was too late for me to answer as my entire weekend had been filled with a painter working on two bathrooms and the ceiling to the master bedroom.  Stuff was moved everywhere and while he did an excellent job of clean-up and moving furniture back in place, I still had lots of things to move into the bathrooms and from the hallway.  So I called her back the next morning.First, let me say that Lili is a delightful person.  She is the kind of person that would literally give her purse to you if you were in need.  She is generous to her two sons but admitted that both of them drop the ball on trying to get schedule details worked out with their parents.  An additional challenge for her is that her husband has a type of disease that is related to Parkinson's and while he can still drive she knows that the days are getting fewer for driving in traffic.  So she asked her son if perhaps they could just drive down the day before TG, spend the end of the week (including TG) watching the Grands, and then drive up the Sunday for the long trip back to their house.  Her son said that the children were really looking forward to spending  TG with their cousins!  So, she sighed, then came up with a new plan. (I will not go into the details of sacrifices she making for this 'new' plan.)  She will meet us at the Grand's house the day before TG (we will not have to drive up and exchange them).  Then they will rest that night and drive back home on Thanksgiving day!  Which should be less traffic(?) plus give them time to rest up from the almost 4-hour drive the day before.  They would make it to her other son's house late in the afternoon on TG. We would leave that morning before TG to head to our house.I was amenable to whatever worked for her.  I would have said let us do TG at the kids' house, but she had said that her son wanted the kids to be together with their cousins up North.  (Remember, he and my daughter will be on the other side of the world that week.)It takes the pressure off of us somewhat.  We return home earlier the day before TG.  Now I just have to get my daughter-in-law and son to let me know if they have decided how they want to do TG...with us and her parents at her house...or with us and her parents at our house...or maybe her parents do not want to drive the five-hour drive from their house at all!!  They live way \"up north\" as well.Whatever happens, I am for ordering a complete TG dinner from one of the stores!!  The food is good and there are always leftovers and it allows any foodie to bring their favorite dish.  Yes, it costs a little more.  I just have to know for how many...2 or 4 or 6??Tomorrow I am getting my old noisy fridge replaced and so everything gets emptied early tomorrow morning to be ready for delivery.  Then, this weekend I am off to Rochester University to attend a college preview with my oldest grandson and his mother.  They have a good Technical college that has him interested.  We will leave Friday and be back late Sunday.  I guess I just need to cram more stuff into my life."},
{"title": "Let Me Know What You Think", "date": "Friday, November 05, 2021", "text": "I have  been organizing for the holidays..or trying to.  Way back in May of this year...YES,May(!) my son-in-law asked me if I could help him  over the Thanksgiving Holidays.  He said he had received a rather large bonus and wanted to take his lovely wife (my daughter) away to the Maldives on a week-long vacation.  He said his parents (who are somewhat elderly) would be taking care of the kids that week and could I offer to help over  the TG holidays. Last week I contacted the parents for details and I guess I totally misunderstood, because I offered to cook or bring stuff up the city, etc.  His Mother said that they were not having TG in the city but with her other son up towards NY state.  The help they needed was to drive the grands two hours close to them on the  day before TG and we would drop them off at some mid-point for a grand child exchange.  My son-in-law then later explained that the help they needed was the days before the holidays.  The weekend before TG and the Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of TG week when the children would be in school and needed an adult at home.  They wanted us to spend the night up at their house those days.So...this means we need  to  plan on driving upstate and dropping the kids off the late afternoon or early evening of the day before TG for the exchange.  Then we can go back home that night,  a 4 hour drive or go back to  my daughter's house and spend the night before TG and drive home  the morning of TG, a 1.5 hour drive.  I am thinking I will not be  planning much of a TG dinner when I get home around 10:00 that morning.Is is just me?"},
{"title": "Cleaning, Nevermore", "date": "Friday, October 29, 2021", "text": "As I posted oh so long ago, I was finally going to hire a cleaning service.   I am in my 70s and I have never had a housecleaner, except for the two years we lived in Indonesia where you were expected to hire a cook, a laundress, and a night watchman (who actually slept at night and played with my 3-year-old son in the daytime).Anyway, I was not used to having someone clean.  My younger sister lives in a big house in Denver and has had a cleaning service forever. She always said they never clean as well as you want.  Since her house is huge she looks upon it as a necessary evil.  My daughter, who has three children, a demanding job, and a nice little house, has two cleaning ladies that also make the beds and do her laundry!  She also said that they tend to cut corners and not clean stuff as they should.  So I lowered my expectations.When I started the service the first time they sent two women who washed window sills, washed doors, and did a major cleaning...sort of.  Then the service goes to one cleaner who comes weekly or bi-weekly or monthly.  They actually thought my house was so clean with the two of us that we only needed a monthly clean!  I went with the bi-weekly schedule anyway.  After two months of bi-weekly cleaning from a sweet young woman, I realize that they miss stuff.  The recessed area below my kitchen cabinets in my kitchen is full of spider webs and dust and in one corner is a dead wasp.  I will finally point that out to her.  No one cares about the cleanliness of your house as much as you do!  I did a quick test in the third week.  She mops my floors each time and a day after she left I spilled a glass of water. I got my Swiffer mop to clean it and this is what I saw from a floor that had been mopped only the day before!  AND I had watched her mop.Each time she comes I find some little cleaning area that needs more attention and it does not add to her four hours.  This service is expensive, but oddly I feel I am helping this young woman keep a job, perhaps influenced by a mini-series I watched on TV?Netflix had/has a TV series \"Maid\" that I watched last month.  The TV series is based on a book by Stephanie Land and has Andie McDowell as a bi-polar mother and Andie MacDowell's real daughter plays her daughter who is a maid.  It is well done and really reflects the chaotic lives of some people.  It is about a young woman with a small child who flees her husband's alcoholic violence and goes to a shelter and also finds a job with a company called Value Maids where she cleans various clients' houses...which of course, adds to the story.My 'maid' Meghan is a young divorcee with a 4-year-old. She has backup in babysitting from her mother, but I think the mother also has a job. (The child had strep throat and although she is now well and no longer infectious she has a chronic cough that will diminish in time, because of COVID they must keep her home from pre-school until the cough is gone!)Meghan is a quiet and gentle girl who goes about her cleaning with iPods in her ears listening to music so we do not talk much.  Sometimes I hear her humming which reminds me of my Dad who used to whistle while he worked.  Of course, I want to direct her to podcasts that will educate her and enlighten her, but I will mind my own business.  I did give her some children's magazines that my children have left behind and she was pleased to take them.I have mellowed on my cleaning expectations in my old age.  I used to be one of those that polished and shined every piece of furniture.Anyway, the title of this post reminded me of the coming Halloween and I will link to a nice little favorite poem of mine which is perfect for this time of year.Have a great Halloween!"},

I struggled but I continued! During this time, I met a world-famous orchid breeder who lives in my state but handles millions of orchids in a venue in Central America.  She lives on 40 acres and has her own laboratory.I met an elder ecologist who talked about all the data he had taken on his little part of a larger river over the last decade or so which clearly showed water rising and temperature changes in a very dramatic and terrible way over each year. An old high school friend of my husband sailed down from Connecticut with his wife on his \"yacht\" and took us out to dinner.  He is (was) a nationally well-known heart surgeon who developed a unique procedure to save lives and make himself a fortune.  He and his wife were very friendly and you would never know this about them.  This was a nice reunion for my hubby. Me?  I felt somewhat small in all this prestigious company being just a retired librarian/educator with no national or international profile.  But I did enjoy all the conversation!

He has received a probable medical diagnosis that we sadly anticipated.  We will shoulder on until the specialist appointment which can only happen a month from now confirms our path ahead.  My medical diagnosis for the idiopathic cough is still that and my specialist appointment with another doctor is in early December!  Don't you love the American health care system?  My cough is retreating as the medicine I am taking is increasing in dose.  I HATE pharmaceuticals...but I accept their necessity and ignore the side effects.Anyway, we both said \"screw it\" and loaded the canoe onto the big car, and headed to the Eastern shore for four days of meditative walking and canoeing.  We are so lucky to still be agile.  The weather was super cooperative and even a little too warm in the sunny afternoons.  So we stretched our muscles.We crossed the big bridge and saw barges full of stuff we have ordered sitting in the center of the water highway waiting for a pilot or a go-ahead.  Your order will arrive a little late today.  There were plenty of recreational boaters zipping along as well.We crossed several small bridges in our exploration.  Bridges that have recognition in this low land part of the world and are so important to those that live here.What we were looking for were peace and no agenda.  What a lovely time.  What perfect cooperation from Mother Nature. What a great distraction.This is the land of hard-working people.  People who have rarely found change a good thing.  They want to be left alone.  They rise early in the mornings to work the water or tend to their small crops or get ready for church.  The water is rising but they do not believe in climate change.  Their savior was Trump and they are angry he was not re-elected even though he gave them nothing the last four years.And plunked right in the middle of this wild country is a more liberal treasure of history.  It is a beautiful small museum with lots of interesting facts about this marvelous leader who single-handedly saved over 70 individuals from a treacherous life.  We did not follow the path of the \"Underground Railroad\"  by automobile but did explore this museum slowly and with interest.My next post I will take you on a canoe trip to where the wild things are."},

I did enjoy sleeping through the night and feeling free to go anywhere and talk to anyone.  New meds may be reducing the cough, but since this started back in January 2020 and I have been on a multi-pack of various meds I am not keeping my hopes too high regarding this new regimen.  Well enough of that!Fall is here.  I saw it coming in the angle of the morning light and then the day after Ida passed (and thankfully missed us) the weather turned to cool and dryer mornings.  Mid-day can get quite warm, but it sure feels like autumn.The delicate skirts of Ida.Above is our Verbena (Black Haw) with the flowers all gone and seed for the birds beginning to ripen. Soon they will turn dark bluish and the leaves will be the color of wine.           I have reached the age where I think often of the passage of time, my connections with others, my growing irrelevance, and how hard I have to work to stay healthy.  While my husband's allergy to mammal meat is on the wane, we still eat mostly fish and fowl.  We have tons of vegetables from the garden and fruit is readily (if not cheaply) available in the store.  Hubby has been told to cut back on sweets (originally by me) but now by the blood data.  I love dessert but can get by with a small piece after meals.  Hubby thinks that pies should be cut into quarters!Salmon with mustard sauce on arugula.Kaffir lime leaves from our tree for soups.  We even took a large bag to the local Thai restaurant.A few kaffir limes from the tree after pruning.  Perfect for our seafood.So many tomatoes that I now broil them! (Sorry for the blur.)I also try to keep up a small bit of exercise with free weights and my elliptical work, about three times a week.  I should up it, but it is sooooo boring.I do miss making a contribution to something or other.  While I do some volunteer work with master gardeners, it is on my own at home, and due to both COVID and my cough, I have little contact with others.  I see my grandkids and my children maybe once every other month.  Their lives are super busy, as they should be.  I might like to work with elementary school children, once everyone is vaccinated...if I am still living then!My next post will be a perspective on being the recipient of a clean house, rather than cleaning it myself."},

Some of them are run by Native Nazis, but most are monitored by people who just want to spread environmental knowledge.One woman had started a native planting under her mailbox.  She was proud of the plants coming up even though it was sparse.  While she was gone one day, her neighbor mowed the area and mowed all the plants down!  She went to him and was pretty angry and so was he.My first reaction was that this was just a kind gesture by the neighbor and that he accidentally mowed down what he thought were weeds while doing a neighborly gesture.  I suggested that she try and calm the waters (you don't want a war with someone next door) and tell him about the virtues of natives and offer to help him plant some.  If he was still angry, then avoid him.Everyone else on the list said that he was an idiot, deserved what she did, and even some said she should call the police for trespassing.  ( I am sure the police have plenty to do with 50 gun deaths alone in the U.S. over the 4th of July weekend.)A few were wise in telling her to put around some boulders for a border edging or a small fence and also a sign telling people what they were.I guess my question to my readers is am I a pansy?  Was my advice wrong?  Can't we all just get along?"},

Exhausted from the trip and proud of myself for actually taking it during the \"wane\" of the pandemic.  YES...that must have been a kangaroo and not a rabbit, and I am thankful for discerning readers.  It was hot and I was tired and when I visited the flower show website I was sad to see that while we visited most of the campus, we missed a bunch of stuff!  Oh well.Still wearing masks here, although most of the stores now have signs that say if you are vaccinated, the mask-wearing is optional.  I wear them much of the time, but this heat does make me less careful.  Also WHO said even vaccinated people should wear masks and distance with the new DELTA variant running rampant across the globe.  I am reading \"The Premonition, a Pandemic Story\" by Michael Lewis.  It certainly tells the story of how hard researchers work and how stupid the government bureaucratic process is.  Brought back memories of incidents that I encountered when working as a Fed.  Of course,  my work did not impact lives to any extent.  Our Center for Disease Control is sadly crippled.My cough has returned...ever so slightly.  I have been monitoring it for a week and going back on the proton pump inhibitor (which sounds like a mechanical device, right?).  I will email my specialist who is an hour's drive away and see what is going on and what we do from here.I finally contracted with a cleaning service this week.  I helped my mother clean her house starting at 10-years-old and except for the 2 years in Indonesia where I had a maid, cook, and night watchman, I have been the cleaner of my various abodes for decades.  I am just tired of vacuuming, mopping, and dusting an almost 3,000 square foot house, and I have let great corners get covered in spider webs and dust.  It is a VERY expensive service and the lady said that I could change my bi-weekly schedule to a monthly schedule down the road if I felt it was overkill with just two old folks living in the house.  I will also have to adjust to having a stranger poke through my nooks and crannies, although they did say they try to send the same person each time.  My garden is blooming in all its glory just before the oven days start.  I will post photos on my other blog.  Grandkids arrived for just a few hours on Sunday squeezing in their precious limited free time to visit us!  I am so blest!  Hope your weekend is cool, comfortable, and full of love."},

I am not a big boating person, but hubby is and so for this week I said we should take the boat out and spend the day on the water.  He seemed thrilled.  He had only been out a few times weeks ago and on his own.  Well, I packed two small coolers with cold chicken, crackers and cheese, fresh fruit and carrot sticks and cold drinks.  We made two trips to the dock to bring everything down.  Then when Hubby tried to start the boat, the batteries were dead.  He has a small solar panel attached to the batteries since we only use the boat about 8 times a year.  Well the wires seem to have been loose and now Hubby is down at the dock trying to see if he can get a charge going and then run the boat in place and maybe we can go out tomorrow.  I am hoping this calm spring-like weather holds! So now photos of the more unique items at the Philadelphia Flower Show for those who asked.          Above can you see the hummingbird on the left?        Above a hammock made of succulents.  This one had me intrigued and I was wondering if I could do something similar.

{"title": "It Wasn't Bad Karma, Just Bad Luck", "date": "Friday, June 11, 2021", "text": "This past week we took three days off from our routines and decided to head away to the Philadelphia Flower Show.  I had not gone for almost a decade and decided it would be a nice change to face the crowds as COVID is waning in our area.  They usually have the event inside the Convention Center.  Due to COVID they scheduled it outside in FDR Park and issued timed-entry tickets.Our entry was for 2:00 PM and since we live three hours away and planned on spending two overnights we thought leaving at 8:30 in the morning would give us plenty of time for checking into the hotel and then \"UBERring\" out to the park.I was using our car's Garmin map tool.  I soon discovered this was NOT a good thing because as we left the visitor center off the highway for our mid-trip break after almost 2 hours,  we encountered LOTS of traffic moving slowly and soon coming to a complete stop.  I switched to the WAZE APP on my phone and saw that there were two areas ahead with accidents.  We sat in our car nestled between huge trucks and vans and little hybrids for two and a half hours!  I have a hybrid car, so not a great loss of fuel or increase in pollution. Had I been on WAZE before I might have avoided the mess as WAZE lets you know of highway incidents ahead of the encounter as well as so much other stuff.We finally exited an area as we crawled forward and went miles east then miles north then doubling back miles west to finally make it to downtown Philadelphia.We proceeded to check in but our challenges were not over.  We had to keep up deep breathing and calming exercises as the hotel had trouble with our credit card.  We had to change credit cards but finally made it to our room!The hotel was right downtown near the convention center, but the Flower Show was out of town due to COVID.  I called an UBER.  I waited...and waited.. until finally one showed up and asked us to meet at some point TWO BLOCKS away!  I said no and he canceled.  A second UBER was a little better.  We jumped into the car and told him where we wanted to go and he said he thought the Flower Show had been canceled!  He said he would take us to the entry and low and behold they had been canceled due to the dangerous afternoon weather!Thus we UBERed back to the hotel and by then we were only an hour or so from dinner so made reservations at one of the many Chinese restaurants in the city.  The next UBUR driver had to drop us off a half block away due to street work.  I used my phone in the steady rain dropping on a blurry screen; we walked past the restaurant TWICE before we asked someone where it was.  The restaurant sign was one of those super modern fonts and very difficult to read unless you were directly in front and looked up!  (I am sure someone has captured the old folks arguing and walking back and forth while staring at their phone screens.)The dinner was delicious and we actually were able to get an UBER back to the hotel.  I called the Flower Show Service that evening and they said we could come in any time and any day throughout the week before the show closed!  Our pre-paid lunch was also still available.   Things were looking up. The next day, at least the weather was somewhat kinder.  We failed to get an UBER again and instead called a CAB that was friendly and efficient and dropped us off exactly at the Flower Show entrance.  The day was hot, 92F, but no rain.  The event was somewhat interesting and a bit crowded because those that had booked the day before came this day.  Maybe I will share photos.  Maybe I have become a bit jaded about these events.As the day came to an end, I tried once again to get an UBER back to our hotel in the late afternoon.  The UBER pick-up suggestion could not be found by our eyes and when we asked a local they explained that the name given was an OLD name for the corner and the new name was the metro name.  I texted the UBER back and told him we would be at the bus stop on that corner.  We waited and waited.  Then when he arrived we were so busy looking down the street that we did not see him pull in.  FINALLY, we connected!  What a nightmare!  All of our UBER drivers were polite and useful if somewhat less knowledgeable about the city than we were --- see below)Since it was pouring rain as we reached the hotel we decided to eat dinner in the restaurant connected to the hotel.  Hubby thought it would be a mediocre venue, but it was delicious food.  I like whiskeys and bourbons and they had a huge selection of pre-dinner cocktails.  Only three tables out of at least 20 were filled and so it was also quiet with excellent service.  The other two tables that had customers had middle-aged men in nice suits eating with sexily dressed women who were clearly younger. Their meet-ups were certainly a date as the behavior of the women was very flirtatious.  (OK maybe it wasn't a date, maybe it was something else since one of the women had her dress slit up to her crotch and was wearing only a band of some stretchy fabric around her top.)  I get to cities only rarely these days and I am not going to evaluate a restaurant on its customers, but on its service, food and beverages.  After the trip we had, I was working on being mellow.We still enjoyed ourselves talking to our waiter who was from Belarus.  He had lived an interesting life and his immigration to the U.S. was also interesting. He had been a protestor against the government and was forced to leave.  So sad. For those of you who, like me, have trouble keeping up, \"Belarus is the thirteenth-largest and the twentieth-most populous country in Europe.\"  Go to this link for a clue how it has changed (‘It’s All Ruined’: Young Woman Caught Up in Belarus Clampdown - The New York Times (nytimes.com)Our trip was somewhat of an international tour as we took time to get to know all the people we encountered.  Note below:Uber Drivers:Nigerian,  Baptist preacherPakistani man Cab Driver:Mexico. 7th-day Adventist who came via his churchWaiter:Man from BelarusLady from EgyptWe purchased some nice green tea at the Flower Show:The saleslady was from Taiwan and her husband from France!The U. S. is becoming so much of a melting pot these days.I guess my advice is to always stay as mellow as possible unless it is life or death."},

I  woke up to go to the bathroom and then felt too rested to fall back asleep and headed to the living room to read a light silly romance that had been a break from my usual historical or biographical or environmental books.   I was near the end and perhaps could finish before sunrise. A light caught my eye through the  French doors, and at first, I thought it was some new ugly spotlight from a neighbor's dock across the way.  Some of my neighbors are so fearful and perhaps a bit superstitious since they seem to think the light will chase away anything nefarious from their empty weekend getaways.  Yet, as I focused more carefully,  I  saw the glow was high in the trees and not a light but a soft vanilla moon smiling down at me.  A perfect spring night and sailing slowly across the Western sky with the black silhouette of new green leaves gently dancing in the front at the edges.  It was a celestial prom night, perhaps.I felt that I had been blessed with such a lovely gift.  It was as if an old friend was smiling at me from a distance reassuring me that everything was in its place 'once again and for a while ' where it was supposed to be, pushing away my usual misgivings.  The shining circle seemed to gently grow as it moved closer to the horizon.  I would have missed the light show if I had stayed in bed.  I stepped outside, barefoot and camera in hand, without a tripod and impatient to try to capture the moment.  A bird was singing a single intermittent note as if to call forth the sun.   No mosquitoes, but the very tiny biting flies would soon find my warm breath, so a stolen photo would have to suffice.  The second photo below was on a calmer night with a steadier hand and was much earlier in the month when the moon was just an infant.Of course, the news told me later that this full moon was the Flower moon and would be eclipsed for those on the West Coast in just a few hours.  But no dance show for me.  My orbed friend was too shy."},

My daughter planned a \"glamping\" trip over the weekend as a Mother's Day event.  The trip included sleeping in fancy Teepees that had electricity and indoor plumbing and spending the day doing things like kayak/canoeing, bicycle riding, and rope climbing.  I participated in the first two but have outgrown ziplining and tree climbing!  (In retrospect I think the trip was to keep the rest of her family happy while pretending it was a Mother's Day event. Also, it was her Mother's Day of course.)    We all are vaccinated or in the case of my daughter's family recovered from COVID and they are soon to get their shots.  Most of it was outdoors and masking was only when they were in groups of others.My son and his wife joined us as well, but even they had trouble keeping up.Below a montage of memories from the event and wishing those of you who have children, a belated Happy Mother's Day and perhaps, one that was very simple where they just took you out to dinner."},

I come up with wonderful subjects that can lend themselves to concise or elaborate text.  Ideas that are meaningful and compelling. Subjects that are interesting or intriguing or just friendly and familiar.  When I wake up in the morning my ideas have all pixelated into the disjointed fog just like those photos that are enlarged all out of proportion to their original digital information.Since my fifteen-month illness disappeared faster than this spring's tulips, I have felt more creative and energetic.  But I find these are just feelings and not something that is manifested into concrete production and activity.  I am back working on my free weights and my running on the elliptical, but there are many days that I can find excuses to put this off until the following day.  Excuses like the exercise clothes I have really should be washed, I must wait to digest my recent meal (which becomes an excuse to wait until just before the next meal), or finally, I have to clean out the inbox of my emails.  My creativity is there for this blog, but when strained through the clean light of morning,  it also comes out flat and must be put off until after the news, after the gardening, after cooking.  Excuses.Most of my readers are my age...old.  Their lives do not stand still as they move forward with the challenges of aging.  I go to their blogs and find I have missed a crisis or two or even three!  I feel guilty for sitting on my thumbs when the real world is still turning.Perhaps I should write about the new fellow that has moved in quite comfortably under the deck.Yet, I do believe that the real world is once again getting back to order and people are once again moving at a quicker pace.  There is a large group of people in my country who are on a hate fest and who will not be happy until they 'win' whatever it is they think they are pursuing.  But the larger group of people just want normal and courteous discourse and freedom to love the nature of the world once again.  I think they would even be willing to read a boring blog or two to inject normalcy back into their lives.I will write soon about the goose saga.  With encouraging and discouraging photos, because us old ladies have not much else in our lives but birds.My coffee is now cold, so I am off to read your blogs and hopefully to comment!"},

They hate what it did to this country, to this world, and to many aspects of their own lives and the lives of loved ones.But its brutal winnowing of their social obligations and commitments beyond the home? They actually didn’t mind this, at least not so much. Their movements had grown hectic and their schedules overstuffed.The way in which shuttered schools, canceled extracurricular activities, and closed offices compelled them and their children to spend more time together? There was stress in this, often proportional to a home’s square footage, but there was also intimacy. They liked how many nights everyone ate dinner together.The halt to commuting? That was all upside and, along with the cessation of business travel, it produced a revelation: In-person meetings and the logistics that went into them weren’t as necessary as everyone thought. There were cheaper and easier alternatives.\"I know the above is true with the attitudes of my two adult children and their families.  Americans live a rushed and career-oriented life.  We are often amazed that Europeans do not care so much about their jobs and are not afraid to take long vacations.  Maybe this pandemic will reset our Puritan work ethic problem!"},
{"title": "Guinea  Pigs Are We ALL?", "date": "Sunday, March 14, 2021", "text": "This is a health post, and if you are not into that after this horrendous year, I will understand and you can move on.I think with medical care some of us think Doctors are marvelous geniuses and inciteful and caring.  Afterall, we have seem them risking their lives for the past year saving lives in a pandemic.Yet, our local physicians which run a private office within small practices are pretty much normal people, some with exceptional skills and others counting down  the days until they can retire, with most of them in a  mediocre middle.  Within a rural community this is even more so.I have written about this dibilitating cough that I started to get over a year ago.  It is the kind of dry cough that cannot be muffled and sometimes ends with a gag or at other times a raging sneezing fit and other times weeping eyes.  Because I am home 99% of the time, I have not had to leave a room or face embarassment.  It  would occur even in the evenings when I was sleeping.  Some nights I was awakened every two hours.  It has been a year since I have had more than 4 hours of continued sleep.  My primary sent me to an ENT who had me x-rayed as well as sent a camera through my nasel passage and down my throat.  Since she found nothing, she sent me to an allergist.  I had already spent over a month tracking what I ate and what I breathed, etc. purchasing a $200 room filter and last spring even leaving my house for a trip for a number of days to see if it was the house and nothing changed in each instance.  I have no fever and no loss of appetite.The allergist ran those two dozen skin test pricks on my inside arm and said I was  allergic to a number of  things including polllens, but nothing severely.  ( I know that I am severly allergic to cat dander!)He then started me on a nerve medication, something you give to someone who is under stress and needs tranquilzing.  No side effects after a month and also no reduction in coughing 8-10 times daily and then through the night.  We changed to a second nerve medication and he said that coughs can be VERY hard to find the cause.  A month of the second nerve medication and no side effeccts  and no reduction in cough.  I had to be taken off it gradually as it did  make me dizzy and I had a waking dream the day after! He then tried a third medication which did not reduce the cough but the warned side effect of anxiety and temper did kick in and I told him after two weeks, I was no longer taking it as I was getting murderous!  We are a fragile chemical factory!At my most reent visit  (four months after my initial visit) he  prescribed a blood test (I was too tired to ask what he was looking for although I did ask if it  could  be a fungus) and also a CT Scan.  He called  last week and said they did find an infection in the top two sinus cavities by my eyes!  I then was put on a 10 day course  of antibiotics  and a 5 day course of a steroid.  I immediately called to explain that I was  getting my second  Covid Moderna shot in two days and wondered about the wisdom of being on a steriod ... my understanding that it suppressed the immune reaction.  He agreed I should only take the antibiotic.  I was thinking that ALL doctors should have COVID in the back of their mind with every patient when they are prescribing these days as many patients do not research their meds!Anyway, I am on my 4th day of the antibiotic and the cough has been cut by about 30% and  usually is not so intense.  But the cough has not gone away.  I got no  reaction to  my second Covid  shot except for a sore arm muscle and what seems to be two days of fatigue.  I have taken advantage of this being a test tube to try to nap each day and rest generally by doing nothing this whole weekend as I have not felt super energetic.  I MUST do some exercise on Monday.  Tonight is take-out unhealthy pizza.Anyway, I am so tired of being a guinea pig in this process and exhausted as it has been a whole year of this cough.  I have my fingers crossed and the doctor recommends taking the sterioids in about 9 days.  Wish me luck!  As someone who had fought food poisoning while living overseas and  dengue fever while overseas on a tropical island...under mediocre medical care, I was unprepared for this."},

I saw an American Cardinal couple kissing the other day!  Right out in the open!  Right on my deck!  Ah, young love. The longer daylight and the angle of the sun have also awakened dismay in me.  I see all the dribbles and spots on my kitchen cupboards under the morning sun's spotlight.  I see the dust bunnies and gunk on the kitchen lighting. My kitchen has a small island with a range.  Since I have a high ceiling I did not want a huge ceiling vent fan coming down.  It would be enormous to clean as well as allowing a draft of cold air to seep through in the winters down that long vent.  Therefore, I had installed a counter pop-up fan behind the range.  I can never use the fan on high.    It is not as efficient and it draws the heat away, so affects cooking, but the filters can go in the dishwasher and there is less to clean.But the \"fancy\" lighting fixture that was installed above is a bit of a nightmare to clean. I actually think it was for pool table lighting!  Since I have a bit of a wrought iron theme going in the living area, I selected it.  I have been putting off cleaning for quite some time and this year tried to remove the three lamp hoods and glass shades and pop them in the dishwasher.  I could not actually reach all the curled iron above which was covered in grease.  I got two of the fixtures down using my kitchen ladder and patience.  The last one would not come off.  The ceramic threads were misaligned.  I called in my tall friend. (You may remember the fellow who helped with the Osprey nest.)  HE could NOT get the glass shade off either!Thus he used his height and good eyes and long arms and cleaned the shades as well as the iron decoration with a rag and some Mr. Clean.  It now sparkles.  He also helped me re-assemble the parts that I had put through the dishwasher.I now have to go to the hardware and get a finish polisher to shine the two black hoods.  Easy enough!

He got no reaction to the first, but I am hearing a second can sometimes make you feel as if you are coming down with the flu--a simple trade-off to avoid the hospital oxygen tent.  It does appear that by the end of spring the majority of Americans will be protected from hospitalization and/or death if not from getting sick even with the current varients, so that is a good thing!Please be kind to others.  It is so hard these days to just put one foot in front of the other."},

I thought the worst but reminded myself that it had to be something normal.  I tried to call but did not get her, so emailed.  She responded right away and wrote that she was fine and that she owed my husband and me dinner.  I think we paid for her dinner over a year ago on our way to a meeting...so long ago.  I had forgotten, but she remembered.  She then went on to say that she has dropped out of the gardening group but is volunteering one day a week at the local library.  She said that she had just turned 95 and decided she needed to slow down.For some insight, this woman is a volunteer master.  There is nowhere in the county that she has not donated her precious time.  She has won awards from the county for her time donated.  BUT when she explained that she had just turned 95, I was a bit surprised.  It seemed just a few years ago she was in her 80s when we used to work booths, etc. together. She never seemed that old to me.  Wow.  Time seems to have flown while I was sheltering and nervously eating chocolate.She has been a widow for almost two decades.  Her children are all doctors and live in the city while another lives somewhere in Germany!  This gene pool should be duplicated!I am always envious of those who fit in everywhere and are not intimidated by some new task or the pace of activity, and she is a shining example.I am Timid Theresa and always move in slowly with trepidation.  I am sure I will disappoint or I will not like the endeavor.Do you have friends that are 'stars'?  Are you a 'star'?  (Having read Bloggers I follow for years, I find lots of shining stars.)"},

{"title": "I live Next  Door to Martha Stewart", "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2020", "text": "Drip, drip, drip.I have blogged (belabored) several times on the economics of my current neighborhood, and this over-blogging of the subject, perhaps, was because I grew up poor.  The kind of poor where there is food on the table but not enough to fill a growing teen's stomach..especially when there were five children at that table.  The kind of poor that when you outgrew last year's winter ice skates, there was not enough money for a new pair. The kind of poor where you did not get the gifts you hoped for Christmas, so you did not make any wishes. My parents were loving but somewhat distant as life pulled them here and there while trying to make enough money to feed, clothe, and shelter a family of seven.  We were never the \"homeless\" poor although my father was on unemployment for one year.  I was in sixth grade the first time I ate in a restaurant, and that was with a friend and her parents.  Our form of eating out was the 15 cent hamburgers at MacDonald's when I was a teenager. I never knew how difficult it was for them to make ends meet, as they were good to shelter us from the tensions of money problems and we did not live in a community where there were wealthy that flaunted their fortune.  We never felt we were poor...just a farm family.  I am sure this is what makes me side with the liberals, as I know the hard-working poor.Education was important and we all worked hard to make good grades.  Besides, that was the only way we made money...by getting \"A's.\"  We did not get an allowance.  I did have the fortune to go onto a small state school where I got a Bachelors's Degree.  Then after saving carefully at my first job I was able to go on to get a Master's Degree.  I met an educated man at graduate school and he was also a good and honest man and we married and raised our family on a solid middle-class income with a small nest egg from living 9 years overseas.  To me that is rich.So living in my current middle-class house, which we designed and had built, is a dream.  As I have written before, the neighborhood is mostly upper-middle-class with at least three millionaires in the larger houses and everyone else solid middle class.I have written about the lovely large house to our left and our good neighbors with whom we went out to dinner at least twice a year and talked on the phone as needs arose.  They finally downsized and now have a small apartment in the Capital city and a small Condo in Florida. Their huge house sold in two days!  The new owner(s) moved in over the weeks of December.  Three moving vans illustrated that the new owner(s) had plenty of furniture to fill up the place.  This was followed the week before Christmas by a large tree to decorate.  I do not spy on them, but as I did dishes there is a clear view between the bare winter trees and I easily saw the day-long activity.  I called my old neighbor and she said that the new owner was a single elderly woman.  \"Single elderly?\" I said to my  former neighbor, \"She must be very wealthy to live in a huge house like that by herself.\"  The response was \"Oh, she has lots of money!\"  This from neighbors who themselves have \"lots of money.\"I will try to get to the end of this ramble here about money, neighborhoods, and neighbors.  This week my husband harvested the last of the carrots from the food pantry garden...pounds of carrots and nowhere to deliver with a closed food pantry due to Covid and holidays.  The pantry was not to open until the second week of January.  So after calling around he found a good place for distribution but saved two batches for our neighbors on each side.  Therefore we(he) got to meet the \"elderly lady\" with a hospitality basket of carrots and a welcome card.  She was very gracious and surprised that we were the first to drop by.  I think she thinks our neighborhood is neighborly...She told my husband she had sold her 600-acre farm to the north and hosted a garden show on PBS for years...so she likes to garden and she must be VERY good to be on PBS. As hubby and she chatted, they realized they were the exact same age spared by a few months.  Her husband passed a few years ago.  So when hubby came back with a name, this nosy old bitch (me) had to Google her and I found that she is listed as a Philanthropist, rather than a TV host.  She has donated a million dollars to our county hospital and hundreds of thousands to other venues in this county.  We are so lucky to have people like her.  She is beautiful (maybe a face lift) but a lovely smile and warm face.This morning my husband noticed that \"Martha\" was out in her front yard planting a tree!  She was digging a hole with a shovel and then she brought in bigger tools.I told you she was Martha...she drives that bobcat!  You can just see her on her knees doing something with the vehicle."},

{"title": "A Very Very Very Busy Solstice, Grab Some Coffee or Tea", "date": "Tuesday, December 22, 2020", "text": "The 2020 solstice day was a busy, busy, busy shortest day of the year. We packed the car with gifts for the kids and grandkids and then headed up to a small town about 20 minutes north of us. I had a doctor's appointment for my chronic cough which is still a mystery. He is increasing my meds by 30% in the hopes this will work! He is a jolly man and actually spends time talking to you about stuff other than your illness. I like him and trust him. Then we were off to to the city to visit the daughter and her three children. Her hubby was off for his shoulder therapy because he injured himself months ago on one of his many sports. When we arrived the granddaughter was upstairs with her therapist working on the pain in her ankles, probably from cheer where she is the base holding people 2/3 her weigh with her hands and shoulders! The oldest grandson has had the boot removed from his foot and still takes some therapy for that injury but he explained there was only a little pain now and he was working his therapy exercises. It seems he has an extra bone in that foot...rare but not so rare that they have never seen it. The daughter arrived at the door apologetically as she had three remote meetings and two conference calls that day and was squeezing us in. But since we arrived early she had not had time to wrap our gifts and was adamant that we wait so that we can take them. She went upstairs and we visited the two boys while she wrapped. The youngest boy was happy and healthy and not in any therapy! I told my daughter that I expected her to take better care of her active family and she laughed.  She told me to open the large box at my feet as it was my birthday gift---my birthday is on the solstice.  It was glass storage containers and I was thrilled as I am moving away from the unhealthy plastic in our lives. We visited a bit more, deposited our rather large box of gifts, and then headed to another suburb 20 minutes away where my son lived.My son was alone except for his neurotic dog, who is sweet, but like many of us has issues.  His wife had driven far north to the Great Lakes area to see her grandmother who lives in an elder home and had just contracted Covid.  She is 91 and we are all praying she does well.  She is a bubbly and delightful woman and one of those who takes the tragedies and changes in her life with aplomb.  Son was also was panicked upon our slightly early arrival and proceeded to wrap the gifts as they were still in their cardboard boxes from the mail delivery on the table in his living room.  We all maneuvered in his small living room around the big tree and the enthusiastic dog and the rolls of wrapping paper.He handed me a lovely and sweetly written birthday card (as I wrote... the solstice is my birthday!) and explained my gift would come by email and while we could not hug and kiss we deposited our gifts at his tree and gathered our boxes from him to put in the trunk of the car and air-hugged before we pulled away.By this time it was mid-afternoon and we had not eaten since breakfast, so we decided to find someplace with take-out as this  County does not allow indoor eating ( which we would not do anyway).  I really craved a hamburger as hubby cannot eat beef with his allergy and we found a place that cooks actual hamburgers and not that flat meat that MacDonald's and Burger King now offer.  The fries were limp and needed more salt, but my burger was delicious with the fresh toppings!  Hubby had a mediocre grilled cheese.  It was an adequate birthday lunch/dinner.  Since we were eating so late I knew that once we were home it would probably just be ice cream for dinner.We headed home after 3:00 P.M. and we faced absolutely gridlocked traffic all the way around the beltway of the city to the other side.  There were police pulling over cars, at least one large toll truck broken down, and just lots of cars trudging along.  As we sat in traffic, we remembered that on my birthday the \"Christmas star\" (the close matching of the planets Jupiter and Saturn orbits so that they look like one star) would be visible just after sunset.  We stopped to pick up the mail about 10 minutes before sunset, rushed home to use the bathroom, get my camera, get the binoculars and head out to a nearby farm field to see if we could see these planet phenomena which had not happened for something like 1600 years (?).I leaned against the car as the sun's fading made the planets and stars visible and tried to be steady with my handheld camera.  We saw it better with the binoculars.  It was exciting and even my meager photos will help me remember.We finally returned home, started a wood fire to thaw, and watched a couple of episodes of The Crown before we sleepily headed to bed.  Such a looong day for two old retirees."},

If indeed I am moving from my 70s into my 60s-50s am I wise enough to live a more healthy lifestyle?  Do I respect the elders more?  Do I understand their issues? Do I stop and smell the roses more?Of course, I am taking this all too literally and it has something to do with order versus chaos among atoms and not a duplication of ourselves.  Even so, it would be fascinating.Our tree is up...a small artificial tree that I put on a small table to make it look higher.  It comes with lights and we just put on decorations, not the familiar homemade type as I gave all the \"kids\" their decorations when they each moved into their own homes.  I have about 4 or 5 that were gifts these past years.  It is a lovely Charlie Brown tree and meets with my idea of simplicity but LOTS of gold globes and red glittery birds!  I am a conundrum...must be that parallel universe swerving.The neighbors have all lit their docks this year...as have we.  It is getting a little competitive as some are using more lights each year!  But there are lovely reflections against the water.  Two images of lights...parallel in their beauty except one is wavy and moving and the other bright and static.Well, time to attend to some errands.

That extra five or eight pounds is not going to go away all by itself.  Now we must also promise ourselves to eat super healthy for the next few weeks until Christmas (or other holidays at this time of year) when we can eat all the bread we want again. To also improve my health, I have been trying to increase my hours of sleep and one would think with the shorter days that this would be an easy win...not.  So I was up at 5:30 A.M. this morning and listening/watching a course I am taking on photography via my laptop.  The house was almost quiet except for the TREMENDOUS wind and rain we are getting today.  It would come in waves and then stop for a few minutes.  I paused the laptop video to refresh my coffee and just before I stood up, I heard a thick thud coming from the kitchen.  Had a tree branch hit the side of the house in this angry storm?  Did something fall over behind me in the kitchen?  Was I still alone with hubby sound asleep in bed or was someone stalking about the house in this dark morning? I did not panic because it was a familiar sound.  It came from my citrus orchard in the corner windows of the kitchen.  The \"thunk\" was the fall of a Kafir lime about the size of a golf ball as the tree shed its ripe fruit.  It does become a prickly treasure hunt when I try to retrieve the green orb and nine times out of ten it falls into the farthest corner.I am growing a Meyer Lemon tree, a Calamondin tree, and a Kafir lime tree inside and all super pruned so that they fit!  The large pots sit in plastic bins (ugly I know) because I have to really soak the trees each week.  They are mostly root and little soil, so I also fertilize every six weeks or so.  The Kafir and the Calamondon are full of fruit.  That means this winter I will get lots of fresh vitamin C.  These windows do not have the coatings that most windows have to reduce sunlight on fabrics and floors.  The timed lighting is necessary or trees would be dropping leaves as well as fruit!I made turkey curry last night and the citrus was a nice addition sprinkled over the top of dishes and added to our beverages.  If I closed my eyes I could pretend I was eating in a small breakfast lanai on Bali."},

It is so easy today to get distracted by stuff.  Wandering through your bank statements to make sure nothing has been posted that should not have been posted.  The same distraction of statements from your credit cards.  Nothing comes in paper, so all of this has to be done on the computer screen and each place I stop has a different layout, different tabs, and a different list.  The use of paper was so easy...so black and white...no offers or ads or bright colored menus that take you down the wrong path. My driver's license is due to expire in December.  I thought I should make an appointment this month to make sure I can get in because our Covid numbers are now climbing once again.  I find on that cluttered website where there are photos of people smiling and wanting to provide good service, that I cannot make an appointment and the Dept. of Motor Vehicles has to send me a notice before I can begin the process to make an appointment.  So I have to trust that they will notice on the database of my pending expiration.  Then I have to hope that the mail they send me will get to me.  Our mail is slower these days.  Also, my driver's license has my physical address and not my mailing address on record.  I use to have a rural mailbox, but after two years in a row of trees falling on it and destroying it, I decided to rent the expensive mailbox at the Post Office.  I did get a license sticker last month that had been delayed because it did not have my P.O. Box in the address.  Therefore, you can imagine my concern that I will not get such a notice for my license renewal.Therefore, I downloaded and printed the change of address form.  (I had put off filing this because it also would impact my ability to vote!  That is the address they use to certify the validity of the voter form which I dropped off.  I just Knew with 2020 being the evil year that it was, I would be told they could not count my vote due to the discrepancy.)Therefore, this week I began to complete the form to mail to the DMV for a change of address.  This is not easy.  They need several numbers that are on my car.  I have to walk through a muddy forest to my neighbor's house, an acre away, to get the numbers off my car!  We had the driveway re-sealed yesterday...thus leading hubby trying to park the cars on the street road and my car sliding off the side of the grass into the muddy thick ditch.  We had to call the tow truck to pull it out and then asked our neighbor if we could park in her driveway.  (Her house is under contract and no one is living there now.)  Since I cannot walk on the driveway for several days, I must cross through the woods.This morning hubby found he had left about $100 of meat in his car after our food shopping trip two days ago!  We bought a lot of stuff from the big box store and he missed his two little shopping bags.  That now goes into the trash!These are not the distractions that I wanted to take my mind off of  Pennsylvania counting ballots (that they could have counted days ago!) following their state laws of having to wait until after election day!Please tell me that 2021 will be better. (I just heard that Biden has been declared the winner...that helps!) To leave on a calm note, I posted the photo below toward my side of the river as the fog was lifting---how symbolic!"},

That was a bit of joy even when viewed on my small phone screen.  I am so thankful for such short moments.  My son and his wife call every so often but we have not been able to meet up.  He wanted to come down this week, but the remnants of Zeta have canceled that.I finally was able to schedule specialist appointments for my chronic and sometimes debilitating cough.  It had gotten much worse starting this past January and not to belabor a health subject, we are working on an allergy-related premise.  ENT visit with a long camera down the nostril (that was fun!), chest, and nasal X-rays, and finally a visit to an Allergist who did the \"multiple pricks of the inner arm test\" and said I was allergic to \"lots\" of stuff.  He prescribed a nasal spray and a pill and sent me on my way for a month to see if we can treat it without shots and more tests.  Been in and out of a lot of doctor's office during this pandemic and staying lucky thus far.  Each office has a slightly different protocol and I see people who are not panicked and those who are VERY concerned.  Some of the offices let you wait in the car and call your cell phone.We took a few days off and drove down to Charlottesville, VA to tour and try to forget about all the nastiness of 2020.  Our hotel assured us they had sterilized the room and I took wipes and spray to do a second sterilization.  We were there 3 and a half days and had no maid service to worry about.  We ate outside at restaurants or took take-out and ate in the hotel room.  Breakfast was in their breakfast room with only a handful of others.  The most dangerous part was the outdoor toilets.  But that was over two weeks ago, so perhaps we dodged the bullet there.  Montecillo is lovely even though I have been there dozens of times.  The gardens are ever-changing. The University of Virginia was a needed burst of energy, even though there were few students on campus, mostly seniors it looked like.  And catching fall in the Virginia mountains, although we were a bit early, was soul inspiring.University of VirginiaMonticelloHere today is gloomy with Zeta hurrying our way.  We are listening to Lang Lang on the DVD to pass the time.  I am blogging and hubby is reading.  I need to exercise and have been postponing due to my cough/allergy, but that is really just an excuse as my breathing has not been impacted.  I do not sleep well at night, so it takes me some time to get my morning/afternoon/whenever energy up.Now I am off to read your blogs, which I have certainly missed, both actually and nostalgically.  I hope you are all keeping the blues and grays at bay and staying as kind to yourself and others as you can.  There is much kindness out there, although you do not see it in the news as much as I would like."},

Then in the quiet I heard an unusual sound.  It was a very close whoosh-whoosh-whoosh.  I looked toward the garage wondering if  hubby was in there and had turned on some fan that had trouble starting.   It was an odd quiet sound and I just knew it was mechanical.  Then a shadow  crossed over me and as I looked up a  large bald eagle flew 12 to 15 feet over  my head and was crossing the lawn heading toward our gate and other trees at the front of the yard.  Yes, I was too much in awe of  his prescence to  turn  the camera on him fast enough.  His flight was so quiet that you would only have heard it when there was no other noise aroundIt reminded me of the very quiet flight of the barred  owl  that we had unintentionally followed down the river on our second canoe  trip  the other day.  These birds of prey are certainly most stealthy."},

Several people commented to my last post about their complicated life with passwords.  I decided to take a photo (heavily blurred) of my MANY passwords lists.  I keep them on spreadsheets.  One spreadsheet is titled SHOPPING/BILL PAYING/INVESTMENTS.  Another is titled COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE  (i.e. router, laptop, wifi...)  I also have photography, travel, and subscription spreadsheets with passwords.This might give you a clue as to why I do not change them very often, but instead, try to make them complicated.I had to log into a government server the other day for my husband's evaluation of some grant work.  That site required at least one lower case letter, at least one upper case letter, at least one number, and one character.  But it also had to be twelve characters in length!  I really wish we could implement safe biological scans soon.Here are the many pages of stuff I try to maintain:I have some sympathy for those who are not as well-organized.

No bank accounts or other emails or friends' emails seemed to be impacted.  Then, being the good person that I am, I went in and changed my two email passwords as a precaution.  (I did not change the password for the email I use for this blog...but I must admit I rarely check it!)  The result of all this careful tying up of loose ends was that I got logged out of everything each day.  Blogger, Facebook, three emails...etc.  I worked my way back by re-entering or in some cases changing those email passwords again, but I am too stupid to make sure the interface I am using keeps me logged in because I check the \"keep me logged in\" box and I still have to re-enter the next day.  At least a drop-down box asks me to save the passwords...each and every time....drop, drop, drop.I actually have two personas on my PC.  My hidden one for Blogger privacy and my other one for the real world.  Yes, it is all way too complicated for an elder world.  Thus, it has taken me some days to be brave enough to log in here.I did not get logged out of bank accounts or doctors' portals which is good!Because I am a slow elder and cannot really understand the difference between Google and Microsoft and why I need passwords for those, it has taken me days working to try to get this all straightened out once again on my computer and I was not the one hacked!   I am not sure that I have completed my work, but I am here at Blogger once again!  (I have lots of blog reading to do.)There is a bright side to every storm front and that was we got phone calls from friends we hadn't heard from in decades!!  (How can they be friends if we do not keep in touch you may ask?  Well, when you have lived a long life you leave friends like breadcrumbs as you move around)  Hubby actually had a week full of long phone calls with old pals as we caught up on their lives.  I think his (fake email) call for help had many worried due to the real issues with Corvid19.  It was almost like being able to travel about once again.I was involved in some of the calls as both of our cell phones and landline could be busy at the same time.  Two of the callers asked if we were Republicans?  I am not sure why they thought this had to do with anything, but I explained that I was not and would not talk politics with them if they felt that was not a good thing.  They dropped the subject and we went on to other issues!I know so many nice people and some of my FB friends have said the same for them knowing nice people who support Drump.  I am not saying I am dismayed by conservatives...as I am liberal on some issues and conservative on others.  I am dismayed by friends who are The Donald supporters because our current leader is a disease...not an ideology.I do sometimes wonder if challenges such as computer problems become more important because we are so isolated these days and feel even more so when cannot connect electronically.  Well, now I need to go write about our long canoe trip the other day on my other blog."},

Trading and bartering and the Dems are the big-party umbrella of varied people who have lots of issues they want to be addressed.  I just hope that the far left can be patient with the changes they are demanding and have willingness to compromise.I will probably not watch the GOP convention as I have seen the guest line-up and most of those people are either from the upper-middle class and have no history of serving their country or helping their countrymen.  They are mostly scandal headliners who got in the news for their extreme behavior or behavior not normal for an average citizen.  It will be a convention of hate and not vision or hope.  This afternoon since the weather has cooled we will go out for a canoe paddle in an area that we have not visited via water.  I hope to get some later afternoon photos of wildlife or scenery and I hope you will enjoy my sharing on my other blog.  Hubby probably hopes to catch fish.  We have not gone out much because the parks and boat ramps have been closed due to the virus and the weather has been too hot and humid to sit in a slow-moving canoe.Restrictions on life are not going to change anytime soon.  Colleges are now realizing that Americans are neither sheep nor passive when it comes to restricting their social behavior.  We are a spoiled lot.  It has been drilled into us about our rights and science has become so politicized that common data and facts no longer penetrate the beer fogged brains of the young.  They are also angry that their youth will be restricted.  They are shortly facing adulthood and feel it is their right to party these few years they have.  Besides they will not be the ones with inflamed organs or facing death.  Have you ever met a twenty-something who felt death was possible?I have tried to get back into an exercise program and that process has been fraught with both success and failure.  For instance, I am VERY good a finding excuses to postpone the effort!  I do feel better (if sorer) after my exercise, but I still do not like it.Currently reading the book \"Things That Make White People Uncomfortable\" by the NFL player, Michael Bennett.  It is rambling but reasonably well written so must have undergone some editing.  He confirms everything I have felt about both the NCAA and the NFL.  I am speed reading it since I am not a football fan and have not been for decades, but I want to know how he sees societal change and what he wants to do.Well, my coffee is now cold.  So going to get out of pajamas and into canoe clothes.  Hope you set aside some time today to enjoy...just enjoy."},

Some are big boxes and some are tiny boxes.  The boxes I leap into have high walls even if they are larger than the box I just left.  No matter how high I leap to bravely land in the next box, I cannot see the horizon or even check out the box thoroughly before I land like the timid house mouse I have become.  I will not be able to see the horizon for a year or more.Hubby and I ate out TWICE this week.  The first venue was a card table on a patio of the restaurant at least ten feet from any other table.  The second venue was a picnic table on the lawn of the restaurant also far from other tables and with canvas on the side to prevent those on either side from sending their breath our way.  Disposable menus, masked staff, and one-way doors in and out were the rule.  I felt reasonably safe.  I have reached the time in my life where I feel this venture is a bit necessary or I will accept being a hermit permanently.  We used alcohol gel on hands before touching utensils and glasses and then washed when we got home and tried not to touch our faces.  I did eat the french fries with a fork and then used my fingers toward the end.I live in Trump country and most of the people I encounter think this is all too much carefulness (nonsense), which means I have to be even MORE careful.  I will NEVER understand how science became the enemy.My daughter and her family drove down to the Carolinas to spend a week with friends and a week in a rental house on the beach last week.  She left the dog for us to watch.  Below nice and clean after I gave him a bath in the sink.When daughter and family return on Sunday to get the dog I will be cautious about making the visit short and not inviting them inside for refreshment.  If they are OK in 14 days, I may drive up for a visit....maybe.  My daughter said she felt safer in a house that they rented...not sharing an elevator, not sharing a hallway, not needing a restaurant or sharing a swimming pool with anyone but the family they are close to.  She was in a much larger box for 10 days that I have encountered...but still a box!Regarding Isaias., my daughter's vacation was denied only one day due to rain.  They were able to pool swim and beach walk and it has certainly been a wonderful trip for them.  Here in our area, we also had no trees down and missed the three tornadoes that were just miles away!  No flooding, but one leak in the roof above the upstairs bathroom!  Now not sure if that was wind-driven and not a problem or if we need to inspect the roof.As an update from my last post, my friend from Scotland who IM's me weekly through FB revealed that he is indeed a \"trans.\"  I thought our messages had been somewhat odd and while I playfully teased him about wearing red spangles, I am so glad I did not mess up and embarrass him or me by saying something stupid!  I asked a mutual friend and she told me he came out a little over a year ago.  I am sure he is terrified of his decision...especially in conservative Glasgow!  I then immediately Googled information on this, because I have not a clue how not to say something unknowingly mean or non-constructive.  I feel painfully for him as he is in his 40s and alone.  So hoping he lives a good and full life.Planning on staying in the \"home\" box in the coming week, although I may go out food shopping.  I can order it in, but sometimes my list misses stuff as I start to cook---like my cornmeal.  Where in the heck did that go?Hope all of my readers are finding their boxes well-cushioned and full of views of green grass and views of summer and a tiny window in the cardboard to see the future."},

I do often wonder why they message an old lady like me.  They both have parents they are close to because I see the posts on FB.  They both have expressed a wish to find that \"someone special\" so maybe they are thinking I may know some single girls...which I actually do!  But cannot imagine how in this time and distance I could work out something.Anyway, I cannot help but wonder if there was no pandemic, would I be juggling this unusual virtual friendship?  Life is funny and odd but, man, if I could hook these very nice men up, I would!!"},

Good thing we do not have any trips in the future.  I am still trying to get him to cancel the hotel reservations in Hawaii that we made for our 50th anniversary.  We were going in December, even though our anniversary is actually this coming August.My daughter is coming down the end of this week for us to babysit her dog while her family takes a vacation to the beach in South Carolina.  They have friends down that way.  We bought a timeshare there and they never want to use it, so now I have to figure out how to get rid of it.I have an uptick in a chronic cough I have had for years.  This is not the time for that because of the pandemic.  I have no fever and do not feel exhaustion, so I just want this cough gone and in the past, the doctor has designated it is caused by post-nasal issues/allergies.  It will go away for months, but lately, it is hanging in there.  It will be hard to schedule a diagnostic appointment.On another dark note, the south side of our brick home has a rather impressive crack in the brick going down 2.5 stories to the ground, and it now looks like we will have to install two of those helical piers to correct the foundation on that side.  4 to 5K!  Waiting for the engineer's estimate.  Hate to see the home I love aging.A bad news/good news bit is that our neighbors who we like very much are moving to a larger community to the north.  The good news is that have a teak(!) gazebo that they gave to us and with our helper, we are converting it into an arbor for under the dogwood tree in the front yard.Good news...there must be some...in no particular order...I will get to see the grand-children briefly when they come down in a few days.  Good news...I have air conditioning in this hellish summer.Good news...I am eating very healthy with all the fresh fruit and veggies from summer garden booths and our own garden.Good news...I found a young gal to cut my hair out on my deck and she is pretty good.  We are slowly beginning to understand how to communicate how I like my hair.Good news...I have a lot of e-books and regular books still waiting to be read.Good news...I still have blogging and bloggers to \"take me away.\""},

We got many sweet peas to eat, just not an abundance to freeze.  (In actuality, when I freeze them, they do not taste nearly as good and we end up throwing the last few frozen bags out! ) On the good side, there is not an abundance of Japanese Beetles dining on everything in sight.  On the bad side, I have seen only 10% of my normal butterfly population at this time.  Even the caterpillars are not eating away at my fennel as they usually do.  The heat and humidity are intolerable and thus you must garden before 8:00 AM or not at all.  I did just 30 minutes of weeding and the sweat was leaking into my eyes!  Most of my flower beds have soaker hoses, so I do not have to stand outside holding a hose and trying to avoid wetting the foliage. Hubby got up early today and went fishing! He went alone as he was unable to get a friend to go along, and I worry about that a bit. The fish head will make great bait for crabs!  (Note he always wears a bandanna these days in case some emergency comes about and he has to talk to strangers.)He also harvested the small number of blueberries that are just getting ripe yesterday and they will be dessert tonight.  I will make a clafoutis for the first time.  We grew blueberries at the old house and they were so abundant we gave away pints.  Our shady and clay-like soil here at this house has made growing blueberries a big challenge and we are lucky to get just a few pints.Today is a good day.  I am going to sleep through the bad days, I have decided."},

It can be suffocating as this virus which is up against an anti-scientist leadership, is winning.Hubby and I took our first road trip in over a month last week. We check the weather for thunderstorms and we saw sunny, and of course, hot weather ahead.  We brought food/snacks and hand sanitizer and masks.  The Governor had lifted the 100-mile limitation of driving from home.  I had not been to the historic Ellicott City in Maryland since their last two devasting floods.  It is a small town of over 70,000 and sits just outside Baltimore.  It was a mill town in Central Maryland and built along the Patapsco River.\"The town was founded in 1772 by three brothers, who took advantage of the location’s proximity to the Patapsco River to create a thriving milling industry. It later became a hub for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, with a train station (which stands to this day) built at the bottom of Main Street in 1831.\"The now-abandoned flour mill.The museum was closed due to the virus as were some of the shops.  Unfortunately, the devastating flood has forced many of the tourist shops to either close or semi-close as they work on remodeling.  The river came down Mainstreet and you can go to this link for a complete documentary of the tragedy.\"In 2019, Ellicott City was still reeling from the disastrous downpour of May 27, 2018, when a severe rainstorm walloped the town, leading to flash floods that ravaged roads and buildings and killed one person. It was the second torrential, 1,000-year storm to pummel the town in as many years. On July 30, 2016, heavy rain soaked Ellicott City in a span of just a few hours, causing flash floods that inundated Main Street, wiped out storefronts and vehicles, and killed two people.\"Even today the danger is still there, although they are continually working on re-directing the river.There were people on the streets, but only a few tourists.  Most were working or getting lunch.  Main street is an uphill downhill walk!While there were places to eat lunch, we opted to eat our own food.  It did not help the retailers, but we are over 60 and must be very careful.If you look closely at the photo of the shop window above, you can see the reflection of hubby and I playing at tourist.We managed to fritter away the entire day by including a 3-mile walk along the river and got home just before dinner time.  A good break before we hunker down in the week ahead."},

I was determined that this would be a relaxed and calm visit. Hubby is very social and has not had the opportunity to expound on his garden, his oysters, etc. for months and since it was Father's Day I let him do his thing.  I am surprised that their ears did not fall off! I laid out the food on a large farm table in the basement where it would be safe and cool and bug-free. I used paper products and only drinks from bottles and cans.  We had homemade coleslaw, a partially homemade potato salad with spring potatoes from our garden, and a fresh green salad with our own lettuce, baby carrots, and edible-podded peas with store-bought cucumbers.  I also made garlic bread to go with the steamed blue crabs.We caught eight from the dock, but hubby gets distracted these days and forgot to reset the traps so we had to buy a dozen from the local crabber. I thought the food was good, and for the most part healthy, and with ice cream for dessert, we did not feel weighed down by the summer heat. Add captionI had fans going both for the mosquitoes that love my daughter-in-law and the virus issues as we are all talkers.  We sat about 4 to 5 feet apart and with the heavily moving air pushed to the yard, I think we were reasonably safe.  (Of course, we will all know for sure in 7 to 10 days.) Psychologically it was a very good break for me to get together with someone other than hubby to talk over stuff.    All of these people traveled through Ireland with us several years ago, and so I told them Scotland is next on the list before we die!!    This COVID has certainly made me appreciate the company more.  As an introvert, I am still glad when everyone is gone and everything is cleaned up...but I did really enjoy the visit!"},

As I wrote we avoid seeing family.  BUT they invited us up to their big yard for an outdoor picnic of KFC and assorted sides including brownies for dessert, and when you say loved ones and fast food, who can say no?  I was thrilled to see the three grands and my son and his wife and my daughter and her husband once again after four weeks of no time together!We did not hug but also did not wear masks as we sat mostly six feet apart in the lovely spring air and were careful about touching only our own utensils.  There were sanitizing wipes on the table as well.  We all brought our own drinks.Faces blurred to protect the guilty.  Shoulder brace was removed for a short time.My son-in-law was the first to arrive with a shoulder brace.  I soon learned he had recently had surgery for an old golf injury (bone shaving of some type) as well as a brand new major torn ligament surgery, both done together.  Four weeks in a sling for a very active dude and it is killing him.  It is also his right arm and he has learned to be very ambidextrous.  With the kids involved in learning and the wife on conference calls, he has been left to his own devices.  I can imagine using a computer keyboard with only a left hand is very annoying, to say nothing of lots of other stuff.Then I saw that my 13-year-old granddaughter now has a full mouth of braces.  She seems accepting of that and I honestly thought her teeth were perfect before!But the final surprise was seeing my very active par-core grandson in a foot boot.  When I asked what had happened he said he twisted his ankle and it hurt so much they went in for x-rays and found that he is one of the 4% who are born with an extra bone in their foot and injuries take longer to heal because the tendons/muscles get compressed???I am guessing if this was a normal year where I might not see them for months, this would have all passed without me noticing and that I would learn about this all anecdotally and promptly forget.  It does seem to me that tons of things happen when you are hiding out at home."},

Please hang with me here.  I received in the mail yesterday a Visa debit card that arrived in a plain white envelope from an address in Omaha called Metabank. (MetaBank, the retail banking division, operates 10 retail branches in four market areas: Central Iowa; Storm Lake, Iowa; Brookings, S.D..; and Sioux Falls, S.D.. MetaBank offers traditional banking services designed to serve the needs of individual, agricultural, and business depositors and borrowers.)   Most people toss their credit card offers, but I decided to open the thin white envelope and found inside my \"Economic Impact Credit\" in the form of a VISA debit card.   Yes, this \"small\" bank is the one issuing the Federal payments as a VISA debit card.  Not one of my two large banks on the east coast, but some unknown!  The reason soon became clear.Some of my friends have gotten their money as a direct deposit to their bank.  The IRS has my bank routing information to one of the largest banks on the east coast, but they did not use that.  Others have gotten their money as a check from the U.S. Treasury.  Instead, I have gotten this Visa debit card in an unobtrusive envelope with absolutely no advertising from the Treasury office that some of us will be getting our money this way.  I have read that some people have tossed this envelope thinking it was a solicitation for getting a credit card!  The U.S. government has made no effort to make this clear to people.  I also learned that there are numerous fees attached to the use of the card.  They (Metabank) allow you to make only one withdrawal per day from an ATM before they charge you $2.00 per transaction.  Because my HUGE bank is \"out-of-network\" my bank is charging an additional $3.50 per withdrawal and will not allow me to withdraw a large enough amount to empty the card in one day!  This is money that people who cannot put food on the table could use.Start adding this all up and you can see the bank lobby is making millions of dollars off of this VISA debit scam.  Not only in fees but in the money they are holding from people who threw away their card!In addition, my card balance is not in even dollars but ends in 50 cents.  You cannot get 50 cents from an ATM.  I will have to spend it somewhere and overspend to get the 50 cents.  I cannot imagine how someone who has never had such a card or does not read small print will get confused and end up owing Metabank money before they can figure out how to cancel.  I will attempt to clear the balance tomorrow, and hopefully donate it all to a worthy cause(s)...although emotionally I would like to donate it to the Democratic party and buy a balloon with Trump in a diaper.Greed is endless."},

{"title": "If Time Were Not a Moving Thing", "date": "Sunday, May 24, 2020", "text": "With so much time on my hands these days I  go through books faster than usual.   I had read the book \"Time and Again\" by Jack Finney a few years ago.  I had forgotten that I had read it and started to re-read it just last week and then remembered how I had found it somewhat intense and a bit claustrophobic.   It is a science fiction book about an artist being selected to create time travel with his imagination/self-hypnosis and this will be used by the government to change what they want to change in the past.  It was a well-constructed novel based on factual historical events in New York in the late 1800s.  There was a rumor that the story was going to be made into a movie by Robert Redford, but that fell through. Now, I have turned to read \"Speak,  Memory\" by Vladimir Nabokov because...well, why not go back in time with a great author? It is an autobiography.  He begins recreating his first impressions of his life way back into toddler-hood.  What an impressive memory he has. It reveals lovely patterns of existence and symbolism in the context of the turn of the Century in Russia in a wealthy family.  In the prologue he explains that all of this was edited by intense give and take from older siblings and other friends who seem to remember some of it far differently than he does.   \" I have journeyed back in thought---with thought hopelessly tapering off as I went---to remote regions where I groped for some secret outlet only to discover that the prison of time is spherical and without exits.\" That is the fugitive of time.  We see one creative side and another set of eyes that passed with us through that same window will throw cold water on that memory washing away a rosy color from our glasses and coming up with evidence of something very different.  It is almost as if our memories of our past life are \"but a dream.\" OK. ENOUGH with the song lyrics. Nabokov also said \"The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.\"  Well with that depressing perspective I will admit I can now move forward with fewer expectations on the importance of my leaving a memory or even a footprint!\"Initially, I was unaware that time, so boundless at first blush, was a prison. In probing my childhood (which is the next best to probing one’s eternity) I see the awakening of consciousness as a series of spaced flashes, with the intervals between them gradually diminishing until bright blocks of perception are formed, affording memory a slippery hold.\"  Nabakov again.Above is a photo looking back to our dock, a memory for this year. Our first venture across the water in almost a year since the recreational boating lock-down was lifted this holiday weekend.  My husband was thrilled and I brought a book in case he had luck at his old fishing hole."},

At what point of psychological and economic degradation is that quality unacceptable and is the life worth putting at risk? What number of lives, if any, is it OK to endanger so that a much higher number of lives can be bettered? What’s the higher number? And how should betterment be defined?Sweden’s herd-immunity approach provided one set of answers. Michigan’s lockdown provided another. Whichever fork a given place or population takes, it’s making a profoundly moral decision.A friend of mine recently asserted that no matter the Covid-19 data in July and August, all college campuses should welcome students back for the fall semester because young people aren’t the primary victims of Covid-19; because the current disruption to their lives, if prolonged, could strain them in ways that haunt their futures; and because they have so much future ahead of them. They warrant a little extra consideration.Implicit in that reasoning is that older people, who are vulnerable if the resumption of business as usual spreads the virus, warrant a little less.There’s no way to sugarcoat that, and there’s no point in being anything less than wholly honest about the implications of the transcendently difficult choices before us.\"  Frank Bruni,  New York TimesSomeone on Facebook responded thus:\"Wonder what it costs for a two week stay in ICU? Families then have to bury their loved one. Legal fees for will probate. Cemetery plot if one is available.All that expense and suffering. And then, medical people that spent fortune to train. Throwing it into the bonfire to care for humanity.If we are reducing this to a matter of money, then the answer is NO. The economy will recover anyway. Your portfolio will eventually go back up. Yearly profits will not be as high. But the human cost is unspeakable. The children left without a parent. That price is too high and the economy is not worth needless deaths.

Even our host on our tour boat gave a talk comparing the culture of the west and the east and admitted to longing for the day when his children would not have to shelter inside due to days of heavy air pollution.  The majority of China's energy comes from cheaper coal. In late January many Americans thought the Chinese were being wussy wearing their masks everywhere.  Many Americans did not comprehend the virus at all. When the pandemic first started to spread here on our continent you would see the occasional mask being worn by an elder or someone you assumed was immune-compromised or something else.  In early March even I went to the store in our rural area without a mask and saw 15% wearing some face covering.  Many of us felt it was probably overkill.  Consistently, the government said we didn't need masks but just needed to distance.  I felt in the back of my mind that this was really so that people did not rush out to buy and hoard the N95 masks. There was a back and forth for weeks on how \"aerosolized\" the virus could be.  There were articles on how far heavy spittle and sneeze drops actually traveled.  Then the scientists' admission (still somewhat controversial) about tiny virus particles traveling distances or hanging in the air for hours.  Whether these tiny vapors are strong enough to be a contagion is still being explored.  Public bathrooms are the absolute worst place to expose yourself as heavy concentrations of the virus were found in patients' bathrooms and areas of heavy use in the reception areas of hospitals. Then States started to turn the corner and ask people to cover their faces with anything if they went out shopping.  This eventually morphed in laws requiring masks in some areas...such as mine.  Suddenly masking was taken seriously by those snowflakes who follow the science.  Others were blatant deniers but felt they needed to public carry automatic weapons for protection instead.  I will not digress on this flat-earth mentality. I had two boxes of N95 masks from Home Depot.  One from a time when we were painting and doing sanding work.  Another from an order I made in early January as a precaution.  I gave away the unopened box of 10 masks to our local Fire Department as the Pandemic grew.  Part of the other box I sent to the family for their protection and the rest I put in zip-locks to be used in the car as I have lung issues and both hubby and I are in our mid-seventies.  Once worn they get aired in the car for 4 days and then re-used, which one medical site recommended for those using it much more heavily than we do. Now the last day of April you will see all kinds of masks with varying degrees of protection being sold in ads or home-made by volunteer groups.  Asia is selling tons of them on Facebook (and probably other social venues) with little facts on how effective they are.  Cotton, batik cotton and quilting fabrics are the best for homemade but should use a wire to fit across the nose which prevents air escape as well as glasses fogging.  They caution against non-natural fabrics and I have found nothing on silk scarves.  I have some quilting and some batik materials but I do not like the ties so am waiting for elastic which I ordered a few days ago.  When I make these I can distribute to those who want or need them and we can use them in the future. As with any product that is needed masks have become customized.  Sports teams, hobbies, pet breeds, and even hand lettering with the initials of the wearer are being made.  Never let it be said that entrepreneurs will miss a sales opportunity! In my vanity, I have noticed that you do not need lipstick anymore if you head outside to get mail or food.  If you are female you do not need to brush your hair too much.  By the time the straps are in place, your hair will look reasonably pathetic anyway. Well stay safe out there and make sure you bring home the correct spouse after your shopping trip...we are all starting to look alike out there.Please explain this label to me..!"},

I am not the type of person that can just toss something off the top of my head...well, I can, but it will sound like one of our President's monologues and people will quit reading here and leave scratching their heads.  It seems that washing vegetables, washing the mail, nurturing my spring seedlings, nurturing the perennials I had ordered with our unusually cold spring, keeping up with the laundry that may or may not be covered in virus, keeping in closer touch with family and friends who are near and far, and trying to plan meals with half the ingredients is taking up all my time and keeping me exhausted.I should be less busy.  But I had two Zoom meetings and about two dozen emails with tasks in the last week. I continue to order food online and that is harder than it sounds.  These online activities are exhausting for someone of my ancient age.  It took me two hours just to organize one of my email boxes so that I did not lose important emails to the great black hole where all emails eventually go. I am exhausted from trying to log in to a Zoom meeting, realizing only my laptop has a camera (who in the hell needs to see my witchy hairstyle these days?), finding I have to go to the bedroom where it is quieter, finding the bedroom internet is not strong enough and trying to take notes when every 5th,6th, and 7th word is lost in static!  Then I came across this article from National Geographic explaining why Zoom meetings are so tiring for many but not all.  My daughter (who is not one of those meme crazy ladies and certainly not one of those chain challenge idiots) got me involved in a 10 days, 10 photos, 10 friends challenge on Facebook.  I spend hours trying to find meaningful photos and thinking about which 10 friends I would select...usually determined by which photos I find.  My daughter's birthday was Friday and she and her family had planned all kinds of things to do.  Online games with friends, a parking lot happy hour where they will remain 10 feet apart and eat and drink sitting in the trunks of their cars, and a movie night--online.  They just purchased a huge trampoline that takes up their entire backyard and the kids are in such good health using that.  My granddaughter has been heartbroken that she is no longer participating in cheer competitions with all the tumbling and balancing, and this is great for her.I also was selected to participate in a View From My Window group on Facebook.  Fascinating photos of ALL types from people's windows around the globe as they shelter in place.  I am sure the administrators of this group will have a good book someday.  Through this group, I see bitterly cold winters, soft gentle spring views, and finally, some hot summer desert views.  I see lake views (pools, oceans, rivers) contrasting with high rise cities and barren alley views from all the continents and islands of the world.  Some of the best \"window\" views include animals---giraffes, monkeys, kangaroos, parrots, lambs, horses, etc.  (I guess I am spending too much time with this group.)Today I am nervous as I will have to try to log-in to a live FB presentation and I still do not know how to do it.  I failed with the test yesterday.  I am supposed to support the person doing the presentation as a back-up to answer questions.  Since I am not the only support person, I guess they will survive if I do not figure this mess out.I will leave you with a photo of the 'view from my window' but this is not the one I uploaded to the group.  I was in too much of a hurry and just selected something from my image catalog.  Yes, I dusted the table."},

The credit for this meme above can be found in Messimimi's comments at the bottom of the previous post if you want to know who and how this came about.The young girl above is paddling down our river on April 8.  The water temps in the 40's and air temps in the 50's.  We just lost two members of the Kennedy family canoeing on the Chesapeake and not wearing dry suits or their Personal Floatation Devices. A mother and an 8-year-old son.  Their death was attributed to rough waves but also very cold water in the 40s.  Note where she is keeping her life jacket! The more significant changes caused by this virus is that when you force mankind to remain indoors for significant periods of time, the world begins to slowly recover from its scars and pollution that we have wrought.Mobs of monkeys are roaming the streets of Japan.Venice's canals have become clear once again because silt is not being stirred up by traffic.  (One rumor is that dolphins have returned.  This was not true and photos in social media were dolphins swimming off the canals in Sardinia which is not an unusual phenomenon.)Lions did sleep on the roadways at South Africa's Kruger national park because of the lack of traffic.The air pollution in Europe, China and around the world has become less.  The countries with lots of asthma cases (China) can now see blue skies.Elk have invaded Banff town as their tourist industry falls into great decline.  You can see it here as well.The earth is actually vibrating less due to the lockdown.  Earth tremors can be more accurately measured closer to developed areas.One thing that is not happening is that birds ARE NOT louder.  Just seems that was with the diminishing of noise pollution and people being forced to stay at home!(You may not be able to get to all of these links if they are geographically or subscription-restricted.)Have a peaceful, stressfree weekend!"},

{"title": "Too  Much of a Good Thing?", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2020", "text": "Apologies as I have not been around to read my Bloggers (you folks) as much as I would like to.  I have been busy cornering the market on milk, ricotta cheese, eggs, spreadable butter, real butter, and coffee creamer.  On the odd chance you might be interested in how to do this I will explain.Last week on Tuesday I ordered the above through an online service called InstaCart where local people who have a car and need income go to the grocery to shop for you.  Once the shopping has started they ping your phone when they want to substitute a product for something not on the shelves. These shoppers can be teenagers who have never shopped in a grocery store or others who have experience and will map out the aisles to be the most efficient.  I got two pounds of strawberries on the last order, which I do not remember selecting!  Anyway, you are looking over their shoulder sometimes when they send a photo of the partially empty shelf with alternative products.  You can tip up to 25% for the driver.  I do that and also leave money in an envelope on the porch where they deliver as cash is probably more important to them. You are instantly messaged to your phone once the order is on its way. The first order came fine even  though  it was missing a few items and had the strawberries.My second order, I needed dairy type products.  I made my order online and waited for a few days and never got any response.  They do not guarantee a short or quick delivery.  Usually, you have a four-day delivery window and they can deliver as late as 9:00 P.M.  This tool to avoid the virus requires patience.Since some times had passed, I was concerned the order was not completed, so I went in and ordered once again.  This time I got thrown off the internet as we lost electricty due to that nasty front that came across the  East Coast.  By afternoon the power came back on and I went through the whole process again ordering my dairy stuff.I know my brilliant readers are waaaay ahead of me on this.  I got the order two days later.  Then the very next morning after that I got the same order again!  And the morning after that I found the same order on my front porch!  For elders this ordering online is a little crazy.  I will pay for it all, as it was my fault, I guess.  If I do not go to the store, I will be much more careful.Now I have reached out to provide this free food to my friends.  I managed to get rid of one dozen extra eggs to a friend who is in her 80's and confined to her retirement campus.  She is a former nutritionist and probably one of the best bakers I have ever met.  She left me a little surprise of her culinary talents after I dropped the eggs off.I finally had to freeze some because everyone I contacted was stocked!  My freezer is now also overstocked.Next hubby Instant Messaged our gardener fellow who lives with his mother and I  told hubby to tell him he had to take all of the order!  He is coming today to get it, I hope!I was going to make an Italian cheesecake with the Ricotta.  Can you freeze ricotta?  By the way, do you need anything?"},

Some days I can be very Zen and so thankful that spring is abundantly showing off everywhere in my area.  I am truly happy that I am ahead of the curve on weeding, frozen foods, paper products, chocolate, and phone calls.  This is the valley in the ride.Then I get to the start of a hill.  I had my first Zoom meeting today with a volunteer group.  I actually had to change out of PJs (at least the tops), wash my face, put on some make-up, and brush and blow dry my hair as it is getting heavy and missing its haircut!  Then I had to figure out how to link to the meeting.  I started 5 minutes early and FINALLY after multiple missed attempts did some corrections in the mass list of ID and Password and other entries that would not validate and logged in only 5 minutes late!  The damn meeting was an hour and a half long. It was very productive and I managed to get volunteered for only one or two things to do.This is what I use to cut hubby's hair and he looks great!Now, this introvert is exhausted from just that, BUT this afternoon I have to get in the car and mail some face masks to my son, pick up the mail, and drive my car around in the country to charge the battery.  It does not like sitting idle for days.  Hubby is thrilled to go for a car ride.  Does he remind you of your pet?Since hubby has been outside working more, he is creating more laundry.  He did a wash yesterday and is folding it today.  I am holding my breath and letting him fold clothes...egad.  That is the downhill, cannot-keep-up side of this ride.  Relearning PowerPoint to convert to a .jpg to put on the gardening FB page is also much more challenging than it seemed to be years ago.  And what I have to post is time-sensitive.I am totally bored with my cooking.  Totally.  And we have a larger variety of foodstuffs than most.  I just want some salty fatty food from a restaurant.  My next job is to call the restaurant and place a take-out order.  This is exhausting for me and a little nerve-racking.Above is an odd meal I cooked the other night.  Kentucky BBQ chicken, Boiled Japanese Daikon radish with ginger and oyster sauce, and some curry-flavored stir fry vegetables.  I order bi-weekly veggies and must find ways to use these.My dreams stay with me longer.  They are odd and usually involve me trying to keep up on some trips or meet-up with others in some tight time frame.Then we reach the valley once again when I read an article that says this virus was probably in China in mid-November as they had an unusual uptick in flu cases.  (You may remember that we left China the last week of October!)  So I can be thankful for that dodging of the bullet. Now that I have erupted in verbal chaos, just exactly how is your day going?"},
{"title": "A Harump Followed by Something Worthwhile", "date": "Friday, April 03, 2020", "text": "Learning to live in the time of Coronavirus is not easy for those who are inflexible or sorta-flexible or just plain privileged. While commercial fishing is allowed, our governor has banned recreational boating.  This has resulted in a 15,000 signature petition for him to lift it if boats agree to stay 50 feet apart, only family members on board and no parties on beaches.  It is hard for good old boys to give up such a hobby and I can understand why.  I am sure the state had images of beer parties and boats rafted together, or remote beach parties, etc.  Also, they did not want their DNR officers spending time on drunken get-togethers on the water when they need to focus on other stuff. Hubby can canoe and kayak as that is considered exercise, so he is not totally dismayed.  Our governor survived cancer and has a good knowledge of medical science, but elected by the GOP, the Trumpers are getting mad at him for taking away their 'rights'.  (The right to infect the nation if they want.)  I have learned that many (at least those on FB, Twitter or the media) conservatives are ALWAYS suspicious of science and think scientists are members of some dark-state cult.  Pray for those scientists that stand behind the President at each daily briefing and manage to not strangle him while subtly contradicting what he says to keep us alive.We also learned that we can no longer work in the children's garden to raise food for the free pantry.  It seems that the University will not allow volunteers (Master Gardeners) to work on their own.  The property is owned by the museum and they do not mind, although they have pretty much shut down their offices.  The director of the museum told us yesterday that she is now employed at one hour a week!! Other Master Gardener projects can continue.  One is run by a church and its volunteers are not part of the MSG program and the garden is on church property.  A larger food garden is run by an environmental organization and pays its staff...so that is considered agriculture which is exempted from the Shelter in Place edict, even though MSGs are part of it.  Hubby is bereft that he has planted seedlings in trays and cannot transplant to the children's garden!  I have begged him not to chance it because there is a 5,000 dollar fine!  I am pretty sure they would waive it, but still.  How would he weed and water weekly anyway?My online grocery orders arrive with about 70% of what I order.  The only things missing are the things I really need like milk and butter!  I may have to mask up and go to the grocery,  now that the CDC is recommending masks...after all this time...!  I dropped off the larger portion (10) of my N95 masks to the local Fire Chief in a dash grab process, but retained a small supply in the event we do get sick.My freezer is full as is my fridge and I cannot complain if I run out of necessities like coffee, chocolate or wine.  I will grow in character...some people have run out of shelter, food and the ability to see their loved ones.But, having written all of this, I have an excellent uplifting video on the virus.

We are elderly but fairly active and do not see ourselves as elderly...this has been a strong reminder of how few years we have left on this earth.Every news report we fall into the \"vulnerable\" category.I am close to my children, but we do not talk sometimes for months and that has changed to texting and phone calls several times weekly as they check up on us!My husband's fishing buddy (in his late 50's) who calls maybe twice a year is stuck at his condo in Colorado and called to make sure we are doing well and to remind us his son, who lives near us, can be called upon for any assistance we might need.  Then he tells us his wife's father passed away last week due to the virus...My next-door neighbor (newly moved in) also offers us assistance if we need it.  He is in his late 50s.Our intermittent helper (gardening and such--the man released from prison last year) calls before he comes to help with mulch and asks if he can bring anything from the store for us.My own brother ( a real introvert) who never calls me unless we are on travel together and trying to coordinate something or pick a place for a meetup, called to see how we were doing!I am ordering expensive frozen dinners online as a break to cooking.  When I say expensive...it is like eating out without all the ambiance and wine but the same bill.  I also think the serving sizes are much like TV dinners and not going to satisfy hubby.I spend much of my time washing things...not clothes or dishes...but mail, food packages, prescription bottles, and of course, my hands.We worked in the children's garden today and I discovered that you have no impulse to touch your face when your hands are covered in dirt.

My mind is racing as I lay in bed and stare at the shadowed ceiling...why did I wake up?  Hmmm...  Oh, yes! I forgot to put the food recycle-bags that I had washed into the dryer and we are going food shopping this morning.Dragging myself out of the warm covers, I put the bags in the dryer and go to make some coffee.  At 5:20 the alarm goes off and I go in to wake my husband.  He seems unenergetic and slow and then tells me he thinks he may have an eye infection!!  I make him get up, wash his face, and then wash the eye with saltwater.  It does not look too bad so we do not cancel our morning plans.  (The eye was better by the afternoon.)The grocery told us, elders, to get there at 6:00 A.M. when they open so that we can shop without lines and maybe have a chance of finding things.  It is bleak and dark outside.  A slight drizzle with cold weather and seems like we are leaving for a trip to the airport instead of just a weekly errand to the village.  I get the mail from the counter to take to the P.O.  We do not have rural delivery and thus have to hit the Post Office twice to thrice weekly.  Hubby has been having trouble starting \"my\" car and I have been seeing him double start even after the dash says Power On!  I am concerned with his concentration these days and greater confusion with technology.  After arguing with him I make him give me the driver's seat.  The computer in the car is clearly not working well.  After finally getting the car to turn off completely which takes several shifts, pushing off the start button, and even opening and closing car doors, I wait a bit and then start it as I normally do and it works!!  Good thing we are getting an early start.We head to the Post Office since the grocery will not be open for another fifteen minutes.  I pull into the empty parking lot and the Post Office is well lit.  I push the off button, but the car does not seem to go off.  I do not worry but hurry inside to deposit and get mail.   When I put the virus covered mail and a medium box of snack peanuts and chocolate I ordered from Amazon in the back seat. I try to start the car.  It takes five minutes this time.  I am frustrated as it is hard to see the car settings, etc. in the dark morning.  I rarely drive at night because of this.  Something is clearly wrong and I am just getting ready to call a tow when I turn the car off and we sit for 5 minutes.  I try again one final time and it works!  It is a computer problem.We optimistically head to the store and I try not to think about the possibility of ice cream melting in the trunk if we load it with groceries and have to wait for a tow.  I have turned the lights to auto, and other stuff to my original settings and tell my husband to please not touch all the settings.  He is feeling bad and I am feeling bad and oh hell...We get two carts and wipe down the handles, sides, etc. and our hands with wipes I carry in my purse.  An Asian elder rounds the corner followed by his Caucasian wife.  They both smile and I smile back and ask her if she brought coffee.  She says her hubby has already had his coffee and I am wondering if she did not realize I was attempting a joke.  Something I do when I am nervous and frustrated.  (It isn't until much later I wonder if the Asian man is feeling the prejudice or does he always smile?)The store is quiet and everyone is polite and keeping their distance.  For the first time since this nightmare started, I see some customers wearing gloves and a few elders wearing masks.  I find most of what I want except bleach.  I am down to half a gallon and use it to wash my veggies.  I hurry past the produce section as I got my first order of produce online yesterday.  (I had opened the box outside, brought in veggies and fruit and dumped them all in a sink of bleach water for about three minutes, rinsed them thoroughly, let them air dry and put them away.  I get little choice in what they deliver, but it will help me stretch my cooking imagination to prepare veggies I do not like.)Remembering what produce I got, I select bananas and strawberries in the store and celery.  I have a feeling that this ordering online will not deliver the more fragile berries, tomatoes, etc. I zoom my cart past toward the meat.  Hubby cannot eat red meat due to his allergy so it is all turkey, duck, and chicken.  I have plenty of seafood in the freezer but the fresh seafood counter is totally closed.  I see the paper products aisle is 90% empty but I do not need any of that anyway and hurry on to the other aisles.Hubby has taken a second shopping list and the second cart and is on his way to the opposite side of the store for the dairy.    We buy more ice cream these days to handle our boredom.  I cannot live without coffee creamer and have 3 jars now!We get everything we want except the bleach.  I get to the counter with only one cart ahead of us.  The elder customer in front of us says that it is nice the store sets aside time for us old folks.  When she has paid, I put up my recyclable grocery bags on the counter and assure the clerk that I have just washed them.  Her response indicates she does not really care, or perhaps did not hear.  We talk lightly about the pandemic and she admits that she is immune-compromised.  She is a young thing in her 20s.  As we wheel our two half-filled carts away I hear the customer behind me ask the clerk if she is holding up under this virus panic.  Everyone seems to care about the vulnerable.Both of us load the trunk quickly as the rain is now starting up again getting everything wet.I get into the car which starts exactly as it is supposed to and we head home.  Lots of Lysol wipes on most things such as door handles, car steering wheel, etc. and then we wash our hands after everything has been put away.  I think we are good for 7-10 days.  This whole experience made me realize how tense we are.  I felt as if I had just caught the last plane out of Cuba and all it was was a weekly errand!  And this will probably go on for a month or two more..."},

It is  a bit frustrating if you are very social and  love your  meet-ups.  It is a bit frustrating if you participate in  social sports or even gym activities, but making a sacrifice to save lives is not all that difficult!  My daughter lets her  little girl out to ride bikes with a good friend a few times each week.  They are told to stay 6 feet apart when  talking.  My granddaughter must have some social connections at the age of 12,but who knows if she understands the seriousness of all this. That is  her life overseen  by her parents.  She spends the rest of her freetime on  the snapchat APP of her phone or doing her homework online.  She is not a stellar student, but also someone who will make it through  school  as above average. My oldest grandson is a teenager and smart enough to be able to handle the homework in an efficient manner and  spends too  much time playing online games.  He is very close to his uncle, my son, so they connect electronically at the end of the workday.The youngest is nine and tries to keep up with his teenage brother but is somewhat lost because team sports have been the  central  part of his life outside of school.I do not  think any of my family realizes how  long this hunkering down is going to last.  I  have restricted my going  out to maybe twice a week...maybe once more as we do  not get rural  delivery of mail.  I wipe the mail down with a bleach  and  water cloth  and let it sit for a short time before I open itI am now getting my vegetables and fruit via delivery.  Getting the first box in  two  days.  We  will see how that goes.  I may try to get all my groceries via delivery.  My neighbor and I are planning  on leaving the box  outside the house and bringing stuff in to clean in the house.  Yard workers and delivery do not come into  the house.  I am certainly hoping we do not need repairs.  My friend 's refrigerator just died and she got new one.  On that same day, Best Buy, which sells appliances, emailed all  its customers that they will sell and deliver appliances, but no longer install them!  They will get them to  the front door and the rest is up to you.We planted spring potatoes in the volunteer children's garden, but not  sure if  or when community children can help us harvest.  It was just hubby and I.  We  canceled the get-together with volunteers  to pre-plant all the vegetables in small trays to  place under grow lights and hubby spent  4 hours doing  it  himself in the basement.My daughter  had planned a long weekend  in the nearby mountains  with us, but the cabin owners canceled and refunded the money.  My son and his wife planned a weekend with us at the C&O canal in a cabin.  That is in May and might very well  be cancelled.  We have a late June trip where my husband was going to take the oldest grandson on a SCUBA diving trip to the Bahamas.  My son was going also.   I was going just to make the the three males behaved themselves.  That is farther away in time, but I will not be surprised if flying out of the country is unadvisable in June!So life is a bit of a bore.  Even our brief  consideration of taking a chance drive up to see the cherry blossoms has been  canceled as D.C. said too many people were enjoying them!  Even  though they are all outdoors, it was too crowded.We still  have the  local parks with their hiking  trails, but hubby and I do not know if they are crowded as this weather warms.  We will have to see in the days ahead.Mage from Postcards From the Edge is back blogging after her lengthy illness.  But she returns to the pandemic that has us all staying home.  It is good to read her \"postscards\" once  again, though.  Blog connections with you all are more important than ever,  helping us realize that life goes on and we can keep each others spirits up virtually with  absolutely no exchange of bacteria or  virus!"},

Except the young man that came last week stayed for three hours and I was worn out by then.  This was just a few days before we all have decided to stay home. Last week we had our last meet-up with someone who had requested a yard visit regarding issues with drainage and protection of nearby water flow areas.  Hubby was enthusiastic in his response with all his advice until the lady politely stepped back and said, \"I'm sorry, but I am trying to make some distance between us here.\"  Hubby smiled and stepped back.  This virus is hard for him in so many silly ways.Therefore, this mandate by our Governor to not hold meetings or go out to gyms or restaurants, etc. has left a big hole in my husband's days.  He watches cable news, he gardens, he even ran 4 miles on the elliptical today, but all of it is him pacing, pacing, pacing.  I, on the other hand, am relieved that all those meetings got canceled.  I hate going to them anyway.  I love people, I really do.  But they are like hot sauce for me.  A little goes a long way.I visited the grocery store today for weekly shopping and was somewhat surprised at how bare everything was.  Freezers were 80% empty and paper products the same.  There was even a small dent in the fresh meat counter and the seafood counter was empty.  I got enough to survive another week.  The store was about 30% full of customers and everyone was hesitant and cautious but polite.  I am out of analgesics and was going to get some Ibuprophan but a lady next to me said she also needed that and since there was only one box, I told her to take it.  It is not something that will mean life or death for me...and it may be important to her.  I did get the last sack of flour, because ...well cookies...that is sort of life and death.Today I am editing a report hubby wrote before we send it on to someone else for approval.  But before this, I played with some spring photos.  Hoping what I post below brings you some peace of mind in this murmuring chaos."},

I understand, folks, that he does sound racist, but it is just \"straight talk.\"Anyway, I am sure you all have moved your laptops to the sink so you can wash your hands every 15 minutes while blogging, but be sure you do not knock the electronics into the sink.  I am not the genius that our illustrious leader is, but I do grasp the concept of water and electricity as something not good!      If you are flying and wearing a mask, please let all us bloggers know how you are handling the eating and drinking part.  I have a plane trip in June and I am guessing this may not be on the wane by then.I actually like the elbow bump greeting and the bowing greeting as one is joyously young and reflective: a coolness and the other is proper and dignified.  I think I can pull off either at my garden meeting next week.  On February 26 the President said the following:  \"[W]hen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that's a pretty good job we've done.\"  As of March 8 and 15 minutes of the writing, we now have 500 cases of Covid 19 in the U.S.  He is a genius, but not a whiz at math.  One of the cases is just 60 miles north of where I live.Am I panicking?  Not for me or even for my family.  I do panic for that younger minimum wage worker that has to meet the public every day and who has no healthcare.  He/she just needs to hold on until the GOP brings that Replace part of the Repeal for their healthcare.  It is unfortunate they could not get it passed when they had control of both Houses of Congress for two years.  Now the politicians have brought it down to theater like wearing gas masks during sessions of Congress.  (Course that guy has a few drunk driving issues, so I understand why a virus would be a joke for him.)I may very well get it--the virus.  I mean just count how many times you touch something that someone else has touched on a normal day out...your credit card, the gas pump, the door handles of every building you enter, the buttons on elevators, the faucets and toilet handles, the glasses the waitress/waiter places on your table, the plates that are touched on the edges by God knows how many people, the seat rails on trains and metros, the handrails of escalators and stairs.  Even every can of beans, carton of milk, a container of eggs and container of gum may have been handled just a few hours before by someone who is asymptomatic or just slightly tired and fighting the virus.  Of course, they recommend that you wear gloves, but I also know that I am very touchy-feely with my face!  Spend an hour and count how many times you want to scratch your nose or wipe your eyes.Are you terrified yet?  One woman at a Trump rally quoted a Psalm explaining why she had no fear and that she would be safe.  I do not know my Bible...not even sure where that lovely white tome with the gold edges is...!  I am sure I could not find the Psalm and God just shakes his head at me when I ask questions, although Psalms was my favorite when I was a teenager.Well, we got an email today from a woman who was supposed to go on our wood duck box maintenance trek and said she had to bow out.  She had met up with some friends who had been on travel several days ago and yesterday she had a sore throat and was feeling \"pecky\".  Keep me posted and for certainty...move that laptop aside and go wash you hands."},

My daughter-in-law was in Nashville this week for work and slept through the tornado! It did not damage her hotel, thankfully. She was not aware of the tragedy until breakfast the next day. She dodged that bullet! Many young children died or were injured, it seems. My daughter is flying to Nashville for work this coming Monday for her company.  I never know where my family is on their various work trips, and maybe that is a good thing.  As the current Coronavirus spreads there will be more teleconferencing, I am hoping.  It is only a matter of time before the virus reaches our state.  You can see Johns Hopkins' COVID map that shows it appears at entry points to the US.  My state has finally put up a map on testing.  There is so little testing going on, that the numbers will be sure to climb when they test.  Fortunately young and middle-aged healthy people will probably not be deathly ill but will have to be prepared to miss several weeks of work.While buying some make-up remover packets in the drugstore a few days ago, I stood behind a stocky black man neatly dressed in a state sports jersey and a knit cap.  He was buying a package of cigarettes.  He reached deep in his pocket for the needed remaining 30 cents in change, spilling coins onto the floor.  He handed the clerk a coin the size of a quarter and she said it was not valid currency, perhaps some chip from a game(?), as she handed it back.  He reached in his other pockets and still could not come up with the needed 30 cents.  He finally said he would go check his car and come back.  I stood wooden Indian still refusing to help him as I hate the cigarette habit.  I looked him in the eye with my best stern grandma look as he turned and said I was sorry I could not help him, but I did not like that dangerous habit.  He smiled politely and then hubby, who is ever the good Samaritan even if it means buying poison, reached in his pocket and brought out the change.  The black man thanked him and looked sheepishly my way before he turned and walked to the door.  Such an addictive danger.Super Tuesday of 1/3 of the primary states' voting determines whom I vote for before I even get a chance to vote.  My first two choices already dropped out!  My third choice was not super strong.  I will vote blue no matter who, but I wish the system was not so crazy. I have gardeners coming next week to plant trays of seeds for my husband's project and I have to clean the basement before they sprinkle planting soil all over it...I also should make cookies...spring is coming closer each day."},
{"title": "Being Prepared", "date": "Friday, February 28, 2020", "text": "I think we all try to be prepared as much as possible.  When you reach a certain age you have exercised your preparedness muscle so that it seems to kick in instinctually.  But even being prepared for the gut punch that you know is coming, does not mean you will be able to duck in time and it does not mean you will not feel it very painfully.That little nine-year-old girl died two days ago.  She was in days of drugged pain while parents sat by her bedside and held her hand.  They saw it coming.  It had followed a chemical respite that allowed trips to Disney World and trips to Children's House and the repainting of her bedroom to look like a Panda jungle.  Now they face the weekend planning a funeral and returning on Monday to that other life that had been put on hold for months.  But they were prepared, right? (no.)  They knew what was coming. I know that death is in the future of my husband and I as we move toward our eighth decade on this planet.  One of us will probably go first and the other needs to be prepared.  I see some really strong and smart widows (at least 3) that move through their lives as if tomorrow is far in the future and the past is but a distant memory.  All three of them were leaders in their careers or society before they lost their spouse.  I am so unlike them.  I never saw myself as a homebody, but in reality, I am.  I watch each of them closely to gain some learning.  It is hard. We all need to be prepared for this Coronavirus that is certainly a Pandemic, although the profiteers won't let the scientists call it that yet.  But this is very hard to prepare for because our diagnostic capabilities are poor, we have no idea how many people across the globe, and even in our country, who have caught the virus, survived and assumed they just had a cold and went on to spread the virus to others.  We have no idea if and when a vaccine will be created and if it will work for all of us and if we can afford it. I am not terrified, but I have ordered the N95 virus masks so I have a small collection in the event that I need to go out and about if we are under a \"shelter in place\" advisory.  I have lung issues and it takes weeks for me to shake colds that move into my lungs.  I get allergies even in winter that gives me sneezing fits and coughing.  Nowadays that action can send people fleeing from your side!  I have antiseptic wipes that I carry in my purse, but I have always used these mostly in the winter to wipe down shopping cart handles and bathroom doors, etc.  I will not use public restrooms if I can help it, as the hand dryers are notorious for spewing germs (bacteria) into the air.  I have antiseptic wipes in my kitchen since we have had food infection outbreaks for years in this country and I wipe down counters and wash vegetables carefully. I am as prepared as I can be.  I have a plan to attend a large assembly of cheer girls at a nearby convention center.  This will be at the end of March.  I also am prepared to not go and to argue with my granddaughter and daughter if I think they should stay home if the news changes dramatically in our area.  My son is taking his two nephews to a big gathering of gamers in another section of town on the same day.  I am not prepared for them getting ill, but I have the knowledge that the odds are in their favor to not get deathly ill. I am not prepared for car crashes, airplane accidents, burglars, or a tragic slip and fall.  Life happens and I am prepared to enjoy each and every day I am given.  I have no choice.  I also find that spending one's life ducking from gut punches leaves one hunched over and staring at the ground all the time."},

This lovely rescue granddog came to visit this past weekend.  She was adopted at about 8 months old.  They do not have a history of her, but know she came through several states by van to get here and therefore, seems to have a terror of traveling in cars.  She also is adjusting to being left alone.  We left her behind when I took the kids shopping at our local discount store.  When I returned I was greeted by this!The other shoe was far worse!  These are my go-to shoes for running outside to grab a photo and thus slip on quickly.  I have owned them for years!!

{"title": "My Weekend Review", "date": "Sunday, February 16, 2020", "text": "This past weekend my husband purchased tickets to the Folger Shakespeare Theater in Washington, DC.  We could not get good reservations at any of the better restaurants because it was Valentine's Eve and that meant you had to make your reservations months in advance.  We instead ate at a cozy pub called the Hawk and Dove.  It bills its theme as an intelligent place to argue politics since they are fairly close to the Capital/Congress. There were icons of selected Presidents on one wall, but not any of the recent ones. I ordered rib eye (since we no longer cook red meat at home) and it was melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I also ordered a nice Bourbon cocktail as that is the only thing I drink in a \"cozy pub.\" Hubby had a shrimp pasta scampi meal which he devoured.  I did not take photos, but it was all brown wood and coziness.  Our meal was at 6:10 which is early and thus the place was not crowded but not empty with just the right amount of subdued friendly noise.  For us country mice it was the perfect city experience. I get anxious at these trips to the city because it is months between times using my Uber app and I had to update my credit card with them as well.  The app is much more friendly and intuitive than it used to be.  We drove to my daughter's house and decided to take a taxi to the restaurant from my daughter's house which cost $27 and the taxi was late picking us up!  We Ubered to the theater about 4 blocks up after the meal.  We Ubered to my daughter's home after the performance and that cost $17 and we only waited 5 minutes in the bitter cold at 10:30 P.M. for the ride to show!  The app asked if we were willing to share the ride and we would be picked up sooner.  With temps in the mid 20's F and a breeze, I was cold and quickly clicked yes.  We shared with a very quiet middle-aged African American woman who only offered a friendly comment when I wished her a safe ride home as we exited first.  We are only going to Uber in the future as my daughter advised.  Cheaper and faster!   As you can see above, we got there about 10 minutes early.  It is a small theater and filled rapidly.  The play we saw was The Merry Wives of Windsor.  I do like Shakespeare while hubby not so much.  This was a perfect compromise because it was set in the 1970s and absolutely hilarious.  The beatnik costumes and hairstyles and music brought back those years warmly.  The acting was superb with enough broad body comedy to keep the pace moving.  They tried to stick to the olde English with occasional 1970's terms thrown in.  Certainly shows how universal Shakespeare was and is. Reminded me I needed to do this more often as I am getting old.  We were very fortunate as there would be only a few more weeks to see plays in this theater.  There was a two-year remodeling project in the future.  I hope they keep the character of the original architecture based on the traditional theater of Shakespeare productions.  It was funded by oil baron Henry Folger and his wife and also has a world-class library attached.  The building opened in 1932.  If you are interested in the history you can go to this page. In the next post I will talk about some shocking news I got the following day."},
{"title": "Waiting for the Unmasking", "date": "Wednesday, February 12, 2020", "text": "We are all linked together whether we like it or not.  The planet can be covered in man-made walls, but they will not make any difference because every country has different resources including the amount and types of labor and we will be forced to trade and exchange what is of value. According to a correspondent on National Public Radio, we get most of our surgical masks from China.  These are not the germicidal masks providing limited protection that you purchase in the drug store or the throw-away masks that the doctor's offices provide to protect their patients from YOUR sneezing if you are polite enough to wear them when you are ill.  No.  These are the tight-fitting disposable masks with two filters so that the doctor and nurse can breathe while not contaminating or getting contaminated by the germs in the operating room. Medical personnel will not operate without these masks due to lawsuits. Most of these masks are in very limited supply in the United States now.  We get our masks from China.  China has shut down their factories.  We get most of our generic drugs from China and we also get most of the basic chemical ingredients to make such drugs elsewhere from China.  We can hope we have seen the worst of this epidemic.  (We get lots of other stuff as well, but the medical supplies are most important.) Below is a photo of one of the American doctors that traveled with us to China as a tourist.  She has on a traveling mask with the double filter and she wore it because of the pollution in Beijing.  She and her doctor husband wore the masks during days that the pollution levels were beyond a certain point.  They checked the data on their watches each day.  Most of the rest of us did not.  One other woman had asthma and they gave her one of their masks.  The times that I saw locals wearing masks was when they went to the temples where there was lots of smoke from incense burning and smoke from the yak butter candles.  Mostly people were maskless.  China is known for shutting down its schools because of air pollution and this was bemoaned by our tourist guide who waited for the day China would have clean air regularly.  China is one of the worst polluters of the air on the planet.  Above is Tiananmen square on a fairly hazy day.  I am sure is mostly empty today."},

We are small in this grand universe and we are closely connected in many ways. Most of us want the same things---a fair chance, honest relationships, a bit of love, and the ability to contribute to mankind in some way.  (Unfortunately, a few of us are broken beyond repair as we can see in the daily news.) I was in China during the month of October last year (those who regularly read my blog have gotten a window into that trip already).  Therefore, I have followed the coronavirus news carefully and a few theories have come forward that the virus may have been moving through the population way back before December!  A small change in the calendar and my blog might have been written from somewhere else with much more dire news as I spent a few days in Wuhan, mostly traveling outside the city. I fell in love with the Chinese people as they are wonderfully simple and complex.  They are really very much like us.  I worry about the people I met and those who depend on travel from other countries to fill their restaurants, fill their hotels, eat their food and buy their handicrafts.  I took many photos during my time there and I have today gone through the first three days of our trip and focused on the people to share thinking about their livelihood and health.  So come along for a quick view of Chinese outside the city. (As usual, you can click on the photos for a bit larger view.)  This is a young woman (notice the long hair) setting out fishing traps along the three gorges section of the Yangtze River.  Far from the cities and night lights. A farm along the steep and unforgiving hillside.  I cropped closer for a better look.  I do not know if they live there or only work there in the day time.There is a calm resignation about their stance.These two men are killing time waiting for someone to rent their vehicle for the somewhat long and steep trip up the hill to the temple.  We walked, but I felt some guilt about that being the \"snowflake\" that I am.Three men, two look retired, and I think one is the shop owner.  They are watching the tourists stroll up to the tall Pagoda.  I think you could get a very different quote out of each of them if you have some imagination.Three Chinese tourists celebrating their success at reaching the top of the Pagoda.  If you can cross the bridge in three steps it means success or love.  They look just like American tourists in their joy.Hope you have enjoyed this little vignette on the locals."},

In reality, I have had nothing to say.   !But that has not stopped me before!   My health (ear infection) seems to be improving, but I am used to improved health before a week's end and not a month's end.  Part of my not posting is my depression over the State of the Union and no one wants to read about political opinions when you can get them on TV non-stop.  This President has been a gold mine for cable news.  I do wonder what they will hype about when he is gone.  (Although he does dream about changing that Constitutional restriction for re-election like the Chinese leader did!)  While the weather is also political, it is unusually warm here.  Days in the 50's and 60's with no snow.  It feels like northern Florida most of the time.  We do get the rare rainstorm, but it is also a little too dry for this time of year.  There have been only a few night freezes. I realize people need good news, so a dear sweet young man I know has just received two patents for his work on cybersecurity.  He worked day and night for 5 years and he is now wealthy and it is well deserved.  Continuing technology advances, the University of Toronto Scarborough has, for the first time, turned waste cooking oil—from the deep fryers of a local McDonald’s—into a high-resolution, biodegradable 3D printing resin. The Pope, yes THE Pope, has given an empty Vatican palace over to the homeless.  That is something to be celebrating, certainly.   They have discovered that putting patients in hyperbaric oxygen chambers can reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's.  (Maybe Michael Jackson was smarter than we thought.) \"According to a recently published Gallup poll—the first of its kind conducted in almost two decades—Americans visited the library far more than any other cultural institution in 2019.\"  That bastion of learning brought in 10.5 trips a year, more than sports events and movie theaters.

The first time today I feel better, so of course, the appointment is tomorrow when I will be back to normal.  I have been very lazy watching the soap opera that disguises itself as a Senate hearing...resembling nothing I have seen in Law and Order but much like Days of Our Lives.  Us elders can see the dust crumbling beneath the foundations of our Democracy.  Others seem to think it is much ado about nothing and all \"politics\". My son-in-law pointed out to me across the school gym a young mother that was wearing some slogan/protest T-shirt, perhaps Mom's against Guns.  I was not paying too much attention except that son-in-law seemed to find it \"quaint\" that I was like her, one of those angry protestors for many causes.  I wish I could find it quaint that he is unenlightened. I have the premonition that there will be much violence ahead in the election year and many months after.  Our President's own lawyer testified (before he went to jail) that change would only come via revolution. China has a tightly controlled society.  People are very well-behaved because they know the dangers of Chinese jails and the lack of fairness is not reasonable argument.  There is no freedom of the press there.  Their leader manipulated the bureaucracy so that he can be endlessly reinstated as a supreme leader.  Crime is low and hidden and corruption is how things get done. I read an article in The New Yorker that followed the probable history of the first diagnosis of a patient with coronavirus which began in Wuhan. (They guess it had to do with illegal live bat sales.)  The writer in The New Yorker got her details from an article in a Hong Kong magazine since the investigative press is suppressed with death in mainland China.  The bottom line is that everything is so controlled under a tight authoritarian regime that even public health officials could not step out of the procedure when they saw a disaster coming or at least questioned the danger.  It took over 24 hours for the first sick man to get any help at all. My Trump supporter acquaintance says that it is because China is a communist/socialist government and the government (some vague entity?) does not care about its citizens.  \"Let them die.\"  I disagree, but will not argue.  Authoritarian rule under the guise of socialism, communism, democracy, ecclesiastical , monarchy or whatever form of government is dangerous when only one voice and the following voices of its sycophants can be heard.  Free speech, free press, arguing in the city hall is always a safer way for all citizens. The photo above I probably posted before.  It was taken from our boat that anchored in Wuhan before our trip up the river.  Wuhan is a very large city. The city was all in lights because of the celebration of the 70th year of the formation of the PRC.  Keep the citizens focused on the bright lights!"},

I have no dizzy or orientation issues, but it does seem odd to hear a sound coming from my left side when the sound is taking place on the right!Now I think I understand what it is like for the hearing impaired and I admire their patience with themselves.  It is easy for hubby to sneak up on me in the shuffle of his soundless socks and it is easy for me to procrastinate doing all those things I do not want to do and instead read my book and play word games on Kindle.  It is an artificially enforced vacation.  I am retired and no longer need vacations from my life, which is a vacation.  I am lazy and use it as an excuse not to exercise or clean house or run errands.  (Of course with this flu expanding, I will avoid senseless trips to anywhere.)I do think about my earlier life when getting sick meant there were chores that still had to be done no matter how I felt, and people to care for no matter how I felt, and going to bed early was the only respite I could find.   I think of my busy daughter with her three children.  At least two are old enough now to cook for themselves a bit.Above my daffodils are emerging like the idiot energizer bunnies they are.

It gives hubby a chance to expound on his expertise.  He is slowing down in old age and the opportunity to be an expert at his age does not come often.  I think this visitor is starting some company for floating oyster rafts driven by solar power...should be interesting.Then we take a break for lunch and in the afternoon we are both listening to an online seminar given by a university in how to deal with nearby woodlands.  We are surrounded by woodlands and interested in ways we can keep them alive and healthy.  We had to pay for the course and its six seminars, but the hour can also be applied to our annual education requirement for our Master Gardener's group.  I may find interesting things to share on my blog for those who do not have time to take online courses.The woodlands have changed.  I see more woodpeckers and more dying trees.  The undergrowth has been eaten away by deer, but the deer have been winnowed by my neighbors hunting across the road!  Branches get scattered in high winds making the normal shadows even barer.  I have taken two days of long walks in woods (not ours) and have a bunch of photos of that beauty to post on my other blog.  We drove to two state parks that we have never visited in our winter boredom.  When I get that done I will link back to here so you can walk with me!Well, I must go straighten the scattered magazines, piles of receipts on end tables, etc. so that the visitor does not see how we really live!"},

My daughter is always telling me to PROOF READ.\"  This was followed by a link to some furnace ad!  (Furnace Calgary Prices Calgary)This was an older post written after my first trip to Calgary Canada and I guess the business model is to search blogs for city names?I do allow unmonitored comments for the first week only after a new post.  This usually means only one deletion.  After that comments are held for moderation by me.  That seems to allow me to screen most of the \"scrap\" from the real thing."},
{"title": "This Is All About the Complexity of Shoes", "date": "Wednesday, January 08, 2020", "text": "I bought myself a gift of fancy boots for Christmas and I have to be careful and wear them only on dry days.  These shoes are pretty comfortable!  I still have some vanity, unlike the wearers of the shoes that I feature below.The above photo (created with some digital alterations for mood) was taken this past fall.  You may guess that it was photographed outside someone's home or an ancient temple.  Those are two places where people remove their shoes out of cleanliness or worship.  It was taken outside the Canggu Monastery temple in Lhasa, Tibet, China.  Look at the shoes.  I was studying this and saw an unusual variety in style and color, but they were ever practical.  These are the shoes of Buddhist nuns.  They must shave their heads and wear the red robes each day.  No need to decide what to wear or try to find something that fits that newly expanded waistline.  Maybe having that stress removed was one reason for the peaceful smiles that they all gave us.  You just have to decide on shoe style.This photo above (painterly) was taken at the Canggu Nunnery in Lhasa.  The nunnery is open to the public.  In Buddhism, nuns can take on the same roles as monks in teaching, preaching, performing rituals, etc.  Although some sects are more strict than others.  (All religions seem to have some misogyny based on gender.)About 100 nuns live here and the monastery has existed since the 12th century.  They make money by manufacturing items such as clothing and printed texts as well as donations.  The nunnery also runs a clinic and employs professional doctors and serves the local residents.  The nuns are loved and trusted by the local residents because of this.  They also run a tea and bun house, but I did not have time to purchase tea as I was off taking photos! Now back to the shoes.  They are all very similar and practical.  They are easy to remove as the nuns must do this several times a day.  Yet some are a little more flashy than others.  I was wondering if a bit of their personality escapes through the shoes.  Are the shoes donated?  Are the shoes purchased by the sect?  Can nuns go shopping?  Feel free to enlighten me in the comments. We also were able to watch them doing laundry.  If they had not been so sweet and gentle this might have seemed intrusive.  Here below is another photo that raises so many questions. I look forward to your comments!"},
{"title": "Washing the Air", "date": "Sunday, January 05, 2020", "text": "This past weekend, like many extended families, we had a post Christmas get together and exchange of gifts.  Since there were nine of us, it got to be much like Christmas Morning all over again, except hubby and I and my son and his wife went out for Chinese lunch just before.  (But maybe Chinese food is now also a holiday tradition in many families.)  Anyway, the weather was predicting heavier rain in the afternoon and hubby and I tried to get an early start to the hour drive back home as the days are also short!  I snapped the photo below on my phone as we saw we were driving into even heavier weather!Getting back to our empty house (we had also dropped off the granddog which we had been dog-sitting for over a week) and this gloomy evening made the house seem even more somber.  I kept looking for a tiny dog to pet, but it was just us two creaky old folks and hubby did not want any petting but did want a cup of hot tea.This morning we woke to sunshine, but even better, the air had been washed super clean once again.That did seem to lighten  and brighten our spirits."},
{"title": "Mind Mazes", "date": "Friday, January 03, 2020", "text": "Why do all of my most interesting questions, resolutions, ideas, and original thoughts happen at night as I settle in to fall asleep?  I tell myself that the idea I am pondering might be a gem to pursue on my blog.  My readers are erudite and outspoken and certainly could add something to the thought maze I have created as my mind misfires in the dark bedroom.  Sometimes it is something I followed on the news while other times it is a phrase that captured my thoughts in one of the few books I am reading.  Other times it is an observation of human nature that interrupted my errands. Then elusive sleep smothers my brain and I sleep the sleep of the half-dead, up a time or two and back to deep sleep.  The marvelous ideas evaporate with the disappearance of the morning fog on the river as the sun warms the air.        I am kind of glad because I somehow suspect that the thought that slithered off was something really inane.  Something of inconsequential importance or supercilious significance. If it had carried any weight, would it not have plunked itself on my chest as I lay in my bed in the morning demanding my immediate attention?"},

{"title": "A Quick City Trip", "date": "Saturday, December 28, 2019", "text": "My children and their children live just outside the District of Columbia, that city of famous and infamous history.We arrived and found parking just as the sun was setting.  Signs said we were not allowed to park for more than two hours, but this was Christmas Eve and it seemed that rules had been greatly relaxed.  We parked across the street from the National Museum of African American History.  I have yet to visit this newer museum (opened only three years ago) because it still is extremely popular allowing entry only with pre-reserved timed passes even though it is free. It always seems to be crowded at most times! The museum remains on my bucket list.  Its architecture is very dramatic and the light from the sunset through the edge of the building made for a decent photo with my point and shoot camera.  As I walked further and pulled back with the camera I was able to get the Washington Monument in the background on the hill.  Due to a minor earthquake last year, the elevator has been closed off and on some days although now I think it is running on schedule and finally repaired.  The Monument also requires passes that you get ahead of time!  I went up to the top many years ago and the windows give a rather blurred view of the city.On the right, as we hurried toward the Ellipse, is the Department of Commerce Building (in the photo below).  Wilber Ross is the Secretary of Commerce now.  He seems to be able to stay out of the news recently, unlike other Secretaries, except for the citizenship question that he wanted to add to the 2020 Census, his failure to divest himself of his assets, and the use of a personal phone for business!  He has Yale and Harvard in his resume, which at least gives him some gravitas for such an important job.  The man, like our President, has been married three times.  He is now 82 and that might be one of the reasons he keeps such a low profile.  He is worth 700 million to  2.5 billion depending on which of his paperwork you believe and he made his money by taking advantage of bankruptcies.We hurried to the Ellipse where the grands could see the National Christmas Tree.  It was pleasantly crowded with American citizens and also many people from other countries, all in excellent holiday humor.  There are several miniature trains running beneath the tree and little towns along the tracks that reminded me of the neighborhood in the Mr. Rogers movie we had seen that afternoon.  These were all behind a protective fence.  When I looked closely I saw that people had throw money, coins and bills, over the fence onto the trains and houses and station and lawn.  Much of it was foreign currency.  That seemed very odd and someone in the passing crowd joked that it was for the President's defense fund.  This is eternally a political city.The sunset cooperated nicely on this Christmas Eve.  I was also able to capture a murmuration of starlings (or some birds) against the pink skies!All in all a very lovely evening!"},

{"title": "When Life Gives You Lemons", "date": "Thursday, December 19, 2019", "text": "My birthday falls in a few days and because it is squeezed close to the holidays, I am not expecting much.  I do not care and that is not a lie.  As a child, my birthday was important (to me), but because it was squeezed into a year of four other siblings birthdays and always close to Christmas, I only had two real birthday parties in my youth.  The rest were family and cake.  I felt cheated then but realize it was all unimportant now.  I neither look forward to or dread birthdays.  They are days on the calendar and numbers on my years.  There are far more important days in any life. Having written all of that I decided to make some cookies.  Well, I decided to do a bunch of stuff.  As my readers may know, I have a Meyer lemon tree.  It is a sad little tree, much like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree, but prior to the photo taken below it had 30 lemons ripening on its scraggly boughs.  I cannot use more than two dozen lemons at one time, so I picked half.  They smell marvelous and are super full of juice.  As I slice them I cannot but marvel at the seeds inside with all their potential to become new young lemon trees, but I have to control myself as I have no room or time in my life for growing more lemon trees.  I have tools for zesting the rind and tools for squeezing the juice.   The juice goes into ice cube trays and after becoming frozen goes into freezer bags for use in the months to come.  The zest gets frozen as well for seafood dinners and soups.  Other lemons are cut in half and frozen for future flavoring.  Then I get a brilliant idea from the Cooks Illustrated cookbook to make some lemon zest cookies.  I do not like this cookbook very much as it keeps giving me recipes that are photographed beautifully but rarely work---at least for me.  But, who does not like cookies?  The fresh zest gets mixed with the sugar and creamed with 2 sticks of butter and the juice gets added to the batter.  Hubby says it smells so good as he watches his football game.  And this is the result of all my labor!  I turned down the heat for the second batch and let them cool a little longer before removing them and this is still what I got!  They are so messy (but quite edible) you have to eat them over the sink!Alas, when life gives you lemons you can sweep the crumbs off the plate and counter and add to a sealed container for topping on ice cream."},

I love my husband of 49.5 years... I really do!  And somedays I have to tell myself that out loud.   He is great at editing my Christmas newsletter filled with all our brags for the year.   He is great at giving me a definition of a word when I come across something I am reading in a paper book.   He knows history,  chemistry,  and biology and explains stuff to me.  He remembers the names of people I have long forgotten.  He is the social animal that keeps me from being a hermit.BUT...he does not know how to use a computer.   I will never understand how he got through decades of bureaucracy using computers when he does not understand the difference between save and save as, the difference between Adobe files and Powerpoint files, how to connect his laptop to the Internet when the signal gets dropped, or the difference between a browser and an operating system!He is a (very) friendly soul and when someone asks if he will give a talk using Powerpoint slides he jumps right in (he loves to expound).  I groan inwardly as this means hours ahead for me helping him find lost photos, lost files and various saved versions of the slide show as he plunders ahead.   I wish I was a more patient person.  I have taught all age groups in my lifetime and did not find it so frustrating as I do with him.  While I did not teach computers, except briefly to my son's high school teachers, I think  I would have done well.I will try to be more understanding as he does get frustrated with himself.  Will you all light a candle this season for our silly problem?"},

I am holding my own, but I think we are like those Afghanistan wealthy citizens that hung out at bars and restaurants before the war many years ago.  We can bury ourselves in the fun and craziness of life while a storm builds in the distance. Something big and loud is coming that will make our hair stand on end. I am back from our quick jaunt south with the family for Thanksgiving.  It was fun, but as my prior post indicated, it was a rush job.  We said goodbye to them at the airport and then drove north to visit our friends for a few days and then a retreat for just us at our local timeshare.  The place was all decorated.  The beaches were so peacefully empty and the cold was very tolerable.I finally had time to just breathe.  Now  I have to pull our small Christmas tree out of a box and decorate the living room so we have a little bit of holiday before it rushes by so fast."},
{"title": "A Post Thanksgiving  Post ", "date": "Saturday, November 30, 2019", "text": "It is an odd day as I sit only 200 yards from a white sandy beach and a tropical ocean. The beach has been re-created by man and is soft and mushy. It is surrouned by concrete cubes of architecture that block the sun by 2:00 in the afternoon.  Like migrating birds this sends all the beached whales that had flopped on towels around the pool inside to other activities. All around are people having too much fun. Lots of curvy skin (those large cheeks of tanned cellulite are really distracting) and their shiny gold bracelets demand respect as their bleached locks with streaks of carnival red are intriguing. The music is loud, the children are hyped, the drinks flow freely and I am feeling lost on an alien planet bracing my feet in the event that there  is a black hole sucking up ahead. At least a third of the partcipants at sun and surf are well- toned runners with  phones  strapped  to  their arms and  water bottles  in hand as they gazelle along the beachwalk and weave past the rare homeless  man whose bicycle is piled with stuff.The last of the group are elders like us who trod and plod from one gift shop to one restaurant and finally back to our beach chairs with some beach  drink in hand and a good book tucked under our arms.I am here with grands who never leave the pool except to visit the hot tub or run in the surf and then back to the pool.  I exchange less than three words with them during the day, because when they return to the bedroom they focus on small screens snapchatting with friends back home.  Snapchat is  a  frightening way to communicate, I am thinking, but I am old, what the hell do I know?  We go with hubby to visit the home he left over a half century ago and oddly enough the house next door had younger (now old  and retired) neighbors that remember him from past visits! We talk about the history of  the neighborhood and are surprised  that while people have  passed and new people moved in,  it has not changed much  in culture or  architecture. Later in the afternoon we all tried to find the  gravesites of the great grands wandering  over the cemetary reading plot after  plot,  but with the cemetary offices closed on  TG day we will  have to do ask them directly another day.Our meal on the holiday is an extensve buffet of TG favorites at some famous chef's restaurant,  and although it is expensive,  it is  really delicious.  No leftovers to take  home, though.The crazy week comes to an end tonight and we drive back north and visit friends in Central Florida for a few days while the kids all fly home.  Then by mid-week we return to the land of  wintry storms and cozy fires."},
{"title": "A Perspective and Farewell to China", "date": "Monday, November 18, 2019", "text": "Our last two nights were spent in Hong Kong.  It was a very quick visit and my part was cut in half as the second day I skipped the bus tour due to a mild intestinal issue.  By early afternoon I was fine, but the tour had departed early morning!  The point I am making is that my view of Hong Kong was very limited. It is a huge and magical city with so much to see!  So much was not seen and certainly worth a return trip someday. This is a lengthy post so grab a cuppa.We arrived by train which is a much better way to transition into another area of a country and to give some perspective.  Locals traveling with us were in a pretty good mood, so I am guessing they were on holiday.  Our train, not the famous bullet train, went very fast and extremely smoothly through the countryside.We had been provided lunch by our guide, but the train also had lovely ladies coming through with hot and cold items.  Click on photos for larger view as usual. Our train actually got up to 308 km which is over 191 miles per hour.  Not a single shake or ear pop or even much increase in noise! We crossed rice fields as we left Guilin, the karst area of southern China. And in a couple of hours after two stops we were entering the Hong Kong District, one country and two governments.   Now for a brief history and essential rant.  They have another few years before they are supposed to be totally melded into mainland China rules and laws.  If you are following the protests closely, you know that the young people are willing to die to prevent this, and I am afraid this may happen!  I am guessing they remember Hong Kong's form of democracy based on the British rule.  If you want to know how all this started in 2014 you can go to this or this link and read the history.  It is complicated but seems to have begun with the disappearance of a number of booksellers in Hong Kong who sold books critical of the mainland government, which was legal to criticize your government as Hong Kong had freedom of the press.  A few managers of the bookstore called wives from mainland China saying they were on business for some time and to excuse their sudden disappearance.  They all never came back. Governments that are fascist are good at making citizens disappear or putting them in jail under false accusations and suppressing freedom of the press by claiming it is false news rather than bringing facts to argue...sound familiar?  You cannot rule with an iron fist if the press spews out facts against you. If you are following the U. S. impeachment hearings the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was told she had better watch her back when she said to her supervisors that she was confused by Guiliana's work in Ukraine without him going through normal channels ...she received vague threats with no specific comments on how she could improve doing her job.  This is what mobsters do.  (Those two Russian/Americans, friends of this U.S. administration, that were arrested at an airport with one-way tickets out of the country a while back, were involved in this false effort.) This year mainland China stated they were going to extradite people who had been arrested and send them to the mainland for trial. That set off a major eruption of protestors.  There are rumors that some mainland Chinese are being paid to enter Hong Kong and incite more violent protests to make the real protestors look like terrorists.  Also, mainland soldiers are now being stationed at the border.  History in the making is breathtaking. OK, now back to my trip.  In just a little while we crossed closer to the water and began to see the industrial shipping areas that Hong Kong is famous for.  They used to be the number one port on the globe, but now they are 4th with other mainland China ports being more active and bringing in more money. Can you see the high rises in the distance across the suspension bridge?In no time we were into the city of high rises and gleaming buildings.  There were just a dozen of us that took this extended tour and we were amazed at how the two luggage porters could accommodate those of us (NOT ME!) who had to have tons of luggage with them.Once again lots of high rises where people live!Below are two photos of the central promenade which we walked to from our hotel, once we got settled.  Earlier protests had occurred here although we saw no damage.  At the time we were there most protests were happening on the weekend and we did not see any part of it.  The University is a bit of a distance from here as well.  You can see local tourists below.Our guide was barely subdued in his anger at the protestors and how they were pushing Hong Kong into a recession.  He said that the hotel rooms were now going for 1/3 of their usual prices making people who lived there say it was cheaper than their rent.  Since he made his living in the tourist industry, it clearly impacted his earnings.  That is the cost of freedom.  What is freedom worth?Well, I do hope someday to return to Hong Kong and see a much more in-depth tour of the city.  I may have a friend moving there for the U.S. government in the coming year, so maybe I will go visit them!  Thanks for reading all the way to the end, and now you can reheat your tea."},
{"title": "Take Off the Rose Colored Glasses", "date": "Thursday, November 14, 2019", "text": "I fell in love with China and its people.  As I have written, everyone was polite and helpful (someone who likes the \"straight-talk\" would say they are intimidated and know their place.) Both of these things are true.  The Chinese government is trying to keep control of more than a billion people, people who are no longer hidden from the real world.  The government blocks Facebook and Google and other social tools, but the Internet is still rampant with information that leaks into the homes of a very diverse culture that embraces a capitalistic culture and is eager to learn about the world.  China has 302 living languages, 276 indigenous. They are called \"dialects\" rather than languages...not accurate! The national language is Mandarin since 1913 and schools are required to teach that. We were told many times in our tours about the indigenous people and how they are given extra points to get into colleges or get special privileges, etc.   The Hans, the largest group in China, is somewhat jealous of this, much like our white folks are angry that minorities get special treatment.  They also have discrimination issues between the various religions.  (Click on the photos for a larger view.)   On our visit to a local family (a friend of a friend), my sister-in-law had an app on her phone and we were able to communicate with about 80% accuracy.  It was fun and certainly helped as we had to take the local bus to their home and also to the restaurant! The greatest variety in people is seen at the temples and tourist areas.  This is also the place you see more police and military keeping the peace(?).  Our tour was full of shows in cheesy costumes and basic folk dancing celebrating the diversity and the history of the country. They reminded me a little of our American Indians who used to do traditional shows years ago.This post has gotten a little long, so I will talk about our final days and visit in Hong Kong next, since they are in the news so much these days."},

For the whole story if you are a musical history buff, go to the link.  While we did not get to hear the original bells played, we did get a very nice concert using their exact replicates.  It was most pleasing to the ears.We also visited the very impressive Tomb of the Terracotta Warriors.  Much larger than I thought and still ongoing in its exploration and reconstruction of tiny pieces.We did not visit the Panda Preserve but did visit the Beijing Zoo where the Giant Panda was so over all the fame that he gets.  I did learn that they have to use porn films of other Pandas in heat to get those in the zoo or those in the preserve to be interested in the opposite sex.  No wonder they are endangered.We toured the large Tienanmen Square and the palaces in the back through the gates.  One of my readers asked about the pollution and there were many days that we could not see into the distance.  Above you can see one of the days.  I was surprised how isolated from high rises this square was.We hiked to the top of the Winter Palace of the Dalai Lama who is now a refugee in India due to his extreme and loyal following.  The air in Lhasa has only 68% of the oxygen of the air I have here at sea level.  It took me 48 hours before my head felt that it was not floating above my shoulders or that I could walk without looking like I had downed three margaritas in fifteen minutes.We also walked the Great Wall of China during a time that the crowds were not too crazy!  That took some effort and I am glad I did it at my age now!  I barely got my mind around it and really think you have to backpack the area for a bit to really understand its importance and size.I see my readers have now fallen asleep, so I will put writing about this trip to rest for now.  Someday I may talk about our wonderful food experiences and a Peking dinner with some friends of friends.  Thanks for allowing me to reminisce my opportunity."},
{"title": "Rural Contrasts", "date": "Sunday, November 03, 2019", "text": "In the cities, the people were younger, looked more professional, or looked as though they were students.  As we moved into the more rural areas of China we were able to see a broader contrast of people..both the younger and older...much like the United States.   We visited a rural school that is sponsored by the cruise line and that was a lovely experience.  We each were \"assigned\" a first grader to work with on English for about 15 minutes.  My little gal was very shy and it took lots of drawing and hand motions to bring her out.  The school was very rustic and there was no example of technology.  A big contrast with our rural elementary schools. The teacher was dressed very professionally and kept a tight reign on the little ones.  There were marks on her desk where she had banged the ruler with passion. I can imagine her in her house getting ready for this visit  by a group of old, rich, Americans. Chinese teachers can get credits toward further education if they teach for some time in rural areas.Automobiles are expensive and hard to come by.   Getting a license involves a lottery and your license plate allows you to drive on the streets only certain days! There are many cars on the streets, but most people travel by motorcycles or motorcycle versions of transport or via bicycle.  Streets were crazily crowded, but I saw no accidents in the three weeks of my birds-eye view from buses.  I saw only one car with a dent. When there was a problem with two drivers I saw it handled with moderation and politeness, and usually finished before the authorities could arrive! Chinese are very Zen about their lives.  It was not unusual to see someone playing jazz in the park.  There are always groups doing Tai Chi in the early mornings before work in the city parks.  I did see a few beggars, but they were severely handicapped in all cases, missing arms or legs or being blind.These gentlemen greeted us on our walk toward one of the many pagodas we visited.

We arrived in Shanghai on the night of the 6th!  The streets were full of tourists from all over rural China, rather than locals!  The lobby of our hotel had a crystal eagle to celebrate the 70th anniversary.We had been dropped off by our guide with plans to meet the next day, so we settled in our room and then decided to leave the hotel to head to the \"Bund\" which was just across the street.  The Bund is the walkway along the river and we were told there was a light show every hour on the hour.  Unbeknownst to us, we were going the wrong way as we left the hotel and could not cross the street which was just in front of our hotel. You can see the light show in the distance and we were going counter traffic.  You cannot see that there were many police and some military blocking crosswalks and directing people around. We had to walk about 4 blocks our of our way, take a left for 3 blocks, go down another half mile and eventually follow the crowd.  We did finally get across the street! The people were mostly families or millennials with sometimes a grandparent or two which they protected.  Everyone was calm and polite even though we were crammed into small spaces.  They all politely took their photos and then left space for those of us in the back to get our pictures.When we were done and realized we had better get some sleep before our morning walk of the city, we started to head back.  To our surprise guards blocked every single shortcut we wanted to take.  We reached the street to the side of our hotel after getting lost and saved by a young Chinese lady with her phone map, and we still were not allowed to cross directly into the front door of the hotel!  I took a chance arguing with one of the policemen and showing him my hotel key card, but he refused to budge.  He looked all of nineteen, as did most of them.  There were lines of young men standing just a few feet apart insuring that we still had to walk another two blocks to wend our way finally back to our hotel.  I saw other elderly Chinese ladies giving the police a piece of their mind as well.  I did not take photos of the guards as that is frowned upon.We finally made it to our side and were so glad to get back into the hotel.  During the whole experience, jet-lagged and disoriented, I truly felt very safe.  We later learned by our guide that these strict walking patterns had been put in place two years ago due to a crowd rush that killed 100 people!!   So much for my naive view of crowd safety."},
{"title": "A First Summary of an Epic Journey", "date": "Wednesday, October 30, 2019", "text": "We left on October 6 and returned on October 26.  During this time we cruised, bussed and walked a large chunk of China.  The map below covers our trip, except we traveled the exact opposite direction beginning with Shanghai. We also added an extension to the trip by flying to Guilin and Hong Kong shown to the south of the map below.  We will probably never be able to return, so we went \"whole hog\".  There was little jet lag on our part upon arrival and we seemed to be able to join right in.  The schedule was heavy.  Half-day and full-day activities were the normal routine except for some of the days on the cruise part.  First impressions: China is large, not just in size, but in population.  I will not bore you with the differences in municipalities,  prefecture-level cities, and county-level cities.  Since China is able to move millions of people and build a city in a year or less, these various levels of the population tend to run into each other physically.  Shanghai, where we landed, is over 26 million people! Beijing where we began our end, has 6 beltways or city \"rings\" around it! More than 100 cities are over a million in population.  China's government owns all the land and it is leased by the builders or the people who live on it in 100-year contracts.  We felt the pulse of China at each stop.  Even our guide would say his visit to certain areas was visibly different than the last time.Below, just a hint of the buildings from different stops!!The above pictures are a bit deceptive as there were many more I took with building cranes everywhere like long-legged grasshoppers.  There was a discrepancy on whether the buildings were filled or awaiting tenants. China builds ahead of the curve.  We did not get to see inside the buildings but I will later write a post about two very different home visits we made.  The apartments are 400 to 700 square feet in size housing families of 3 and 4.  We saw laundry hanging on balconies, meaning there are no dryers in them.  We were told by several people that the kitchens are quite small and therefore Chinese eat out most of the time!The next post will be our first night of arrival and gentle chaos."},

Hope she finds them.Our tax man is helping us with a delayed filing and has spent today attempting to send us some additional forms to sign through an encrypted email, but each time we only get one of the two emails.  Finally, he is going to just send a PDF and have us physically scan and sign tonight.I have a bag full of charger cords for Kindle, phone, and camera batteries.

Box and thus we were in payment default and the two new cards were being blocked for use!  Another half-hour at the bank has now corrected that little anomaly.My SIL recommended we use compression stockings since our flight is 15.5 hours long after the transfer.  I have two more days...so still thinking about that.(It does not help that every time I turn on the TV that old man is in his front yard in his underwear shouting at everyone.  I look forward to getting away from this circus.)"},

While I know that being active is very important in retirement, I am looking forward to some downtime before my 22-day trip that is also filled with stuff!  This post should go on my other blog, but I just posted something seasonal there, so I will write about it here.  Reptiles lay eggs in many different areas of the wild.   I have seen them move the gravel from the side of a busy road to lay their eggs.  I have come across them laying eggs at the edge of a hiking path in the forest.  This year one of our box turtles decided that the compost pile would be perfect with its summer warmth.  The eggs usually hatch in late August and early September.  Hubby was flipping that good earthy compost a few weeks ago when he found thisHe is a scientist after all and realized he had torn an egg and induced an egg hatching before its time!  Thus a section of my kitchen was immediately converted into a hatchery for one lone box turtle.  He avoided turning the rest of the pile for another two weeks!He brought in the aquarium and filled it with some of the compost.  I got a timed light to replicate the sun.  We added a small dish of water to keep the aquarium moist.We had some watermelon and put a little of that in the aquarium/terrarium while waiting for the turtle to hatch.  Days went by, but we could see slight movement if we touched the egg, so we knew it was still viable (alive).  Finally, just before the visit of the first grandson, the little guy/gal shoved its way out of the eggshell and crawled to the watermelon and ate!Hubby cut up a worm or two a day later, and turtle also liked that.  I was told by a friend that they liked grubs but never seemed to find those in our dry soils after weeks of little rain.  We also added pawpaws which are ripening in our woods now, and that was a favorite.  He still had his little egg tooth!He did well for the weeks that we kept him, and it was hard to let him go out into the world of snakes, fox and whatever else might want to eat him.  We put him back near the compost with a little food, and maybe next spring he will return!  We will not recognize him and I doubt he will recognize us."},

I spent two weeks very closely interacting with  relatives in July.  I returned home to spending parts of weeks with  my grandsons, involving planning days full of activities and love and joy.  This was followed by a weekend visit from my son and his wife, where I tried to give them a bit of respite from their demanding  lives. This coming weekend I am entertaining another young couple and their 2-year-old that I have not seen in 18 months, when the child was an infant.  I still am not sure why they are coming.  They want to expose the daughter to marine life...or  something like that!  While I am  flattered they think we are  good guides, I am also so done with company.  After all, in early October I am going to be on a 3 week  trip with my  family across China.  That should be a pleasure and so exhausting.  Those lonely short days of winter cannot come too  soon.The coming visitors are \"modern\" parents focusing on gender neutral activities and ideas, even to the point of not allowing pink in the nursery.  It makes me realize that my ignorance of colors  and color stereotypes perhaps saved my sanity.  I had both a boy and a girl and therefore our house was full of all types of toys and books and I just let them play with whatever they wanted.  They also spent years in foreign countries which certainly broadened their view of the world and gender standards.  Seeing men in sarongs and skirts was common.  My daughter was a blue jeans kind of pre-teen and teenager and I did miss having the fun of dressing her up, but not the drama that comes with most girl teens!   Oddly today she wears designer clothes for her job.My son participated in sports because we insisted for social  and health reasons, but music was his space for retreating and recharging.  Today his  hobby is songwriting.While gender neutrality has its place, I think it is better to  focus on shelter and  rest in any color."},

Maybe I will learn to be better organized next year.I learned that my husband will always have enormous ideas for projects!I learned if you accidentally tear a turtle egg in the compost pile, you are responsible and it will change your kitchen for a few weeks.I learned that when your daughter says the kids may be too busy to come down during the summer, at the last minute you will get at least two of them.  What fun!I also learned that leaving a teenager alone to bathe in your Jacuzzi can be a surprising experience for both of you...modesty notwithstanding.Never too old to learn!"},

Some folks find the whole crustacean body thing offputting. Some folks like crab but prefer it picked by someone else and put into a nice patty with no filler and good seasonings.  At our house, we wade in full steam and dump the steamed crabs in a bowl where we can pick them with crab picking tools and get our hands all greasy and out chins covered in Old Bay seasoning.  No, I do not have a photo of that disgusting practice.  But we are catching crabs and freezing a few while cooking and eating most of the others this month.The photo above is a bit blurry, but this is what they do, holding claws before we dump them in the steamer pot.We catch our crabs off our dock by baiting large chicken wire baskets with fish heads or chicken necks and leaving the traps in the water overnight.  We now have new neighbors and while heading out the other day for a boating trip I caught this photo of them enjoying their new house on the water.  They do not have a boat, but are trying to line-bait their crabs!  They brought down family and friends for this new family tradition.  We have also crabbed this way.Some of our neighbors take out a small skiff and drop floating baited crab traps marked by buoys in the early morning and then go out and check them at dusk.There is one caveat when eating crabs.  We usually dump the remaining shell and parts back into the river rather than our compost pile.  Sometimes we get lazy.  One recent night I heard rumbling and thudding and at first wondered if someone was trying to break into the garage.  Then my deductions got honed as I headed toward the back deck and turned on the deck light.He was wading in full throttle and covered in crab juices.  Turning on the light was a very mild distraction.Lesson learned.  Get those crab remains out to the river right after dinner!"},

I will give it as a surprise holiday gift.  They both have a lot of emotion attached and would only be framed by someone who loved them.Thanks for loyally stopping by and extra thanks if you leave a word or two."},

The past two and a half weeks they have been exploring Scotland, Ireland, and Paris with their parents and another family.  The trip comes to an end in a few days.

I will link from this blog to that when it is done.  In the meantime, I am reading \"The Blood Archive\" which is a fiction about the Romanovs...sort of.

I purchased some Starbucks instant foil packets (they are pretty good) and enjoyed coffee in my bed!  Hubby does not drink coffee.My brother is a conservative and I have no idea if he voted for the current mental case in the White House, but we did avoid politics.  His wife is from Denmark and very much a liberal and socialist as her country reflects that...even though they have a monarchy.  I was surprised that he watched CNN in the morning, but maybe he did that for us.  (CNN has become too much one-note these days for me.)We both love the outdoors and seem to be on an even pace with how much physical activity we both wanted.  My brother is a silent Sam and we really never know what he wanted.  That is one reason their marriage ( a first for him and a second for her) works.The money dance is always the most important.  They are conservative in spending, although Sis-in-law was the one who sprung for the expensive pedicure in Jackson Hole.  They own multiple rental properties as well as two homes and do not have to budget tightly.  We have far less money than they do, but I am always ready for a fancy restaurant splurge at least one night!  (My sister and I were wondering how my brother's wife talked him into the China trip...which is costing a lot.)  He does not like making small talk in the evenings, so we must protect him from that and encourage him to head for bed early on this trip!I am ever thankful to my sis-in-law for giving up a precious week this summer to go around with us because her second son's wedding is less than a month away.  Her son lives in D.C., but the couple is invading her mountain Colorado plateau for a wedding of about 100 guests.  Sis-in-law will be hosting a family from Denmark and her ex-husband during the three days.  The rest will stay at a hotel and the ceremony will be in a tent with terrific views at a nearby resort.Sis-in-law was in the process of remodeling the main bathroom and adding a back deck during the week we arrived!!  Mother's go crazy for their kids.Although we know the son and have hosted him and one of his earlier girlfriends at our home, we are not invited.  I am not mad about it, but I do think it is weird as my family members that live in Colorado are invited.Families are complicated, are they not?  I have learned it is best to be like the duck in the rain and let it roll off.Next post about searching for ashes."},

I admit that I rarely use about 75% of the camera's marvelous settings.Due to an upcoming trip this fall I have decided to buy a \"bridge\" camera which means you get the advantage of a DSLR without the weight of too many lenses.  I now have that new camera with its attached lens and it is a different brand from my Canon and absolutely a complete difficult change for an old lady like me. (If you are totally uninterested in photography you can scroll to the bottom for your reward for my sitting in the heat and humidity in the mornings and trying to figure out why this does not focus easily!  It is one of the stupid 100 settings, I know.)   The photographers' group online recommended that I download the 400-page guide from some guru. The brand is a Sony and most of the professional photographers in the group have told me it is a devil of a camera to learn.  I downloaded some guide...not sure it is the one they recommended but am having a heck of a time getting the focus I want.  For those of you who know anything about cameras and want to drool the non-removable lens is a 24mm-600mm.  Takes a lot of battery power to drive this.I have also set it to silent mode, which means if I am not careful, and I do try to be careful, and shooting in sports mode and failing to turn it back I get 25 shots of the same thing! When you do not hear the clicking noise, it is both a pro and a con.It does weight slightly less than my Canon and they say it is super weather sealed.  Anyway, I have a steep learning curve ahead before my October trip and already my computer is getting too full of images.  Now the next step is to buy more memory?  I deleted almost 1,000 digital images today and I stopped shooting in RAW/JPEG and just shoot in RAW.  OK, now for the reward of some eye candy;  my yard is brimming with butterflies!"},
{"title": "Chasing Our Tails or the Human Tinkering Issue", "date": "Wednesday, June 26, 2019", "text": "I wrote recently about a \"meadow\" trip that I took.  Meadows are now the new thing to promote among environmentalists. First, what is a meadow?  According to Merriam-Webster, the word's origins are: \"Middle English medwe, medowe \"grassland kept for hay, pasture field,\" going back to Old English mǣdwe, ... going back to West Germanic *mēdwō- (whence also Old Frisian mēde \"pasture, meadow,\" Middle Dutch māde, mēde), \"\":  most simply a flat land covered in grass.  Some definitions include hay or alfalfa, but I am talking about fallow or unused lands. Let us use a definition by some Sierra Nevada scientists (my favorite group of people):     A meadow is an ecosystem type composed of one or more plant communities dominated by herbaceous species.It supports plants that use surface water and/or shallow ground water (generally at depths of less than one meter).Woody vegetation, like trees or shrubs, may occur and be dense but not dominant.  Yes, a meadow can be for animals to graze or it can be fallow and maybe mowed once or twice a year to keep down fire threats to nearby communities or private lands.  A meadow can also be a wetland community edging other bodies of water. We have lost many wild meadows because of our changes to this land. A more bucolic image comes to mind for most of us with flowers and flying insects allowing romantic long walks with vast views.     But let me tell you about the reality of  \"managed meadows\" first and then we can discuss the issues later.  Why?  Why does mankind want to restore meadows to certain areas?  If you asked my husband he would say it is for the quail.  He misses the song of the quail.  Not good enough?  Well, meadows can store rainfall and release it over time to other areas, protecting against erosion.  Meadows maintain groundwater storage which is a precious resource that is disappearing in many areas.  Meadows are sponges that filter out pollutants as well.  Meadows are also homes for rich biological diversity including many endangered insect and plant species.   We toured this meadow in early spring before its beauty could surprise us.  It involved about 80 acres that are managed by a consortium of government and college agencies.  It is a study that has been conducted over a number of years.  It seems to involve a lot of work. Routine plowing of the soil to disturb some plants and to provide habitat for ground birds and to break up dense clumps of grasses that small birds cannot walk through.  Routine burning of sections of the land in fall to minimize invasives, monoculture, etc.  We also visited the Longwood Gardens meadow below.  The above sign was at the Longwood Gardens meadow for education to the public.  Above is, perhaps, an invasive version of Helianthus (related to the sunflower) that they are letting go over a substantial area...perhaps for the beauty of watching the goldfinch in fall?  Large paths are cleared for scientists and students to work, machinery to move and visitors to walk.Longwood created birdhouses for some of their insect eaters.Well, that is enough for now.  Maybe next will be a post of my view of the pros and cons."},

My yard is working its way to a hellish summer, but surprisingly the June weather is perfect this week.  Yes, weather anomalies are normal while not predictable.  It is not the incident which we must accept but the trend for more frequent anomalies and anomalies of greater proportion.  Whole communities are burned to ash or drowned in rising waters.    Entire agricultural communities have been destroyed in drought and flood.   I have accepted that mankind is changing the world dramatically in many ways (not just the weather/climate) and I accept that we can destroy this planet so easily in both little and big ways and that we are basically too naive or distracted to realize our power.  If you are a believer in a higher power, you may assume that there is a benign force that will pull us away from the cliff at the last minute while introducing a lesson in sin.  Perhaps you assume that the higher power is not benign and just an entity with an intellectual curiosity about the evolution of all the living things he/she has installed on this blue planet and watches with fascination as we destroy  ourselves.I do not know.  I do  know  we ignore at our own peril.I will not argue with you on the whys of this danger, because beliefs are not weak opinions open to easy change, and I do not like argument.  These are life-long postulations hung on the hook of certainty and security, and I am not able to reach that high and unhook them and then catch you as you fall..  I will discuss with you about mankind's ability to influence this planet, though.I do believe finally in good and evil, but evil is hidden in camouflage and beauty and good is shrouded in sweaty work and sacrifice."},

Yes, boring and trite stuff that we all do and which seems to take more time than it deserves.  Then there is the yard and garden to revisit. Also on the schedule was a Wednesday evening meeting where hubby was giving a Powerpoint slide on the artificial creation of meadows. It is a new trend primarily to return fallow farmland to the meadow bird species.  It sounds interesting but is a real effort because on the East Coast meadows most naturally return to woodlands.  Maybe I will write a post on the work if readers are really interested.  This meeting was supposed to be followed on Thursday by a visit from acquaintances up north who wanted a fishing adventure to celebrate a birthday and then the day after their departure a visit from son and daughter-in-law.  My mind was going in circles trying to get a clean and well-stocked house before they arrived. Make sure bedding was all clean, rooms dusted, and lo and behold, they both canceled at the last minute!      It was a feeling like going 90 miles per hour while reading the Google maps very carefully and then finding you had come to a dead end/full stop at the edge of a forest!  Or like walking a tightrope and finding the floor was only a few feet below.I usually love free time but must admit that I was pretty disoriented until this afternoon.  I have been given a four-day weekend with no plans.  Actually, I still feel a little lost..."},

Lots of vendors selling organic honey, organic soaps, rain barrels, solar panels, electric cars, you name it!  Our table and garden made contact with over 200 adults and children in a five hour period, so I was pretty tired at the end of the day.  We joined a friend and her family to celebrate a birthday that evening, and I am sure I was less than coherent throughout the meal, even with only two glasses of wine and a gallon of water.This was the endcap to an exhausting week of hubby getting a medical diagnosis regarding a new diet and changes to what we eat.   I had warned him about not being more cautious in his outdoor activities, but he seemed to just brag about his adventures.He has been diagnosed with the \"alpha-gal allergy\". (It has nothing to do with any females he knows!)  This is an allergy one gets to mammalian meat after a lone star tick bite.  He had been having esophageal inflammation which they automatically said was acid reflux, and then they said it was probably due to the antibiotics he was on due to a mild infection he got from a tick bite, and now, after blood tests, they have diagnosed this meat allergy.  There are various levels of an allergic reaction to mammalian meat products depending on your blood numbers.  Some can eat dairy products without issues and others can go into anaphylactic shock and into the hospital.  It is recommended that you carry an epi-pen in case.  We had heard about such an allergy and know a few friends that have it in this area, but it seems to be increasing its span.  It has been misdiagnosed in the past (unless they run the blood test) probably due to the allergic reaction not happening until 5 to 6 hours after the food intake.  Therefore, some people may have it and because it is a mild reaction, they did not know.  Now of course, they are tracking it more carefully with this blood test.Currently, his numbers are on the low side, but we meet with the allergist next week.  I have so many questions.  Wondering if he can eat chicken on a BBQ that also has also cooked steak, wondering if he can eat cheese on pizza, wondering if he can eat ice cream!!Wondering if I have to give up eating lamb!"},
{"title": "What Was the Question?", "date": "Thursday, May 30, 2019", "text": "Whether to talk (write) or not, that is the question.  Some of the bloggers I read apologize for their political comments when they get to a place in their thoughts where frustration and amazement make them \"bloviate\". I am of the opinion that as long as you indicate where the post is going, the readers can avoid reading or get involved.  It is your blog after all.  I am a strong advocate for free speech. How can I consider all sides of an argument if most of one side opts out of participating?   But, having said that you must also honor those who disagree with you in your comments.  BUT only rational disagreement.  Name calling reflects the immaturity of the commenter and does not move the conversation toward a meeting or even changing of the minds.While I do not like the polarization that seems to be a global disease these days, I am not a fan of retreating into a private world forever and pretending it will all work itself out.Last week we attended a dinner with friends.  We have known them a few years and they are the kind of people who come from \"good stock.\"  The wife grew up on a farm in a large family and has all the strong skills that were needed and which served her well when she married a man in the Air Force and had most of her life to mold into that dynamic career of his.  Military wives rarely get choices in where they live and whether they can have a career. This is especially true if they are married to a man who becomes a three-star General in the Air Force. This couple did many amazing things and still do!  They took in military foster children and saved lives.  They had three beautiful children of their own.  She, like us, loves gardening and was featured in the magazine Fine Gardening a few years ago.Where am I going with this?   Prior to the dinner on their lovely patio, my husband was drifting into politics, as he sometimes does because he loves this country, he loves the environment and he is depressed at how we are treating both.I came in on the middle of the conversation where the former Lieutenant General said something very calmly to the effect that he learned while in the military to follow orders and stay out of politics and he was keeping that model.  The conversation moved onto something else.I was thinking that the retired military should not opt out of commenting on politics.  They risked their lives and the lives of others for this country and certainly should be clearly spoken and listened to as they have an important perspective on so many issues.  He is no longer on active duty.  I do realize that he may feel he could drift into areas of security that cannot be discussed.  I respect his opinion to stay out of the arguments and discussions, but I am so glad that many Generals and Admirals, etc. are clear where they stand and feel free to speak out when the time warrants."},

When this day arrives I tend to feel \"less than\".  While my mother was not an abusive person, except when she got mad and did not talk to us for days, she was overwhelmed with five children, and as I became an adult and mother on my own, I realized why we did not have that close relationship pictured on cards and in movies.  Her days were long and hard and we never could afford a babysitter.  She was not close to any of the other mothers that we knew and that must have made it harder facing challenges on her on.  She was pathological about having a clean house, even locking us outside for the day while she cleaned. She made it clear that she thought I was too full of myself, and perhaps I was.  But perhaps I just needed someone to stand up for me as the eldest and go-to babysitter, and that was me.I also feel dismayed on these days knowing there are people (my husband) who were very close to their mothers and miss that love and attention every single day.  They are sad knowing they will never see their mother again.  Some others have lost their mother tragically early as a former colleague of mine to ugly cancer.I also feel dismayed on these days for those mothers that have lost a child and will not get that phone call or Mother's Day card on this day.  This day is a sad reminder for them.So, please enjoy your day, but also remember for many this is a day to just get through, and if you know someone getting through this day, give them a call and talk about your friendship and how much they mean to you."},

I am the old lady that talks to the bee encouraging him not to give up in his search for the Kafir lime blossoms and the Meyer lemon blossoms that are tiny and hidden within the waxy green leaves of the branches. He does give up and heads into the strong breeze, but I have not given up hope that he will be back. I am the old lady that talks to the birds telling them her deck feeder has been taken down as the weather has warmed and they need to go the feeders in the yard or fend for themselves.  I watch as they come to the window and cock their heads in frustration like children I have put on a diet. I am the old lady that gets such a pleasure from completing her lists and then makes more lists!  What is up with that? I am the old lady that embraces the term Nonna, and I have never felt dread in reaching that honorific.   I am the old lady that swears on rare odd occasions and my husband is surprised as I never used to do that in my younger years.  I explain to him that my frontal lobe is shrinking. I am the old lady that sees the world and the reason for living in a much different perspective and very sharp vision, as the world turns a bit faster and I like to share this discovery with others, even though they may find it a bit tiring.   I am the old lady that gets more compliments these days and respects them less because people are always complimenting old folks the elderly because they are on the doorstep of death, which can be frightening to the one giving the compliment and perhaps thinking it is a way of warding off evil and slowing their own approach to my domain. I am the old lady that has no fear in wading into politics but knows that anger only fuels those who are fearful, ignorant, and unable to see both sides.  One must be calm and carry on while showing data. I am the old lady that looks back on youth and wonders why she did not see that she was attractive in her youth and why she focused on stuff that made no difference in the grand scheme of things. I am the old lady that admits she has regrets but files them away to selectively pull out when her grandchildren reach their teenage years, as one of mine has! I am the old lady that has the wisdom to realize how rare it is to be married to someone who sees the joy in observing 4 Ospreys in flight high against a clear spring blue sky, or two male mallards fighting over a female near the shoreline, or two green leaves emerging from a pot, and calls to me on his cell phone to share. I am the old lady who realizes she is one of the millions and throws wide her arms to an old lady sisterhood."},

She is in sync and a very detail person! Do not go visit her blog if you have garden envy issues. She and her husband have created little bits of paradise everywhere. For the first time this year, we hired a young man to help weed and mulch. He actually did most of it as hubby cleaned out the shed and worked on the garden tools and I cleaned out the house.   Hubby got distracted by an old golf club he found in the shed....The man who helped with our landscaping is actually 42 and we hired him from a church program where they help lost souls find rehabilitation. He used to be an electrical engineer, also worked as a carpenter and spent seven years in prison for killing someone with his car while under the influence. He is 6 foot 3 and a gentle bear of a man. He tends to work very slowly and methodically, but our beds have never looked so good and I feel no guilt in not spending the five days out there with him. (Hoping and praying for his return and getting a job.) We used a half dozen cubic yards of mulch.  What a luxury to be able to get all my seedlings planted, all my container pots painted, and ready things for the plant sale.  April is a crazy month. We also hired another man who owns a cleaning company to power wash the house, bleach-wash the gutters and deck, and hand clean my dozens of windows. I gave up on doing it last year as I had so many interruptions. Everything was covered in dirt and algae from two years of neglect. Now the house sparkles as if new!We rewarded ourselves with a lamb chop BBQ dinner on the newly washed deck.  (Now all I have to do spray paint that table in the coming week!)Spring can be exhausting and demanding, but it is so welcome!"},

I had used the contents a half dozen times in my mid-married years and then got very busy and put it up and away.I had forgotten how heavy it was and it was a bit of a balance as I climbed down my small kitchen stairs to put it on the counter. Many of you already know what is inside. It was a second marriage for both mother-in-law and my father-in-law. They were young and up and coming in Detroit. This was a wedding gift maybe or being as my father-in-law was a blustery man who liked to impress, perhaps he bought it for his wife one anniversary?It is a very large set of silverplate/silverware? by Kirk which was a famous manufacturer. I think my mother-in-law said it was silver plate, but it looks like silver to me. \"Founded in 1815, in 1970, Samuel Kirk’s company was “America’s Oldest Silversmiths.\"   “America’s Oldest Silversmith” was acquired in 1979 by The Stieff Company and was renamed The Kirk Stieff Company. Operations at the old Kirk Avenue factory were quickly moved into the more modern Stieff factory in the Hamden section of Baltimore.\"  There is even a cool book on the Internet that I may print out.I see the larger set of silverware selling on E-Bay for between $1,500 and $2,000 dollars and this set is huge with even more in storage beneath. I called my daughter and told her it was hers to inherit because I will never spend the needed time cleaning silver or having enough formal parties to justify such use. It seems such a shame to just let it sit in a brown box for more decades. She wanted it and I hope she uses it. She entertains far more than I.  Sending it to a more appreciative home.  Some of the flatware even has grandma's initials."},

I gave away an oriental rug last year to an animal habitat center for their rummage sale. The same pattern and size were being sold on the Internet for between $1,000 and $2,000 dollars! It was a big, heavy, old rug that was kept in a roll in the basement for years. I had tripped over it many times on my way to the shelf for paper towels.

I actually asked him if he or his wife used it and he said no. I asked if I could have it and he said yes. BUT it really belonged to his wife who got it as a promotional gift months earlier and she was in NYC at the time. It is a computerized coffee/teacup. You charge a battery in the bottom of the cup through the saucer, you set the temp from about 120f to 145F and your drink stays hot from the first to the last drop. It takes a bit of intelligence, acumen, tech-experience, etc. to get the App to show you what is happening on your computer...only took me under an hour! I even selected the color for charged and for heating. It pulses when heating. It works reasonably well and I like having a \"hot\" drink from start to finish. Would I buy one of these? Never. Too expensive. Also, there are other ways to ensure hot coffee, like a travel cup and I also feel the cup is too small.My next techie thing was a gift I got for Christmas...a VERY expensive wireless headset. (My kids have connections and probably got a discount). I would never have bought such a high end one of these, but I do LOVE it. I can quietly listen to my digital courses, listen to my favorite podcasts, and even watch TV from my laptop without disturbing others. The sound is phenomenal...so I have to start using it for music. Since it is wireless I can go to the kitchen and make coffee while listening or if carefully holding my head, put in another load of laundry. This little device only took me three days to figure out how to connect to my laptop AND my computer in various modes. Would I have bought this for myself...now after using it for months? Yes! The sound quality and noise canceling are really good.My old cell phone was very old. I could not upgrade any Apps and my son explained it was time for me to get a new one with much more memory. I decided it would be nice to have a phone with a better camera lens and so I got a high-end Google Pixel. They were on sale in the shop and they always set it up nicely so that you pay for it over time through your phone bill, thus naively avoiding the sticker shock. Maybe in two years, I will actually own it. I love the ease of use and extra memory. I have not downloaded many new Apps, except this morning I spent an hour trying to figure out how to connect to my DSLR through the house Wi-Fi and to the phone. I kept going through the assistance directions on my laptop, but it never seemed to let me get to the next step. I wanted to use it for remote control of the DSLR with ease like the guy on the YOUTube video showed. I did succeed in spilling the hot coffee on the tray on the cushion next to me. Thus I spent the next 15 minutes washing coffee off the couch and changing my clothes! I do have a remote control for my camera, and I also have a delay timer on the DSLR, but what fun it would be to see through the phone before snapping me in the group photo!  Oh well, another day.I am surrounded by techies.  My 13-year-old grandson was impressed that I had replaced my old clunker cell phone with this new one. I was feeling a little guilty that I get praise from him by spending a small fortune on technology.  Yes, two of the grands were into technology big time when we were up there grand-child sitting.Where she gets those legs???And Hubby was not going to be outdone reading his book on his Kindle at the same time.But there is still one primitive soul at the house that does his high wire act the old-fashioned way...and I was just a bit jealous."},

Hubby has been gone on a reunion-type trip for four days, my house heating system has been broken for the same four days (which makes it even quieter than normal), and there is all the rest of the stuff going on in my life that I will avoid burdening you about.  I needed the resilience of seeing the rare sunrise through my \"harbingers\" of spring's showy skirts against the kitchen window from a new low angle with camera in hand.  Amaryllis dance the samba, so who can ignore the joy in that?The wooden floor in the kitchen is colder than usual and my nose is a bit colder than usual, and soon I need to move my old joints and collect the wood from the rack on the front porch and get a warming fire going.  We have lots of wood because my forest is dying and hubby made sure he split a lot before he left.  The trees are tall and should live longer, but they cannot fight the dramatic shifts in climate that did not challenge their ancestors.  I have at least six species of woodpeckers moving in with their hammering and shredding, very content about all of this.The weatherman has promised 60-degree weather in the days ahead, which also will probably mean the repairmen will arrive much more promptly since I need them less now.  No one stocks parts, parts are held in warehouses in other states, and repairmen give you 5-hour windows and show up at the exact time the window closes to do their work.  Only us retired folks can deal with this.Each evening I have snuggled down in the heavy quilt at night as a blanket of 27-degree air hung around the windows begging to get in.  Each morning, once the chill is off with a warming fire, I can do chores and blogging and cooking and forget I am not a pioneer woman.Shot with hand-held telephoto...guess it is not that cold."},

{"title": "Paperwork  and Brain Fog", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2019", "text": "Aging is supposed to be something we accept with grace as the trade-off for living a longer life, and other than a few \"dammit\"s  now and again, I think I am dealing with it as best I can.  As mentioned in a post a while back, we are planning a lengthy trip to China. We used to live in Asia and traveled to a number of Asian countries.  While I had not been to China over my life, I avoided such a trip wanting instead to place resources, time and money, to learn more about Europe.  Recently, my sister and sister-in-law encouraged us to join them on a China adventure and wanting to spend time with my relatives who live so far away, I decided to spend the money. The trip requires completion of a 4-page visa including attaching a few other documents and copies of documents. The trip organizer also included a rather lengthy set of instructions for all the paperwork. I put it off over the holidays. In January my sister sent me an email wondering if we had made our plane reservations since we needed to do that before filling out the Visa.   For some reason, I thought this was also a reminder to hurry and get Visa stuff done.  Another example of aging since I panic and do not think things through and do not ask for clarification as I plod forward.  We made our plane reservations a few weeks ago. It took me three days to complete the Visa application (which is valid for ten years - China really loves us!).  I would spend three hours each morning and then put it aside for my sanity's sake.  I kept making mistakes because I realized that I was just filling out the PDF and not reading the directions on how and what to fill out!  As I age, I think I know more than I know and I hate the tediousness of directions anyway.  I used to be more careful about directions, but now I like plug and play stuff far more or resort to bribery to get someone else to do it.  Finally, I started to re-complete the application by reading whole sections of the directions.  That improved my accuracy slightly when I reviewed both of our sets of papers.   Finally, on the third day of this nightmare and after a few emails from my two sisters, I went through the application step by step, line by line. (For some reason in our inclusion of all the hotels and dates, they do not want to see you are going to Tibet - Political? - so we followed those directions and I omitted information on that stop.) Thank goodness this is all done electronically or I would have wasted reams of paper and expensive toner ink.  I scanned our driver's licenses, attached a check, completed the return address form and tucked in our passports. I was sooooo proud of myself that I poured a glass of wine.  That afternoon I drove to the drugstore and bought a FANCY stiff envelope for mailing of the paperwork including our passports to a service that will do all the running around at the Chinese Embassy as well as send whatever is necessary to our travel company.  They said it could take up to 6 weeks for processing, so I should be sure we did not need our Passports before that time.   No problem! Today I got an email from one of my sisters explaining that we should not send the stuff off more than 6 months ahead of the trip!  This would be seven months ahead of time when I counted my mailing.  I am hoping they will give me a pass...please.  If they send it back in a week or so, I will just have to return it, because it will then be in the correct time frame. (I actually expected them to send them back for some minuscule error anyway.) I think sitting around all winter and passively watching birds, passively taking photos, passively eating carbs, and passively binge-watching TV in the evenings has overcome the blood-gorged pathways that send nutrition to my synapses when I ran the elliptical and lifted my weights two or three times a week.  You can't win."},

Lack of sleep is also a big deal and has generated 1,000s of articles discussing causes, cures, temporary or permanent relief and so on. My husband sleeps like a full-bellied infant. I sleep like a watchful night guard. I can drift off to sleep usually fairly easily, but if I get a tickle in my throat or on my foot or hear my husband snort a few times I am awake and must start the relaxing process all over again.My bedroom is well-designed for the end of a busy day. The only distractions are small and medium stacks of books in regimental rows, along with two e-readers and the landline and a clock radio on the end tables. I work at keeping the bedroom as zen as possible, to the point that I took down a bunch of pictures a few years ago and have not got around to replacing them with something more sleep-inducing. I still need to add some small photos or art to the wall at the foot of the bed.  I work at this because I have periods of insomnia. I avoid alcohol, caffeine, and sugar in the evening. I read my Kindle on the non-blue light mode; I do not read the news or social media or text friends and family.  I keep to a routine as much as possible and being retired this is 90% possible.  I keep plants in the bedroom in the winter to purify air and create a non-wintery mood.  In the photo above the plants are on a stand in the window behind me as I take this photo.  About the only thing I do not have is a noise machine.Good sleep for an individual can range from 6 hours to 9 hours a night depending on the individual and his/her metabolism.  My fitbit does tell me I average 7.5 most nights.  Please note the first two items on the list below are Friday...I guess I really caught up with a nap, although I know for a fact I did NOT nap that long, my naps rarely lasting more than 30 to 45 minutes.  Maybe I was just reading and lying VERY STILL?Some doctor's say that insomnia is a psychiatric disorder.  I am not that willing to submit to that.  I think it is chemical, but then chemistry impacts our psychiatric response to things, so who knows. I have noticed that full moons are usually a trigger for my sleeplessness.  I close my non-blackout curtains but still seem to find myself wide awake around 2:00 A.M.  I lie restless for 20 minutes while my mind goes through a roller coaster of 100's of subjects, issues, problems, etc.  Eventually, I throw back the blankets and get up to find some way to fall back asleep again. Two nights ago I was mocked by the full moon.  It seems to want to \"parhteee\" in the black and piercing, cold, winter air while all is still and oh so quiet. I have no desire to dance. I feel like a zombie and am just thankful I do not have anything on my schedule for the next day! I put on my slippers and take my camera outside.  I forget to check the settings and in the dark attempt a few photos with no tripod but also no shakey caffeine drug. While it is indeed freezing the water is not and dances with the moon to the quietest of waltzes.  At least the moon has some company.  It is light enough that I could go for a walk without a flashlight. Eventually, the cold seeps into my hands and shoulders and I cannot control the shake of the camera and get the watery photo above.  I look to the inviting warmth of the light through my kitchen window.

I also get a peek at the lives of the very few people I have met only peripherally but who I friended because I knew them through Blogger for years.  (I do not friend friends-of-friends unless I know them.)  I am able to throw rotten apples at those elected officials that are really rotten at the core (pun intended), and I throw more incisive comments at my elected officials that are walking too moderate a line and I hit the like or love button for those elected officials (mostly not mine) who are carrying a torch for Democracy, freedom of speech and transparency.I follow friends I have made that live hundred and thousands of miles from me.  I  watch their children grow and have children of  their own.  If it was not for FB I  would not be  able to follow their lives as closely.I also post photos that are manipulated slightly or greatly because it is an addiction that I have to share.  I love the play of light and color and shape and shadow.  I post these photos whether they are worthy or not, because I am moving through my 70th decade and do not give a ####.My son is no longer on FB because he has serious and difficult issues in his life and FB  can be a dangerous sink-hole when you are trying to get your life together.  Most people are just trying to get through the day when they post a photo of their breakfast or their good-looking barista.  Others are posting the best of their life and making it all look so easy.  A few are honest and post both the lows and highs.My daughter is  on FB and posts just a few photos of her many travels with family or the girl's weekend stuff that women her age post.  All of them are in perfect shape and dressed fashionably whether on the thin or chunky side with perfect glossy hair and a glass of  wine or a plate of dessert in the foreground.  It is hard to be a 40 something I am thinking!  She is not shallow as she posts rarely,but ... she sometimes posts the family skiing, or cheering, or concerting, or attending a sports event...you get the idea.My sister and brothers will rarely comment on anything and never post.  I comment more on their kid's posts.  I am young at heart.My daughter comments every so often on my posts.  But I  cannot tell you how it makes my heart sing when she asks about a photo, a bird photo, and asked its ID!  She did this today and my heart just bloomed.  She does not care about birds as I do and the very fact that she noticed certainly made me feel like I had just been sucked  into her planetary orbit ever so briefly as she rushes off on her hundreds of errands and meet-ups in other space dimensions."},

{"title": "Old Ladies Just Want to Have Fun", "date": "Sunday, February 10, 2019", "text": "When I was young and with toddlers I lived in Indonesia. I am sure I have mentioned this a few times before on this blog. I had a maid/washerwoman, a cook, and a yard/nightwatchman. I did not have any appliances so everything in the house was manual labor.  Also, culturally we were supposed to hire servants because our wealth in the community was too obvious and the U.S. wanted a better profile for its civil servants.  It all balanced out because I truly needed them.  Shopping for food took a half day three days a week!It took me a short time to adjust to having strangers in my house, perhaps an unusually short time because I am not uncomfortable around people I employ if I trust them and like them. I am an introvert, but when you employ someone you can see them as often or \"unoften\" as you like.  My cook was Muslim and my maid was Catholic and the night watchman, Jaga Malam, was a young good looking man in his late teens who seemed so sweet I could eat him. I must have been a good employer as they all stayed with me for the two years and we became friends. (Other Americans had trouble hanging on to their staff and I think one of the husbands had a \"hand\" problem and one of the wives was a perfectionist bitch.  Another family were Christian missionaries and refused to have anyone not Christian in their home, which narrowed the servant pool greatly.)  God knows I need all the various religions I can get and I thought about them all.Anyway...where was I going with this?  Oh, yes.  There was/is a lot of poverty in Indonesia.  It was not unusual to have beggars come to our door offering odd things to sell for money.  It was not unusual for me to see a woman in rags and in one case stark naked, offering an empty rice bowl for food.  I was young and very busy trying to teach at the mission school and raise a family and adjust to living outside my homeland, therefore I was able to hand some money over and shelve the images to the back of my mind before they touched my heart and soul.  I grew up with a family that lived pay check to pay check, so perhaps I was hardened to the hardness of life.Somewhere when I had passed middle age, my children were out on their own and we began to live an upper-middle-class lifestyle (or maybe it is just middle class), I started to see such things as poverty with more insight.  When I travel now, I truly enjoy the food, the music, the art, the history, but I hate seeing poverty.  It grabs me like a clawed hand and throws me back against the wall.  It grabs my gut and shakes it roughly.  I become angry at the injustice of life across the globe.  I am a liberal in the purest sense that I believe most people want an honest and fair living and the prevention of that goal is usually due to large, wealthy, powerful corporations that lie.  As an example here is an incident that happened in Santarem, Brazil where Cargill has left a polluted imprint and poverty is tremendous and Cargill has not come through on its promises to raise the standard of living.I have burned into my brain the sorrowful face of a Brazilian man in his 40s or 50s who offered to take us around his town on his bicycle cart.  The rain was drenching as we left an elaborate cultural school dance show and we just wanted to get back to our boat and get dry and sit in a stuffed chair on the foredeck and catch our breath and clear our heads from the sugary rum drinks they had passed out before the show.  The man was small and dressed all in dark grays as he held in front of his chest a sign in English offering tours.  My husband speaks enough Spanish to explain to him that we could not go because of the rain.  He was still standing near the wall with the sign as we stood in line and pulled out IDs to get back on the cruise boat.  I asked my husband to go offer him some money...enough for a ride, enough to feed his children, enough to make me wash guilt from my mind that evening.  I hated doing that because he wanted to work, he did not want charity.  I knew that.  He accepted, but I could not watch his face and turned away and do not know if he was relieved, embarrassed, or reflected numbness.Would he tell his wife that he got one customer in spite of the rain?  What work did he do when the Cruise ship was not in town?  Why did life rob him of his dignity in this way?That evening we ordered a lobster dinner to celebrate the nearing of the end of our trip.  The lobster tasted great.  My guilt did not overcome my enjoyment of the meal.  Lobster is still an expensive ritual in my life.BUT, I just want to go on a trip to exotic areas of the world and have fun.  I do not want to bring home so much reality.  His face stays with me to this day.  This fall I am going to China!"},
{"title": "How Many Face Lifts Can You Have? ", "date": "Saturday, February 09, 2019", "text": "There is an actress who used to be on a U.S  soap opera.  Her name is Susan Lucci.  I used to watch soap operas when I  was  stuck at home with babies in diapers, and although I did not  watch her show, she was very famous.  These shows were a compulsive distraction for many housewives stuck at home and I am guessing  they still are.  The people were all beautiful and protected from aging, except for the token octogenarian with money and power who was either well  loved or extremely feared. The women wore  the height of fashion whether it was a tennis outfit or  ball gown.  The sets were usually rooms in luxurious mansions.  The lives of the characters were always exciting and dramatic and unusually melodramatic in their multiple love affairs.  Anyway Ms. Lucci was the evil seductress for  decades. Her character was the one you loved to hate.  She never aged and was always glamorous for her 31 years on the show becoming the highest paid soap  opera star  and finally winning an Emmy in 1999.This week she was in a fashion show to promote heart health.   She is 72 (her birthday only a few days from mine) and has had serious heart  issues. Her close call has motivated her to be an advocate for living a lifestyle for heart health.  She was layered in some off the shoulder red  dress which hugged  her 110 pound body  frame with flowing layers of cloth turning her into a brunette Barbie.  She still wears high heels and somehow her feet went out from under her and she hit the runway with her bottom.  The photos of  the incident are truly delightful as she looks as if someone had surprised her with a fun  ride.  She does not break her stride or  sense of grace and got a standing ovation.  She is  72 and looks 40 if you don't zoom in too closely and notice all the  lifting.  She seems like a truly nice and normal person even being married to her first husband for decades.I just strikes me oddly how we  are the same age,  took  totally different  paths in our lives  and she looks  like she could be a daughter that  I had early in my life.  Better living  through chemistry?"},

Back in July hubby and I went to Washington, D.C. to the Building Museum. It is not a public venue but private and supported by a professional association and you must pay a fee to go inside. They have some very interesting displays and I wish I went more often. The rest of the museum, like most museums, has various rooms addressing issues with habitat, history, and relation to buildings. Maybe someday I will post about that aspect because it is certainly just as interesting if not more so.  For more on the museum go here.   The temporary exhibit held in the grand hall on the day I was there was certainly compelling.Above is a description of the primary areas...mostly for children. Below is the living room every child would like to have! In some of the areas, there were challenges like this one above with black marbles and a plastic tube maze. The whole exhibit was mostly in black and white!There was an area for even more fun and the toddlers took advantage.  I did blur faces a little as a courtesy to those who were in front of the lens.Note, the mom/guardian is taking her own photo here.Lots of room for fun.  This area above looked like a destroyed building.The building is a classic and when this room is cleared it is used for grand events.  My daughter's company holds some formal parties here.  She has seen it in its true glory.  I will go again."},
{"title": "Wading In and Out", "date": "Tuesday, January 29, 2019", "text": "My biggest cheerleader is my husband...this is both a good thing and a really bad thing. (Flattery will get you not very far with me because I tend to be a realist and know that people are just being nice...or they want something from me.)Hubby is a mixture of both.  He sees my talents, efforts, and energy through rose-colored glasses. He works with a group of community-minded folks that have passion, some have money and even a very few have connections and power. They want to save their little portion of the bay through restoration efforts. This also includes an education component and they have been able to contact at least FIVE schools from elementary, to high school to vocational tech, to help participate in these efforts.  Recently, after some arm twisting on hubby's part telling me I worked so well with children,  I volunteered at one of the elementary schools to help a STEM class with hands-on work with data collection on oyster shells counting oyster spat that about 6 adult volunteers and teachers brought to the class.  The kids were intuitive, smart and well-behaved and it was a fun afternoon.  Not sure what they really learned as scientific data collection is a long term effort in reality, but we found a lot of interesting wildlife on the oyster shells when we removed them from the aquarium.  An elderly lady, my age, ran the effort and did a great job.Oysters we sometimes eat over the winter that hang out in cages under our dock...the only photo I have of oysters.Well, the woman who was coordinating the effort emailed me the next day and asked if I would like to be on a \"steering committee\" toward this effort.  I emailed back that I was NOT a meeting person, but if the meetings were short and few I would come.  I have now attended two that last over an hour and were two weeks apart.  The first meeting had about 8 people and the agenda was somewhat all over the place as we had industry folks, fishermen, biologists, and some hands-on aquaculture guys.  They had projects and plans like an octopus has legs.  I took notes, asked questions and left at the end.  This effort includes building and deploying \"reef balls\" with attached oyster spat throughout the bay while training the students!  They do have money for cement, wood, a large trailer and are now collecting tools, etc.The second meeting was last night and plans got a bit more solidified and filled up a calendar for the next few months.  They (only five attended this time) were suggesting we needed a chair for this group.  Everyone (some still worked full time) were shifting eyes and were too busy.  They looked at me and one suggested if I had time.  Well, I was not born yesterday, and I immediately explained that I was coming way late to this group, did not have the experience and connections they needed, and would be willing to volunteer at events, but NOT coordinate anything.  I looked directly at the gal that had invited me, an elderly woman, one of those dynamic movers and shakers.  She had the honesty to look down and make some notes. (I am sure hubby had praised me to her!)Hubby and she ended up being co-chairs.  Hubby has NO time for this, but that is his problem.There was an after meeting of a much larger group (fishermen) to which hubby belongs, so I took my car and headed home.  While watching the last episode of Hinterland, hubby returned and talked about someone at the second meeting.  He asked if I remembered a person who joined the group late and sat across the table and I said, \"No.\"  Well, this person is a really good nature artist and donates lovely water bird paintings to the auction/money raising effort that the fishermen/conservation group holds annually.  I have seen them.  I guess the fellow was out that morning with his camera trying to get some good bird photos as references for his artwork and came back without anything useful and complained to my husband.Hubby immediately told him we had Canvas Back ducks in the river last week and that I got some good great photos.  Not true, the photos were barely in focus and far away.  The artist was excited and asked for my email and if I would mail him my photos for his work...OMG! to throw out a valley girl expression.  Did I say hubby exaggerates my talents?This morning I went through a bunch of waterbird photos taken over the years and will email the chap two of them explaining that as he gets to know my husband better he will realize that he exaggerates a bit.This is the photo that I took last week.Below is a better photo that I took many years ago. (To add insult to injury, last week my DSLR broke and I had to send it out for an expensive repair.  I put my telephoto on another smaller older DSLR that I own and in a few hours the telephoto broke!  In all fairness, this equipment is over 12 years old and while I am careful with it, it does see a lot of outdoor use.)"},

They caught some fish (didn't bring me any) saw alligators and dolphin and got to sleep under the stars as this was truly camping out. They had two canoes and one kayak all pulled by a small motor, so with navigation by maps and GPS they covered over 100 miles of the islands going from fresh water to salt water. I think they had fun, although this would not be my cup of swamp water even if warmed before a cozy fire. They came back two days early because the weather was nippier than usual...yes, even in Southern Florida. Fortunately, I had food for dinner and we ate a new recipe of marinated herbed chicken wings that I was trying.  This dinner was all prepared after I got my kitchen back from their unpacking!!These photos above were taken after hubby had done most of his cleaning!  I know.  The two men that went with hubby are people he has known for decades, one was a student working under him in Hawaii and the other was a high school chum.  The fourth fellow who is the oldest of all had a serious heart incident prior to the trip and thus could not go as he has gone before, but you see him standing below wishing them well.  These trips do get precious as time moves on."},
{"title": "Re-Classify History", "date": "Sunday, January 20, 2019", "text": "I firmly believe that we must exercise the brain as well as the body as we age. Being more honest, I have always loved being a student and liked school and am always looking for learning experiences. Hubby and I are watching a Great Courses series called \"The Great Tours: England, Scotland, and Wales.\" It is probably a bit of a slog to those who live in those countries, but it is a particularly enjoyable experience to tour from our armchair. A tour that is not just lovely drone photos of famous structures and areas, but also includes a bit of history, architecture and personal experience from the teacher.A Castle I took a photo of  in Ireland back in 2014.While watching one of these digital downloads it occurred to me how those of us across the pond romanticize the castles and ancient churches that are going to ruins.  We are lascivious about the people who lead these times, how they dressed, what they ate, who they loved and how they used their powers to change history while moving through these castles and churches.  We rarely think about those who died building them.A famous church in Ireland, photo taken in 2014.As I pause the video, I realize that these castles and churches only existed because there was an oligarchy that took advantage of the poorer uneducated classes of citizens demanding a tax from limited resources.  Those citizens (perhaps like our President's supporters) knew their place in society and gave fealty to the oligarchy, and in turn, might look down on other more poor sinning outsiders seeking safety, to reassure themselves they were not at the bottom of the totem pole of resources after all. Democracies do not lend themselves to castles.  Democratic religions do not lend themselves to preachers with jets and palatial homes or entire protected cities with secret bank accounts and an ability to live by a different set of rules than their worshipers. Don't get me wrong.   I do not denigrate the wealthy from enjoying their hard-earned wealth...I just want to make sure it was earned on their own backs,  otherwise, I believe in a more socialized distribution of the wealth that is acquired."},

For those of you who are widowed, this may have less meaning to your understanding of my adjustment to living alone.  I have totally given up the meal planning as I am the only person eating.  I have a batch of leftover chili, a few frozen dinners, and a ham and potato casserole which was left by the guys.   I have made long lists of projects and want-to-do lists that have been rattling around in the back of my head before total freedom from meal planning days. The first project was to begin to make a dent in my basement.  Boxes of stuff we never opened since we moved here.  Many folks have those. I found six of these patio votives which I purchased and have never used! Elsewhere and not yet found are the iron hooks that go in the ground upon which these should hang.  Above is something to grilled crabs that my husband wanted and which we have never used.  It is going to the thrift shop as is the Sushi maker kit he got as a gift and which we will never use.  I would offer on Facebook, but I think it is peripheral to many of my FB friends needs. Lots of boxes have been emptied of junk and lots of empty boxes have been collected for recycling to the trash site. I found files of old brokerage statements...decades old...surely I can burn these??  I have managed to clear some shelves!  I still do not know what to do with the electronic wine chiller which was a gift from son and which we have not yet used.  When I have company and open wine it rarely has time to lose its cool temperature! Just to let you know I do not have a real wine cellar as some I have seen in friends and relatives homes.  I did buy this item below from the behemoth  Amazon while I was cleaning for storage and it arrived in two days.   This Lionel Richie has to be a daughter's album...maybe not.  Anyway, after I fit all the LPs into the metal file it weighs a TON!!

So I put on my camouflage snowsuit and got the shovel out of the garage and proceeded to carefully move and lift the heavy wet snow in at least the first half of the long driveway. It looked like below at the end of the three hours. I was tired but not exhausted as I got this far so decided to rest at the gate and save the other third or so for the next day. During the early evening, the snow began again and dropped at least another 4 inches.  When I woke up Monday morning this is what I saw.Frustrated, I called the Doctor's office, waiting almost 45 minutes to get an answer, and canceled my appointment as most others were probably doing.I am not going to shovel right away today.  There is possible melting this afternoon, so maybe I will wait and see if the sun helps me.  There is always a good side to focus on and that is no aches and pains, so I must be staying in shape!"},

Hubby, who is a bit of Irish finds these dramas way too depressing for binge-watching, although he can become intrigued by an episode or two.😘I am not a somber depressing person by nature. At least I do not think so, and no one has told me that I am too gloomy. I am usually considered mildly bubbly and friendly while not necessarily outgoing. So what is it about these dramas that grasps me? I am guessing it is the disturbed hero that I want to be saved from his loneliness in the end, by a joyful young person who re-enters his life or a passionate lover who needs him. I also like the puzzle of solving the crime(s). I am not attracted to the many sexual persecutions of helpless women plots, but if they are peripheral to the story, I will continue to watch a nice bloody murder.  When I feel I need something warmer I will watch something like Midsomer Murders, which requires very little investment on my part.On very rare evenings I will watch the Hallmark channel with its syrupy characters, cliched and formulaic, but I watched due to a need to see nice interior designs or fantasy holiday decorations or just something you can chew gum and easily watch while fixing dinner.In the early mornings (with my new Christmas gift of a very expensive wireless headphone set) I listen to the BBC In Our Times from my laptop.  I work my way through the years of titles in alphabetic order....now up to the Fs.  Sometimes I just pick arbitrarily.  This morning I listened to a talk from three astrophysicists on the Kuiper Belt.  The discussion left with a tease of perhaps a huge planet just beyond our visibility that may be very powerful.  I guess that makes me a bit of an intellectual...although these days that is considered a bad thing.As the morning progresses, I also am finishing listening to the audible version of Born A Crime read in Trevor Noah's own voice and wondering how he got to be so smart and compassionate considering his problematic upbringing.  I did just finish reading The Tenth Island by Diana Marcum and while it made me want to go spend a month or so in the Azores, not sure I enjoyed it all that much.All of this keeps me distracted from the torture circus in the news.So just how are you keeping yourself entertained in our Northern Hemisphere quiet months?"},

We really had not been eating too many desserts, unless you count the doughnuts I bought when the grands were here or the pecan pie I bought from the grocery two days ago or all that mint chocolate candy in the Tupperware. Anyway, I was thinking of Christmas cookies to take up to the city for Christmas Day, so we were not going to eat them all!The recipe was for thumbprint cookies and would allow me to use up more of the abundance of persimmon jam we seem to have by putting a tiny dot in the hollow of the thumbprint. The recipe only required 5 ingredients, including the jam, so the work went easily. I watched them closely in the oven spread into thin flat spheres of sugar and butter with the ones in the back of the tray burning just a little on the bottom. The second batch did the same even though I turned the oven down 5 degrees and cut several minutes off the cooking time. Now I have two dozen thin almost burnt wafers of confection! They look nothing like the thumbprint cookies on the Internet.Hubby is on the third/fourth day of a nasty head cold and he did not seem at all dismayed by my cooking disaster as he ate two of the broken ones just like the Cookie Monster does. I do not bake cookies as often as I used to, and maybe I am just out of practice.  He is not out of practice on the eating, though.Today I will drag out an older recipe that I have used in the past and make different and hopefully better cookies."},

It was kind of a surprise when I remembered that hubby and I had donated our full-size artificial tree to the thrift shop last year and only had the small artificial tree to decorate. But it also meant that they were the age where all I had to do was select the boxes of ornaments with the right colors and tell them to put on the decorations. It was fun seeing them discover new (to them) decorations and put stuff on the tree.  There was no argument or shoving or anything. They worked exactly as if they were Santa's elves! They alone brought the season of joy into my heart.(I elevate it on a small wooden box that normally holds other things in the basement.)  I put the cover around the base and then I get a really lovely Christmas tree with an aura of specialness this year.  Scrooge has retreated."},

All those sweetness and light ads making you assume that Christmas is about buying stuff to make people happy are evil. Not everyone is able to buy food this time of year, much less an automobile, French perfume or an exercise bike! I hate the commercialism more than anything. Yes, there are lovely decorative lights covering homes (adding to global warming), there are rich and delicious foods (contributing to obesity and diabetes), and there are numerous parties where you have to find another fancy dress and hire that expensive babysitter to make small talk with people you barely know. (I do not get invited to any of these anymore, needless to say).  OK, I will give you the music.  That is the good stuff.  (Unless it starts getting played before Thanksgiving.)  Yes, I am Debbie Downer today! I am almost in tears right now as I type this because that young man who knocked on my door asking for chores a few weeks ago so that he could bring home some food is back this morning. We gave his number to the food pantry folks and maybe they called. Maybe his mother was too proud and hung up on them. Maybe she accepted the charity and her family can eat again. I do not know, but on this snowy day with schools closed, this young man is back asking to shovel my driveway. It will be totally melted by this afternoon as most of the snow has disappeared where the sun hits the driveway. He asked for maybe $20. I, of course, said I would love to have him shovel it.  I am thinking of having him shovel my back deck so I can pay him more.  I do not know how far he walked to get to my house.  I also realize he does not want charity and I am being careful. An hour later he knocks on my door and as I pay him and hand him a bag of persimmon bread and homemade cookies, he tells me he has graduated from high school and is taking classes when he can at the local community college.  That is good news although he seems to lack the sharpness and sophistication that will be needed when he moves forward into adulthood.  I ask for his number and tell him my husband may call if he needs a young helper.  He is really pleased with the baked goods and gives me a surprising hug. I wish I could believe in a God, but this just makes my heart so heavy that such poverty is common.  It is not some Christmas novel, it is real life and I hate that children have to deal with this!  I just drove my very privileged and lovely grandchildren back home with their dirty clothes separated so that the \"maids\" can do the laundry.  Along the trip they had their faces glued to their various technology toys.  They are good kids, but I have serious concerns about whether they will understand the world.  Even more, I wish I was rich enough to start a foundation in this county that can help families like this young man's.  Yes, we all give to various foundations, but it is not enough. Looking forward to getting past this time of year."},

If you have not gone ahead and listened to Malcolm Gladwell's Season 3 podcasts 3 and 4 on Revisionist History, go back to the prior post, click the link and I will wait...I will just look at the trees....If you are too busy, then it is your loss. I mean really. You would enjoy it. OK. Here are three versions of the same event.  (I actually tried to search my blog to see if I had written about this story before but could find nothing, so maybe I am not repeating myself after all!)I worked as an au pair for a family in Hawaii while I was in graduate school. They gave me food and a place to live and that saved me tremendously so that I could get my degree.Version 1.One afternoon my employer came to me to let me know they were having company for dinner and instead of eating with the kids (which I did when they had company), she asked if I would join them for dinner to make it a \"foursome.\" She explained the young man they had invited was a biologist at the University. He had become a friend on a cruise that her husband had taken. They explained he was a bit nerdy on science and maybe somewhat intense, but I might find him interesting and they just wanted a fourth to balance the table. I reluctantly agreed as I was in the middle of mid-terms.  I figured that I would not join them for pre-dinner drinks and work on my term paper and show up before dinner later. Version 2.  The man who came to dinner (my future husband) tells the story a bit differently.  He says that they invited him to dinner because they wanted him to meet a young woman that they thought he would like.  They explained that she was charming and interesting.  He had been complaining to them that he could never seem to meet a \"nice girl.\" (As an aside, I was dating a number, small number, of guys while attending graduate school. I am guessing they were not impressed with my selection of dates.) Anyway, that night I arrived later than my future husband felt was polite form and we did not hit it off.  I completely forgot that he did not seem to be nerdy because he seemed to be so offended that I was not super eager to meet him.  I remember thinking he seemed so full of himself!  The evening did not go well.  Hubby says that I was really offish to him the whole night! Needless to say, we did not begin dating right after.  We did run into each on campus a few times and slowly got to know each other, and because hubby is a determined person, we actually did start dating a month or so later. This year we stopped by on our Hawaii trip to meet up with the couple that brought us together over 46 years ago.  They are now in their late 80's early 90's.  We told them our versions of the story and they do not remember the story as going either way.  They said they just remember inviting us to dinner as a break for both of us working so hard in school. Clearly, the truth of the story is somewhere in the depths of each person's version both at the time and in the following years as it gets re-told."},
{"title": "Telling Stories I(He) Don't Remember", "date": "Thursday, November 29, 2018", "text": "A bookshelf of stories from a friend's house.I am sure that many of us have sat around the holiday table and told a story from our childhood or youth only to be interrupted by a sibling or aunt or cousin or old school chum telling us a substantial variation of how things really happened. Are we lying, are they lying, do we just see things differently, or are our memories plastic and undependable? I guess the more we like to tell a good story of an event from our life we tend to embellish or maybe just exaggerate a little because we have told the story so many times before and we want it to have a better edge?  If we do that enough, then the story may change substantially in our own mind.  But what if the story is not that old?  What about omissions to the story?We had been invited to lunch recently.  This was by a couple I had never met and they lived about 40 minutes from our house.  When I asked Hubby why and what was going on his response was that \"I  had met the man at the community pool the last time I went up to swim(!).  He found we had so much in common that we were invited to lunch.\"We get to the house, which has a lovely spreading view of a river, and when the door is open a lovely, very thin, lady with dark Spanish eyes and bold dangly earrings welcomes us in.  The home is warm and inviting and there are nice smells coming from the range.  We introduce ourselves and I meet the husband who is of average looks, average build, and above average intelligence.  We learn over a glass of Spanish rose that she is from Columbia and this is a second marriage for both of them.  (They met via computer.)  We, of course, do not get into what tragedies brought about the dissolution of both marriages.  He is retired Navy and she has worked on nutrition programs for USAID in her past.Another couple arrives in leather jackets and pants via a very expensive looking motorcycle that can carry home the groceries if needed.  The man is a retired Navy pilot and the wife is currently working in intelligence data for defense, both in their late 50's or early 60's.  I finally ask as we sit down to eat why the retired Navy pilot had been so brave as to invite to lunch someone he just met at a community pool?  His wife is laughing because she agrees with me.  This is when I get the other version of the story.He begins with:\"Well, at first I was not too sure about J.  As I was leaning against the wall of the pool he walked up to me and asked if I had an extra swimsuit because he had forgotten to pack his.  I didn't.  Then after my swim, I saw him working out in the gym and we headed to the showers together and got talking.  We found we had a lot in common.\"I think I can safely say that most of us found this story a bit jaw-dropping.  I am not as surprised as you are that my husband asked if the man had an extra suit.  My husband is an only child and the most honest and trusting person even at his old age.  (My daughter was shocked when I told her the story.)  The fact that my husband left out this important point shows somewhat how we skew stories.Now for another story.  I was listening to Malcolm Gladwell's podcast (which can be heard here) that explains how stories by honest and intelligent people can be so strange or contradicting. Listen to Episode 3 and Episode 4 from season 3 for the background on this storytelling thing.  Malcolm Gladwell has a compelling voice and really good episodes....go ahead and listen...40 minutes long and 37 minutes long...I will wait.Then my next post will be the story my husband and I tell about how we met and a revisionist ( more boring) version."},

{"title": "The Other Side of the Vacation", "date": "Thursday, November 15, 2018", "text": "I may have mentioned that there is racial and cultural prejudice in Aloha land. I saw it slightly when I lived there as a grad student decades ago. I was poor and young and probably missed most of it because of that and because most of my time was studying or working, not beaching or shopping. But native Hawaiians like our American Indians got bypassed in much of the money and development arena of Hawaii. Today they have a much stronger voice in halting development if they think a burial area has been disturbed.  They do have an island (generous of the white man) set aside for blood Hawaiians.There is also poverty like anywhere else.  The authorities attempt to control the beaches from squatters and homeless, but it is an ongoing battle. Hawaii does provide shelters through churches and public venues, but like the rest of the world, there are more homeless as poverty grows. The public parks closed down for a while in an effort to move homeless elsewhere, although they claimed it was for maintenance. It does seem there are fewer homeless veterans. The State is considering establishing \"safe zones\" where homeless can set up and be free of being forced to move elsewhere. According to one article, the islands have over 7,000 homeless people, the highest per capita in the US and most of these on Oahu.  'Lack of affordable housing, an epidemic in the use of synthetic drugs, insufficient support for the mentally and physically ill, prisoners discharged without any safety net and people coming to Hawaii with misconceptions about opportunities and then running out of money.\" are the reasons for the increase in homelessness.  Still, it appears that tolerance for the homeless has lessened overall.My kids exploring a banyan tree in downtown Honolulu.When we walked around the tree and looked up...!The ingeniousness of sleeping and making a home in a banyan tree must mean some marketable skills!I do not think the woman in the photo below is necessarily homeless.  She may live in on of the houses across the road, but the photo shows how difficult it is to track tents and homeless in such a moderate climate.Many Polynesians who are not homeless are still angry that their land has been taken from them.  They become politically active and let their arguments be known.Taken at South Point, the southernmost tip of the United States.  The sign says \"Kingdom of Hawaii is still here we never left.\"We wanted to see the Captain Cook monument on the Big Island which is easily accessible by boat and not so accessible by hiking down a trail.  In case you missed your history Captain Cook was so loved by the Hawaiians, they killed him.  We naively thought we would hike the 1.8 miles each way to the sheltered cove.  Do not believe the tourist articles about this hike.  Parking is a nightmare just off the highway and room for only a half dozen cars.   The trail is NOT cleared but disappears for half a mile into 7 foot dense, tall grasses that cut the arms and legs.  Wild pigs hide and protect their young in these grasses and grunt if you come near, so make noise!  If you make it through the grasses and do not get attacked by wild pigs, you come onto open terrain and the rest of the hike is in the boiling hot sun.  Bring a few gallons of water!  Clearly, the locals could care less if you go to this monument.  We actually did not complete the hike as it just got way too hot and we were low on water!  We made it a mile and a half down and rested and headed back.  There was another family that had sent someone back up (all that way) for water!  People have been rescued from this hike.This looks like a clear trail, but it disappears as you descend with those grasses on either side closing in over you.I do not regret attempting the hike but opted out on another strenuous hike at the end of the trip as I had done it on my honeymoon.  ;-)"},

I do not know why it seemed that way to me because I came from the Mid-Atlantic at the end of our hot summer and this should not have been such a change. I do not remember Hawaii being that hot when I lived there. I remember hating the cold air-conditioned stores and looking forward to being outside. But maybe my blood was warmer then as I was decades younger.  It was also more humid.The volcano had stopped its bleeding before we arrived. There was no place day or night to be able to see glowing molten lava flowing to the sea. Decades ago we had hiked at night across an old lava flow using stone cairns and a flashlight over a mile to guide our way over an older lava flow to see the glowing fire in the distance.  But this time Pele had spent her energies and anger and retreated once again into sleep letting her long black hair flow across the land as the only remaining evidence of her power and passion.  We drove up to Volcano National Park to get close to the steaming crater. The Southern end of the island is streaked with ancient and newer lava flows in most places.  Rock that is smooth like a river (pahoehoe) or coarse (aa) like broken glass can be seen when driving down the roads.  The reminder that all is temporary on this island is ever present.Later in the day we hiked across the uneven lava and through \"tangatanga\" which is a common name for an invasive close growing shrub (cannot find the link); we startled herds of wild goats; and we almost became lost a few times before we found one of the larger fields of open lava where Hawaiians had carved many petroglyphs.  While standing in the hot sun on the open black rock, the thought that someone spent hours rubbing away the lava to create a pictograph of their life or a prayer for their life is humbling.The small \"pukas\" or holes are where umbilical cords of newborn children were placed as an offering for long life.This is the old Hawaii, far from the maddening crowd, but not too far from a few maddening tourists."},
{"title": "In Memoriam", "date": "Saturday, November 10, 2018", "text": "Since Monday is Veterans Day in the United States, this post on the Arizona Memorial and Pearl Harbor Park seem appropriate a few days early.  It would be more appropriate for Memorial Day, but it is what it is since I just visited there.  We spent over 4 hours at the Pearl Harbor Memorial Park before the hunger for lunch forced us to walk out of the park to a nearby restaurant.  I had visited this site decades ago as a poor graduate student and was a bit overwhelmed at that time before it had become so instructive.  This was a time before the lengthy audio tour by Jamie Curtis which takes you around the outside grounds and before the Road to War Museum and the Attack Museum had been built. Both museums are extensive and well done if such tragedy of man against man can be \"well done\".  Some say the memorial is Oahu's biggest tourist destination with 1.5 million visitors a year.  You will not regret a visit.Once you have cleared security ( no bags allowed), you see the Tree of Life standing tall across the plaza. This was a sculpture designed by architect Alfred Preis to symbolize rebirth, renewal and a reminder that we are all interconnected.  It is near the entrance to the tour area and museums and duplicated at the far end of the actual Arizona Memorial letting light into the inside. We could not go into the Arizona Memorial as it is sinking and needs repair.  The USS Arizona Memorial is located in Pearl Harbor on the island of Oahu. \"The USS Arizona is the final resting place for many of the 1,177 service members who lost their lives on December 7, 1941. The 184- foot-long (56-m) memorial spans the midportion of the sunken battleship. The memorial consists of three sections: the entry and assembly rooms; a central area designed for ceremonies and general observation; and the shrine room, where the names of those killed on the USS Arizona are engraved on the marble wall. The USS Arizona Memorial is only accessible by boat, which departs from the visitor center.\" \"Originally built on a landfill designed to settle 18 inches, the museum andthe visitor center has settled 30 inches in some areas, far exceeding expectations. As a result, the lower level of the facility is nearing the water table. Repeated leveling projects to maintain the facility’s support structure has created cracks in the concrete. This deterioration has allowed moisture to permeate the concrete and sometimes reach the rebar. Engineers have assessed that the deterioration must be addressed and have given the current building a five to ten-year life expectancy. The building has settled more than expected and, as a result, some support columns are close to being over-extended. The National Park Service is dedicated to keeping the USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center open and to provide a safe environment for the public. However, future planning must be done to ensure the Pearl Harbor legacy is secure for future generations.\" There is a fee to get in and you can reserve tickets online to ease the long lines that are sometimes there.  It was busy during our visit, but not super crowded, and I am thankful for that.  The Arizona is still leaking oil (black tears) from her hull and the men still lie in state at the bottom of Pearl Harbor.  You get to meet the survivors through video and reprints of news stories which makes it much more meaningful.  It is a very powerful tour.Thank you to all who serve now and who have served in the past.  We will not forget."},

I hired a carpet cleaning company (for the first time in many years as I usually do it on my own) to come clean some area rugs and a few wall-to-wall carpets and they scheduled this day!  I forgot to ask the two huge black men who came if they had found time to vote.  I swear one was football build and about 6.5 feet tall with lovely dreadlocks falling onto this shoulders.  They could have moved all the furniture without a sigh. They had to be Blue voters!Anyway, this post is not about them or about how the house smells a little like a dog caught in the rain right now.  I had not slept well last night worrying about not getting the furniture moved before they arrived.  I should have played the helpless gray-haired lady, because they came a half hour late and I was exhausted. Once they left I ate a quick lunch and turned on fans in the rooms to help with the drying and retreated to my bedroom where the carpets were dry and soon I felt sleepy and had drifted into a deep restful sleep.After a half hour, the phone rang and I put the pillow over my head and ignored it.  Then ten minutes later the doorbell rang.  I had not closed our gate and wondered if the carpet cleaners had forgotten something so I gave up on the nap.  I opened the door to find a thin white teenage boy standing near his bike in the driveway.  When I ask if I could help him he explained he was looking for some type of work (like laying sod? he suggested) so that he could make some money.  His explanation was that his mother told him to get some money to get some food for the house.  He worked this into the conversation a couple of times.I am an old fart but not a soft fart and for some reason I was leery of just handing him some money.  I told him it was late fall and we had no yard work to do and all the wood for the rack had been split and filled, as it had.  I asked for his name and number and he handed my a torn piece of paper onto which he had written Clyde and a phone number.  When I asked where he lived he said it was down our main road and into another, etc. about a mile from here.I told him I would ask my husband if he had any chores to be done and bid him adieu.  Maybe he was really looking for work for food.  We are always taking fresh produce to the food pantry, although there is nothing fresh this late in the fall.  I doubt we will have something for him...and I am not sure that I feel safe in helping him.As an addendum he did pull out a small box with a heart-shaped necklace that he said his mother would let him sell for half price.  There was a sticker with $100 in the bottom  corner.Am I just a cynic?  What would you do?"},

I have used Google Chrome since the beginning, but will try Internet Explorer and Mozilla and maybe Bing next!! Anyway, below are photos of how I attempted to keep up with the younger ones on our two weeks in Hawaii.Our AirBNB was close to Diamond Head, so that was the first workout we chose. It is a park with a 560-foot climb that can be done in 30 minutes if you are in shape and do not care what you see on the way up or down. The last 99 steps are straight up concrete stairs to a tunnel which lead you inside. While it is described as easy for children and golden agers, I paid my dues!! I think it was the heat and sun that were killers for me. There were also medium-sized groups of young Japanese tourists that insist on moving in sync both up and down the hill at a fairly good pace making passing hard on the narrow path.  It costs $5 per car and $1 per person if you walk in. Parking can be tough if you arrive between the changing waves of people hiking. We only waited 5 minutes for space!It is not so nicely paved the whole way.Diamond Head is a volcanic crater first called Le'Ahi or Leahi for the \"tuna fish brow.\" It was named Diamond Head by British Sailors who thought they discovered diamonds but instead found calcite crystals. It was a former volcano so we can forgive them. It was also used as a military lookout, Ft. Rutger, by the American Military. The DOD always gets the best spots first.There are several places to stop for \"vista photos\" along the way.Can you see the trail of people all the way from the left down below to the far right?And of course, the views at the end are worth it.It took me longer to go back down because I was stopping to take plant, vista, and bird photos since I no longer had to 'work it.'And for some money, there is a reward at the end!!Now, back to my experiment...feel free to test and leave a comment!!"},

It may seem crazy and crowded like Tokyo or filled with ancient ghosts like Italy or that make you question man's inhumanity like poorer places in Asia.  One of the places where I have never felt I was a stranger was Hawaii. This may be due to having lived there for a year and passing through the islands many times during the years I live in the South Pacific and in Asia.  But I think it is because the geography is generous to the mind and the people are generous to the heart.  Yes, there is prejudice against the tourists, but you have to go deep into the bowels of Hawaii to find it.The first day we adjusted easily to the sunshine falling during our normal night time and took the rental car around Oahu to familiar and popular places which we showed to my son and his wife.  We probably bored them with tales of our youth having met there and getting graduate degrees there, but they were patient and willing to listen as they saw the jaw dropping scenery.In the distance is the famous Diamond Head of movie and TV fame.Then you turn to the other side of the vista.  That flat place in the middle distance of the photo above is the airport.  Islands in the Pacific build their airports on coral reefs as there is little land for such a venture.  Of course, now environmental issues prevent such careless construction.  Pearl Harbor is near there and to the right, but not clearly visible in this photo.  All of that precious air flowing over the ocean is so pure.  Take a deep breath.In the photo above to the center is the distant Honolulu with the overused Waikiki Beach and the luxury hotels and the luxury shopping and the free regular evening hula show which we attended at sunset.  It was not corny even though they had done it so many times before.The next day we put the rental car in gear and headed half-way around the island for even more gorgeous vistas.Above is the famous Hanauma Bay, a pocket beach, which has been loved to death and is now suffering the effects of that.  I had one of my first dates there decades ago and it was just a small beach with about a dozen people sunning themselves and lots of lovely fish.  Now there are parking lots, places to drive down and if you do not get there early enough you are turned away.  Much of the coral is stressed or dead and that is so sad.Ever-present to the North side of Oahu, behind the mountains were rain clouds that tried to make it over the scraggy tops clinging like foam.  This was the beginning of the rainy season and there were heavy afternoon rains on that side of the island almost every day."},

We jointly planned the time spent, we did spend some time apart, and I have reached a mellowness in my old age that accepts not getting to see everything or do everything that is in the plans.  There are a number of reasons, which I will not go into, that this trip with son and daughter-in-law could have been difficult, but it looks like we were all good and on best behavior and parted with loving hugs and kisses.  It will be a cherished memory for me forever.  We also had the parents of the daughter-in-law along, and that was a nice event as this trip was more than special for them.  They had never traveled to the Hawaiian Islands.  We spent one week on Oahu and one week on The Big Island.I did not take enough photos of the food, because I am not thinking of taking photos when food is put in front of me.  I am super thinking of stuffing my face!  We ate many different places, but the best eating was in the hole-in-the-wall local places.  The hotels offered good food but that was also very expensive.  We ate one night at our favorite high-end restaurant, Roys, and were greatly disappointed.  As disappointed as we had been with one of its sister restaurants here in the Mid-Atlantic.  Gotta look for a new anniversary venue, I guess.  But the freshness of the fruits and seafood were never a disappointment no matter where we ate.    And smoothies and shave ice are the perfect treats after a hot and sweaty hike and eating outside is the best! I am currently downloading the 1000+ photos that will give me something to play with during the cold winter days ahead.  Right now the weather outside is a perfect dry fall day and I will not want to miss that in the coming weeks.  Such a nice day that a poet could write about it.Our return was delayed by 4 hours and thus we missed our connection in San Francisco on to the East Coast.  This means that an eight hour time on planes and in airports became 18 hours!  It seems that a computer problem prevented the air traffic controllers from tracking the majority of planes flying over the Pacific!  We were glad that they paused and then seemed to assign planes various altitudes as they left Honolulu airport.  At least I 'think' that is how the Captain explained it.  I had downloaded a couple of movies to my Kindle and was glad as the United wi-fi was also not working!!  United did give each of us a $20 voucher for food at the airport because of the delay.  $20 does not go very far if you order yogurt, fresh fruit, granola, coffee, and a pastry??  Blueberries out of San Francisco are really sweet, though."},

And no, I don't hate to go.\"  Did John Denver just roll over in his grave or was that a mild earthquake??We are heading for a week on Oahu and a week on Hawaii (the Big Island.) We will be playing tourist as well as visiting a number of friends. As those who have visited this blog decades ago may remember I went to graduate school at the University of Hawaii as did my husband. We met there and married there and started our careers heading further East toward islands and other countries in the South Pacific.Anyway, I am going with son and daughter-in-law and hubby this time and hope to get away from all the crappy news, pardon my French, and instead be faced with volcanos and hurricanes in the Pacific which are somehow far more rational than what is happening in the U.S.A. I am up for the challenge and promise photos upon my return...I saw a few of you yawning out there in Internet Land. I will keep it succinct."},

We are right maybe 75% of the time and also give them referrals that are more authentic for accuracy. It is something old people do to help ease their retirement days and pretend they are not becoming useless.  One of the men and his wife are recently divorced and they do not come together as a unit but move as very separate entities on opposite sides of the booth and talk to different people at different times. She is what some would say is a challenge. She has hearing issues but would also have an \"in your face\" personality even if she was not hard of hearing. He is a master at building and repairing and talking about his many projects. He also has an excellent grasp of soil and ecology even though he has no scientific background...he was a mechanic in the Navy for years.  This year they have moved into separate homes and she clearly has a need for conversation. Another man, a handsome, neat as a pin in his mid 70's comes early and assists in a quiet but accurate fashion. Late in the day a nurse wheels in his wife who is in a wheelchair after a severe stroke more than a year ago. He was angry and hard to work with for many months, yelling if you moved a brochure or adjusted a display. Now he has come back to earth and adjusted to the pain in his life. His wife, a delicate lovely lady, looks bright-eyed and interested, even though she does not talk.  As I watch them in loving touching,  I know they were a really beautiful couple in their wedding photos. The Matriarch of our group who knows thousands of scientific names of plants has limited patience with those of us who keep using common names.  Her husband passed just a little more than a year ago.  They were sailing mates around the world for many years and he was a famous physicist.  She also was angry and impatient for a while after his death.  She still has little patience for our stupidity but smiles more these days. The Girl Scout of this particular event (and many others) is a decade younger than most of us and keeps us organized.  She belongs to several volunteer groups and seems to know many people who come by.  She lost her husband a few years ago to Alzheimer's and I think (in her 60's) she is lonely.  We, the old timers, were hoping for a matchmaking event with another naturalist in the community, but that was not meant to be. I smile as I write this because I wonder how these folks above would describe me...and my husband...and our presence in this group.  Do you sometimes wonder how other people see you?... Or do you not care?  Or do you think you know?"},

This was just a few days ago.  Guess what?  I had the same thing happen to me yesterday when I tried to see a post I had written on my own blog.  I scanned my PC for viruses with Webroot which is the anti-virus I use and was recommended by an IT person and nothing was found. I emailed Webroot and have not gotten a response as of yet. Luckily, I rebooted my PC and was able to get into my own blog then! Wowie!  Something is rotten in nefarious Blog Land.  I do remove the spam comments from my blogs before allowing them to post unless they comment immediately.  Webroot is not among the top ten virus packages...maybe I should ask my friend who used to work for the Secret Service technology office what virus he/she would recommend.In another case, I have found that certain blogs I try to comment on after reading default to a Google login with my real name and since I do not use that login, I cannot comment on their blog. I will only log in with Blogger.  So, if I have not commented on your blog in months, it means I cannot log in as Tabor.

{"title": "My Ray of Hope", "date": "Tuesday, October 02, 2018", "text": "I try hard to be more sociable.  It is not that I dislike people, but  on some days I do.  I have no patience for their small mindedness, their self-interest, and their righteousness.  Of course, I have these same traits some days and have no room to pretend I am better.  I  do  think  I am more  open-minded than some.  And of course as I watched the hearings for the new nominee for  the Supreme Court, I realize I  am  totally prejudiced.  I have met this creep/type in my earlier life and my instincts tell me he is  scum.  I try hard to cram a logical thought and a fair approach into this and it will not fit, only pure raw emotion and hatred.  I turn off the TV.  The \"other side\" tells me that all  the \"little brown\" immigrants are here to take their/our jobs  by accepting lower wages and then also living  off our  social welfare programs and do not see  the contradiction in their thinking.  They do not have anger for the rich white boss  that creates the situation of lower and lower pay.  And the same  \"other side\" tells me they knew our current candidate and Republican Sheriff when he was a cop and that he used to give young girls traffic tickets and then tell  them he would tear them up for  \"favors.\"  They think this is amusing. I saw Michael Moore's movie Fahrenheit 11/9.  Moore is fat, messy, and a tease.  The conservatives hate his guts and some liberals are embarrassed by his tenacity.   The movie is pretty typical of his prior documentaries and shows his lack of power and finesse.  But it links all of this strange political culture  under a magnifying lens and he criticizes both Democrats and Republicans with  only a fair and very brief nod to Bernie Saunders and a chunk of time to  the young  veteran  from West Virginia that  is running for office.  Would love to  hear or  read our last President's response to how he  was thrown  under the bus in this  documentary....and women continue to be insulted every single day by those old white guys in  power.I do see a ray of hope in all  of this.  I watch the advertisements on TV  and the characters and lovers and families in them look like  the real world.  This must drive the  racists and misogynists crazy!  At least that is my ray of hope.  Sorry, must be the meds I  am on.  I  do feel  so much better after vomiting all  this bile,  though."},

Finally, it did morph into a virus thing in the lungs and I sounded as if I had been smoking my whole life. I could not get in to see my doctor, but saw a backup and got some meds to ease symptoms. Needless to write, I was not getting much sleep. Then a few days ago it all started to heal maybe due to the meds and helping me sleep regularly and soundly. Very slowly, I might add, the symptoms diminished.Yes, I have an appointment with an ENT specialist, but I am not optimistic or even pessimistic that he will find a solution even if he does cram some camera object down my throat.  I am just glad to be up and walking around and on the mend.  Going shopping today for food and supplies in the event we lose electricity with this impending storm.Anyway...just if you missed me.  If you did not, that is OK also.  I am not the center of my own attention, even.I did a photo painting this morning for the first time in days...taken back in mid-August."},
{"title": "Disjointed", "date": "Sunday, August 26, 2018", "text": "My life has become disjointed.  It seems to be full of disparate themes these days that make me feel just a bit off kilter.I saw Mama Mia Part II recently and various ABBA songs keep running through my head at odd times of the day. I like ABBA so there could be worse songs drilling a beat in my brain.  Is it a premonition that the phrases \"take a chance on me\" and \"SOS\" are the constants?I cut myself (again) while chopping garden veggies the other day and now two tips of my fingers are sore when I use the keyboard to type. I try to keep the knives sharpened, but they are getting old.I am reading \"The Crooked Little Road to Semi-Ever Happiness.\" It is a well-written story, but the kind of story that haunts you with sadness as you finish each chapter. I have mixed a weed-killer formula of vinegar, Epsom salts and dish soap to kill my weeds while protecting the river. I spray this along paths and where crabgrass has grown over the drains or into the bricks. It took me all day to find where I had left the large bag of salts. I looked in the garage, the laundry room and even under the bathroom sink until eventually finding the bag under the kitchen sink of all places! I washed all the windows on the outside with one of those Windex spraying tools resulting in a sore shoulder and stiff neck.  It also helped me see more clearly how the inside of the windows is covered in a pale film of dirt. I guess I have to start on those next and do the \"wash on-wash off\" Karate dance.  The whole time I did this I kept thinking of rain against the windows of friends in Hawaii as the hurricane just missed them.We lost our large fig tree and now the new ones we planted a few years ago are just starting to come into figs.  Hubby is eating most of them as snacks when he mows the lawn so there will not be much of a harvest this year. They are Celeste figs and seem to taste better than the other ones we had.John McCain lost his battle this week and I am struggling with the sadness of losing his balanced and fair voice in the Congress. He was one of the few that admitted he made mistakes. The Republicans are now free to fully lose their way.The DNC, on the other hand, have changed their rules in dealing with Superdelegates in order to appeal to Millennials.    Time will tell. I have tried to be more regular with my exercise (elliptical and free weights) which results in my Fitbit telling me I am not meeting the 10,000 steps each day.  Nothing more annoying than wiping the sweat from your brow and your Fitbit asking if you are up for a stroll!  I wonder if I will be alive when this technology really tells us how we are doing. And perhaps the most annoying is that it is 2:59 in the morning as I write this.  A full moon usually means insomnia for me.  I  do not have to be anywhere today, so may take a nap after lunch.  Here is hoping I get back on track sooner rather than later.  Maybe some meditation and breathing exercises?"},

The mother osprey no longer scolds me when I cross the dock. I can see the family of three some evenings teaching their single offspring how to soar above the river and then dip their talons across the mirrored surface before surging up into the blue once again and perching on an overhanging snag. Soon they will be heading south for the winter.The wren nest is also empty as they must have learned to fly while we were visiting in the city. Grandchildren are back home wrapping up the last few weeks of summer camp. Our company have all finished with their vacations and are now back home across the Pacific ocean. The house is now quiet of much activity and busy meal preparation. Children's games and toys are slowly being returned to their cupboards, sheets are washed. We have some leftovers to finish eating and that leaves me time to wander to the water's edge for sunsets once again at days end as the sun moves around into a center stage position. We can even catch a sunset down in the village when it crosses the bridge. Sighing with gratitude."},

The first week  I had company, caught a cold, and got the oldest grandson for a few  days.  The second week  I  got the youngest grandson  who kept us busy with wanting to do something most of the day including kayaking and a 10 mile bike  ride.  Although, I will admit  we binge-watched \"Merlin\" on Netflix  and he did make  it through two seasons  and loved it.  The characters were uplifting and real.   I always like how Britain uses all ages in its  series.  That week was followed  by three days with granddaughter  at our house where we  played  with  photography a bit (she  says she  loves photography but not sure she loves the patience  and details required. )  I also supervised her  exercises to get ready for Cheer leading  Camp.  She did 250 jumping jacks and high knee runs interrupted by push-ups for another count of  250.  I got  tired just counting!  She has a really lovely well-muscled body.   We also binge watched the new season of  \"Anne With an  E...Anne of  Green Gables.\"  That is so  well done that she was completely enthralled  and  truly upset when the character, Cole, left. Avon Lea..and we left home had to head up here.  (Her parents have Netflix, so she can watch the ending.)  Then we drove her back home to here in the suburbs outside  the city.  We are being chauffeurs  in taking her to cheer leading  sessions the rest of this week while  also sitting the  oldest grandson  who now has a  little  cold.  The busy life of a  family! We will  celebrate a birthday of the grand-girl and our  48th wedding anniversary on Thursday evening, and then, hopefully, head home on Friday evening after doing some more chauffeuring during the  day. It will  be a strange time in the coming week with no child obligations  and only gardening  and housecleaning to do.   It is always like a mini-childless time similar to when my children  headed  off to college and I had  only a job to distract and fill  my days followed by quiet evenings  and  an even  quieter dinner.  Like everything in this world it requires some adjustment.  It just seems in  retirement you have more  time to ponder over the  adjustments being made and less to  distract you.  It seems to bring a magnifying glass  to the  ever creeping end of times ahead.I am not saying this with huge sadness, but more a realistic view as to how  to adjust so  these final years are more carefully planned."},

I guess the photographer also enjoyed this!He is a bit of a water bug, so not afraid to get out on the river.He practiced strokes while we held the kayak by rope. Then we got into the canoe and he stroked around us while we held on to the rope, then we let him go.We paddled just around the point and found our selected beach was a bit gone at high tide.  It was still walkable and they got out to rest for a while.I stayed in the canoe and took photos of the late summer fruited trees against the setting sunlight.And I watched the kayak bob on the colored water.The older male taught the younger male how to cast and as luck would have it we got a nice 8-inch perch to add to our crab dinner that night!It is always a miracle when everything goes perfectly!"},

( I had to later Google this flag issue to realize that there are people who think the whole moon landing was fake!)  Then he went on about flat-earthers' arguments and I began to get a creepy feeling that he was one of them.  As he was collecting his tools he went on to tell us a story about his grade-school stepson who was being bullied in school and how he was teaching him martial arts at home.  When I asked why he did not bring the bullying to the Principal's attention, he said the bully was a black kid and they would not do anything because they were afraid of it being a racial call.  I had to take his word for it but was suspicious since he had been so strange in his deductive reasoning in all the prior conversations.At least you do not have to be smart about conspiracy theories to fix the AC because he must have done what was needed since we have had cool air inside all this month!  (Yes, I do live in one of \"those\" counties, lord help me.)"},
{"title": "A Long Weekend and We All Survived.", "date": "Tuesday, July 24, 2018", "text": "This was one of the best days the whole time!!A man and his wife came to visit us from Hawaii these last few days. We have known the man for decades and his wife (second) for a little less than that. (His first wife died of cancer and we knew her quite well.) My husband hired the man as a graduate student years ago on a grant. They lived together on a boat in the harbor in Hawaii before their marriages, dived together, did lab research together and my husband probably even saved his life when he had an appendix attack in the middle of the night by carrying him to the car and carrying him into the emergency room. Together they were a good team. The man is a big practical joker and hubby went along on some of the actions including re-editing the Science Building calendar announcements to more risque messages for a few months until the University finally got a lock on the glass-encased board.   I write this just to give you an idea of how close the guys were.This couple, after moving to Texas, now live in Hawaii and we visited them once a long time ago.  The man has recently retired and they are now doing some travel.  The man, let us call him Joel, is a tall thin cowboy type.  His wife is more the shorter wider version of a country girl (woman).  They came to spend four nights at our house as their first stop heading down the coast to Florida.Since I had visited them many years ago in Hawaii and hubby had also reminded me of their quirks, I was somewhat prepared.  Quirks?  We all have quirks, right?  Well, on the first dinner I served chicken and rice.  The wife, Molly, said she really liked rice, but they don't eat it much anymore.  When I asked \"why\", she explained that you had to buy such large bags of rice in the big box discount store that they decided they never could get through them before the rice got too old.  (?)  Yeah, I know.  I did not say anything but watched her plow through her second serving with gusto.  She really liked my coffee and I wondered if they also did not buy coffee because it came in such large bags at the discount store.  (Kona coffee is marvelous.)They brought in big boxes of cereal, a cooler of food, etc. since they were touring the entire southeastern U.S. via rental car, visiting friends and relatives.  I stowed it away for them.  While they ate most of what I cooked, they did eat cereal for both breakfast and dinner some days.  My husband who had stayed with them a few years ago said that Joel would eat nothing but cereal at every meal while hubby was there.Joel and his wife liked to go to the local large hotel in Hawaii when they had live bands to dance.  He said they did not go for dinner because it was too expensive, but they did order dessert and then danced.  They stopped going dancing a while back for two reasons last year.  The dance floor got too crowded and they started an annoying $10.00 cover charge.  (Joel has over a million dollars in stocks for retirement.)Hubby also cautioned me that they were very conservative in their political views and so we had to keep the TV off most of the time.  The only news channel they watch is Fox.  Hubby explained that we watch a number of news channels, but mostly Public Television and BBC since they are the most balanced in news.  Thus, we watched the weather channel and few detective shows.To further complicate this visit my grandson was due to come stay two nights before they left.  This actually worked out really well, because grandson taught them card tricks and Joel had some good card tricks in his repertoire that he taught grandson.  To further complicate the visit we had 5 inches of rain the first day, 2.5 the second day and rain off and on the entire rest of their visit!  We did take a few day trips, but they were carefully arranged around the many storms.To further complicate the visit, Molly came down with a cold the first morning and Joel came down with it a day and half later.  They were brave to soldier on with a few trips, but we actually let them sleep most of the time.Molly acted like a good-old-girl, but she was smart as a tack and I think she knew where we stood regarding our illustrious leader.  She kept complimenting me on food, the house, our letting them sleep in and I kept wondering if she thought liberals were usually not this \"nice.\"They left today, and we hugged and smiled and proved that people can get along when we admit we cannot change each other's mind.  I did wonder if they were thinking about how blind we were to the truth, because that was what I was thinking about them.Oh, you can catch a cold from a conservative, because I am now soothing a scratchy throat with tea."},

We did not get tickets as being in an arena with tons of people is not my idea of a vacation. Patti LaBelle was the only name I recognized and the majority of singers, band, etc. were Reggie, rap, etc. Yes, they were mostly black folk. What this meant is that for one of the few times in my life I was in a high-end hotel and I was in the minority regarding my ethnic background. This had happened in Egypt years ago, but the Saudi Arabian men were haughty and rude and one actually shoved me aside much like Trump had done with the Prime Minister from Montenegro last year while I was trying to check in! These black tourists from all across the globe were much nicer, and really much better dressed.  I wished I had upped my evening wear, and exercised more by the end of the week when waiting for our driver at the front of the hotel.  I saw tons of really interesting and exotic hairstyles, dresses clinging to barbie doll bodies but did not think it appropriate to snap away, so you will have to take my word for it.There were many other people there as well and below is a brief montage of those whose path I crossed, or who crossed my path.  (The vibe was much nicer than when I went to Jamaica a few years ago.  The economy and the tourist trade seem to be responsible for that.)Our driver, Nigel, who was absolutely the key to our having great food and a wonderful time.  Getting married this August for the first time!A nice collection of young ladies on the beaches!I think these folks said they were from Cleveland (?)...maybe here for the music festival.They might have been here for an anniversary or some such.  Maybe they were famous musicians!A young couple who took the boat to Nevis with us.  I think from New York.A small example of the lovely hairstyles.A local who works in the tourist trade.We took the local train on St. Kitts and this was the tour guide.  She had an excellent background in the history of the area.  I think she said she had a graduate degree.A trio that sang for us...wonderful harmonies, slave songs, spirituals and some oldies but goodies.While eating lunch I was trying to catch hubby and this fellow apologized for photobombing the event.  He was from Chicago on vacation and fun to talk to. It is always all about the people, is it not?"},

All pre-planned by the two executives (both in their jobs and their lives) and we grandparents make a good attempt to tag along  keep up.Thus the morning walk by myself was just the tonic I needed. As I mentioned the beaches were not being used by the people staying at the resort. The resort did provide free shuttles to two other beaches on another side of the island that were not covered in sargassum grasses and while not having any lifeguards these beaches did have restaurants and restrooms.Back at the resort, you can see from above, perhaps, how soft this sand is. The footsteps have been easily softened by the ocean breezes. It is like walking on pillows! Good workout for ankles and knees, but requires one to walk more slowly for careful balance. When I had gotten around the point of the beach and into the more remote areas, this was one of the first beach signs I encountered. Not exactly drawing me in as it reminded me of a death memorial!Just ahead were the horses...not the donkeys, tied to the edge of the coast with small plastic tanks of water nearby.  The photo below gives a good example of how rural the area was.I walked some more and came upon an abandoned sea moss research laboratory. Sad in so many ways.  I think it was initiated in 2015 to encourage cottage industry for the locals.  There is a sea moss cocktail/drink, which I did not try, which is supposed to help with male fertility.  There were some buoys still offshore, so maybe something is still happening.  I came across a very few sandpipers (I think) scurrying along the second point that I rounded in my walk.  Conch shells washed ashore are in abundance. There was no noise on this side of the island.  Just the sound of the wind as it moved along the coastline even muffling the sound of waves.  It was extremely peaceful.    I did not collect this beautiful conch shell as I did not know the rules for collecting shells, did not have room in my luggage and have passed that time in my life as I have an extensive shell collection already.  I did eat some fried conch that week. As the island curved out again, the beach appeared to have come to an end.  I paused and explored some of the flora and fauna and then regretfully had to return to the resort as I was out of my water.  The horses were even less curious about me on my return.  Slowly I re-entered civilization. Maybe ready for a nap before lunch?  Hoping you got a bit of the atmosphere and mood of this tiny island in the Caribbean."},
{"title": "A Sargassum Sea", "date": "Saturday, July 07, 2018", "text": "Above is what one expects at a resort on the beach. The only unusual part is that no one is there. Actually, very few people are there.  This is the beach at the resort where we stayed.  Part of the reason no one was there was because it was the \"off-season.\"  This place gets really busy in the winter.  But there was another reason...The islands of the Caribbean are having a major problem with seaweed abundance.  Large blooms offshore entangle swimmers, turtles, etc. and then drift up upon the beach covering the sand.  It was at least a foot thick all along the shoreline.Every single day a scoop was out removing the seaweed and working its way up and down the beach.  There was no off smell as the news reported...just a little pungent saltiness in the air.  Maybe that was because they worked each day to remove it.  As a gardener, I was hoping they were taking this truckload somewhere to enhance the island soil!  This plant is called Sargassum, a brown seaweed, that grows in the open ocean. There does not seem to be a certain answer for why this north Atlantic plant now is in abundance down south, although one marine scientist thinks it is more closely related to another species of Sargassum off the coast of Brazil.  “Nobody has a definite answer.  Nutrient inputs from the Amazon River, which discharges into the ocean around where blooms were first spotted, may have stimulated Sargassum growth. But other factors, including changes in ocean currents and increased iron deposition from airborne dust, are equally plausible. It’s all “educated speculation,” Hu, an oceanographer from the University of Southern Florida states. This was the second day of our vacation the family went out on a boat to snorkel.  Since they were going on the windy side of the island and I get seasick, I opted to stay at the resort.  My walk of a mile or so down the Sargassum beach was really good exercise.  There was no one else once I left the resort area and I was not fearful of crime as I only had my small point and shoot camera and the island is \"relatively\" crime free.  (More on that later.)  The sand was very soft and gave me one heck of a workout as well as the solitude I craved.  Come back again and I will take you on the walk."},

It is something I did over 35 years ago when I lived in Jogjakarta, Indonesia. The dyes we used were from Germany. The bamboo room where I worked at the foot of the Palace smelled like pine from the rosin that was melted into the beeswax and paraffin mixture. If you want to read about that time in my life, you can go here.I wanted to see the batik culture in St. Kitts which was on a hill near an abandoned sugar plantation.  They drive on the \"wrong\" side of the road, so we got a driver at the hotel who ended up being our guide most of the other days.  I was somewhat disappointed, as I knew I would be because it was really very commercial with only a very simple view of what they did with an emphasis on selling stuff.  Their work is very bright, colorful, and simple in nature.  We got there in the offseason which was WONDERFUL as the store was pretty small with examples of the stages of batiking and photos of celebrity visits such as Prince Phillip.  Inside was close and stifling even with the various fans running.  There were no exotic odors...just bored salespeople.  I bought two small neck scarves as this style is not my style...The area around the store has lovely gardens and a famous 400-year-old tree probably photographed millions of times!  It is a Saman tree which is in the pea family.  Sometimes it is called a monkeypod tree. The blooms are fuzzy balls (like something I have seen called a bottlebrush tree in the tropics) but it was not blooming when we visited.  Can you imagine what this giant has seen??  Yes, that is hubby in the blue shirt down below.  Try as I might I could not get the entire tree in the frame even with my wide-angle lens. We walked around the gardens and even sat a bit since we were on our own this first day, without hungry and restless grandchildren and with rum drinks everywhere---virgin for hubby.Temperatures were in the mid to high 80sF with the wonderful trade winds.  Much more comfortable than here at home in the mid-Atlantic. Another labeled tree on the grounds was the calabash which is used for medicinal purposes with the outer shell dried and made into bowls.All of this is situated on the Romney Manor, owned originally by Earl of Romney when colonial life was elegant and guilt free.  The manor and sugar plantation were later owned by Sam Jefferson the great, great, great, grandfather of the third President of the United States.  Family wealth built on the backs of slaves living and dying on a former sugar plantation.Next post about the beach and climate change."},

{"title": "Tip of the Iceburg", "date": "Wednesday, June 20, 2018", "text": "This has been a more difficult year to maintain our yard. We \"contracted\" with employees from a small landscape firm in the area in the years past. The company used Mexicans, employed for around six months at 6 days a week and with \"some\" arrangements for health care. They arrived around May and returned in early November.  They were EXTREMELY talented in that they helped us fix our lawnmower, repaired the garden gate, identified a gas leak which we missed since we did not weedeat that corner of the house, etc.  They were ALWAYS prompt, polite and efficient.Our \"helpers\"  were a \"band of brothers.\"  The family had 8 brothers and each year they were able to send at least 4 of them north to the U.S. for employment.  The local U.S. landscape business could not find local folks to do these jobs, clearly.For the last two years, their arrival became more difficult and they would come later.  This year they were not allowed into the U.S. at all.  My husband called one of the brothers since we have become friends as well because we have paid for their services for almost a decade.  They explained that they could not get work visas, they also tragically lost their older brother to murder from a gang over the winter months.  He was shot outside the front door of his home. They had related various tales of the increase in dangerous crime over the years.  (If you are a tourist in Mexico, the government may feel it is necessary in some areas to give you a police escort.)My husband was trying to manage the yard on his own through May and early June of this year until we found a young boy who was saving for college and could help.  (Hubby's back has a recent problem.)  Why don't we just hire from another landscaping firm you may ask?  We did that in years past.  The various small firms either quit on us saying the yard was too difficult, or they would not show up on time after rains and grass would get too high to mow before they could reschedule us, or they complained about everything else.  They were totally unreliable and perhaps just wanted enough money for drugs or until another job came their way.  Living in the countryside is not always easy for finding help.  Even after writing this we will research hiring another landscape company next year.This event in our lives is related to the huge refugee iceberg that is forming across the globe.  Closing borders, wars, climate change resulting in famine, climate change increasing diseases, criminal gangs, and overpopulation are taking their toll forcing people to flee for their lives.  In 2017 68.5 million refugees were displaced from their homes, their cities, their countries.  One person becomes displaced every 2 seconds.  The Central African Republic, Central America, Europe, Iraq, South Sudan, Syria, Rohingya, Ukraine, and Yemen are all impacted by the ongoing refugee crisis.  Now it is at our back door where we are housing refugee toddlers and teenagers without a budget, plan, or infrastructure.  MAGA"},

{"title": "Grocery Event", "date": "Thursday, June 14, 2018", "text": "I shop at the local big supermarket. Produce is less varied and must be selected more carefully than when I shop at the more expensive yuppie market across the bridge. While I am fortunate in that my grocery budget is ample for the two of us, I come from that old family farming culture which makes me shop most carefully and not buy so much that I have to throw out food at the end of the week. I do use mostly the outside aisles (bakery, produce, meat, and dairy) while avoiding the processed foods in the inner aisles. I get my cleaning stuff at the Big Box store, but in reality, if I paid attention to sales, I would not need to go there. This intro had nothing to do with my event yesterday, by the way.I had four large bags of food and was loading them from the basket into the trunk. I heard someone shouting and looked up toward the door of the store. I was parked about eight cars away. Standing in front of the double doors and waving both arms was a black man in his 50s with salt and pepper closely cropped hair, tall and in reasonably good shape. He was all in black. There was a set of black earphones covering his ears, a black backpack and what appears to be a bit of paraphernalia tagged to his shirt pockets. He was also shaking his head from side to side. He was loud, but I could not figure out what he was saying as he was talking fast.  At first, I thought perhaps he was singing to some rap music that was coming from his earphones.  People entering the store pretended not to see him.I finished loading the trunk and opened the driver's side door. The man started jogging in my direction. I then heard what he was shouting over and over again. \"I can't take it anymore!..I can't take it anymore!..I can't take it anymore!\" I was not frightened as I got into my car and shut the door and he ran down the area in front of me between the parked cars. I was sad and curious instead. For just a second, I actually felt like re-opening the door and shouting after him...\"ME TOO!\"Within a few seconds a man in a white shirt with a name tag and black dress pants and holding his phone appeared.  He was moving after the black man but did not seem to want to catch up with him as he typed something into his phone.  He stopped in front of my car and then another man in what appeared to be a supermarket shirt and cap (perhaps a deli-counter uniform?) showed up behind him.  The second man looked at me and then shook his head and chuckled.  I raised my shoulders and arms agreeing as if saying \"WTF?\"  But I do not swear, so I was more commiserating with the situation for all.My take was that I wished I could have helped the man.  Had he shoplifted?  Had he threatened an employee?  Did he have a fight with another customer about who was next in line?  Did his mental illness manifest itself?  Was this a reaction to a drug (legal or illegal)?  I actually wish he has not been moving so fast and that I would have been brave enough to get out of the car and display some sympathetic body language if nothing else.Clearly, this was not a major crime or even a novelty to the two employees who walked back into the store as I pulled out of my parking place.  The black man had totally disappeared as I found my way to the exit.  Crime in our county has been climbing this last year.  Not sure why with all these great emplyment figures and growing economy (snark)."},

She lived on the other side of the country and our correspondence was by sporadic phone calls and emails.   The expertise of the staff of a major Los Angeles hospital was not smart enough nor quick enough to save her life.  I flew out to be with her for a few days in the middle of her battle.  When she passed she left behind a 10-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl soon to turn 13 and their Dad.  These two children grew up into beautiful, stable, and sweet adults through some miracle of good parenting and good genes and damn luck. This weekend I flew out again to attend the wedding of the young man, my nephew.  We were there for only 2 and half days and it was very emotional...more so than weddings are normally emotional for me.  I left the rain-filled skies here in the Mid-Atlantic for the sun-filled skies of Southern California.  Southern California where real estate prices START in the very high six figures and never seem to end.  This little gray house in the background was worth a couple of million! This was a special trip for me since I had not had a chance to see my niece and nephew for many years as their careers took them away from the places where I visited their father.  The wedding was small, semi-formal, and was a chance for me to see my other brother and sister briefly as well.It was both a tough and terrific time for me and I am so glad I did not miss it.   Now I am back home and returning to normal---my version of normal that is."},

According to the FBI's National Crime Information Center Missing Person File, 36.5% or approximately 32, 121 that are missing are humans under the age of 18.  Of course, these children were not the responsibility of the Federal Departments nor was their separation from their parents an action by the government.  Data indicates that 90% of these are runaways. The European Commission reports that 250 000 children are reported missing every year in the European Union, 1 child every 2 minutes.  Runaways account for 57% percent of EU missing children.  23% were parental abductions.The Internet has been a tool for luring children away, but it also has been a tool for finding them.  Cell phones owned by children have been important in finding children who just get lost.  We cannot blame it on technology.Did the immigrant children go to a relative who is hiding them?  Were they taken in by a foster family that is evil?  Did the children run away in confusion and fear and are sleeping in the desert or the sidewalk?  Is this part of a sex slave network?I saw the movie Lion based on a true story a year ago and was deeply moved by the overpopulation and poverty in India that created a culture where children were treated like lost dogs.  I just wish we would fight for the rights of the born as much as we fight for the unborn."},
{"title": "Abstraction and Distraction", "date": "Tuesday, May 22, 2018", "text": "The Laughing TreeI have been watching the National Geographic series Genius. Last year it was about Einstein. This year it is about Picasso. The style of storytelling these days, whether in books or video, is to jump back and forth along the timeline. You reveal a little something in the present and then you go back in time and explain how it came about. While it does add tension and even works for the writer sometimes, I am not as in love with it to the extent that the popular culture seems to be. I am also not a fan of contemporary and/or abstract art. Moving into the impressionist period was as far as my interest would take me. But I have always loved the work of Picasso and admired his creative and evolutionary talent for his time:  misogynist pig that he was in his personal life. In his blue period, he conveyed such a depth of misery with each painting. In his cubist period, his works invited a more intense study as they slowly revealed an edginess and a novelty and an energy in the inanimate.His life was very complex, so I am not sure that Nat-Geo has been as accurate as it could be. It glosses over so much and leaves one wondering why and what impact something had.The casting of Antonio Banderas as Picasso is effective. He has those dark Spanish button eyes that Picasso had.  If you study his interviews you will see that he has much the same passion and devotion and openness in his real life that Picasso had.  Banderas is an underrated actor. The Thirteenth Warrior is one of my favorite movies that he did even though it received mediocre reviews. It is moody, heavy, and slow, with a little too much blood and guts, but full of atmosphere and a wonderful musical score. He is very compelling as the warrior.  OK, just a review of what has taken up my time, because of the days of rain, I spent too much time in front of the television, on the other hand, my house is pretty clean."},

I am not super comfortable with this holiday because I do have friends and relatives that lost their mother when they were very young, early teens or one in college. For those who have gone through this tragedy, it may bring up days of sweet memories and for others a deep longing for all that they missed. I will be attending the wedding of a young man that lost his mother when he was about ten. He lives on the other side of the country and I do not get to see him as much as I would like. My daughter-in-law has recently learned that she will probably not be able to have children and her sister learned the same fate years ago.  They both married later in their lives which complicates things.  I think they have both decided not to try adoption, so it appears her parents will never have the joy of grandkids, and they are special people and would have made wonderful grandparents. This Mother's Day, while special for many, carries baggage for me.  I had a complicated relationship with my Mother.  She was judgemental and overworked and angry much of the time.  I understand it all now but did not when I was a young girl which she burdened and guilted with chores.  I got a call from my distant son late that evening (certainly prompted by his wife) and nothing from my busy daughter who is a very wonderful mother in her own right.  But they know I would not guilt them about their actions or inactions on this day.  We love each other with or without holidays to remind us.

I want someone not too quippy because I am 18 and going to pick their brain on important decisions in life and mistakes they have learned from. I will ask the most important thing they have learned. I will ask the most important relationships that they have made in their lives. I will ask what they say \"no\" to on many days. I will ask them about their most important success. I will ask them what they wish they could do over. I will ask them about their relationship with a higher being or what they use for spiritual guidance. I will ask if they think one can be successful in love and what are the keys to that. I will ask them what second career might they wish they could have followed.  I will ask them what keeps them centered on their most difficult days.How do we meet?  Well, maybe I win some contest.  We would meet on a hike to a mountain lodge or a walk to a cabin on a lake. NO one else, just the two of us stuck together for most of the day.What happens next?   This would be a challenge for me to try and apply some of what I learned to my own future career, marriage, and decisions on life in general. I would also hope we could keep in touch over the years ahead.Oh,  you want to know who I selected?  Ruth Bader Ginsberg.  No special reason as there were many authors, journalists, political leaders that I could have considered, and since she has her own exercise program I am guessing we could handle that gentle mountain walk.  Perhaps a spring walk in Utah?Now, your turn...if you like."},

{"title": "I Knew That Already", "date": "Thursday, April 12, 2018", "text": "I use Facebook more than many people do, but I do not judge those who will have nothing to do with this social networking site,  like my husband. I like to keep in touch with friends who live hundreds of miles away. I am somewhat restrictive in my criteria for accepting FB friends and I have written about that before. I usually like to at least have met the person. I have made a few exceptions. In one case the person and I grew close through blogs and the person also had a terrible illness which at least restricted travel on their part. We were probably destined never to meet in real life. In another instance, one of my close relatives was going through a difficult time and one of her colleagues asked to become my friend on FB. I accepted that just to be able to see how my close relative might be doing from another's perspective without actually discussing it! I know exactly how many friends I have on FB.  I keep it as close to 100 as I can.  I have very few FB friends here in my community, but I do have a few.  I am very political on FB.I have not answered friend requests from a few co-workers that I did not become close to when we worked together or that I thought were not generally \"nice\" people. My judgment---my call, and I am sure others might just judge me the same way.I have lost only one friend over the decade or so and this was a distant relative who could not stand my political postings.  He 'unfriended' me.  It was sad because he would post \"photos\" of the \"rape\" of the Ambassador in the Benghazi debacle and other questionable links.  The photos were not true and violent and fed his conservative fire, and I never pointed out that sources are essential when attempting to post facts.  I let him post what he wanted.  He was young, an ex-marine and a gun-lover.  He had lots of problems with romance in his life, lost his access to his toddler daughter due to his anger, and this was and is sad.  We had a few attempts at face-to-face conversations on his goals and direction in life, but you cannot change the spots on some leopards.  He had been a great marine, which is a structure many people need and his life stalled a little after he left.Now to the title.  I know that the 'world' knows all of this about me.  I have taken a few of those quizzes, so they know my exercise, food, personality, travel preferences, and my habits and my spending profile.  I did not take many because I realized this data was being compiled elsewhere.  ( I was not smart enough to think about the Russians, but I did think about Pakistan and ID theft.)I downloaded my FB archive today and it is a surprising history walk, because we do forget the intimate conversations we might have with others.  I am glad that at least others are aware of this.  Elders have less to lose in terms of information compromised, but just as much to lose in terms of ID theft.  If you have bought anything on the Internet outside of FB, they also have your data.  I have been informed by Target, Office of Management and Budget, Experian, and some others that my data has been stolen which is more than a credit card number.  So let us all blame that shy, awkward nerd, Zuckerberg and ignore all those millionaire CEO's that are storing their money overseas while selling out data to others or at the very least being lazy in keeping it safe."},

My sleep patterns are the most dyslexic. I sleep until 7-ish about three mornings a week and sleep until 4:20 something about four mornings a week. I sometimes take a nap on those days to catch up.   There does not seem to be any reason for my insomnia as it occurs those early mornings when I have been mulling a problem the day before as well as on mornings when I have been pleasantly busy the day before!  Although lately, it seems more coordinated with a full moon(?)? While up I would love to finish that load of laundry or clean the bathrooms or vacuum (as this is the time of day when I have energy); hubby is sleeping (like  a hibernating bear) and I am polite.  Instead I make my coffee and do the following: Sip that coffee and check outside in the dark through the porch light to see what might be happening (usually not much)Check out Facebook (sometimes a fun trip and sometimes a bit disappointing)Glance at the Google news and then read a bit of the digital New York TimesDo the mini-crossword puzzle from the New York Times (never brave enough to do the real puzzle)Check my photography website looking for sales or commentsTake a digital class or two from the Great Courses subjects I have downloaded (How  to Boost Physical and Mental Energy, Building Great Sentences: Exploring the Writer's Craft, Introduction to Water Coloring, English in America: A Linguistic History, Everything Gourmet: Recovering the Lost Art of Cooking---Some I have competed and am re-watching these videos just for fun and memory.)Listen with earphones to a program from the BBC In Our Time  (probably one of the jewels of the Internet)and then finally read blogs and write on my own blog.Today I discovered that the author Malcolm Gladwell has a podcast so I am subscribing to that to fill future time. I am not sharing this to impress you on the industriousness of my mind or to reveal that I might be a bit of a culture nerd or even to show that I am not as empty-minded as one might think...because I am an elder and no longer care about what people think.  I am just sharing to be sharing.

We have a good-sized vegetable garden and I have to tend about seven various sized flower beds, the rest we sprinkle on our pathetic lawn which is really just an effort to control erosion.Below is what half of 5 yards looks like.  (Our garden helpers are weeks away, so much of this work we have to do ourselves....sigh.)   ($200 and we will use it all.)We are about 70% done. Since I have company next week, I want all of the chores out of the way so  I can play.This is where it goes: I had to do lots of weeding, some perennial dividing, etc. prior to topping the beds  with the humus and after several days I am DONE with this work. Right now, I just want an afternoon bath and a book! But I do get a reward and some photos with which to play. I have written before about this germander speedwell that snuck into a pot of something I was planting so many years ago and since it looks so lovely in the spring I have let it wander.  It is a polite wanderer.  It is also called Catseyes or bird's eye speedwell and we have the wild version  roaming in our lawn.  The wild version has fewer and paler flowers."},

Yes, it is boring and maybe repetitive for some of you, but the next time you feel helpless in fixing this old planet, you now have one tool below.My state is making an effort to improve the way we deal with waste. We are composting (turning organic material into soil conditioner instead of waste) big time! And, because you may have a busier life than I, I am going to take you on this selective tour with Master Gardeners and Master Naturalists on this cold day.First, we got a slide show and a brief intro. This man loves his job and these \"Masters\" were serious enough to take notes. This facility has a potential for 200 acres but is currently only using 40. They produce two kinds of humus. That compost which is made just from leaves, branches and grass clippings and a second process from plant material and from human food wastes. They are marketed as Leafgro and Leafgro Gold. They accept truckloads from all over the contiguous counties and charge a fee to leave waste. No plastic, ceramic, tissue, styrofoam, diapers, foil or glass is accepted, although bits and pieces do sneak in. There are rows and rows of this compost in various stages of decomposition.   The plastic that sneaks in is filtered at the very end. There was only the odor of freshly chopped wood and garden mulch.  On warmer days the smells may be stronger.  We did have to be careful where we walked as there were some pretty muddy areas. They were moving into a more technological approach by covering the rows with a permeable long-lasting fabric and then pumping air to control temperature and oxygen levels for the breakdown. There are environmental companies that pick up the produce and plant materials from stores and restaurants.  This man below had more customers than he could handle and delivered from some of the finest restaurants in D.C. since this facility accepted raw meat!  He had to pay a fee to deposit these materials but still turned a profit from the retailers' fee he collected. This material was immediately covered by the bulldozer with several feet of plant materials and that insured that no rodents or animals came in.   And for us gardeners, we were drooling over the final product...black gold.  They sold everything they produced and always had a waiting list.  They sold directly as well as through over a dozen retail outlets that sold both in small bags and by the truck!  There was a sliding scale and I cannot remember the price, but it was reasonable. Now some of my readers may have no interest in this process or resulting product, but you cannot tell me you are uninterested in much smaller landfills, much less pollution, and a healthier environment!  (Don't I take you to the best places?)"},

I spent hours weeding and cutting away perennials on my knees in wet soil. My roses never got their late winter cutback and now they are 4 feet high.   Then there is the danger after taking a warm shower to sit down for an hour or so and go through emails. On these days I need a crane to get me off the couch when all the joints have joined in protest against moving ever again. A pod from my gardenia.I have spent much time going through expired packs of seeds and scolding myself for not throwing them all out or even to sprinkle in an area of soft soil, and thus, giving them a fair chance to rally. I also collect seeds in the fall and sometimes I am good about labeling and stratifying and or keeping in sealed containers, but other times they end up in an unmarked envelope and then leak all over the plastic shoe box in which I keep my seeds.  80% will most likely never germinate.  I faithfully gather black plastic seedling flats and fill with seed soil and place on a warming pad under a grow light and try to talk them into emerging. I learned that pea and bean type seeds can be shocked with very, very warm water for a minute and they will germinate more rapidly when planted.  That is my experiment with my hyacinth bean this year...we shall see. This week I took a tour of a magical composting facility which is too good to not have a post all its own.  By hanging out with gardeners and farmers I get into some of the very best places!"},
{"title": "A Talk About Home Away from Home", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2018", "text": "We were lucky in that we had time for a quick lunch at the airport before boarding for our lengthy second flight due to the layover in Charlotte. Of course, we landed at one concourse and had to make our way to the end of another. The people traffic was reasonable which made it easier to navigate and work around the people treadmill.You may not know this, but airlines new move is to not only charge for the class of assigned seats but they now charge for boarding times! I think for $14 we could board before others, and we passed on that just because it seemed so stupid and mean!  Thus we boarded near the last and overhead bins were getting full, and it was harder to get around large knees in the aisle, and stewards and stewardesses were cheering us on to get seated as fast as possible, etc.  We had an aisle and a middle seat. I almost always get stuck in the middle. The window seat had not been filled, but we put our stuff away and sat. I reset the air fan and turned on the reading light and thumbed through the airline magazine (pretending it was not full of germs) which contained articles on local restaurants, local tourist sights interspersed with full-page ads for plastic surgeons (had they had surgery ?) and executive love-matching facilitators who looked a lot like our President's liaisons. It is so hard to make a love connection when you are rich and busy, I guess. After a short time, our seatmate was coming down the aisle.  She was a stocky woman in her 50s-60s of Latina heritage with very close-cropped hair and drawn on eyebrows.  Someone commented that there was no room for her hand luggage and she responded that she was not allowed to lift over her head anyway and she would tuck it under her seat.  We did the get-out-into- the-aisle dance while she moved in.  As she reached below while next to me I noticed she had a compression stocking on her arm, and realized she could not lift probably due to some circulatory or surgery issue. I was not in a talking mood, but she was.  She was flying back to New York, her home.  She asked where we were from and what we had been doing.  I keep my responses polite but short.  Then, my mistake, I asked what she had been doing in San Juan.  I learned the following over the next hour or so:She was on 30-day treatments for 4th stage breast cancer, but doctors felt she was in good remission and able to make this trip.  She was thankful to God and felt that her future looked bright.  I felt guilty about thinking her drawn on eyebrows were overkill and was impressed by her optimism and energy.She was born in New York but lived in Puerto Rico for about 20 years of her younger life.  She had traveled various places following her husband who was in the Army.  She had taken this trip because she had to take care of her parents' house.  Her parents had passed on years ago, but neighbors had informed her that a wall and a fence had need of repair due to the recent hurricane.  This house was in a town outside of San Juan and most of the town had taken on substantial damage, so it was complicated getting there.  While there she visited with a friend of hers, a teacher in her 60s.  This woman was living in a house owned by another and it had been pretty much destroyed.  The teacher has been living in the basement without water or electricity since the hurricane.  The owner was in no hurry to repair the house and the teacher had no friends or relatives that could take her in.  Imagine living in a basement without water or electricity for months!  My new friend on the plane said she got her parent's house somewhat repaired and convinced the teacher to move in and watch it for her for at least a couple of years.  There was still some contracting work to be done and she told the woman that she would have oversight to see that it was done correctly and she left her some cash for that.All of the blue in the photo above covers roofs that have yet to be repaired on one of the Caribbean islands we toured.I am sure this was just a smidgeon of the many stories that could have been told in that town.  I read an article the other day that said Puerto Rico had been set back at least a decade in development and infrastructure.  And of course, a new hurricane season is just a few months away."},
{"title": "Do you like to Samba?", "date": "Thursday, March 22, 2018", "text": "The photo below is the back of the Capital Building and taken from the exact spot where I fell!  134 architectural designs were submitted from the US, Cuba, Canada, France, Spain, and Puerto Rico. After controversy and changes in architectural designs and more modifications of the final selection, the building was completed in 1929. The day we were there, the Governor was going to give a speech and therefore there were many police officers all around. This photo does not reflect how many! The second photo of the Capital Building above is the front of the building and was taken the day after the speech and the barriers had not been taken down.The statue in the photo below is the gateway to the Old Town area of San Juan where there are many restaurants and shops. It was not super busy on the day we were there and I think this was reflective of the reduction in tourism due to the hurricane.\"The statue commemorates the 400th anniversary of the discovery of Puerto Rico by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the new world. Christopher Columbus originally named the entire island of Puerto Rico to be San Juan Bautista (Saint John the Baptist), however, the island was later renamed and only the capital city of San Juan retains the name. Bronze plaques on the base of the monument provide pictorial representations of the ocean journey and arrival of Christopher Columbus and the meeting of the indigenous people.\"   I will not discuss the colonial guilt I felt while studying this symbol.  Soon the local Indians had been enslaved by the Spanish. This was a beautiful statue when you really looked at it.  Old Town is colorful and artistic and a perfect place to shop and eat.It is also full of colorful characters.There were examples of hurricane damage even in these simple palms along the waterfront. There were buildings that had still to be repaired and others that were brand new on the same street. I am not so sure I like the new architecture and I hope it is a reflection of storm sturdiness and not bad design. Of course, comments in U.S. social media complain that Puerto Rico does not deserve our support because it is so corrupt and the money would be wasted...so unlike the real estate projects, private university efforts and philanthropic foundations established by the staff in our White House.I did read in the newspapers of small grants and a few large loans being made through our government, so there is small hope.There are a number of small and larger forts around the island where Spain protected its colony from attacks by pirates and others.  This is El Morro, one of the more well-known and one we have visited before.  The views of the ocean and bay are amazing and the freedom of such an open area is welcome on crowded days.  There is a small fee for the museum which is part of our National Park Service.  On this day the temperature was perfect as it can get quite hot!  (This is me after my fall, and you can see I am recovering well.)We had to be at the airport by early to mid-afternoon and so had time to stop here:The sunny courtyard was protected by palms and umbrellas and in the background was some very nice samba music to get you in the mood.  I had a rum Pina Colada and hubby had the virgin version.  It seems this famous drink was created here.This barely touches the flavor and culture of the island that we absorbed in our two short days.  I didn't even mention the great restaurant attached to our hotel and the conversation with the man who runs the food program at the church that had been damaged across the street!  I also have to write the tale of the lady I sat with on the plane home and her story about the hurricane!  And I failed to mention that the very days we were there, winter storms on the north side of the island had sent huge waves inland washing cars into the ocean.  Never enough time is there?"},

Those of you who know ships can perhaps enlighten me. This happened after we had docked.This is how the locals go up and down the river. Supplies and shopping and shipping are on the bottom deck.

{"title": "Locals", "date": "Thursday, March 15, 2018", "text": "We stopped at islands in the Caribbean after we stopped at small cities/villages in the Amazon; we were able to see lots of local people.  First I must qualify this post. I HATE ocean cruises. I repeat, I HATE ocean cruises!  I only went on this one because it cruised up the Amazon River for most of its 1,000 miles. Something I would never be able to see unless I stayed in one of those villages for some time.  This ship held 900 people.  It was one of the smaller ships, but still WAY TO BIG.    Ours was the \"small\" ship on the left. When these floating giants come into a port the entire energy of the island or small city changes.  They see us as people who come to spend money (hopefully) and then leave before the day is over and we see them as very poor folks that make handicrafts and are very slow in service at the restaurants and can also be thieves.  (Two of the women on our cruise wore jewelry into a local fish market and were robbed...I know, they were idiots.)   We descend like leaf-cutter ants as we swarm into their churches, museums and food places.  One of our 900 said they thought the 20-minute tour of the local museum was too long!  It was mostly history and political leader information and one of the few things they could show to us of interest. Along the Amazon stops tourism via cruise ship is a brand new venture and they are struggling to learn enough English and to provide things that we want to buy, or see, or do. This is not just a hobby for them, this means they have food for their children and can repair their fishing boats! I will NEVER forget the haunting face of the small man in his late 40's who wanted to peddle us around the town, but the rain was too heavy for us to consider it. We gave him some money anyway, but that face...that face will never leave my mind. It is an ancient story. It is a double-edged sword, this tourism thing. One of the talks about the tribes (100s) of the Amazon forest broke them down into three groups. Those who wanted nothing to do with outsiders and would shoot you with poison arrows as they retreated deeper into the forest, those who were willing to meet briefly with leaders to trade handicrafts/food for things they needed, and those who were making an effort to meld into the Western culture so that their children might have an 'easier' life and lived at the edge of the forest. The Amazon forest, referred to as the lungs of Brazil and the whole continent, is being destroyed by both drug cartels and illegal loggers on a daily basis. It started with rubber barons 100 years ago.  Seventy-eight million acres are lost annually to a forest that is currently 2.124 million mi² and there seems to be no slowing of this with the current levels of corruption in the government.  It is a sad story and an old story and I do not regret that I saw it.Here is a good Ted Talk to leave you in a more optimistic state of mind:https://www.ted.com/talks/sebastiao_salgado_the_silent_drama_of_photography"},

The generic daily schedule for each day on this cruise was placed on your bed the night before while you were at dinner.  It was filled with items of interest, or not.  You never had an excuse to be bored.  Hubby took in many of the music shows at 9:30 while I headed to bed, but I did take in the magic show which was exceptional on that small stage. You could actually just spend time on your tiny balcony and watch the horizon go by while you read a good book. If you forgot to bring a book there were LOTS of great titles to explore on the ship.  These below were in the Explorer's Room.Note how 'tightly' packed they are on the shelf, someone works hard at that.  Each book is marked inside with a label of the lounge from which it was taken.  The Explorer's Lounge had books about explorers and exploration, of course.The first few days the seas were rough and we adapted and got our sea legs or in some cases took Dramamine. I did not get seasick as that happens to me on the smaller boats.  The rest of the cruise was perfect in terms of ocean smoothness.  Most customers on the boat were \"elitists\" in the sense that they valued expertise and education and wanted to learn more about the culture, geography, and economy of the areas we were visiting.  This did not mean that they did not politely challenge some of the conclusions of the lecturers.   There was always music playing somewhere!  There was always wine and soft drinks being served everywhere. Yes, that is a view of the mouth of the AMAZON once we had moved up into it a couple of hundred miles.There were cooking classes and dance classes and we took a small part of both.  The dance classes were free and the cooking classes were $30 each which coved the cost of the food.  If the day was too rainy for sipping wine on the bow or stern you could take your iPad or laptop and walk the public areas and learn all about the Norwegian art on board by following an audio website as well as check out the historic artifacts in the small onboard Viking museum.  They did have a lot of Munch art and I am not a fan of his, unfortunately.  Edvard Munch was most famous for \"The Scream\"  and moved through a number of styles in his lifetime.  (Note the audio clue next to the painting.) If you got tired of the lectures and the shows and musicals and even the late night dancing in the little nightclub at the bow, you could go to bed and watch movies, or a few news programs or Ted Talks that had been pre-selected to match the cruise!  Then you could be rocked to sleep by the waves (gently)."},

There was plenty to do so no passenger boredom and I will write about that in the next post. Below is the itinerary (sort of). Our cruise was similar to this one posted below but we left from Miami and ended the journey in San Juan; we did not get to Devil's Island because the seas were too rough to tender passengers ashore and we stopped in Antiqua and not St. Lucia. These are grandma and grandpa cruises and some of these folks came on board with wheelchairs, walkers, and canes!  (The itinerary was also changed a few months ago due to the hurricane damage.)We left Miami around 7:00 and got a lovely if somewhat hidden sunset.We were able to board a few hours earlier and voyeuristically watch the tremendous wealth in this part of Miami.No matter how much money you have, there are people that have so much more.  Note how the water is greenish and not a nice blue!  We soon were moving a rather windy speed and headed indoors for our first of many gourmet meals.  No, I did not take a photo of everything we ate...!I did not take a photo of our room, but it was really comfortable.  Our traveling companions got one of the nicer rooms (a suite) because nothing else was available and I post that photo below!  The ship was from the Viking line...\"In 1997, Torstein Hagen acquired four ships in Russia and Viking Cruises was born. Three years later, the company absorbed KD River Cruises, and in the process gained access to certain European ports as well as 40 years of river cruising experience. That same year, as Viking River Cruises, the company opened its American headquarters in Los Angeles. The operator has grown rapidly ever since while upholding its dedication to destination-focused itineraries that allow passengers to immerse themselves in the history and culture of their surroundings. Today, operational headquarters are located in Basel, Switzerland. In 2015, Viking Cruises broadened its horizons by taking to the seas with the launch of its first oceangoing cruise ship.\" The design and decor are very pleasing to the eye and comfortable as well!  Our friend's suite was filled with lots of great books to read and a bottle of champagne to enjoy while reading."},

Where did I go?  The Amazon River and a bunch of Caribbean Islands.  More on that later. In response to the title of this post, on the second to the last day of my journey, I took a very nasty fall in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  I fell down two concrete steps with very sharp edges onto more concrete.  It was right behind the Capital building and since the Governor was giving a speech that very afternoon, dozens of police officers were everywhere.     In no time I was spouting blood from my right shin, building fluids in my left knee and beginning the swelling of a nice left black eye where my face fell on my camera!  Guess what?  No broken bones, no stitches, and no concussion!  Had I not been going into shock, I would have taken more photos of the tragedy. Three police officers (cuter than ever and very sweet) came by and called the ambulance and two medics checked me out asking lots of questions but allowed me to opt out of going to the ER---wonder if I would have gotten away with that State-side?  I had no later headache and the bleeding stopped on the leg almost immediately with pressure and elevation although the blood flow was nasty.  I spent the afternoon watching movies in the hotel and after taking Advil applied ice and gentle movement to various parts of my body. The next day I was well enough to see parts of San Juan with a hired taxi before our later afternoon flight out.  That afternoon I had to make a fast walk from one end of the Charlotte airport to the other to catch our last flight and had no pain or problems.  Somebody up there is watching out for me...for some reason!Now I will add reading your blogs for updates to my list of things to do!"},

{"title": "Resolution on that Banking Issue", "date": "Tuesday, February 06, 2018", "text": "This snow is long gone.Called the bank (800 number), since I have no bank nearby to walk into. \"They\" being a computerized program said the wait would be between 59 minutes and one and a half hours. I love that 59 minutes math as if they had some kind of micro efficiency over their services. Maybe they should just hire more staff...but that would cut into the millions in profits and millions in salaries of those at the top! The computer system did say I could just push \"any\" key and they would \"capture\" my number and call me back when someone was able to assist me. I pushed the hashtag key and resisted the urge to also push FU. They did call me back in a little over an hour and \"Bill from Montana\" was the person who called me back.  That little cutesy response was to assure me that I was not talking to someone in Mumbai or Bangkok and that my bank hired good old boys who needed jobs in the USA.  \"Bill\" had a slow gravelly voice and a tired voice as if had just come in from hours of rounding up the steers and had put out his last cigarette.  I tried to joke and he patiently ignored that and continued in a droll voice---maybe he was an out of work actor?He assured me that the new $25 monthly fee was because I had a \"core\" agreement with the bank that required I maintain a balance of 5K.  When I asked if this meant average monthly balance he said \"No.  A daily 5k balance.\"  I calmly assured him I had another local bank that could waive those types of fees.  He responded that he could fix this immediately by putting me under a new agreement requiring a direct monthly deposit of a minimum of 250 dollars and no average balance maintenance.  He moved me over to the new agreement, re-deposited the 25 dollar withdrawal and told me he hoped I would have a nice day.  He assured me I would receive the new agreement in the mail.  (My bank is not Wells Fargo, but this gives you a clue how sneaky all of these big banks are and why you should write your Congressperson to support and not weaken the Dodd-Frank bill.)I will read the new agreement with a spyglass, I can assure you."},

It would be nice to go out to lunch with friends, but most are in Florida soaking up the sunny weather. Hubby has been sick on and off, which at our age can hang heavy on one's mind. So I get nostalgic and put on a Carole King DVD.  This is music which I had listened to in my mid-twenties (although it was a reel to reel tape back then) right after we were married and living in a small apartment on a tiny island in the South Pacific, far from family and friends.   We were more than enough for each other as newlyweds with so much to explore and new jobs to challenge us.I remember a man who was decades older than us managing a fishing plant there saying \"You will remember these days as some of the best of your lives, so pay attention.\"  We were having so much fun, and he was right as I look back on those times with a smile.So today I am also trying to get my scanner, which is acting up, to scan some of the old slides that bring back memories.  Who were those naive kids with the world in a bucket of sunlight???"},
{"title": "A Follow-up to the Prior Post", "date": "Friday, January 26, 2018", "text": "This is a follow-up to the prior post. So if you have not read that, go there and I will wait......The photo in the prior post was taken while touring Fort Charles a formerly British fort in Jamaica in Port Royal at the mouth of Kingston Bay.   This fort was built in 1654 after the British routed the Spanish on this island. It is a minor tourist attraction mainly because it shows how an earthquake (actually two) can bury and twist buildings in the sand on a Caribbean Island. I was there in 2011. What made me go looking for these photos was an article I read last week in The Guardian warning British citizens to be careful in touring Jamaica and to not leave their resort unless with a resort guide. It seems that crime, especially in the area of Montego Bay, has risen. Jamaica has always had a reputation for being an edgy place to tour. We were mildly uncomfortable there, but never felt we were in danger.  We freely toured the small town where our resort was located and while there were EXTREMELY polite beggars, we never felt concerned. We also took a small tour to Kingston town and other areas on the island. That was the day I took the photos in this post.OK, now back to my question on the photo of the school children. They are certainly neat and proper. Maybe middle school age? In America a middle school group of kids would not be this composed. Boys would be poking boys and girls would be giggling, maybe using cell phones if the teachers let them.  American children might be too jaded to even look at a crowd of tourists,  boring! And, here is my take for what it is worth.The girl on the far left is wondering if she would ever get to travel...to America perhaps.  The girl in the middle is checking out the clothes of some of the American children that were part of a family tour.  Maybe she will be a fashion designer someday.  The girl on the right is downright curious about something one of the tourists is doing.  Not sure, as I did not look behind me.Clearly, the girl with her arms crossed is a ring-leader, and perhaps a future politician.  Something significant is going on in her brain.  I feel sorry for her mama. The girl in the middle is looking for an \"in.\"  There is always an angle to everything and she is wishing she had the freedom to enter the tourist crowd.  The two larger girls on the right reveal all the sadness of poverty and isolation and lack of hope.  In the photo above, the angry one on the right is the one the world has to deal with.  There is an opportunity here, and also a big chance to fail her.  I would not want to cross her because she is making a list and checking it everyday.Now we come to the boys.  They have it a bit easier in this culture.  The bulk of the workload and responsibility falls to the females in Jamaica.   The two taller boys on the far left might be business leaders some day.  They are evaluating and thinking outside the box and fearless in their evaluation of what they can accomplish.  The boy on the far right is the clown and troublemaker.  Maybe he can be a Bob Marley entertainer if he does not end up in jail.  The short boy in the middle wants to be playing ball or cricket somewhere.  Anywhere but this stupid tour. Oh well, it is a different way to spend a winter afternoon and reminisce."},

Please don't feel so stupid or insecure, it's not your fault.\"\"I think the only difference between me and the other candidates is that I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.\"\"I think I can't do much better, right?\"\"Now, you know, I was a good student. I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They're elite? I went to better schools than they did. I was a better student than they were. I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House, too, which is really great.\"Now are you totally assured, people?  (No one at Wharton can remember this blusterous personality who had transferred from Fordham and he failed to get his photo in the yearbook and the university did not write a pro-Trump  letter when he was a candidate as other ivy leagues have done, even though the Trumps have donated almost a million to Penn State.)  And yes, I could have listed so many more comments to reassure you about how he is so much better than I.  He talks just like the people I hang out with...hardly.)"},

There is also my extensive seashell collection that I started when I lived out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in my younger years.   Most of others like these beauties are also in cardboard boxes!  I do save new buttons, just clipped from new garments and put them in a box or a bag never  to be used.  I guess I would have to admit that I have a rather extensive collection in drawers of glitter, beads, yarns, threads, connectors, paints, fabrics, batik tools, ribbons, bits of jewelry, colored papers, bits of craft from my Mother-in-Law...all in my crafting closet in the basement.  I do not use those things much these days, except if the grandchildren come by and want an activity.  They take up an entire closet in the basement! I have a growing collection of books of poetry, yes, but who does not have shelves of those?  This is just one shelf below.   I can explain how I got here at the beginning of a new year.  I  was standing  looking out the kitchen window  and then decided to take the photo below.  The photo is what motivated this rant,  post on collections for this day.

One of the real problems that I (and most of us) have is understanding each other. It is hard to see the big picture when you know the people involved only somewhat superficially. Just because you work with them and see them maybe monthly at meetings or because you run into others three times a year at one of your daughter's project events, or you chat with someone on a regular shopping trip to a retail outlet, this does not mean you have even a clue about them, about their challenges, beliefs, prejudices, history and/or motivations.  This is because the yardstick by which you measure these encounters is YOUR yardstick.  The nicks and faded numbers on it are from your experiences and your wins and losses.Our current cultural shift has seemed to drain the swamp of empathy as we are told that most people do not deserve anything they have not earned.  So, I try to work harder at this understanding of people and not come into relationships with pre-conceived opinions of where they get their opinions...But I do need some help on this one:I post my photos regularly on Facebook.  I post my photos (the ones that I am most pleased with) on a less regular basis on an Australian website that sells digital art.  I have sold maybe two dozen items and made enough money on all of them for dinner out for two at a nice restaurant.  Clearly, I would have starved as a digital artist.  I only mention this to illustrate that I do take this a little seriously.  As the year progresses I may have hundreds of photos on Facebook.  These go into albums such as family, trips, and my yard, etc.  At the end of the year, I begin to clean all this up both for personal privacy reasons and to protect my artistic work and to just be able to keep track of what is posted and what is not.  The more artistic photos I will post in lower resolution on the off chance that someone would 'steal' them.  My friends ask if they can use them for odd things and I always let them copy and re-use so it is not a hard rule.  So, now for your challenge and response.  I recently deleted a bunch of photos and posted on FB that I was cleaning up my albums getting ready for 2018.  One of my virtual friends (He is very smart, very opinionated, and I do not know him very well. He worked IT and I rarely saw him when we worked at the same company.) went off on a tangent.  He was furious that I was deleting photos and he said he was not going to comment in the future on my photos if I deleted them, etc.  I commented that I was sorry, but that was the way it was.  I went on in my life and last week decided to re-read that conversation as I was still mystified and the thread was gone!  He had deleted it.  Weird.  I do not care about this person.  We are never meeting in real life.  I am just curious about what would make a person think he had control over anothers' creative work?  Why would he care that his comments on my photos (which were short and flattering and mostly just LIKES) would be gone forever?Where is Miss Manners when you need her advice?"},

I will give you a clue. It is not covfefe. That is not a word, just a lazy tweet. Another clue is that it starts with an \"F.\"  It is not a swear word.Before I reveal this important word, I want to discuss a conversation my husband and I had on the recent reveal of all the men in power that have sexually assaulted, molested and/or scare-threatened women while the men were running businesses, making movies, drafting legislation, running cooking shows, managing restaurants, attending military shows, etc.   We were talking about why men in power do this?  (The real question is why are there more men than women in power, but this post is not about that.) My husband seemed to think it was a deep biological need.  There is a biological programming for males to extend their gene pool for survival.  I claimed it had to do with a hatred and sometimes fear of women and a need to reassure that oneself was still in power.Now that I have dwelled on it, I think we are both right.  Have you ever had the opportunity to watch an elk herd get organized in late fall?  I have.  The younger females drift over to the better looking younger elk males and give each other the tentative eye.  This lasts about 10 minutes and then the major elk, the older one with the big shoulders and rack and bigger, well you know, comes around and paws the ground and demands the females get back in their place with serious threats.  He will run off the younger elk and then strut his stuff and herd his harem roughly to the other side of the meadow. There is a deep biological need to continue one's gene line.  Male lions rape and kill for sexual reproduction and otters attack females for the same.  This is found throughout the animal kingdom. But humans are sentient, living an intelligent and civilized life; and hopefully, we have moved beyond those physical power plays and forcing themselves on others, at least most people have.  So those who molest are throwbacks to an earlier time.  They have failed to evolve, or they have a deep-seated mental illness. For those males who bemoan today going to the holiday parties worrying about how to behave, I have little sympathy.  Treat each woman as if she was your mother or sister or daughter and you will do just fine.  If you feel you need to hug someone, ask them first!  If you are under the mistletoe, act embarrassed and walk away.  If you drink too much call a cab and go home.  NEVER tell off-color jokes, ever!  Compliment a woman on her dress only if you regularly compliment a guy on his tie. I am not sympathetic to these creeps as I have been a woman always ducking that snake at the holiday party, always looking over my shoulder when alone at night, always dreading the boss who told dirty jokes, feeling belittled when denigrated by gender at a meeting.  I managed that for years, so now men can manage the other better type of behavior!Oh, the word --- feminist."},

Walking to the gate in the fog I saw two rust brown wrens flittering in the pile of kindling I had made after the last tree fall.  Since I was in camo it took a while before they saw me.2. I drove up to the city for a birthday party for my D.I.L. and upon my return, I noticed that 90% of the leaves had finally fallen in that short period turning the trees into skeletons.  Fall is departing.3. One morning this week I walked in the early mist to the dock to catch a photo or two of the geese gliding on the river.  Some broke into noisy flight heading toward the cornfield when they heard me.  Then shortly I heard gunfire and felt terribly guilty.4. Yesterday I woke early and saw that the woods were shrouded in fog, so in a sleepy \"fog\" myself put on my frumpiest clothes and headed down the street by my neighbor's houses without even taking a brush to my hair looking for photos.  It is amazing how many of my neighbors have to drive somewhere that early in the morning...wondering if they recognized me!5. Lobster tails were on sale the other day and so we bought two jumbo tails (which we may do once every few years or so) and had a lovely pre- New Year's dinner. Side dishes were asparagus sauteed with dill and oyster mushrooms and mac and cheese.  It was a mini gourmet dinner.6. My grandchildren have such a parade of guests coming through their home that they are not surprised to wake in the morning and find I have spent the night!7. I am working this week on the gift list. One of the hardest parts of this season as I put great effort to get it right and many of those I buy for live in abundance.  I do lots of donations which does lift my spirit.8. Binge-watching House of Cards and wondering how they are going to end it without the lead after so many years.  With today's support of an accused pedophile for Senate and a President who admits to infidelity, the series seems rather tame with its prostitution and threesomes.9. \"To face unafraid the plans that we made while walking in a winter wonderland.\"  No longer making those long-range plans as I age, this thought crossed my mind as I listened to my holiday music.10. This past week I have made persimmon bars, persimmon cookies, persimmon bread and persimmon pie. We gave bags of fresh persimmons away at a recent party.11. My Christmas card list gets smaller every year. I am of mixed emotions on that.12. We are well into the first week of December and I still have guara flowers and pineapple sage in bloom!  Cold front coming this week.13.  For the last in this list, I realized, almost too late, that this little fellow could have gone into the persimmon jam I was making as he was so color-coordinated!   This December has been exceptionally warm."},

The White House says he was an Obama holdover (Obama fired him and Trump re-hired him). Incomplete pass on their part and they need to explain why they ignored the FBI warning telling them to get rid of him and ignored that dear career lady with the intelligence and ethics.  I am patiently waiting for the dominoes to fall.  Trump, Trump Jr., and Kushner and Ivanka have all had ties to corrupt money launderers and domestic and foreign criminal groups most of their lives, so they know how to accept bribes, hide money outside this country, and have gotten away with it, for now. The  National lighting of the Christmas Tree had the smallest crowd ever in front of the White House this year and the weather was beautiful, rows and rows of empty chairs.  He keeps getting fewer and fewer supporters in his gatherings even on such simple unpolitical things as holiday activities.  Obama had standing room only when he lit the tree each year.  I do miss the intellectual transparent honesty of his administration. So, today after the morning news, I binge watched that old TV series \"Frazier\" which has such snappy dialogue and proceeded to make about 100 persimmon spice cookies while I watched and reminisced.   Half of these chewy spice disks are in the freezer and the other half we will eat.  The recipe only used about 4-5 of the hard persimmons, so making no dent in the harvest! Even the folks at the food pantry are too picky to want to take these home for the holidays! The kitchen was full of dirty bowls and utensils and I just finished washing a batch and am now running \"pro-scrub\" on the dishwasher for the rest.  The small artificial tree is up, a few wreaths scattered about.  Mage made me feel guilty  reconsider and not give in to the challenges my family is now facing and become a ghost (i.e. ghost of Christmas past).   We played Christmas music while we decorated and hung a few strings of lights on the deck and took out a few sentimental items.We blog readers lost the activist Hattie from Hawaii this past week.  She was tough and took no prisoners and I will miss her intellectual arguments greatly.

{"title": "Cold and Hot?", "date": "Saturday, November 11, 2017", "text": "North of us got their first freeze and we are 34F this morning with no frost on the grass. Everything still looks the same outside the windows. But I slept in. I am alone ( I keep reminding you) and I woke up around 6:00 A.M. and read a little in bed. Then I turned off the lights and snuggled back down into the soft flannel sheets and under the light downy quilt and drifted back into blissful sleep for several hours as dawn slid into place. It was the cold outside that makes me lazy and slothful inside. I love pulling up those blankets and not having an agenda set by an alarm. I have worked hard (not as hard as many) for this time in my life and I am thankful for this morning.  I eventually made a pot of decaffinated coffee but returned to reading \"The Forest Lover\" by Susan Vreeland.  (It is the life story of the Canadian artist Emily Carr based on her journals.  She lived 1871-1945 and lived in the Northwest with the indigenous people much of that time and with great discrimination by her culture.)  The writer brings me to cold and rainy British Columbia as I remain so warm as I snuggle back into bed with a warm cup. Now for the hot: For those of you who know about Scolville scales with hot peppers, you may remember the big deal when Habaneras became a fad for cooking.  They were not a condiment for the faint of heart and kept their level at the height of heat in pepper cooking.  They were rated as 250,000 to 577,000 on the scale.  Well, hubby got seeds from our daughter for the newest pepper, the Carolina Reaper, which he planted this summer.  This pepper is rated as 1.6 million(!) and has held the world record since 2013.  We (daughter, hubby and I) chopped some of them for testing.  (When green they have no heat at all!)    I took one of those tiny red pieces and put it on the end of my tongue and I died.  I spit it out, but the heat kept on.  My daughter also choked on the heat.  My grandson (pretended) it was not bad at all.  My daughter put it in some vinegar for taking home and adding to whatever.  While they are extremely beautiful, this is killer stuff.   I have no big fondness for super hot food, although I do like my chile with a tiny bit of bite.  Researching I found there is a new pepper accidentally raised in Wales that will challenge the Carolina Reaper.  It is called Dragon's Breath and is 2.48 million on the Scoville scale.I have read that eating lots of hot food does kill the taste buds over time and may be the reason that people who regularly eat hot food (Indonesians) find most food in the U.S. too bland.   I will also leave you with this caution: \"Concentrated capsaicin, found in the Dragon's Breath and other extremely spicy peppers, can trigger the immune system to go into overdrive. Capsaicin activates the proteins found on nerve endings, and those proteins can mistakenly interpret capsaicin as a signal of extreme heat entering the body, Live Science reported. The result? Reactions like anaphylactic shock, severe burns, and even the closing of one's airways are all possible, experts warn. So this extreme pepper is nothing to mess around with.\""},
{"title": "A Late Harvest of Gold", "date": "Monday, November 06, 2017", "text": "Late September and much of November are harvest times here at my house. Hubby has planted several persimmon trees outside. They are slow to ripen and, if you know anything about persimmons, the Hachaya type is astringent to eat if you do not wait until it is soft as jelly on the inside. We grow both the Hachiya and the Fuju which can be eaten before it gets soft. It is the round one that can be eaten over a longer time frame.  Early it is more like an apple and then it ripens to a juicy pear.  Its Latin name means \"wheat of Zeus\" or \"God's pear\" and \"Jove's fire\". I like that I have ripe Kaffir limes and Meyer lemons to add to the recipes.When hubby is here he makes persimmon freezer jam and persimmon bread. Since he is not here that task has fallen to me. Trying to get the accurate recipe, particularly for the jams, is hard because the persimmon has to be scooped out into measuring devices before you can find out exactly how much pulp you have for the recipe. It cannot be left out in the air for too long as it turns cloudy and brown.The Hichiya is hard to pick because the ripeness makes the fruit as soft as a globe of jelly.  Touching the fruit for this softness as well as noticing the translucence in the fruit are the clues for picking.  But you have to hold it like a soft-shelled egg.There is another problem in identifying those persimmons that are only half ripe and hoping that they can be used in a few days.Then there is the basket of those that were harvested by mistake or fell that must sit in my kitchen and give those fruit flies their best days while waiting for ripening.  (It is hard to have a glass of wine in the evening without having a fruit fly go up my nose!)I followed a persimmon freezer jam recipe exactly the other day and made three containers of freezer jam.  Unfortunately, they did not set!!  This is the problem with this fruit.  Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not.  We will use it on toast anyway.  It is also good with vanilla ice cream.  And because it is not cooked it maintains its flavor and vitamins.  According to one website \"Persimmons are low in calories and fats - they provide 70 calories per 100 grams. This fiber-rich fruit is an excellent source of Vitamin A and good source of Vitamin C and contains a range of antioxidants and minerals. But as with most fruit, you should eat these in moderation because it contains fructose, which can be harmful in excess amounts.\"The flavor?  Maybe someone else can explain, but it is sweet and delicious and one of my favorite jams."},

Now the big house is really quiet.  No pets and a quarter mile from neighbors on either side.  I cannot get good radio reception unless I carry a laptop from room to room, so I keep TV on in the background in the mornings.  I don't really watch it.  In the afternoon I play music, although my cable company has majorly destroyed my amplifier/speaker setup and it takes me some time to figure it out each time! Anyway, late in the evening when all noises are off and I am finally in my warm pajamas and reading by the light from my end table I find myself listening carefully.  Do I hear a scratching in the ceiling over my head?  Have the mice moved in again?  I strain to hear the Canadian geese down on the river, but it is just a lone Mallard because the geese have not yet returned.  Eventually, I fall asleep.  Out of the blackness of the night, I am jerked awake but not sure why.  I hold my breath and listen.  I freeze as I tune into anything that makes noise.  I can even hear the creaking of the refrigerator in the kitchen, but nothing else sounds out of place and I fall back asleep.  The next night I have the same event, only this time while I am straining to find out what is wrong I hear a loud thunk.  It comes from the kitchen and I at first wonder if a thief is making a midnight snack. I throw back the quilt and without a weapon in hand (ever the optimist) I head into the kitchen.  I turn on all the lights.  I scan.  No one is there.  No animal is hiding in a corner or behind a door.  Then I see the cause of the sound on the floor.  Thre are two of them, small and round and each the size of a golf ball.  They are surprisingly heavy for there diminutive size.  They are kaffir limes.  They have ripened and are falling from the tree at will.  I soon will have 40 of them!Kaffir limes are knobby and odd and small.  They have a very interesting and almost floral fragrance to compliment their strong lime taste.  The leaves from the tree are used in Thai cooking as the flavor holds up to strong spicy dishes.I have three citrus trees (a small citrus orchard) that get moved into the house every fall and returned to the deck each spring; a Calamondon, a Meyer lemon, and a Kaffir lime. (The Meyer is struggling as it was severely damaged when purchased, but it is hell bent to catch up to the other two.  It has eleven lemons and almost as many leaves.)I have been told it is not a true lemon, but I have no idea what that means.  These lemons are bigger than store bought and will indeed make a much louder thud when they fall in the middle of the night.  (By the way, both of these always fall in the middle of the night!)"},

He is going to be gone for a month working on a project on the other side of the globe in the middle of the ocean.  He likes to tell others it is a company he started. It is not. It is a hobby he started employing a few staff at poverty wages, and it is a bone of contention between us in terms of its expense to our personal bottom line since there is no profit margin at this stage (the first decade of its operation!). It is keeping him alive and energized, so I am of two reactions on this \"project\" and do a continual dance.Anyway, his first of four flights was departing at 4:55 in the morning this past Sunday.  Since the airport is an hour and a half from our house and since we did not want to pay for a month of long-term airport parking, I had to drive him up there.  But since he knew that he had to be there at 2:55 A.M. for check-in which meant we had to leave at 1:30 A.M. for departure from this house, he compromised by offering me a fancy dinner at the city restaurant and an overnight in the local airport hotel using points.  It meant I could sleep in, which I did, get one of those awful free breakfasts and leave for home the next day around 8:00 A.M.I had not been in this city for over a year and was impressed by all the changes.  Like many cities, it has its challenges with crime, budget limitations, and culture issues.  But the state officials have made a deal with the devil (a fossil fuel company from another country) and seem to be able to upgrade the nicer parts of the city as this company moves into the state's rural areas and expose others to air pollution and sudden death---NOT an exaggeration as I live rurally.  Chances are slim this wealth will trickle down to the more challenging areas of the city and the school systems.  I have not given up hope, though.Anyway, while walking around the more touristy parts of the city on a perfect fall weather afternoon, with only sparse numbers of tourists, it became a nice evening to say goodbye to my husband before our temporary separation.Below, a few photos I captured after a fancy cocktail in one of the seafood restaurants.Lots of new dock space for all the yachty types.Lots of crime-free sidewalks to enjoy after dinner although a few skateboarders and bikers could have used some discipline.Fancy places to work and to live in the heart of the city.And plenty of chain restaurants to appease the citizens along with a lovely sunset."},

Or would you rather avoid my complaints? They are big and small. The biggest is helping a loved one fight depression and alcoholism, fully knowing my help is in vain most times and realizing that I am only pretending to pull them back from the cliff. We are in good days now so I can focus on the blog and my glass is half full.The medium reason for a lack of creativity is that multiple health problems have been visiting hubby. Nothing death threatening or even scary. Just constant reminders that our bodies are falling apart as we age and making me face up to the fact that I have to take on more responsibilities and accept a more careful lifestyle as the years move on.  (And also try to find more diplomatic ways to get him to slow down rather than screaming at him.)Also, I have friends and friends of friends involved with the California fire disaster and I do feel helpless so far away. Yes, this is all linked to climate change... ALL the Armegaddon shocks as our oceans heat up. Scientists are now finding that the warmer the waters of the ocean the slower the circulation of the major currents and the potential for tremendous changes when those biggest bodies of water stop moving. It will mean climate changes in huge areas, loss of seafood, and loss of land food.

They are putting huge sums of their money into solar farms. Just today the Saudi's admitted that developing solar farming is so cheap they have no trouble finding the lowest bid for their development...and they are an oil-rich country!The smaller reasons for my funk, but no less important, and tied to the paragraph above, are the horrible things happening to our country and the way some Americans accept exaggeration, daily contradictory statements, and outright lying as a means to an end if they agree on that end. Well, now that I have got that off my chest, maybe I can actually write something next time!?"},

I am of the belief that travel keeps a life in perspective and in technicolor. Without travel you have a life of monotony and lots of grayness except for an emergency or miracle or two.  Yes, life tests you but if there is little testing of beliefs, testing of bravery, testing of what is trueness, that is a life unearned.  Travel is better when leaving a safe place, and even a journey to a new town down the road can be a learning experience if one keeps their eyes open.Of course, there are those who are afraid of having to negotiate with someone who does not speak their language, or who speaks it with a thick accent.  There are those who do not like being at the corner of a street unable to read any of the signs and being watched by the locals who sit on their benches with blank emotion in their eyes.  There are those who are put off by peculiar food smells and certainly repulsed by bizarre-looking foods.  Screw your courage to the sticking place, my friend, because this is not an us and them situation.I consider myself an introvert based on all the tests I have taken and the literature I have read.   Having written this, I am also pretty outgoing on travel.  I am addicted to answers and always asking questions from the locals and other strangers as I suck up all of the newness of where I am.  I even ask questions of the tourists, because they have their own funny stories.  My ice-breaker is using photography.  Those selfies usually lend themselves to an offer so that both parties can be in the photo or so the person can pose.  Recently while in Amsterdam and walking through their city park, which most tourists miss, I came across a lovely young woman with a bouquet of flowers in her arms using her phone to take a photo of herself with a large chestnut tree in the background.  A tree...a simple tree to frame her.  Of course, I immediately offered to take her picture for her and used a larger framing that would truly lend perspective to her tiny body and the monstrous tree.As we later talked, she asked if she could take a photo of my husband and me which we agreed.  She explained she was from Turkey.  She was traveling alone and had been traveling for 20 days.  She was heading home the next day.  She was a chemical engineer and had just graduated and was going to start a new job in her homeland.  Now the cynics would remind me to check my purse and pockets when she left and other cynics would say she was something other than a chemical engineer and was just lying to impress or deceive us.  But I knew she was real.  Most people are real.  You have to believe that the globe is full of honest, hard-working and generous people or why live?"},

In the photo below, he is turning a very small wheel (palm size) that adjusts thrusters and moves us every so lightly toward the shoreline to dock.  He turns just degrees!The lower level crew that handle the rest of the ship usually come from the Baltic states where jobs are few and skills are high.  Their ability to speak English is a premium for these jobs.At least the maintenance can be done in an open-air office.  These ships are amazing in their complexity.The crew that deals with the passengers are usually from the countries that the ship passes through. Germany, Nederlands, and France were the homelands of our shipmates.  When I asked they said they usually have 8 weeks on and one week off.Above a toast with Aquavit to the success of our voyage, by the Hotel Manager and the Chef. There is no staggard seating for dinner, but they managed to mass produce a decent meal with variety!Some of the crew were multitalented and sang and played instruments. (It was not as hoaky as it may look in this photo!)And the Cruise Director was also super outgoing, full of humor, full of the double entendre, and a good sport...she only wore this costume on the last night and looked professional most of the rest of the trip.The serving and cleaning crew were mostly from the Philippines and a long way from home.  I took the photo below in a haze as my cold was beginning and while we were waiting for our shuttle to the airport.  We were almost the last to leave the ship."},

But, while in Amsterdam, I became intrigued by the edgy more modern architecture. Perhaps it is because I live in the country and rarely see cities or have time to walk about when I visit them.All of the pictures below were taken in Amsterdam...just Amsterdam.  There are some really dramatic modern buildings in other parts of Europe, but I did not get a chance to see those so I will share these.Above is the ceiling as you enter the Van Gogh Museum which was remodeled just a few years ago.  (I personally feel they totally failed on the sound suppression as the high floors get the brunt of the noise below in the open areas!)Below is another museum...I think it was a marine museum. My favorite is to try and capture a library or two!  I wish I had had time to go inside. Now for some more \"edgy\" buildings. I think this above is a hotel? Lots of buildings on stilts, maybe due to the fact that Amsterdam is below sea level. Man seems to be getting smarter about environmental building, privacy in cities, affordability, and durability.  I wish I had time to study the history of each of these projects and what the people thought after they were built.(PostScript to Granny...

{"title": "Of Course There Were Castles", "date": "Tuesday, September 19, 2017", "text": "The major point of moving down the mid-Rhine region of Europe on a riverboat cruise is the ancient castles that dot the hillsides. Some of the castles are abandoned and in ruins, others are privately owned---one by a Japanese man who paid 25 million Euro(!), and others have been turned into hotels, perhaps charging prices not reflective of their service(?)...some even with parking at the top of the hill!Most of the days were overcast and trying to get good photos of the castles without the definition of sunshine was a challenge.They were all sizes and shapes.Seeing castles from a cruising river ship is certainly the lazy way to experience the history and architecture, but I was able to visit a few castles. They require walking up many stone steps and then navigating lots of cobbles and slate and rock beds. People trip and fall all the time as they look away for a second from their foot placement.  The photo below was the only one I could find where I captured the uneven terrain.  You can see the threshold was smooth, but further in, it was treacherous!\"To reach my bed, I have 158 steps to climb, explained Hermann Hecher, the genial owner of the Burg Reinstein, near Bingen. \" And it's really terrible when I forget something. Because then I have to go all the way back down and up again!\"  Taken from Castles in the Air, A Journey Down the Rhine.  Hecher, a former opera singer, purchased his castle from Prinzessin Barbara von Hessen und Rhein, Herzogin von Mecklenburg, for the sum of 360,000 Deutschmarks---whatever that translates to today.This one above is definitely a hotel.  I read that nearly all the castles on the mid-Rhine are not medieval castles, but nineteenth-century reconstructions of medieval castles.  \"Most were built in the 13th and 14th centuries to collect customs duties for the Holy Roman Emperor.  Seeing what a good business it was, so-called Raubritter or Robber Barons, build their own castles to get a piece of the action.\"  This was an area of Jewish merchants and they were especially preyed upon.  By the end of the 17th century, most castles had been destroyed in feuds and wars.  Today more than 60 castles remain.The stories from this area are haunting like the Grimm Brothers horror tales and romantic like words that were written by Bryon and Shelley.Die Pfalz constructed by King LudwigThis castle in the photo above was known for breaking up the pack ice that came down the river in the spring.Castle maintenance and repair is not for the faint of heart.  The government sometimes will provide a grant or loan, but like agro-tourism, they make money by putting on falconry shows, having butterfly houses, and renting out for weddings.And as you can see from these photos wine is an important crop.  It is a passion with the Germans and I learned for the first time that Reisling can be dry.  The slate stone upon which the castles are built is important in absorbing the heat of the sun which is important to the vines growing at the upper limit of this wine growing area.  I did not go on a wine-tasting because they are usually unrewarding to me.  If I ever return I will pay for a private tour, which is better.Yes, the grape harvesting on these steep hillsides is still done by hand, but fewer and fewer are willing to work that hard and small wineries appear to be closing.Well, thanks for coming along the river with me.  By the way, do you have a favorite castle?"},

This type of thing always reminds me of how naive Americans are to think that the history of our country is weighty in time. We are just babes in the woods of civilization. Amsterdam is a high-energy city with a young population.  They have a population of close to one million and at least 1.8 million bikes.  While they have an excellent tram and bus system, the streets are cobbled in places and narrow in others with limited car parking.  Most bike owners have \"backup\" bikes to use when their bike gets stolen.  There is a whole black market where a stolen bike can be purchased to replace your stolen bike.  The police offer no real assistance as this seems to be too routine to attempt to enforce. I did wonder how on earth a tired worker found his bike at the end of the day!   We were cautioned about kami-kazi bike riders many times as we got in the habit of looking both ways when crossing streets. Amsterdam is a very liberal city as most people know.  We accidentally walked around the red-light-district, but the only way one would recognize it in the daytime was the pornographic postcards and the fluorescent condom displays in some windows.  Night time is when the curtains are drawn open and women advertise, and we were tucked safely back in our hotel rooms by then.   The flower market sells cannabis seeds and there are pot-pubs to kick back and relax.  These areas were obvious by the many cigarette butts in front of the sidewalks the next day. The city itself is very safe and lovely with surprisingly clean canals.  We did take a canal ride, but the walks were more rewarding. We have been home for days, but I caught a cold two days before our flight home and while I managed to hold it together for the 7.5 hour flight, I completely collapsed upon our return and have been in bed being lazy for the last three or four days...what day is it anyway?  I actually felt sorrier for the Ukrainian of over 6 feet who had to sit next to me in the window seat in pretzel formation listening to my sniffling!  I hope his business trip was healthy!"},

We are lucky to have a small bicycle shop in town and he found a lime green/red racing stripe bike that just suited his needs. It even had hand brakes! Something new for him to try.  The photo is filtered to hide faces a bit. Then we had to plan dinner as it was late in the day. First, we had to check the crab traps to see if that was what we were having! What fun hearing him squeal when the traps had crabs. We ended up with 9 medium sized crabs which made enough for the three of us!Back up the hill to start cooking."},

Yet just when you think you have your balance, it comes at you sideways and you find yourself tumbling and frightened and helpless as you are pushed head over heels. Things are going to be broken and maybe irreparable and most certainly scarred. I am now in the phase where everyone still has shards of glass and is in prickly pain and is lost in their own thoughts while they lick their wounds. We are all pulling our tools of amazement, shock, anger, bitterness, love, hate, helplessness from the deep dark shed.  There are still those of us who naively think we can fix it.  Others have drawn their lines in the sand.  As our eyes clear we can see down the foggy road and do not like what is ahead. The road is longer than we thought and far rougher and covered in the blood of others as if warning us to turn back. But there is nothing behind us.

I have not looked at the weedy flower beds, but since it is currently raining pretty heavily, I feel no guilt for that. We set Calgary as our base of operations.  We were going both east and west from there.  Years before we stayed in Canmore which is the gateway to Banff National Park but this restricts touring to the park itself.  This year the park entrance fees were all waived because it is Canada's 150th anniversary.    The weather was perfectly warm, mostly hot some days!  Banff was flooded with tourists (mostly from Asia) and Canadians.  The main attractions had little if any parking and we finally tried the major features on a Thursday early in the morning just to get in.  The remote trails and lakes were more available.    Everyone above is waiting in line to see the waterfall up close through a hole in the rocks at Johnston Canyon.  When we came here years ago there was only a handful of people.  Not exactly the experience one hopes for on a mountain vacation. In addition, further south and west there were hundreds of large and small forest fires.  Some started by lightning storms and others by careless campers.  Ranchers had evacuated leaving behind sheep and dogs to watch the sheep and only taking a few horses.  Large parts of the park were closed due to that.   The air was not difficult for breathing and you could just barely smell smoke, but when the wind shifted the scenery disappeared.  My eyes were red the next day.  Fortunately, later in the week, we got rain followed by some lovely scenery.   To make things even tighter all the Bears were down by the valleys eating the berries to get fat before winter and those parts of the park were closed off with \"crime\" tape.  Of course, the bears were not following the rules and sometimes pulled away the tape to get at more food.  One local Canmore woman who jogged each morning with her dog wandered into the restricted area and was attacked (only slightly injured) by surprising an eating Bear.  There was some talk about her being charged for entry into a restricted area, but then the Park realized the tape has long disappeared and she would not have known.  What an insult that would have been, a wounded shoulder and then a Park fine!  Park Rangers do not get paid enough.  It was an adventure.I had seen the popular spots (Lake Louise, Bow Lake, etc.) years before and did not care, but my son and DIL had not, so we braved the crowds.  Quite frankly I could have closed my eyes and imagined I was back in NYC, it was so crowded in those places.  We spent some days going to the eastern \"badlands\" area and even those places were well visited.  Maybe everyone who had planned to come to America decided Canada was more friendly.

If the addiction is small or inconsequential we may call it a bad habit or tick, and if it is bad for us we know it and must find a way to shut off the endorphins provided or compromise our life greatly. If the addictions are rewarding to others we call them talent.  Someone I know is addicted to listening to others problems and solving them, and he is pretty good at it.  If not rewarding we may call them annoying or a bit crazy, like grandma's insistence that hanging the laundry at an exact time of day prevents rain.I have a number of addictions, but certainly taking photos or editing photos each day, is one of them. I cannot take a walk around the yard without thinking about the way the light or shadow falls, the movement of some creature, the pattern of some botanical miracle, and then wonder how the camera lens could be framed to capture the feeling that I get when my eye falls on the object or scene.  This cosmos below was a quick capture this morning and I only adjusted the lighting levels.  The undulations of the petals of the cosmos are addictive.I am most annoying when walking through a city as I want to stop and hide in a corner for a while and capture a zillion candids of all the activity or frame a neat story I see.  It is not as much fun when they know you are taking their picture as you hurry by with your 'pack', but there are indeed a million stories in those eyes.The result of this \"chasing the light\" is thousands of photos that must be deleted. If I am honest with myself the majority of my captures are mediocre at best. The few good ones are most certainly derivative and the best is a happy accident if I am truly reflective.Above I wonder if this street performer loves to mime and act and be the center of an audience, or does he do this so he can eat for the week?What is your small or big addiction?"},

Local artisans trying to push their products.  There was a booth of lavender beer and another of lavender wine.  I tried neither in the hot sun.  There were lavender soaps and creams and had I been in need I might have purchased something.  Instead I bought live herb plants because parts of my herb bed were bare.I ran into a gardening friend, Ibu (names changed to protect  myself), who is a strong woman my age, who has traveled the world with a husband formerly from the state department.  They continue travels to esoteric places like shell conventions in France!  She is always firm in her attitude.  She speaks enough French to get by, but her history includes growing up in Poland until she was six.  She still speaks good Polish and told a story about some people she met in France who claimed they were Polish.  “Hmph!   They kept calling a food they liked “porogue”.  I know how to say pirogue!\"  Then she explained that she and her husband did not buy their shells from tourist places but had collected many when  they were diving many years ago.  “Buying shells is not appropriate.”  She has a strong and attractive face with full lips, a strong jawline, and light brown hair that may have been dyed and pulled back casually by a plastic clip.  She always looks well put together without being dressed up.  Ibu went on to tell us a story about an acquaintance they knew in Asia who was always trying to collect the best shells and 'one-upping' everyone while not even knowing about shells.  She laughed as she explained that the couple had purchased a large and rare turban shell which they placed in a prominent place in their patio so they could brag about getting it only to find the green color was not natural and washed away in the rain.  This seemed to give Ibu some satisfaction.I met my final interesting person of the day that afternoon while shopping for groceries.  He is actually someone I have seen fairly often.  He works as a checkout clerk and  has been in my grocery store for the last ten years.  He looks close to thirty in age.  I will call him Clark.  Clark is somewhat overweight, has dark, close-cropped hair, and has a small  mustache to break the plump circle of his round face.  He wears dark rimmed Clark Kent glasses.  We often have all kinds of conversations while he prices my groceries.  He is someone who talks to everyone, even if you are old enough to be his grandmother.  I have learned things about him over time, such as that he likes computers, he likes computer games, he has firm convictions about things certainly food, he seems to have come from  a loving family, and he sometimes likes to argue for entertainment with me.  This day we were talking about personal appearances.  I am not sure what took us down that path (perhaps a headline on one of the tabloids), but I had gotten on the topic that women were admired for their delicate and diminutive beauty more than their strength of character and ideas.  I pointed out several women in the world who did not fit this mold, but had changed the world for the better with their non-diminutive attitudes.  He agreed and said that he did not like delicate or frail females, but liked women who were strong, although he did say physical appearance was about 30% important as well for attraction.  He explained he had always been a big kid starting when he was eleven and pretty much was the size then that he is now.  While he took on the role of protector for his younger brothers and sisters, he did not date much because he was so much bigger than most in his school.  We somehow got on the topic of his not ever finding a gal that he really was attracted to although he was still looking.  I looked at him and do not know why I responded as I did but very quietly I said, \"Maybe you like guys instead?\"  He looked right back at me and said,\"Actually, I am bisexual.  If I see a gal that looks good I notice.  If I see a guy, it is the same.\"  I smiled and wondered how we ever got this close standing across the check-out counter.People are fascinating to me."},
{"title": "Gifting", "date": "Monday, June 26, 2017", "text": "I am thinking that there are several types of people when it comes to gifting for birthdays.1. Those who do not want anyone to make a fuss and who only want time (at any time during the year) with those they love. (This is me.)2. Those for who have everything and pretty much accept they will not get anything they need but remain gracious anyway.3. Those who are clear about what they would like for their birthday. (Some are kind enough to give a range of items to cover financial boundaries.)4. Those who want the same thing every year. (My hubby wants either an outdoors hike or a fishing trip.)5. Those who would just like you to \"fuhgeddaboutit.\"6. Those who make an evaluation on what you gave them either in cost, time spent, or accurate targeting and therefore you have to give the gifting some thought.My son-in-law is number 6, not in a cruel or mean and judgemental way. But if you hit the target he is effusive and if you do not he is mildly polite. He is also a blend with number 2 in that he can afford almost ANYTHING he wants and usually goes out and buys it the minute he tells you he wants it. In other words, he is hard to gift.He and I have the love of theater and cinema in common, and this year the Smithsonian had a lecture (2 weeks before his birthday) with Ann Hornaday, the cinema critic for the Washington Post.  He was happy and loved the fact that I did not tell him what it was, and he loved the puzzle of spending an hour on his phone trying to find \"happenings\" in D.C. on that night while he was waiting for us to join him for dinner downtown.  (The night before he and my daughter attended the Bono concert in Virginia, so you can see the standards I was up against.)He did not find the \"event\" via phone search because the Smithsonian lectures are not really geared to the Millenial demographic, so I told him what we were going to do at dinner.The lecture was fun and she name-dropped everywhere, let us in on behind the scenes gossip and promoted her book which my son-in-law bought.The additional cool part was that venue was in the Navy Memorial building.  I did not know it existed, had never been there, and now would like to return and explore the area another time.This lecture ended while the night was still young, so we went out for $12.00 a plate desserts!As you can see, the plates are MUCH larger than the desserts.  Not sure what the reasoning behind that was, but this town has people who make lots of money!Hit a homerun this year."},
{"title": "Post Father's Day", "date": "Monday, June 19, 2017", "text": "Hubby, on the right a month after his knee surgery.My husband's father's day was filled with activities and love and fun even though we did not leave the neighborhood and the heat was unbearable. We all get along these days, although our politics brought some tension in the past.  Thanks to Trump we are all on the same side. I was not close to my father although I loved him very much.  I am sure that makes you raise one eyebrow.  My Dad was a quiet and reclusive man and when he lost his hearing in later years, that meant he was frustrated and talked to me even less.  So there is a small shadow hanging over Father's Day when I think of my Dad and my guilt. My son has wanted for almost two years to become a father and it does not look like that is happening after spending money and going to the doctor.  They do not talk about it and there was some easing in that yesterday when they actually dropped a phrase or two about probably not having kids.  The day was packed with folks, so I did not poke and pry at that tender bit of news. I imagine this was a tough day for them, even though they work at spending time with my daughter's children.My husband has a friend who was working hard at getting his life back together and starting a new tourist venture in the South Pacific.  He had nine children.  He was 44 and passed away last week from a sudden and totally unexpected heart attack.  That family is working hard at getting through Father's Day, I am confident.I am sure that there are families that have perfect relationships and that had a love-filled holiday where everyone had lots of homemade food and were thankful when they sat down to eat, or shared a hole in one with their dad, or hiked a cool mountain trail with their dad, or even just shared a beer.  But there are lots of folks for whom this day is a bit of a trial and I raise a glass of wine to them."},
{"title": "Three Questions", "date": "Thursday, June 15, 2017", "text": "When I peruse the Internet, it is to me very much like taking a tour around the world and getting to meet some of the smartest people on the planet, and it makes me count my blessings. As much as the Internet is criticized for being invasive, a time waster, a tool that keeps us from being face to face with others, like any new tool/toy/distraction/technology there are both good sides and bad sides to its existence and we are the deciders for how we use it. As a child growing up I remember reading how television reduced families from talking to each other and introduced outside influences that interfered with parental ideals. Television was going to dissolve family life as we knew it--- the same television that let us see John Glenn on the moon, and saved me in grad school with Laugh In, and these days bringing many exotic and brave and energetic people into my home as my world grows smaller with age.   There were conservative and religious families in my small town that carefully limited their family viewing time and devoted the rest of their evenings to reading the Bible, singing songs, or playing board games. My parents were not religious and I guess they did not fear we would be changed by the outside world anymore through television than we would through growing up and facing those life changing questions on our own.  The TV was on perhaps more than off in the evenings (all of us worked hard in the summer at jobs to save for college), but my two brothers and my two sisters  (one who passed from cancer many years ago) and I grew up to be contributing members of society, with stable marriages honed by acceptance and compromise, and while sometimes divided by politics, still keeping a good sense of humor most of the time.  The mistakes we made in life were from the culture of our communities as much as the culture of television.I feel the same about the Internet in that you can dwell on the angry, vitriolic, scary, amazing news or you can go to the slow and in-depth studies on the issues and the sharing of ideas and memories of amazing writers/journalists and begin to understand why you may feel the way you do and ways you can change or adapt to those ideas. I have been reading articles from a site named \"The World Economic Forum\" and recently read an article written by Paolo Gallo, Chief Human Resources Officer, Member of the Executive Committee, World Economic Forum, Geneva.  He wrote an article about his father teaching him about growing up and suggested three questions to ask yourself at the end of the day to help you live a purposeful life.  This works while you are young and also if you think have just a few short years in the future.  It works for me.  These questions are: 1.  Have you learned something new?2.  Are you helping others?3.  Do you love what you are doing? The full article is here."},

{"title": "Thinking About Stuff", "date": "Sunday, May 28, 2017", "text": "There seem to be two philosophies of how we approach the lives of others in this world and how that applies to our resources.  There is a group of people that do not see wealth they have made or inherited or found as something that is due to them wholly because of their efforts or the result of having good genes.  God may have provided this wealth as an opportunity to lead change for the better.  It is a power that they can use to help those who need help because others lives did not go so well.  If they do not believe in a God then they look at this wealth as a responsibility and opportunity to do something good in the world in addition to creating more wealth.  These people see themselves as part of a huge tapestry of humanity.  They may see themselves as a leader, but also as a part of the whole of mankind.  Humanity that is good, bad, or indifferent.  They want to help weave this tapestry into a better pattern and see their wealth and power as a tool in that direction.  They look for problems to solve outside their daily professions or sometimes within their professions.  Wealth is, of course, a hugely indefinable thing.  Someone who earns $30,000 in his first job may think that driving for Meals on Wheels and paying for the gas and car maintenance out of his tight budget the least of a contribution he can make to those who do not have an income or cannot get out to get food.  A man like Tom Steyer who is a hedge fund manager worth 1.6 billion sees his opportunity in funding (hugely) environmental programs to keep people on the planet healthy while fighting the corporate energy companies that do not care about climate change, even though the CEO's believe it is happening.   The second group of people are those that see their wealth as their right.  It is due to them because they were born into a family of amazing hard-working and smart people.  OR they got their wealth because they knew how to work the system to their benefit.  They were SMART.  They do not think there is such a moral measure as a \"fair\" deal.  You win or you lose and that is your opportunity or your failure. They are part of the good gene pool and they think those in the poor gene pool cannot really be helped.  It is a Darwinian view that most are poor because they are stupid, lazy or weak.  The losers are drug addicts, criminals, or not able to adapt to our changing world fast enough.  This second group put their money into more growth or put it away in offshore banks where the socialist governments cannot \"tax them to death.\"  They can be the man who makes $30,000 in his new job and spends a portion of that hard-earned money on a few guns to keep him safe from the \"others\" that do not fit into his gene pool such as that loser neighbor next door who is some weird religion and untrustworthy by his odd behavior.  They can also be the billionaire who runs for office and is not interested in being part of any group...Republican or European allied network or ANYTHING.  The billionaire who owes his power only to himself and never sees himself other than a leader of others.  He is smart enough to decide who wins and who loses and it sure as hell is not going to be him on the losing side.Then, of course, there are a bunch of folks in between walking the tight rope trying to balance being good with being safe and with being financially secure and with keeping someone from killing them for disagreeing with them.  At least that is my take on it right now.  Maybe I am oversimplifying."},

It was the European Union Embassies Open House.  This year they celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Marshall Plan, which was crucial to rebuilding Europe after WWII. They are clearly \"grateful to the United States for our unwavering support of European peace, unity and prosperity\". And they are celebrating the 60th birthday of the EU, which all began with the Treaty of Rome!  Twenty-seven embassies participated, including Britain, which was a bit of a surprise.  The event was from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM, so we were able to hit only a few of the countries.There were food bites, cultural singing and dancing, and fun costumes.  Many of the embassies had experts more than happy to talk about their areas of expertise. I learned from one handsome man in Uniform at the Italian Embassy all about the Carabinieri in Italy and its extensive global mission.The Italian Embassy was quite modern indoors.Those Embassies that were actually open did have security, which went smoothly and with a smile.I was able to see where the large wet umbrella goes in a $440,000 Roll-Royce at the British Embassy.  I asked the tall handsome man if he came with the car and he smiled and said \"That could be arranged.\"The Brits put out a Downton Abbey style table and some tall beauties.I saw wonderful costumes of historic figures such as Pola Negri at the Polish Embassy and soldiers at the Latvian Embassy.At the Latvian Embassy they were handing out all sorts of informational materials and when I asked if they had a list of their authors who had been translated into English the woman disappeared back into the Embassy and brought me a book of short stories, a book of poetry and the Ambassador to discuss literature!  Unfortunately, I was too polite to ask for a photo.A day well spent, I would say despite the cold and damp weather.  A very important union and only those who know their history can understand its importance.  Now I want to visit Latvia!!"},

{"title": "More About Being \"In or On\" Time", "date": "Monday, May 08, 2017", "text": "I may have mentioned that on my good days I read a few pages of Marcus Aurelius book titled \"Meditations\" before I take a nap - not to disparage this classic but saying it puts me to sleep.   It is a challenging read since the language has the cadence and vocabulary of a Roman Emperor in the mid- 100's A.D.   That was certainly a time that was filled with intrigue and powerful people.  Time that moved very differently than time today.   I went to Wikipedia and this is what they wrote about his book:  \"Aurelius' Meditations, written in Greek while on campaign between 170 and 180, is still revered as a literary monument to a philosophy of service and duty, describing how to find and preserve equanimity, a state of psychological stability and composure, in the midst of conflict by following nature as a source of guidance and inspiration.\" Certainly fits these times, does it not?  So what did this philosopher/ruler have to say about time?  \"Every instant of time is a pinprick of eternity\" I think that I like that it reminds me how I have so little significance on this planet that my worries would not even fill the tummy of a mosquito.    Some cultures move in monochromatic time and others in polychromatic time. Is that why we do not always get along with each other?  You arrive too early for dinner and I arrive too late and no one arrives on time!  We cannot agree on the correct time.Have I moved us closer to an understanding?  Now does that make you feel better?"},
{"title": "Time is a Moving Thing", "date": "Friday, May 05, 2017", "text": "Time has been a very relative thing for me these days.  Spring is always a rush.  Flowers bud, bloom and petals fall in just hours as the sun chases night across the sky.  Within a month we have days of spring, summer and fall crammed together like a mixed race family, each with their own pleasures and pitfalls. I watch a bluebird househunt in the morning, build a nest in the afternoon and lay her eggs while I am sleeping that evening. The purple iris blossoms race each other down the strong stems while spewing out grape scent across the yard and finally giving way in the strong rains bowing down to the lawn.  My roses cover the arbor and then in what seems just a day or two drop all of their lovely pink petals like best wishes at the wedding march.  My days have been full of tasks and errands and trips and schedules and spring continues on her way not waiting for me or anyone.  My obligations are only on my time.  Her time is hidden somewhere in a space continuum over which I have no control and little awareness.  Did you know that a long time ago towns had their own schedules and set their clocks without coordination of any nearby village?  Their time/space continuum did not depend on anything other than their view of how fast the sun was moving. Time is relative.  Someone, somewhere, has a spring that lasts at least a month.  They sip tea and watch the morning sun kiss the buds of roses and then watch as Dianthus burst forth with their cinnamon scents and pink lace-edged blossoms.  They watch the bird building the softest of homes with bits of grass and tufts of seed pods along several days. Mother Earth has her own time clock.  It goes so much slower than ours that we miss the melting of icebergs, the increased flooding of coastal planes which climbs each year, the death of tiny microscopic beings that hold hands with larger microscopic beings until entire coral reefs centuries old are gone...and so on, and so on.The data gatherers notice these things because their clock moves much slower than mine.  They can gaze over decades past as they thumb through their well-worn penciled notebooks of graphs and numbers and they count the changes in meaningful ways.  Soon this earth time will catch up with us all."},

The benefits are tremendous: I get to hang out with like-minded strangers that smile at me and nod;  I have conversations with people who actually are knowledgeable about chemistry, history, poetry, immigration and how government works (and it DOES work); I am getting some well-needed exercise; and I get to walk by some of the most beautiful architecture in the world.   While I think this new museum has too large a footprint it is amazing in style.I worked on the inside of the Federal government for decades and while there were \"pencil pushers,\" braggarts, lazy folks and political appointees who were there because they were related to some Congressperson, 90-95% of the workers were people with training and expertise in their field, a vision to make things better, and no interest in making a fortune off the backs of others.  A little naive, maybe, but honest, certainly. We met up with the Union of Concerned Pissed-off Scientists to get some signs before heading out. No, they are not all that young. The Park Police were in all their glory waiting the impending storm.  They are terrific workers in that almost every Saturday these days there is some protest march going on! Last week I was involved in the March for Science.  I got to see Bill Nye the Science guy; Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, Pediatrician, Michigan State University who was the Doctor that discovered her young patients had high lead levels in Flint, Michigan; Mari Copeny, aka Little Miss Flint, who at 10 while overwhelmed by the crowd read her speech with great aplomb; Leland Melvin, astronaut and S.T.E.A.M. Explorer, and a bunch of other beautiful geniuses and leaders.   We also were entertained by the Jon Baptiste House band while waiting in the cold and pouring rain for free!  What a dedicated bunch of nerds! We were a little far from the stage but certainly close to one of the Jumbotrons.  This weekend it was the March for Climate Change, which included a larger and more diverse group of people and a larger march.  We got together for breakfast with my Sister-in-Law from Colorado and her family and friends here in D.C. and made some signs at their hotel.  Some were affiliated with the Fair trade USA Group  and so we went to the Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream sponsored float since he had donated money to their cause.  He was there being interviewed by network television, but we missed that.   We then left our posse as they took the kids out of the heat and we marched with the indigenous peoples group that had some very cool dancing and the best drums (even in the 90 degree heat - climate diversity anyone?) as well as several ceremonial \"smudge pot breaks\" in the middle of the street.  Gotta love free speech!  There was only handful of of anti-science protesters and absolutely no violence or arguing.  We had received our \"marching order\" to focus on our mission and avoid dissension and that worked just fine.  It was like a 1960's  meet-up without the pot because that is illegal in D.C.  So what did you do last Saturday?"},

I have not even had time to read a single blog post from all of you until a few days ago.  Today I have a short reprieve and can post.  My student had to work and cancelled her class.  I should be weeding the garden on this cool and misty day.  I have a house that really needs cleaning and at least two laundry loads to do. But instead, I will blog about my trip.  California was beautiful.  We stayed at a resort near the Crystal Cove State Park and did get to glimpse the spring flowers and the ocean on the first few days.The grandchildren loved the beach but the Pacific is usually wet suit temperatures, so they did not swim.  It was also a bit \"surfy\" and they scared the you-know-what out of me while their Dad explained that raising children meant you let them take risks.  Fortunately we only spent a short time here as there were many other activities on the agenda.Even the heated pool at the resort required some baring it all in the cooler winds to enjoy.  The mist in the mornings off of the Pacific was lovely, but cooler than expected.  Yes, it was a \"fancy\" place.Hubby had visited Knotts Berry Farm when he was about seven years old, decades ago, and wanted to revisit with his grands.  It had that old fashioned charm of an amusement park without all the dazzle, except for a wild ride or two, and while my grandchildren are really spoiled with fancy vacations, they were not so jaded that they could not enjoy the place.Two of the grands panned for gold as hubby had done so many years ago and came away with a small jar of gold flecks (salted by the miner, of course.) The youngest got into the spirit of the place at the gift shop.  The next day we toured Los Angeles Staple Center with all its bronze statues, saw the original Capitol Records building, Jimmy Kimmel's studio in Hollywood (door), walked on the \"stars\" on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, tested the hand prints that many stars placed at the Chinese Theater, and did a drive by of the homes in Beverly Hills.  I will not bore you with the hundred or so photos.  I had never done this type of tour, but my son-in-law was over the top with excitement, and my daughter was thrilled to see her favorite comedian's, Lucille Ball, former home.We also spent an afternoon touring La Jolla beach and ate at a nice restaurant overlooking the beach.  I may share the lovely late afternoon photos later.We spent five days here and then had to leave the resort as they could not accommodate us for the full week, but we got to go to the \"real\" San Diego and meet up with Mage and her husband for an outdoor lunch!  That in the next post."},

But what if you have conflicting instincts? I do have two conflicting instincts.  One tells me to hibernate  at home with my forest and my birds and my garden and stay safe.  These activities rarely disappoint.  They often reward.  The other instinct tells me that hibernation means the mind and spirit will become sterile and stale and may just eventually die.  Therefore, I am routinely battling with these two noises in my brain. I fought the instinct to just veg because I do that a LOT of time in my retirement days.  I read, I cook experimentally, I play with photography, I garden, I watch TV, I download courses on my laptop, I blog, all of which allows me to remain in my cave and face challenges at a snail's pace. Master Gardening activities do force me to go to meetings, participate in events and work on projects with others.  My family is just near enough that I am called upon to babysit or share an activity with grandchildren who will, all too  soon, be young adults themselves.  I force myself to offer dinner to friends a few times a year.  It  is work and I  get nervous (odd at my age), but it always ends up being time well spent. My instinct told me that volunteering with the Adult Basic Education office would be both a challenge and a reward.  The reward has been in inspiring people to bring their best to the table.  Another reward has been re-learning all that I forgot!  The challenge has been  in taking the time to prepare lessons and work through the clunky library computer software to schedule a study room and then to find this was all for naught as my students, who have their own challenging adult lives, cancel on the day of the lesson. I am  currently working with a woman from Peru who has passed her high school equivalency but still  finds everyday English an effort.  She wants to go to community college, but her lack of command of English would hold her back.   She also is still saving money for this from her  full-time job.  One recent afternoon we met for a lesson after she had cancelled the prior week.  She  had said that her husband had  a \"cholesterol emergency.\"  She had to  take him to the hospital. Once we had settled in and spread out our work, I asked her how her husband  was.  Her face fell and she said he was just fine and back home.  She  looked very tired and claimed she was fighting a cold. I opened the vocabulary book and looked at our lesson and asked her the first question.  She fumbled a bit and when I looked up her face had collapsed into pure  misery as she tried to hide her weeping.  Suddenly the lesson was forgotten as I reached out to hug her and asked what was wrong. I never expected the \"Telanovela\" episodes she was going to bring forth.  It seems that along with PTSD her husband has a cholesterol problem, yes, but more significantly he has a serious drinking problem and that is what brought him to the hospital.  He  tells his therapist that he is going to quit drinking and like many with addictions goes home and starts drinking, and as many know, the turn away from alcoholism has to really begin with  the alcoholic.  When in the Navy he was very physically fit,  but now a knee injury and an arm injury have left him far less able to be as active as he would like.  He is retired but did some work with a construction company and had a falling out with the boss.  I am sure he sees his life as useless.  He  has lots of excuses. Well, this is only one of  the issues as her concern for his drinking has made him violent and threatening  to her.  She grew up in an abusive home watching her father abuse her mother, and perhaps without knowing it, she has returned to something familiar here, and she is frightened. Then there is the Telanovela episode of her not being able to stay in  the  country if she divorces him.  She is about nine months and $1000.00 away from getting permanent residency and the immigration officials are already suspicious that her marriage was one of convenience and not love, and perhaps it was.  When one is living in a country filled with crime and poverty and daily dangers an inroad to that golden America is hard to pass up. If you do not think this story could get any more complicated, she is living  with him and his ex-wife!  According to my student the ex-wife is very kind  to her and helpful...to the point of buying her a car for her to get to work.  The ex-wife still works full time at a good paying job for Navy intelligence but has severe arthritis problems and is looking forward to her own retirement.  The ex-wife is still on the husband's retirement pension.  I know,  it is all very strange. I am  certain that a psychotherapist could complete a research paper on all three of these people.  I, on the other had, could only recommend  she walk on eggs for now, call an abuse hotline and make an appointment with a legal aid lawyer.   (I  did offer to pay a legal aid fee, if there was one.)  I was terrified for her but knew I was in no position to really give advice and knew all these problems were taking their toll on her.  For me it was a dangerous and tragic story, and I was not naive enough to think I had the whole story.  For her it was her daily life.  She works in retail and  it reminded me to be  ever so nice to  those workers as we have no idea what their daily life may be like. Well, if that does not inspire your week and encourage you to listen to your instincts, I do not know what will."},

The fact that the far right held their ground and stopped millions (more) from losing health care has given me hope.  I have tried really hard to understand those who voted for a man whose speeches sound like an angry grade school bully.  He has claimed he graduated at the top of his class, but this is certainly not reflected in any of his rhetoric or his endless golf.  He has no favorite books, interesting American history quotes, or rich pals that are intellectual businessmen.  He has no detailed vision of how to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.   He has no plan of how to spend the increase in budget for the Defense Department which even the Generals agree they do not want now. He claims he is a good businessman, but my broker (whom I just called to adjust my investments to make them less risky as this market adjusts) just told me that according to their experts (this is one of the largest brokerage firms in the country) he did worse than possible based on his investment and all his bailouts from his dad over the last two/three decades.  If he had taken that money and just invested it, he would be worth far more than even he could imagine.  But he did not beat the market in 3 decades with the money he was given!But just being wealthy would not give him the endless visibility he demands.  Watch almost any popular New York TV show and he was walk-on over the years.  He finally had to create his own shows.  He demands attention.  He is not a Republican or a Democrat and I keep thinking this is some wry God's humor as he will use this President to bring both parties together on at least a few functional bits of legislation.  Far stranger things have happened this year.Imagine a Congress that actually meets, compromises, and SLOWLY get stuff done!! OK.  No more political rants.  Next post is about my Peruvian English student...not necessarily much happier though."},

She has a very demanding job with a consulting industry, works with some good people, is active with a women's legal organization, and also has to deal with some male chauvinist pigs in the company.  Yet she has managed to hold her own while raising three children and running the household activities.  This past week she came down with the flu on Monday after nursing her oldest who had contracted the flu the prior week.  She rarely calls us for help but she had to as she had scheduled a last minute fly-out to Chicago for just the day (an important luncheon with a group where one of the leaders, a cyber security expert, wanted her there for various reasons)  She also felt the meeting was important for her career.  Due to snow delays the week before, a repairman and a furniture deliveryman were scheduled for the day she was to fly out.  We were happy to head up and house-sit since we had planned on driving up that weekend anyway for a Smithsonian lecture.She made us an amazing Thai shrimp dinner the night before she caught her plane.As luck would have it, the youngest son came down with the flu the afternoon before she left, so we did nurse duty, took him to the doctor's, and completed our house-sit duty for the next two days.  He seemed to weather the illness as children sometimes do.  Periods of rest... followed by creating a magic show for his granddad.Hubby had been nursing a mild sore throat the day before we went up, so he was a bit compromised already.   Here we are four and a half days later, and back at home, and neither of us has gotten sick! We did get our flu shots this fall, but were told that they are only 50% effective this year.  Maybe we dodged the bullet?  I am still keeping my fingers crossed.Daughter did not cancel the dog-walker which was good as I had not brought snow boots and the sidewalks were pretty slushy.  (Yes, some people call this a dog...).I do not know how young parents juggled all that comes their way and I try not to think about it."},

{"title": "Though the Mind's Eye", "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2017", "text": "We had this strange couple over to our house the other day.  They appeared to be in their seventies but  were rather gregarious and energetic for that age.  It was a bit exhausting, and a little bit annoying on my weekend off from work as they seemed to be talking all the time and they had enthusiasm for anything and everything.  Maybe they did not have many friends and had all that pent up stuff to share.  Yet, in all honesty, it was somewhat our fault, as we had initiated the call to visit their yard.  A friend had suggested that they also had some hillside erosion issues when they built their house and that we might get some ideas for our yard. It was a three day weekend for my husband and I.  I was glad to be out of the city and back into our newly purchased get-away on the river.  The house is over 70 years in age tucked against the trees, but has been well maintained.   It was not large and still needed a lot of superficial work as a son of the prior owners had lived there a year and repaired nothing.  The rooms with contemporary high ceilings and track lighting and the wide windows overlooking the river on the left side and overlooking the backyard with a view across the river and the softer view of the marsh on the right from our rise of land were what I looked forward to soaking in with a cup of tea each Friday.  Each view was a painting.  Everything at the CIA had been tense these last weeks, and even though I was in the history section of the department writing biographies, I could feel the confusion and craziness just outside our section.  Warden, my husband, could shut everything out while he worked on his computer code, but I was in a room of people separated only by cubicles and could feel the distraction.  I was working on a detailed biography of Sarandji of the Central African Republic which had not been all that intriguing.       Anyway, Warden had called this elderly couple for a tour of their yard on the river.  They did sit on a bit of a hill, but the slope down to their tributary of the river was much softer.  It was hard trying to keep up with the couple, casually dressed in jeans and hoodies, on what was our warmest day of the new year thus far.  They showed us every single tree they had ever planted in their ten years of living there.  They pointed out various birds in the woods, the vegetable and flower gardens, and finally we got to the side of the hill where they had placed retention walled supports that we were interested in studying and the river where they had put in rocked reefs to deflect the waves from eroding more shoreline.  The couple talked over each other and corrected each other like long term married couples do.  I decided that the best method was to divide and conquer.  So Warden took the husband for a while and I followed the wife.  Then mid-way we switched.  When we finished, we of course had to invite them back to our house to get their advice on our land challenge.  They were like happy dogs, covering paths and identifying plants and suggesting reinforcements in our yard while we tried to keep up.  By the time they left at 1:00 PM I was both hungry and ready for a lie down.  I was also wondering with some trepidation if our paths would cross more often when we fully moved down here.(P.S.  The above is mostly true and happened last weekend.  We are the elderly couple, of course, so I have no idea what was running through the younger couple's minds, although I wrote this as if I did.  But I do know we (hubby) talked way too much.)"},

It includes my son and his nephew and niece (my grandson and my granddaughter).  It has that almost fisheye look as well.Note the hand in the frame on the lower left.  This is a better example of how hard it is to clone certain elements out of the photo.  I tried to pay attention to detail, but it becomes obvious when you repeat a pattern from somewhere else in the photo over the part you want to clone out, particularly when there is not much background to choose from.  I also took out my sweet granddaughter but just left the light color of her clothing and it looks like a jacket or backpack, perhaps.As a follow up to my prior post I had given up on getting the geese as the focal point of my photo.  I could have cropped it down, but the focus was too poor to be useful.  I just removed my neighbors for the heck of it to show how photos can lie.Errol Morris in his book that I am reading wrote: \"It is an error engendered by photography and perpetuated by us.  And it comes from a desire for \"the ocular proof,\" a proof that turns out to be no proof at all.  What we see is not independent of our beliefs.  Photographs provide evidence, but no shortcut to reality.  It is often said that seeing is believing.   But we do not form our beliefs on the basis of what we see; rather, what we see is often determined by our beliefs.  Believing is seeing, not the other way around.\""},

{"title": "Is It Fake?", "date": "Saturday, February 18, 2017", "text": "These colder days have given me time to focus (and I do mean that as a pun) on photography.  I am reading a book titled \"The Mercury Vision of Louis Daguerre by Dominic Smith.\"   I am also reading a book titled \"Believing is Seeing (Observations on the Mysteries of Photography)\" by Errol Morris.While both books are about photography they could not be more different in tone or focus or era.  The first is a biographical fiction written with the prose of a poet or a romantic or a photographer.  Paris in the 1800's is seen through light angled scenes and colors and scents that makes it easy for me to think I am there. The city is dirty and ugly, marred by revolution and class separation, but still filled with lovers and artists and lamplight.  The fictional theme of the book is Daguerre's search for the love of his life at the end of his life while becoming mentally compromised by the cloud of mercury poisoning from his years of photographic work.  While it is fictional, it is done very consistently.  A series of nude photos are taken by Daguerre of an important figure in his life and we see how he decides to pose them and why and how photography began to change the society.  He asks one elderly woman whether she wants to have a daguerreotype made of her and she scolds photographers for trying to capture \"death.\"  It is a frightening new technology and considered as a sin among many religious people at that time.Daguerre talks in the book about how the person changes the minute the camera lens is upon them, and therefore, it is impossible to get an honest essence of the person in a picture.  At that time a person may have to sit for several minutes in front of the camera, and candid shots were unknown.In the second book I am only 30 percent through the 300+ pages.  It is a discussion of the truth of photography and the accuracy of interpretation of a photograph by others when viewed years later.  The writing is a bit tedious and forces the reader to question almost everything in what we see and how we come to conclusions about what we see. \"We may know the order of the photographs but that doesn't mean we know whether they were authentic or deliberately posed.\"  This struck me as certainly important today with the magic of digital painting.  Some of you may remember the photo of the dusty and bloody Syrian boy sitting shocked in an orange ambulance chair after an Assad/Russian bombing of his home.  Assad claims the photo was fake, even though witnesses attest to its reality.  There are so many photos of children in pain and maimed after the war, one wonders why the Syrian President claims this one was fake?  Is it because it truly captures the emotional horror of this war?This taken from Wikipedia on the truth of photography:  \"Charles Peirce's term 'indexicality' refers to the physical relationship between the object photographed and the resulting image.[2] Paul Levinson emphasizes the ability of photography to capture or reflect \"a literal energy configuration from the real world\" through a chemical process.[3] Light sensitive emulsion on the photographic negative is transformed by light passing through the lens and diaphragm of a camera.[4] Levinson relates this characteristic of the photograph to its objectivity and reliability, echoing Andre Bazin's belief that photography is free from the \"sin\" of subjectivity.[5]\"  So much is covered in the preceding sentences that one could talk all night about it.Another person who writes about photography, \"Sontag also describes the inability of a photograph to capture enough information about its subject to be considered a representation of reality. She states, \"The camera's rendering of reality must always hide more than it discloses…only what which narrates can make us understand.\"[25]\"  This is clear to me as I frequently frame the photo to leave out distracting or extraneous stuff and may later photoshop to erase it.There are lots of photos on social media sites where celebrities state one thing or another about life or politics.  Almost all of them are fake, their images being used without their permission.  There are other photos that have clearly been enhanced with romantic mist or fake snow or something to make them softer and more beautiful than the original.This seems to be a theme these days.  Viewers are being duped everywhere.  How do you know something that was shown is real or not?  You can search online for testing fake news and a number of sites will come up with guidelines.  Factcheck.org and Snopes are reliable sources for analyzing something written or said, but they do not usually focus on photos.  You can find a reverse source search for some photos here.  This is sometimes used by photographers to see if their image has been stolen and used elsewhere.Fake stuff has been around for a long time and will be around, perhaps forever.  (Apologies for my very poor photoshopping of the image above.  I was too lazy, and perhaps too low on technique, to present something more believable."},

I kind of dread this having to head out and having to be on my toes at this time of day.  I am a hard person to please.  I know this is both good for her and certainly good for me to get back into remembering digraphs, graphemes, irregular verbs and whatever.  This is a free wheeling project in that the county has done its job and I have no hard curriculum to follow.  As you may remember from a prior post, I have PILES of books to choose from and am trying to hone my focus and create some structure to this journey.She wants success yesterday and I have explained to her that there is no magic wand that she or I can wave.  But I keep thinking to myself, am I focusing enough in the right areas.Anyway, while I feel full of satisfied hope at the end of each class, I do feel a bit of tension as I plan each lesson and as I head out to each class.I do know that this is probably good for me and I hope it is good for her and I will continue to stick my courage to the sticking place and just do it!"},

Remember his characterizations of African-American culture and living conditions.Jesus began his public ministry with a proclamation of the need for repentance, that is, \"re-thinking\" our lives. Trump has said he isn't sure that he has ever asked God for forgiveness.In Matthew's Gospel, Jesus called on us to repent as he began his ministry. Immediately afterward, he gave us the Beatitudes. In those eight couplets, Jesus gave us the formula for Christian life.\"Blessed are the poor in spirit, theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\"Generally, we take this to mean we should be \"detached\" from worldly goods. We don't have to dwell in poverty, but we don't measure the value of life or people by their wealth. Trump brags about his wealth. He lives ostentatiously. He sees such enormous wealth as perfectly OK, even laudatory. He does not think he needs to contribute even the socially required minimum to the commonweal, the common good, by paying his taxes. He ignores the needs of the poor.\"Blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted.\"Jesus meant for his followers to be empathetic, sharing in the joys and sufferings of others. If we want to be comforted by others we must mourn with them in their sorrow.Empathy is a part of the Christian life. Donald Trump mocks people for their looks and handicaps. He mocks those who are empathetic. When Jeb Bush said, immigrants come here out of love for their families whom they support, Trump mocked him.Narcissism is the antithesis of one who mourns with others. Narcissism is a preoccupation with self. You cannot share in the sorrow of others because you are only focused on yourself. Only you count. Trump is a textbook narcissist. He is so busy bragging about himself and the size of his crowds, so busy obsessing over every slight, that he cannot mourn with others.Jesus also said \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.\"When we think of \"meekness\" Donald Trump does not spring to mind. Meekness is an aspect of the virtue of humility. It is the quality of deferring to others and being open to learning from others. Humility means not arrogant, but teachable. Meekness requires that we admit when we are wrong. Meek people are not puffed up with themselves.\"Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for justice or righteousness, for they will be satisfied.\"Justice or righteousness in the Scriptures was a right relationship with God and others. It was being zadok, righteous like St. Joseph. It means we should humbly seek to conform our lives to God's commandments and not our own will.At a minimum, it means that we should treat others fairly and keep our commitments. A man who cheated his contractors and repeatedly evades his creditors in bankruptcy is not righteous. A man who defrauds people enrolled in his so-called \"university\" by taking money and not delivering training is not zadok.A righteous man is more than just doing the minimum. He goes beyond justice to mercy. He upholds the widow and the orphan and defends the alien and the stranger.\"Blessed are the merciful,\" says Jesus, \"for they shall be shown mercy.\"Can a man who advocates torture and extreme interrogation techniques be considered merciful? Can a man who advocates beating up people at his rallies be called merciful?\"Blessed are the pure of heart, or the clean of heart, for they shall see God.\"Everyone struggles with this, to be clean of heart. Lust and greed cloud our judgment and become competing \"deities.\"But a man who admits to and brags about groping women cannot be called pure of heart. A man who objectifies women, by assigning \"numbers,\" is not pure of heart.What does he worship? Physical beauty and superficial attributes? He owned the Miss Universe pageant. Such a superficial and degrading view of women is not pure of heart.Can we imagine Mother Teresa or Dorothy Day in a beauty contest? What number would Trump assign to Mother Teresa? What does he see when he looks at virtue and goodness?Jesus says, \"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God.\"Can a man who would deliberately target the civilian families of terrorists, in violation of the law of war, be called a peacemaker? Can a man who is so thin-skinned, that every slight, every disrespect, every implied insult, must be answered by a full frontal Twitter storm be called a peacemaker? How does he make peace with others?He never apologizes. He never backs down or lets up. He does not do what peacemakers must do: listen. He does not see the other side's point of view. He does not credit his opponent with good will.He sees every opponent as someone to be shouted down or roughed up. He is not a peacemaker.Finally, Jesus says, \"Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you and speak ill of you for my sake, for your reward will be great in heaven.\"In other words, we don't have to win every argument and answer every insult. We don't live for the praise of others. We live for the approbation of God. Him alone do we seek to please. When we are insulted, we should offer it up and let it go. Jesus tells us to love our enemies and pray for our persecutors.Repentance is not an option for a Christian. It is the essential beginning of our Christian life. Every follower of Jesus must at some point repent.The gospel Trump is preaching absolutely contrary to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. We who stand in the real pulpit should be willing to say so.[Fr. Peter Daly is the pastor of St. John Vianney parish in Prince Frederick, Md.]"},

Enough of this!  I am back. I have been going through old photos and taking a nostalgia trip being glad that I lost only a very few things with the crash.  Below is my Maxfield Parrish (one of my favorite Art Deco painters) version of the mountains in Breckenridge Colorado which I took  a few years ago!  (I am so glad I am back!!)"},

{"title": "Sorry, But the Truth Sometimes Hurts.", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "\"This post concerns Donald Trump's elevation of Bannon to leading roles within the National Security Council. To review: the National Security Council (NSC) comprises important high-level government officials including the President, Vice President, Secretary of State, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Director of National Intelligence. Its main job is to use this broad expertise to advise the President on national security matters and assist in carrying out security directives.Yesterday, the President reduced the involvement of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Director of National Intelligence from the NSC. He replaced them with Steve Bannon. Bannon has no government, intelligence, or high-level military experience; his experience is leading a propaganda outlet (Breitbart News) that peddles nationalist and white nationalist viewpoints.This would be deeply concerning in and of itself. But one of the jobs of the NSC is to oversee a secret panel that authorizes the assassination of “enemies of the United States Government” – including American citizens. These targeted killings are fully authorized by law under the Congressional military authorization act following 9/11. There is no trial, no due process, and no public record of the decision or the assassination itself.Just to recap the absurdity: the President of the United States has appointed a known propagandist, nationalist, and white supremacist to replace the highest military adviser in the country on a council that authorizes secret, legal, targeted killings of American citizens (and others) without due process.What You Can Do:- Call your Senators and Congressperson this week and demand that they publicly and legislatively oppose Trump’s appointment of Steven Bannon to the NSC.- Spread the word about this news to your networks, since this is not getting a lot of coverage right now.\"This was cut from a FB post."},

The one I was supposed to use was way down at the bottom of the back hidden under a tiny ledge.  Since the PC did not come with any graphics or icons, this was an honest mistake.  Still it cost me money to have a nice man, retired from the Air Force, come fix the plug-in.  He was also able to install drivers for my scanner and newest printer. When looking for drivers for the Canon printer, a few years old, he found that Canon said it was NOT updating any drivers for any of its hardware for Windows 10!!  Therefore I once again have an obsolete printer, as well as one unopened packet of printer ink!  The printer was free to me, but the ink was very expensive.  I only used it to print photos, which was rare.  You get better quality product from the professionals in the Internet.  At least my wireless printer works!I am only writing this to hope that others will not be surprised when their digital baby dies unexpectedly.  I was told that this solid-state should last much longer...of course, time will tell.As you can see it already has fingerprints all over the impractical shiny top part.  It also has red racing stripes that glow dim and then brighten like a sport car revving up for a race around the track.  It could have been designed by Steve Jobs, who you may remember was more about form than function.It runs very quietly with no rattle of a fan.  It has multiple intakes for air.  It also seems to process a tiny bit faster, but since I am not playing a high graphics game on this machine, I really am not testing its full potential.I had learned from my earlier crash to gather all the software license numbers, disks, serial numbers and whatever was needed to bring the opening screen back to something I recognized.  I am embarrassed to say I could not find how to open the DVD driver for many minutes. I could find all the info on it and the place...but the only eject button W10 seems to use is under the File Explorer's icon!  Yes, it makes sense if you think about it.Well, enough boring information that most likely means nothing to both computer wizards and all the rest of the world.   So, I will leave you with a photo from my new gallery that I just loaded on this baby.  These guys are here regularly certain times of the day."},

I got a solid state drive as the last time my PC was repaired, last year, they explained to me that it would last longer...and it is,  of course, more expensive.  Well it arrived in the store yesterday and they said as part of the  service they would remove \"bloatware\" and \"set it up.\"  The young man was drooling over the speed of the processor and some other technical stuff I can barely understand, so clearly I bought something way out of my league.  I cannot remember the last tme a 20-something chatted with me!Anyway, I picked it up and brought it home.  It is an ASUS, which is a brand now under the DELL umbrella and Consumer Reports said it was well made and their repair response was reliable.  It took me some time to clean out the old PC, dust, remove cables, etc.  Then I got the new tower out of it foam snug box and took out the directions (6 sentences in English) on how to get it running.  I  miraculously found all  the  ports for the two monitors, the new keyboard, the mouse and the electricity.  I wisely left the two old printers and Scanner on the other table alone.I finally plug in the power cord and turn it on!  I get the most beautiful red racing stripes lit across the sides and front as it hummed very quietly.  I waited.  The monitors showed nothing except that they had electricity from the PC and then they went to sleep.  Nothing.  No old-fashioned DOS prompt, no screen with blinking lines, nothing.  I was going to load the one CD I found for the newer monitor, but the disk drive does not open except by computer command, so that is a null and void process.I have finally given up and scheduled an appointment for a home  visit as I am not hauling all this equipment back. He/she is coming tomorrow afternoon and I am  going to watch closely what he  does, because this is a real mystery...unless the PC is broken in some way!!

Perhaps the chaotic news that I read on the machine broke  its heart?My hardworking friends who have given their lives to handling jobs in research and security are depressed as they are criticized in the public without proof or a chance to defend their side of the issues.  We are returning to a society where intellectualism and education are liabilities.  Fear and opinion carry more weight than fact.  Maybe my PC is just tremendously depressed  as it relies on data to work.I am pro entertainment industry, pro science research, pro academia, pro public schools, pro public libraries and pro journalistic voice.  I am smart enough to follow  the trail of a news story to see if it holds water and do not  need to  reduce the press corps to the 6 who agree with the leader as Putin has done.  I am pro transparency except when our country's security is involved as I do trust those who have been trained to analyze our threats from other countries.  Are some people in these fields power hungry, liars, stupid?  Of course, just  like  some real estate moguls.  But I continue to think  this is the minority and most public servants enter the field to serve the public because they are not going to get rich  doing these jobs.  No wonder my computer is confused and committed suicide! I just re-booted and the PC is gone, gone, gone.Sorry, but this is a BAD day for me.   I hope to be more moderate in my next post if my bank statement is flush enough for a new computer and I  feel that I have  the energy to do this.  (Thank goodness that  this old laptop  is still working.)"},
{"title": "Compromise and Acceptance", "date": "Monday, January 09, 2017", "text": "I am a novice of this being alone for days on end.  Coupled with a snowstorm that has prevented me from seeing anyone for days, and being a person who is not crazy about talking on the phone, I have lived in a very hollow echo tunnel it seems. I am surprised when I say something out loud and it fills the room.  A simple bump of the pipes has me listening for something wrong.  I have had the TV on more than usual and played the Christmas music until I became tired of that nostalgia and had to turn it off.  I am reading Marcus Aurelius's \"Meditations\" out loud in bed, which might otherwise annoy my husband. There are people in this world (I have friends) that live alone and work alone, but also have a calendar filled with coffee dates, exercise dates and dinner dates.  I do wish I was that type of a person, but I am not.  I have a calendar filled with a few hobbies and am blessed with children who see me now and again.  I can go for several days in a row and never talk to anyone, and miss people, but not really miss people.  It is hard to explain.I do think about what habits I would absolutely have to change if my husband passed on before me.  He is in excellent health for someone in his mid-seventies (swims a mile once or twice a week, runs four to six miles on the elliptical every now and then and is far more active in general than I) and both his parents, who were not in excellent health lived into their late 80's and early 90's.  He is becoming more forgetful.  This is hard to measure because he always has been a bit scattered on details and location of things.  Still, even now he admits his memory is not as good as it used to be.  He called today and complained about how he forgotten his backpack when loading the boat, lost his phone on a hike, but while both were later retrieved, he is having fun and does not let the annoyance get to him.  When he is home I do spend more time than I would like looking for something he set down somewhere.  It is what it is. Could I live out here in the woods all alone?  I read a blogger, actually a few bloggers,  who live alone in the country and relish the quiet and beauty.  I think I would have to find some compromise...not the city or the suburbs...some community that is rural but has amenities and a sense of community for the less agile.  My children have said that I could come live with them, but they both live in the suburbs which means I would have to be able to drive to get anywhere and I would be in a neighborhood that is empty during most of the day.   I must admit, what a luxury to be able to think about this, to not be forced into some situation...at least for now.  It is wise to be willing to admit that compromise is in the future of most of elders.  Compromise and acceptance or you do battle with the inevitable."},

Maybe the Google search gods have put down the eggnog and are back indexing bloggers posts and recognized my reset.  I had been feeling like the decayed mushroom above and was wondering if I should just stop blogging for a while and do all those things I have been procrastinating about for a few years.  Now it seems I have a brief reprieve with at least one blog being revived.As most of you know, and many some of you agree, this new year will be a big challenge for those of us who love and support gender equality, education and access to that for others as well as ourselves, the free press and journalistic excellence in helping us understand what is going on (thinking about the movie Spotlight for example), the precious and fragile environment, labor laws and labor negotiations to empower the worker, access to healthcare for everyone---already in every major country, political humor that is satire, broadway (all theater actually), religious tolerance, acceptance of strange cultural foods and dress in this country, and trying to understand why polite behavior is no longer the norm but being PC is so yesterday.  And what the hell is alt-truth?  Is this snowflake being too sensitive?  Within the last two months there have been FIVE rope nooses hung at the liquid natural gas construction site and our Sheriff  seems to be at a loss to find out who is doing this, and we wonder if this clearly racist act to some of us is looked upon as just a joke by our county government who thinks voters are too stupid to understand their policies.  Maybe next we will see the Star of David painted in blood?   This site has all kinds of security and cameras and limited access in part because it is next door to the nuclear power plant.  We all wonder why the culprit has not been caught and why they have all this expensive security if it can be breached so often.  I mean, even if you work there, you cannot drive onto the construction site, you must take a shuttle bus from the parking lot across the highway.  So this freedom to threaten hate is now at my door.  They have been required to bring in the Feds finally, but who can trust the FBI after our President-elect has pointed out their incompetence.Anyway, my immediate challenge is a long list for the New Year and I am actually going through it pretty fast already.  Therefore, I can ADD to it if I get energetic.  Hubby is leaving tomorrow for a camping fishing trip to Florida which means I will be alone for two weeks.  It will be a good challenge for me to be on my own, but I am guessing the TV will be on more in the afternoons for background noise.Today is a rainy and cold day and so gloomy outside and I am sure that is contribution to the mood of this post.  I promise to be more mellow next time."},

Perhaps it was fortunate that the 30 or more of us met in a therapy room and with a therapy dog who was such sweetie I wanted to steal him.  The therapy business was hosting the meeting and providing the space.  Over 50 signed up to attend and over 30 actually showed up.  This was a HUGE challenge for me as I am not someone who can in any remote sense look forward to a \"meeting\" much less one where I do not know a soul!  It was being held up-county, so I knew there was no chance of me running into anyone local to ease the angst.I did not take photos because this was a \"secret group\" meeting.  Some of you already know what I am talking about and for those of you who do not, it makes no difference.  It is a superficial designation with good intentions.Anyway, once the ice-breakers were finished, the room was filled with the chatter of estrogen.  I am sure it would have made some men deaf and others blind.  There was one young man there who left the second the meeting began to break up.While the break out groups came up with no surprising issues to address and no surprising strategies to implement, their hearts and minds were in the right places.  Unfortunately the whole time I was there I kept thinking that other groups were doing this in smaller and more focused ways and with higher profiles.  Were we re-inventing the wheel?  Part of the discussion had to do with a name change for the group because the national umbrella had decided they wanted to be a \"storytelling\" group and if we wanted to be a pro-active group we had to use another name!  This group of ladies were definitely NOT going to tell stories.  They came from environmental groups, private businesses, state and county offices and several, like me, were retired.  They are blue ladies buried in red offices and social circles where they had been shouted down angrily if they tried to make a point or promote an issue.  They were gunshy, but in this setting realized they were not alone and that in numbers things get done.  Us older folks do not get gunshy easily.I will probably not be active with them because at my age I have no patience for embryonic development.  The two leaders were beautiful, intelligent and broad thinking women and in just a month have pulled together a membership of over 1400 women from three counties.  I just was hoping they wanted to focus on more local tasks.  Maybe they will in time and I will monitor that.  Since I have one or two issues that burn holes in my mind and heart, I will probably begin to investigate and support groups that meet my narrow needs."},

{"title": "A Fake Venice on a Garbage Island", "date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2016", "text": "There are changes that I have made to my budget to be a bit more proactive as a citizen.  One of these was to take the half-price offer for digital versions of the New York Times which also includes a batch of free news magazines.  Conservatives say it is liberal trash propaganda and liberals say it has become a corporate shill for backing down on  hard hitting news against the conservative corporate machine.  Thus far I am feeling if I support it (at $7.50 a month) I will at least get a year of news reading that is not as awful as television has become.  It will give me news on everything and not just politics and I become the driver for time I want to read and what subjects I want to read, and since I do not have birds, I have no worry about newspapers to recycle.  I can read it on all my electrical devices.I most recently read a book review:  \"If Venice Dies\" by Salvatore Settis.  I visited Venice decades ago and was so impressed by its exotic decadence.  I was a naive traveler at the time even though I had lived for some time outside the USA.  I have just spent time looking for Italy photos from 2003, after slides and after prints and finally found them on a DVD!The photos that I took were from an older low resolution digital camera...wish I had been able to do better!Now for some text from the review in the NY Times:\"The beginning of Mr. Settis’s book is its own plague of terrifying facts and figures. Today, visitors outnumber Venetians by 140 to 1. If tourism development continues apace, the city center may soon have no residential lodging at all. Among the institutions that have closed since 2000 along the Grand Canal: the National Research Council, the Mediocredito bank, the transport authority, the local education agency, the German Consulate. Souvenir shops have replaced grocery stores. Luxury hotels have replaced medical offices.“A tourist monoculture now dominates a city,” Mr. Settis writes, “which banishes its native citizens and shackles the survival of those who remain to their willingness to serve.”There’s a depressing falsity to it all. The city has become a replica of itself. Epcot by way of Palladio.    And the city is hostage to the tourism industry. Cruise ships blight the scenery, ravage the canals and disgorge their day trippers. Yet the governing class passively accepts it, “all in the name of a single reward: money.” What Venice desperately needs — which Mr. Settis doesn’t say until the penultimate page of his book — is a rehabilitation of its own industries, like fishing, and better infrastructure for a new creative class...He devotes three chapters to lamenting the various simulacra of Venice around the world, including the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, which he fears are “corrupting the real Venice’s image of itself” by further reducing the city to caricature. The ultimate insult: a possible amusement park, Veniceland, on one of the islands in the Venetian Lagoon now dedicated to storing garbage. But will it happen? And if it did, would the resulting tragedy really be what he describes? “A fake Venice next to the real one, whereby the truth of the simulacrum shatters and engulfs the truth of history”?\"Interesting and depressing and enlightening all at the same time and I guess money and politics still raise their ugly heads."},

Then we drove to the summit for more hiking.Up ahead after parking is a selection of trails.  As we got out of the car and headed to an overlook near one of the trails, dogs began barking furiously off in the trees at the side of the slope.  We later learned from the man at the hunter's two trucks that the hunters were training their dogs although the hunting season was over.  The noise we heard was because the dogs had tracked a bear.  Nothing more stimulating than thinking you might encounter a running and fearful bear on your trail!We headed out over one of the trails we had not taken a prior time.  The trails are rocky as you can see from the geology above.  It is hard to enjoy views and vistas because you always have to keep secure footing and avoid the pockets of water.  We were crossing a cranberry bog that had intermittent islands of blueberry shrubs.And, yes, there were cranberries.  Very bitter, but beautiful.Hubby was able to keep his shoes dry as he had a different style.  My feet got wet several times, but the day was warm and it did not bother me to have slightly damp feet.  The air is as pure as it gets and the views are phenominal.  It is a harsh and unforgiving land with trees that struggle against winter winds.  Maybe next I will post about our lunch and the woods and our afternoon."},
{"title": "Pass It On", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2016", "text": "This season is one of dynamic contrast.  Bright colors reflected in sunlight and charcoal death reflected in rain.  If your hair (if you have hair) is gray and you have reached that time in your life when you can ponder the changes rather than rushing past them onto something more demanding and commanding, then you know the contrasts are most important to you.  The shorter days tell stories of death and dying and endings and in the distance another brighter future.  The maples go out with flying colors and claim flamboyance as their curtain call.  The obedient plant, like other small perennials, turns flakey gray and dark and then shatters into ashes around a black spot, not even a hint of its summer beauty.Even though the rhythm and repetition bring comfort to us, the movement and shifting bring inevitable endings that are bittersweet.  You can ponder the celebrating of lives on social media with friends who meet challenges happily and post the success of the goals they reached.  Joyful families, children growing like weeds, successful careers, and exotic celebrations.  Why would I want to read their worries and their failures anyway?  And yet one of the posts I remember so very well was about a young man revealing that his balding head had been a heavy burden which he was no longer going to carry around.  He was closing that door and moving on by accepting his appearance and only wearing a hat when it was cold.  He was in his thirties when many men begin to have that receding hairline.  I do not remember his birthday and wedding/anniversary celebrations including the photos of his beautiful daughter that they celebrate almost weekly nearly as much as his honest acceptance of this evolution.  Accepting the superficial concern and moving on.  Accepting the inevitable and moving on.The circle remains unbroken.  Or does it?  I am just in another place in my life.  Those who have passed before me did not share this life of mine for many of these decades and therefore I can study faded photographs with nostalgia and not pain because their world was so different and so long ago.  We were together in another life.  They added richness to my memories and helped me get perspective even with their mistakes.  Dwelling on regrets will not change that history.  I hope the faded photographs of me are viewed the same in the future ahead as part of a complicated tapestry.  Not with regret at my moving on, but as acceptance that my life contributed something to theirs and it is now time to pass it on.  And now I will pass on a lovely trail we took.Autumn is the more bittersweet of the seasons."},

But it seemed to be a mini-UN with some in exotic dress.During the ceremony I sat next to an ex-Marine and his wife who worked for the Federal Government in the Environmental Satellite Data program.  During the reception I sat next to a gentleman, newly retired, who wrote policy for the Federal Government on computer security, and no, I did not ask him about the Hillary Clinton issue, but did sympathize with his former challenge.  He was glad to be retired.  He said it was hard to appease the 300 people to whom he reported. I said he was in charge of writing poetry and he agreed.  I think he would have rather written computer code.The wedding party were all pretty successful in their professional careers.Among the members of the wedding party above are a doctor, an environmental lawyer, a computer programmer for a start-up company and a neurosurgeon.  These are just the ones that I either knew or talked to!The reception was held in an old dairy barn with the bar on the first floor and the eating in the hay loft! Charmingly low key.While the food had lost much of its appeal by the time it was carried up the stairs to the drafty venue, the conversation and wine were terrific.  The tributes were touching and I actually was crying by the time the bride gave a little speech.  The nieces and nephews of the bride read their tributes on their cell phone, which I guess is the new way to do this!  My old eyes would find this small screen electronic notepad somewhat stressful.Finally, my tie-in to the title.  One of the female guests arrived with a crutch having broken her foot a day and half before at Stanford University checking her daughter into school.  Since weddings involve lots of standing, she was brave.  The husband of one of the sisters of the bride and seated at our dinner table had arrived with a cane.  He had fallen that very morning and sprained his ankle severely.  Since his brother-in-law, a Puerto Rican, was also an emergency room doctor and the sister-in-law a pediatrician, he was surrounded by good advice, which he said consisted of \"Take a few ibuprofen, get a stiff drink and we will review this again in the morning.\"   I guess they had both seen so much worse that this was a no-brainer.  He did not seem to be in any pain.This was a wonderful break from my daily boring life."},

The explanation: \"Nearly 2,000 years ago, the Mexican volcano Xitle, or “spirit,” erupted and destroyed the ancient city of Cuicuilo. To create the seemingly impulsive sculpture, Durham quarried a 9-ton boulder of red basalt from the archaeological site and used a crane to drop it onto the roof of a 1992 Chrysler Spirit. As a finishing touch, he graffitied the stone with a smug, cartoon-like face. Despite its comedy, the work carries a complex gravity, capturing the moment at which the spirits of ancient and modern collide. \"  Now at least I have a little better understanding of the artwork.While I am always interested in the various sculptures, Auguste Rodin (1840-1917) is always a compelling draw for me.    Rodin has a very broad style and as he aged he became more rebellious with form and space and abstraction using marble and bronze and even later in life had his sculpture of Honore de Balzac rejected by those who commissioned him after a long time of missing deadlines.  I like his more traditional work, but realize he was truly a genius.   He grew up poor and studied under a \"Romantic\" teacher and I can see that influence in his early works as he was finding his style.   His sculpture, The Kiss, which I saw in France was truly magical and very erotic.One of the most interesting places in my city to see some of his work is the Hirshhorn sculpture garden across the street from the museum itself.  It is buried a story down into the ground and therefore a lovely quiet place in the heart of the Washington DC Mall.  I have rarely found it busy, but it was particularly quiet on the early evening of our visit.The Burghers of Calais is prominent in the garden and I have to pause each time I see it.  I can write about the story behind the sculpture but I will take text from the Rodin museum in Philadelphia which is much more succinct.  \"In 1346 the English king Edward III laid siege to the French port of Calais. Eleven months later, Edward demanded the surrender of six of the town’s leading men, or burghers, in return for sparing its citizens. Rodin’s sculpture commemorates this episode and emphasizes the internal struggle of each man as he walks toward his fate wearing a sackcloth and rope halter. The burghers were later spared thanks to the intervention of the English queen, who feared that their deaths would bring bad luck to her unborn child.\"  There are SEVEN copies of this sculpture around the world.Glyptoteket in Copenhagen, cast 1903.the Royal Museum in Mariemont, Belgium, cast 1905.Victoria Tower Gardens in the shadow of the Houses of Parliament in London; cast 1908, installed on this site in 1914 and unveiled 19 July 1915. The inscription on the pedestal was carved by Eric Gill.[9]the Rodin Museum in Philadelphia, cast 1925 and installed in 1929.the gardens of the Musée Rodin in Paris, cast 1926 and given to the museum in 1955.Kunstmuseum in Basel, cast 1943 and installed in 1948.the Smithsonian Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., cast 1943 and installed in 1966.the National Museum of Western Art in Tokyo, cast 1953 and installed in 1959.[10]the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California, cast 1968.the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, cast 1985 and installed in 1989.[11]PLATEAU (formerly the Rodin Gallery[12]) in Seoul.[13] This is the 12th and final cast in the edition, cast 1995.Therefore, maybe you will have an opportunity to see it in reality.It is set out in enough space that you can stroll around it.  I see tremendous fluidity and can almost hear them breathing.  The anguish is portrayed with a purity one does not often see in bronze.  Each stands alone in his sorrow, not connecting with another.  They are larger than life and you have to look up to see the faces.\"The Burghers of Calais , was in no small measure prompted by a deliberate policy of raising morale after the disasters of the Franco-Prussian War and the ensuing Commune by creating public monuments to patriotic Frenchmen. \"  It took ten years to complete."},

The young man above is lost in thought and I probably know what he is thinking.  When he married his love she was not sure she wanted to have children at all and now she is pregnant!  Both of them are over the moon, of course.  He spent time in our canoeing together asking me advice about raising children.  What had I learned?  How had I adjusted?  Etc.  It was sweet and I tried to encourage him to go with his gut on most issues and give 160% effort.This is a lovely quiet beach, and while others were there, it is not hard to get away from the crowds and look for fossils or bald eagles or just sit and enjoy the scenery.  They escaped from city life and hubby and I were welcoming fall.She is starting that very special time in her life where she will no longer get any sleep and there will no longer be extra money, but life will be so very rich in other things.  I am envious."},

{"title": "Learning the Hard Way", "date": "Sunday, September 18, 2016", "text": "I have this little garden bed on the other side of the turn-around in my driveway that is used for those annual flowers from seed packets that I come across.  Those seeds that are free from the seed-exchange, or that come in the mail, or that I have collected from the prior year and lie scattered in an old shoe box.  Most of the seeds do not succeed since it is too far from the nearest hose to water with any regularity and it competes for sun and sustenance with two tulip trees that grow right beside the bed.  I have put an ugly little metal fence around it since there are also a few plants that rodents love to eat in the spring and they can be protected here.  Since the flower bed is only 6 feet by 4 feet, it frequently gets crowded with  the hardy and fast spreading cosmos and in years past celosia. It is a bit of an experimental ever changing flower bed.  This past year I planted larkspur.  I was not anticipating much success because this plant does not like a hot climate.It took off like a house afire.  The plants did not need staking as they were able to lean against the curved fence as they reached away from the trees and toward the sun.  I had never tried growing larkspur before, but the seed packet was a gift.  They were lovely.  The light colored double petals of a few plants was perfect for photos. And it bloomed for a couple of weeks at least.  Visitors commented on its loveliness.When we finally had a break in the heat at the beginning of September I headed outside to clean up the summer gardens.  The larkspur, while hidden to some extent by the prolific cosmos, had turned into dark brown stalks of dead plant matter.  I reached over the fence and pulled it all out and carried the 4 foot long plants to the burn pile.  Back in July I had already collected a batch of seeds.Then  a few days later, I learned a lesson.  I had read years ago that larkspur if eaten by cattle, or another other animal for that matter, will kill.  Farmers do not move cattle into their fields until the wild larkspur has died back.  I had read that somewhere, but I did not know how toxic this plant was/is!At first it looked like an infected bug bite.You can see in the photo above how a second area appeared just from me folding my arms while I slept.You can also see from above the outline of a bandage I had placed over the bug bite the second or third day when it looked infected.This rash on the inner sides of both of my arms was burning and itchy and spread like crazy.  It started as one bug bite that looked like it had become infected in my upper inner arm and this grew in blisters to the size of a quarter.  Then it crawled down my arm and at night spread to my other arm while I slept.  I thought I had an infection and because of the intensity of its spread, my mind went to those nasty staph infections that are so hard to control (MSRA!)!  Even my doctor wondered what it was and when I convinced her I had not been near any poison ivy she started me on antibiotics and steroid cream.  I washed sheets and pillowcases and towels and hubby kept up a sterile regime away from me.  The rash did not move to the top of my arms where the skin is less tender.As you have probably guessed by now, the cause was gathering all those long dead larkspur plants in my sleeveless shirt.  It has been about ten days and I am now getting back to normal, although the rash, which is turning darker in color, is still there without all of its prior nasty side effects.  Perhaps TMI, but lesson learned!"},

At the end of the meal we passed a bicycle shop and I went in to get my grandson a bike bell since his was broken and he reminded me I would get him an new one when we said goodbye.  We also stopped at the pastry shop which was recommended by the young couple with the 3-year-old eating at the next table.  (We always find ways to have conversations with others at restaurants.) We bought some cupcakes as they were too lovely to pass up and as our reward for two straight weeks with kids.

This morning there was no longer a scattering of children's shoes at the front door, there were no tiny sounds of video games coming from the sofa, there was no need to pour small glasses of juice and, of course, it was sad.  Even the earth outside reflected the quiet changes that endings bring with a very light rainfall and ten degree cooler weather.  The small gusts of wind were whipping leaves from the tops of trees before allowing them to fully change color.  I could feel that somewhere fall was moving in even though we should have 90 degree weather again by the end of the week!Above he is enjoying his last sunset at the water."},

He was in his late 60's/early 70's and very handsome and healthy looking.  He was selling a book on that iditarod experience, so that was why he was so focused in sharing.I met another older man at the same place who claimed he only shot film photos.  He said he would never change to digital, but he was quite old and that made sense to me.I met a tanned blond with perfect breasts that were nestled in a tube top who recommended a high-end very modern Mexican restaurant in downtown Anchorage as a place for dinner.  She was correct except the contemporary metal chairs and tables were a little off-putting."},

(You have to click on the photo, perhaps.)We got a \"great\" (see below) view from our expensive hotel...not expensive enough I guess for a real city view.But we were only walking distance (in the rain) from our hotel to many restaurants...most with higher price tags.  There also were several reasonably priced places.  Thai food (hubby's favorite) is EVERYWHERE.Anchorage, smaller in population, sophistication and expenses is a very simple square city to drive around.  Although there are just enough streets that dead end or are one way that make you be sure you have a map.Just in case you forget that at least 8 months of the year it is hard to do anything outside in Alaska the sign above reminds you. Clearly Anchorage survives on tourism with at least two if not three cruise ships coming in each week and an endless supply of planes.Gwennie's is a popular place for breakfast and has been just outside of town for decades.  Certainly a colorful place that lets you know you are in Alaska.  HUGE breakfasts, so be prepared.And everyone has a story and something to sell.  The man on the far left is a film photographer and I paid $20 for a handful of nice photos as he was such a delightful \"codger\" it was money well spent.  We bought the other gentleman's book about dog sledding.  He was involved and raced in the very first Iditarod.  I have not had time to read his book!And just outside the city and down by the river we discovered that the salmon were running!"},

(Yeah, I know.)Vancouver was different than I expected...I could get my mind around it.They have a pseudo Disney type ride/movie of the Canadian land, which I actually enjoyed. I do not like medium or large cruise ships, but was able to enjoy this Holland one and kept thinking I could write a Hurcule Poirot story as I catalogued some of the passengers on our voyage.Crew were mostly Indonesian and so hubby and I (mostly hubby) got to practice what we remembered of the language. I saw my first calving of a glacier which was worth the money for the whole trip.I could not see the puffins, even with binoculars!Alaska has only 600,000 plus people.  Everyone knows everyone.Most of the people who waited on us or worked retail were not \"Alaskans\".  We met Californians, Texans, Russians, Moldovans, Chinese, Taiwanese, and Serbians.Viewing a cow moose from a safe boardwalk, I realized how easy it was for them to disappear into the high grasses as the moose dissolved just beneath my vision.We could not take the hike my husband really wanted to try as the trail was closed due to a grizzly attack.  When it finally opened we drove up to the Park and were told it was closed once again due to a second attack--same bear that they thought had been driven away!Everyone who lives there says they love the winters and the dark days...really.  Methinks they are maybe overly enthusiastic?"},

Except for the abundance of slugs, we are getting a great harvest.  They are small but have a good strawberry taste. The larger variety that hubby planted are not so flavorful and tend to rot!While so few of the birds are nesting in the houses we so carefully cleaned, I have spotted a blue indigo bunting and the scarlet tanager.  While not so common here, they are not rare, but just have that ability to reflect sunlight and look like dark little birds unless you are carrying the binoculars and a bit familiar with the songs.  And then the cry of the red-shouldered hawk fledglings were heard the other day in the nearby woods.  It sounds like they are trying out for some show.  They were soon gone.We had heard the \"meep\" of a small fawn near the fence line this past week and hubby explored and found a little one lying in the shade of a fallen tree and watching us carefully.  We left it, expecting mother was away, and later in the week when we kept startling vultures while gardening, we discovered it was dead.  You may remember last year we tried to \"rescue\" a fawn and found it was just normally waiting for mother...and you can go here to re-read that in case you missed it.  Thankfully the bugs, predators and rain have moved it away as the smell of death competed harshly with the fragrant honeysuckle now in bloom.And finally, just to keep us on our toes, the towel racks in the guest bathroom and on hubby's bathroom wall came loose and while I tried unsuccessfully to re-install, it took the purchase of a ball hex tool in metric size 2 so I could angle the turns and a kneeling position to get them both installed again!  Then we were rewarded with one of the in-hull fittings coming loose as hubby was planning to put the boat in the water.  Luckily he saw the daylight through the back of the hull while switching over the batteries and we were told that this is common in a boat as old as ours!  I got on my knees once again and stretched my arm to put the temporary plug through the hole so that hubby could tighten the temporary fitting from the outside while sitting in the canoe.  You do not own stuff, it owns you.I will save the garage foundation fix and the cement truck for another day!  In between times you can enjoy my self-seeding larkspur which has gone crazy this year."},

I wisely saw the housing collapse ahead of time if not being able to pin point its exact fall or extent.  I don't get much right in this world and this was a lucky call.  We sold our big house to move down here in a bit of a rush (I was not yet retired) because I was worried about the real estate bubble and being unable to sell my house.  I rented in the city for over two years and put my furniture in storage before I left my job.If you read my prior post you note that there are some very wealthy people living here.  In most cases they are people that grew up here, earned their wealth here, and decided to stay.  There are also other people, like my husband and I, that while not rich, would be considered upper middle class by most standards, although our house is the smallest in the neighborhood --- so we just squeeze in there.  There are also a number empty lots in my neighborhood sitting idle because they claim a price to high to justify the type of house that would need to be built.  There is one large house on the water, the one with the tennis court, that sits idle as the owner rarely stayed here and has now passed on and his children may be deciding what to do with it.Now, back to our builder.  When we bought our lot where we built I would drive by that builder's lot at the front end of the turn to our neighborhood a number of times.  They had cleared the land and I was wondering what was going to be built on that place.  Then a hurricane came through shortly after the clearing of that lot that brought down about 15 big pine trees on one side.  Building came to a halt while those trees were cleared away.Finally, slowly, the house began to be built.  It was a big colonial which is popular in my state.  It was nicely landscaped and the builder seemed to have a good design.   It is all brick which is another step up in architecture where many homes have brick facing only.It sat for some months after it was put up for sale and eventually the builder moved in.  He parked his big trucks, his boat, etc. in the driveway and the for sale sign still sat on the road.  The next year I was walking by and met a young woman with a toddler in front of the drive.  She explained she was the builder's sister and he had allowed her family to move in to help with expenses.  She was clearly delighted to be in this nice house.  More months went by.  I do not remember seeing any real estate agents showing the house, but I live a half mile down the road.  The asking price was in the high $400,000s.  This is not an outrageous price for this area, but the market had collapsed and there were no buyers anywhere. And then one day as I took my walk I saw the house was empty.  No cars, a few strewn toys, and padlocks on the doors.  Another year went by and the house was showing its neglect.  The neighbors and I tried to track the paperwork to see who owned it, but the mortgage had been sold and re-sold and now belonged to some conglomerate on the other side of the country!As time passed, the house began to be robbed of its various parts and later used by others for overnights.  It does not take long before appliances, copper pipe, etc is gone! \"They -- who now own the paper\" put a log across the driveway which seemed to reduce the vagrancy.This week I saw the log had been sawed into chunks and the driveway was open once again.  Maybe an investor has purchased it and has the capital to re-dress this grandam to her former glory.  I hope so, because I worry about fire in my woods and do not like to see such sadness.The story of lives in distress, having no place to hang a hat, and craftsmanship destroyed is very depressing.  I could mourn the issue of my property values being compromised, but that hardly seems fair as this is a microcosm of happenings elsewhere, some far worse.  Seems we have forgotten this issue in our current election where bathrooms used have taken center stage."},

I was in the deepest sleep very shortly.  I kept fighting to try and waken and could not.  I was dreaming that I was in a house somewhere and a lovely young boy maybe 6 or so was outside playing.  He was my son or grandson, I could not get my mind around it, except that this angelic child with a lovely laugh was having so much fun on a sunny spring day and I could hear him through the open window.  I knew in my heart of hearts that I was missing out on this precious time, but try as I might I could not open my eyes or lift my head from the pillow.  I could not wake up!  Later when I finally pulled myself out of the stupor I realized that I had slept for over an hour!I am not sure what the dream meant, but I do know I must have needed that sleep.Now as a thank you for your interest, I will provide a photo-painting that I worked on using filters, highlights and shadows, hue adjustment and even painting some colors with the mouse during this gray day."},

{"title": "Magic Bullets", "date": "Wednesday, April 20, 2016", "text": "It is spring and in spite of the beautiful rewards of re-growth outside I have been forcing myself to move on task each day.  Being alone gives me lots of time for thinking...too much thinking.  All kinds of issues, ideas, regrets, plots, plans, and philosophical ideas tumble in my brain.  I have never had a quiet mind and that is one of the reasons, I think, that I like to read and watch television.  It is escape and helps me push the pause button.  Otherwise I resolve and re-resolve problems and relationships from the past endlessly.As Jane Fonda says, this is the third (and final) act and we hope so much to get it right.  We hope to adjust with lessons from history, to be more accepting of changes and to pick our battles much more wisely.  We hope to be more motivated and better at seeing opportunities to contribute wisely.  We are surprised when age has brought with it only some wisdom.I have been in a bit of a slump.  Nothing big.  Nothing to write home about.  AND nothing I can really put my finger on, which is the conundrum.  But it seems lately I have been thinking more pessimistically than optimistically.  Even avoiding the news has not given me a boost.And then two things happened this week which turned the corner at long last.One was a nice long call from my daughter whom I do not see often enough.  She has a SUPER BUSY life filled with work and weekend activities and we had not talked in a long time--over a month.  I hesitate to call as it never seems the right time at her end.  She had been meaning to call for weeks, but was so busy she never could pick up the phone.  Then we had an hour to just chat and laugh and tease and love.  Better than any pill or sunset.Second, a former work friend of mine, whom I see once a year if time permits, texted me that she needed a babysitter for her grandson for a little over an hour while she went to the chiropractor.  This little guy is 9 months old and could be into everything.  I love kids, felt deep down somewhere I needed a baby fix, and thus said yes.  He was a mellow fellow and calmly crawled around the house until he found the toys and spent the rest of the time tasting them.Two magic bullets.  What are your magic bullets?"},

I will relate another type of encounter with a spider that happened last week and that was much more compelling.  It is spring and spiders are exploring.  The other day a spider swung from his trapeze wire unexpectedly right into my face and drifted behind my eye glasses as he tried to gain control of his movements.  It took several seconds for me to figure out why I had gone blind in one eye and then when I swiped with my hand I saw all those legs working across my wrist and under my left sleeve.  The greater problem  at this time was I was actually driving along just leaving our town on 4-lane divided road at about 40 MPH.  There was not much traffic as it was the mid-afternoon before workers were rushing home.  But, by the time I refocused on the road (only seconds has passed) I discovered to my shock that I had swerved into the left lane and then onto the grassy median with a ditch dividing this highway.  There were a handful of cars on both sides as I bounced along the ditch briefly before getting control of the car and coming to a safe and soft stop just avoiding hitting the fence pipe directly in front of me.  I took a deep breath, forgot completely about the spider,  felt embarrassment wash over me as the panic waned and gathering my wits put the car in rear gear and pulled back a few yards avoiding looking at drivers in the one or two passing cars.  I pulled ahead gently on the median, and seeing a large truck far in the distance, I turned the steering wheel as I pulled onto the opposite side of the road, made a careful U-Turn, and then took a left in the lane ahead  and made another U-Turn and headed home once again.  On a dime, folks, on a dime.I have lost the fog light and created some limited damage to the driver's side fender as well as permanent grass stains.  I am calling the body shop today and will be punished for my distraction with an expensive estimate I am sure.Yet, I cannot help but wonder about other outcomes.  Hubby is far away and the rest of my family and I touch base every few days or so.  If I had been in a serious accident, when would they find out?  What if I died before they reached me?  I guess they would eventually adjust, but life is shorter and sweeter than we think, is it not and not being able to say goodbye maybe one of the greatest worries."},

(Hubby is gone and the driveway gate is closed!) I was cautious.  Out front were the two helpers that hubby hired to do the lawn while he was away.  I was told they were coming on the NEXT Sunday.  Oh well, at least I was out of my PJs.After telling them what I wanted done, I rushed out to get lawn seed, buy them some quick lunch and go to the bank so I would have money to pay them.  I only had $20 in my pocket. Then in the early afternoon I began my Powerpoint presentation for the Commissioners.  By mid-afternoon I had to run out again and take some photos from the volunteer garden for the Powerpoint.  (I am a bit nervous about this VERY SHORT speech...our coordinator was clearly relieved when I said it was only 5 slides...and hope that Tuesday comes sooner rather than later.  I cannot remember the last time I gave a public talk.)I finished the presentation later in the day and sent the workers off after some further instruction and then took a well deserved bubble bath and ate a cooked frozen turkey pot pie while watching mindless television until bedtime.This Monday morning a list of phone calls were made.  A list of emails completed.  I now have to call the Adult Basic Ed folks as they seem to have another student for me, and this time it is NOT help with math but reading that is needed which I feel more prepared for.

At least we are not over 100 pounds.\"  (They later learn they have $70.00 overage in weight.)  There are valid reasons for this weight problem and it could not be helped, unfortunately.Someone from the basement...\"I don't want you to do this now.  DON'T do it!\"  Followed by grunting and shuffling sounds and someone dragging something upstairs....They finally left early this morning and I am exhausted as the scenario above is just a small portion of what has been going on the last three days.  Last week hubby learned a number of items (heavy tools) had been stolen from the locked container overseas and he had to rush out and buy them.  To my own credit I had warned him years ago when this plan was in its infancy stages that theft was going to be an issue on this South Pacific isle if he insisted on trying to do this project.Our guest, who will be keeping him company, has traveled much and accomplished much and wishes to share much of his over 8 decades of life as he follows me from room to room during the three days he stayed with us making the bathroom the last resort for my peace of mind.  At least he was a good eater and ate everything I put in front of him!Well they are off.  I now will try hard not to worry about hubby diving in the open ocean trying to set up hardware!  I will peruse the lengthy list of stuff he wants done while he is gone.  (Note to husbands:  Go on a long trip and list all the things that you do for your wife and home which she has to now do, and she will certainly appreciate you when you are home!)Today is rainy and other than a quick spreading of lawn seed from the tiny bag left in the garage and going to purchase another large bag of lawn seed this morning, I will most likely take the rest of the day off and just be a slug.  The beauty of not moving, not thinking, not doing chores, not straightening up (the luxury of living like The Donald.)A last minute hint that the 80-something might also be diving did concern me.  I will not tell his wife as she currently is nursing her son from a heart attack and installation of a pacemaker as well as healing from a fall herself and needs no more stress in her life.  She also will be getting a houseguest on Monday, hoping so much this mean help for her and not more work.When it rains, it pours....The happy boys."},

Below is one of the early photos that I came across in my husband's family collection box and I thought it was charming.  The photo was scanned in the sealed frame and I did not want to disturb it, so the clarity is a bit rough.  It was taken in the 1920's when his mother (the girl in the photo) was about 14 by her father, my husband's grandfather, who was a professional photographer in the city. On the back of the photo is written \"Miss Folly---age 14-16?  Masonic Lodge\" As I progress on my research I will share what I learn in terms of preservation if you like.  It can get very technical and down in the weeds so I have to skim the surface in terms of information or both you and I will throw in the towel.  It also can be expensive, but maybe better than doing it yourself.  I once worked for USDA on a preservation project for printed materials, which was cutting edge at the time and a lot of work and more detail than I expected. My first stop during this project--preservation and digitization-- has been the Library of Congress web site which researches this field professionally for all the libraries in the country and therefore, takes it pretty seriously and pretty comprehensively.  Wish me luck!"},

Marissa's mother, Alice, was in denial and had been able to live alone for this past year while they considered what actions had to be made until several scary incidents caused Marissa and her brother Chet to pursue hiring in-house care.A contract needed to be signed before care could be hired.Marissa brought the paperwork last night and carefully explained to her mother what it meant.  She asked her to sign it.  Alice was suspicious and didn't want a stranger living in her home.  She didn't understand why this was even necessary.  As they closed in on the first hour of discussion Marissa lost her carefully controlled patience and they began to argue.  Marissa threatened that Alice would have to go to a \"home' if she did not sign the papers, which was true.  After another hour and exhaustion on both sides, they were at an impasse and Marissa left the papers on the kitchen table and headed home.Her morning broke a restless night of no sleep and she called her mother early as she did every morning since her mother had been diagnosed.  Alice was not an easy person to care for, she had had mild schizophrenia for years and her children were always on egg shells around her.  Ever since Alice's divorce from her father decades ago, the burden of care had fallen on her.  Some days were normal, but some were filled with upsetting emotions.  This new dementia diagnosis was more fuel to a simmering fire.Marissa decided to call Chet, her younger brother, an engineer who with his wife and little boy lived a few miles away.  She had held off because Chet had problems of his own.  He had been diagnosed years ago in his twenties with inflammatory bowel disease and had spent years on treatments that worked for a while and then failed.  These past months he had worked from home because the symptoms had become so debilitating.They decided to drive over to the house together.  Although they both had keys the door was unlocked and they walked into the familiar apartment.  Everything was in place, the bed had not been slept in, Alice's purse and keys and credit cards were on the table, and Alice was not there.  They knocked on nearby doors and no one had seen her.  They walked in different directions in a mile or so around the neighborhood calling her.  Hours passed and nothing was found to give them a clue to her whereabouts.  They did not want to, but decided to call the police.  Because of Alice's medical condition, the police immediately dispatched two units and began their own canvasing as well as looking through address books.  Marissa made calls.  The afternoon was coming to an end and Marissa and Chet called friends who came out in winter jackets with flashlights began a grid search assisting the police.  By sunset the police had both search dogs and cadaver dogs that worked for the next 24 hours across the suburbs and outside woods.  Temperatures dropped below zero in the dark and held on through the morning.There were no security cameras to give a clue.  Someone who lived in the apartments said they had seen her pacing back and forth in the parking lot at about 10:00 PM.  Maybe waiting for a friend?  But they had called everyone they knew and nothing turned up.Facebook and other social media were used as tools to find Alice with recent photos of her.  Another long and anxious day passed and still no clues were found.Marissa was blaming herself for having the argument and for pushing her mother and for leaving her.  She was wracked with guilt.  Chet had discovered some paperwork that Alice had drawn up with a lawyer more than a year ago that had given him Power of Attorney...something he had not known...and now he was wracked with guilt.  He could have signed the contract. They had failed her.It has now been over a week and no sign of Alice.  Since she does not have money, credit cards, a phone or car, it is a real mystery.This is a true story of friends of one my children with names and details changed.  It is very different from TV when the tragedy is being lived by people you know."},
{"title": "It is a Dangerous World Out There", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2016", "text": "This past fall while traveling in Florida and visiting some long time friends, I met a man.  He was a childhood friend of my friend and they had not seen him in decades although they lived in the same state.  The man was in his late 70's I am guessing.   He was tall and handsome.  He used to be an engineer.  I surmised that he was a very successful engineer because he recently lived in a beautiful house in a very nice part of Florida, one of those impressive gated communities.  He lived there alone and I think his wife had passed years ago.  He had been a community leader explaining he had thrown many a party for political candidates.  (Stop me if I have told this story.  I swear I have the memory of a gnat.) We were talking about weather, food, filling time because his car would not start.  He had come for a visit to my friend's house and could not leave.  He was restless and impatient.  That type that I know so well that runs companies or manages projects.  The type that wear out the carpet and check their  watch every few minutes.  It was getting dark and both he and the neighbor lady he brought did not like to drive in the dark.  This is common among the elderly and a joke among the middle-aged in Florida.The conversation got around to his new smaller neighborhood and why he had sold the big house.  I assumed he was going  to say that it was too large for him, too hard to maintain, too expansive to use or that his friends had all moved away.  Instead he said he had moved because he used to wake up in the middle  of the night listening for noises and thinking someone would break in and kill him...not rob him, kill him.  Now maybe I could read something into this, like who had he wronged over  the years or what did he know that we did not about his past, but I really think there was nothing nefarious here.  There was no crime spree any greater than any other place in the state or even the states for that matter in his area.I think he was that man that never was comfortable in a community unless he was the leader running things.  I do not think he was the man that trusted his fellow man.  He was not the man that figured most people are honest, most people are fair, most people do not have hidden agendas.  He was the man  who would vote to go to war first and ask questions later because the world is a dangerous and ugly place.Last week I read a news story about an incident on the mass transit train  in England.  A man, large and military looking, got on the car  and began  having an emotional attack of some kind.  He was talking to himself, thrashing about and terrifying the other passengers.  A woman in her 50's or 60's was sitting at the end of the car where he was standing and she reached out and took his hand when he took a pause in his emotional outburst.  He collapsed to the floor in tears and sat there the rest of the ride  holding her hand.  At the end when it was time for him to get off he said softly to her, \"Thanks moma (mum?).\" and exited the train. When this woman was later interviewed they asked her if she had been  afraid.  She said, \"Of course.\"  but she explained that her instinct told her to try to help.  She did not know how he would react, but  she  knew he needed something.  Yes, I know that this could  have turned out so much worse for  her, but I truly feel the odds were on her side.  The world is not that dangerous and ugly if we use caution and  love."},
{"title": "It is Not Adding Up", "date": "Tuesday, February 09, 2016", "text": "When I began to volunteer with the county Adult Basic Education program it was a very slow start.  I took a three hour training/meeting that involved more in the way of forms and cautions about privacy, legal issues, etc. than it did about learning theories or learning styles. While initially they had told me they really needed someone living at my very rural end of the county, months passed before I was contacted with a student.  During that time I was certainly romanticizing this project and envisioned hours of success and happiness and goal completion! As I wrote in a prior post, it was to teach math...not reading, which was a bummer for me.  I only volunteered for math because I felt guilty not trying to help students.  It was high school math, not Algebra or Geometry, etc. thank goodness.  I was told not to contact the student until I got my \"packet.\"  Someone spent a good part of a day pulling together all kinds of exercises from various curriculum books, included the answers, and put them all in an inch thick notebook which I picked up at the local high school.I looked over the exercises.  I slowly became terrified over my research hours because I honestly do not remember the details of combining fractions and the rules for decimals, I mostly just used a calculator in my daily life these days.  Word problems are another challenge and can be easy or difficult.  Anyway, I studied and prepared and then called my \"student,\" a 50 something black woman who had dropped out of high school at 17 due to pregnancy.  This is such a tragic and common story.  You can go here to read about our very first meeting.We have now had over 12 sessions together.  Our meetings have been erratic to put it generously.  She cancels about 20% of the time due to a granddaughter in the hospital, her flu, a grandson she has to get ready for coast guard deployment, her moving to a new location, a migraine, and this last cancellation was due to a fall on hard concrete while doing her job.  I myself had to cancel over the Thanksgiving holidays for travel and we did have a \"snow\" day.  She cannot afford voice mail and when I call I just have to wait for her to call me back to touch base.  She does not seem to have email either.  That is another challenge.The program lets her take her test early if she has enough formal class hours plus hours with me.  I sent in the paperwork and while I discouraged her from taking the test in January she went ahead and took it anyway.  She did pass her reading but did only slightly better on the math side and thus failed.  I have not seen the tests and while I have asked her and the county offices to let me know her areas of weakness, I do not seem to get much help. She still seems enthusiastic to meet this challenge, but also shows up and then cannot read the problems because she forgets her glasses.  I have been around the world a few times and know exactly what is going on here.  She does not want to quit and yet she does not want to continue.I have scheduled the library study room for 6 more weeks and will continue with her into late spring and about 12 more classes, but realize at that time if she is not ready, she may need to find a new volunteer teacher.  I think she is not allowed to take the test again until September, but I am not even sure about that scheduling.  I will give it my all through these next months, but feel a little disheartened that I am failing her and she is failing herself."},
{"title": "Update", "date": "Saturday, February 06, 2016", "text": "Regarding movie/video preservation it is the 16mm and 8mm home movies that turn  to acid.  They do not like dramatic temperature changes or  being stored in very warm places.  Once these films start their \"vinegar\" transformation they can  no longer be saved.  We had converted all of our reel-to-reel type movies years ago because some were almost 100 years old from my husbands family!But at the time we converted them we converted them to VHS as that was all that was available.  Now those  VHS are getting old and must be converted to digital.  The DVD's are not recommended as long term archival  medium any more, so we may have to put them on flash  drives,  or  hard drives and as back up  store them some safe place \"in the cloud.\"  This process is actually a scary and expensive nightmare. My wedding photo album is fading because I did not  have money for a professional photographer and it is snapshots taken by friends, so that is something I need to also  send away for professional restoration  soon!  It is sad that we are not going to live forever, even virtually, it seems."},
{"title": "What is that smell?", "date": "Tuesday, February 02, 2016", "text": "Is it a bouquet or a stench?I lived in an apartment for two years before my retirement.  It was a change I had to make because we sold our house and had no where to live.  We were retiring in a few years and had not decided WHERE we wanted to live, and felt the housing market was too squirrely to wait for another few years when we might find it more difficult to sell the big old house.The big positives in this new lifestyle were that it took an hour to clean the whole place.  I lived across the street from my workplace.  Everything I needed including shopping, hardware, restaurants, cultural activities and mass transportation were just blocks away.  It was a new lazy way to live without the yard work and the low utility expenses.The negatives were that I rarely got to know my neighbors.  We may meet at the mailbox but many tenants came for just a year and then left.  My view from the apartment was of a parking lot and the rooftops of business buildings.  I missed my gardening.  There was little room to entertain company unless you went to the lobby with human traffic and stale air, and the kitchen was not exactly set up for cooking.  Our first Thanksgiving I actually bought a large box Thanksgiving dinner from the local supermarket.The other adjustment was the closeness of living spaces with strangers.  Fortunately there was only one yelling match that took place in the stairwell off my kitchen door. But I also frequently smelled curry in the hallway.  Now I do love curry but not everyday and certainly not that stale smell that lingers in the morning as I ride the elevator down to work. There are those commercials that remind people the smells of their pet can be hidden to them but very off-putting to others.  You can always tell when a toddler lives in a house no matter how careful they are in changing the little one.  And there is the joke of stale cabbage odors and cigarette smoke in homes of the elderly.Well, once my new home had off-gassed its odors of wood, sheet rock and paint, we noticed something a little off in the master bedroom closet.  Now to clarify, this closet is HUGE as The Donald would say.  It is not only walk-in but there was room enough to put the grand children's portable crib when they came to visit.  We checked out the shoes, billed sports caps, and dark corners.  I checked hubby's suits which he no longer wore and we had some of them cleaned.  We could not identify the smell and eventually we no longer smelled it...because we got used to it.Once or twice when my son visited he commented that the closet smelled funny.  He did not make a big deal out of it, probably thinking old people shed skin and stuff, and therefore, their closets smell funny.We never could figure it out until yesterday.Hubby was going through all of his old photos albums, his parents albums and diaries etc. in a box on the top shelf.  He called to me and said he had figured out what was making the odor.  In his hands was an 8mm movie tape in a metal case.  I could smell the acid yards before he reached me, the vinegar syndrome where an acid is created by the decay of the ascetic base.  Fortunately we had converted this to VHS years before, but now I have been reminded that we have to digitize even that medium.  VHS gets brittle and fades, to say nothing of the fact that we have only one VHS reader in the house and it is part of a TV set.The movie tape acid was so strong that we had to wrap it in a plastic garbage and take it out to the garage garbage bin.  Even today I can detect the smell in the garbage!Now when son comes down to visit, I am going to take him to the closet for a sniff test."},

It is an environmental argument.  Does this work on our continent?  Who knows?  It might be worth looking into though.It is a TED talk which means it carries some validity and is worth paying attention.  I am just linking here to provide a better argument.(https://www.ted.com/talks/allan_savory_how_to_green_the_world_s_deserts_and_reverse_climate_change?language=en)Oh, the photo above is a macro of my couch fabric with some photo-painting!"},

My lower back will remind me tomorrow, but the rest of me will be happy for the exercise.I have monitored how everyone has coped on FB.  Most of the families with young children are sledding, shoveling and building various snowmen and snow-women.  The more dynamic types are cooking or complaining about cabin fever.  We are mostly mellow because this is the first really winter weather we have had.  With my Helleborus blooming last week I was fearful all my bulbs would be emerging.I sit at the computer and paint my photos. I read books.  I follow one of my courses that I bought a while back.  I binge watch a Netflix series.  I do sometimes feel I am wasting time but I am not lost.  There is always plenty to do.  When I post this I will start the pork ribs in the slow cooker for tonight's dinner.  Not healthy, but we deserve it.Soon a more normal routine will emerge."},
{"title": "Dodging a Bullet", "date": "Sunday, January 24, 2016", "text": "Spent most of Friday getting ready for the big one.  Meteorologists were in the middle of orgasmic math as they predicted the breaking of ten year and then five year records of snowfall and temperature drops on fancy graphs.  We parked the big car at the end of the driveway for an emergency exit if needed as we had no intention of trying to shovel that long driveway and we do not have a snowblower.As you can see above toward the road, there was just a little snow left from that first dusty bit that shut down the city earlier in the week.  We filled buckets with drinkable water in the event we lost electricity.  We got out the flashlights and candles and the weather radio.  I had gone shopping two days earlier and we were well-stocked with food.  This was a good thing, because there is a ritual in this country that people go bonkers 24 to 5 hours before a storm hits and buy everything in the grocery store that they can find.  The lines get long and the people begin to lose their sense of humor.  I did not want to argue over the last can of beans!By the afternoon big wet flakes were beginning to fall.  Mayors and Governors were giving speeches on television about how ready they were, how you must stay home, and how this could be life threatening.  This was followed by newscasters talking to people on snow-covered streets who did not stay home and who were trying to shop for last minute booze or whatever or dragging out their snow shoes or skis which never get used.  Hubby stocked up on wood...we had a week's worth next to the house.  We started a cozy fire and watched a movie.By nightfall it was beginning to get serious as the far side of the river disappeared.We went to bed just a little excited about what might await us on Saturday morning.Throughout the Saturday snow fell and gusts of wind rattled the window panes.  Birdies were thankful for our water heater and the full bird feeders and the suet cakes we had left out.  I went out around the neighborhood for photos because we were supposed to have a follow-up ice storm and I knew I could miss all the good stuff.  We had not gotten more than a foot of snow by mid-day which probably makes Canadians laugh.I made my way carefully down to the dock for photos while hubby brought firewood into the garage and blew snow off the AC/Heat fans beside the house.Then by mid-morning we lost electricity and thus started taking things more seriously.  We moved the love seat right in front of the roaring fireplace and got our books and e-readers out and put a pot of tomato soup on the gas cook top.  While we missed the contact and hullabaloo (yes, that is an actual word) from the outside world in a very quiet house we slowly re-settled into non-technology mold.  We did use our cell phone to report the outage to the electric company and to let loved ones on FB know we had no power.  Gusts of  strong winds pushed drifts next to doorways and against trees and pushed windows until the drifts were a few feet high.  Several small dead trees went down.  Yet, we had electricity back within hours, we were so lucky!By the time we headed to bed the snow storm had become a white out with blowing snow hiding everything around the house.  We had measured only 12 inches of snow around noon, but it will be interesting to see what this morning brings when daylight begins.  I am writing this at 3:00 A.M.  The precipitation has stopped and thus far there is no ice!"},
{"title": "Keeping Balance", "date": "Thursday, January 21, 2016", "text": "We went to our monthly master gardener meeting last night and were surprised to find almost an inch of snow as we left in the early evening.  It was still falling in soft large flakes as we headed home down the highway.It seemed we were not the only ones surprised as people were sliding and driving much slower in the dark.  We did a little fish-tailing on the turn into the intersection and this was in my husband's large and heavy Ford Explorer, so you can imagine how difficult it was for smaller cars to keep their traction.  The snow wetness, the temperature, and whatever else made for some acrobatics you do not want to see except on TV.  The city to the north of us came to a standstill for NINE HOURS.  Some people did not get home from work until 2:00 or 300 in the morning.  Officials had been focused on this weekend's bigger storm and failed to get roads salted for this little dusting.  It only takes an inch of snow to shut down an entire metropolis.  I am sure that officials heads will roll, but at least we are not drinking lead in our water, so I am willing to give the traffic department a pass.I am supposed to assist with a seed exchange meeting on Saturday, but am pretty sure that will be postponed to the snow date next month.  I am glad, because I have not had time to sort the few seeds I can share.I like having an excuse to not do anything but sit in the house and waste time for the next three days!  I am in truth a bum at heart.  Maybe I will at least make an effort to write...Except, I really feel like making chocolate chip cookies.  I have half a bag of walnuts left over and flour I need to use before it gets too old.  Then I will have to run 4 miles on the elliptical to justify eating two of the warm cookies!Stay safe and warm inside."},

{"title": "TMI With Photos", "date": "Friday, January 15, 2016", "text": "What follows is going to be about medical care and procedures.  If you are young and healthy and do not want to read this, I will understand.  I was like you once...I think, but putting your head in the sand is not always healthy.I lost about 48 hours this week from my routine, uneventful life.  It was an expected loss as I have done this before.  This loss was time preparing for and time getting a colonoscopy.  I am fortunate that my health  insurance covers most of  the costs of this---although mine did require a $200 co-pay which is a sizable cost.  I had this done first long ago at about the age of 55 and the second time around I was 64.  They recommend it every 5 to 10 years as we age.  My most recent dance with the machinery was this week.  If you have not had this done I can tell you it is a good preventative procedure to have if you are covered by insurance.  It is also NOT a lot of fun.First, you must be on a jello, bouillon, clear liquid diet for 24 hours.  That in itself requires sacrifice if you are a foodie like me.  No creamy liquids and only sugar in coffee.  Then the evening before the procedure you must drink a liquid preparation from the drugstore that is the most foul tasting drink (sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate and magnesium sulfate) even though they attempt to drown it in cherry flavoring and sugar .  It is a full 8 ounces mixed with 8 ounces of water followed by two more 16 ounce cups of plain water over the next hour.  Your gut is now filled with 48 ounces of liquid.  Within 45 minutes you will be visiting the bathroom every 10-15 minutes.  If you own a Fitbit, be sure to wear it on this day as you will easily reach your 10,000 steps.  This cleansing continues for about three hours before it wears off.  In my case I was really ready for sleep at 9:00 P.M.  While I did sleep uneventfully, I had to set the alarm for 4:00 AM and start the process all over again so that I was really clean for my 8:30 procedure.  In the photo above you can see how clean.  The nurse told me she had lost 8 pounds when she had the procedure done, but I only lost 2.5!!The doctor puts a probe with a camera up your rear end and looks at your lower and upper intestine for anomalies, polyps, hemorrhoids, etc. and they want you squeaky clean.  They put you under an anesthetic before they pump your bowels with carbon  dioxide air and you sleep through the 25 minute process.  The CO2 is best because when it is over you have very little gas pains or problems.  It just absorbs!In my case I had a team of really energetic, friendly and efficient nurses and doctors.  They even had warmed the nightgown and blanket in a heater before they made me strip naked and put it on.  I was required to answer the same questions for two different nurses and the anesthesiologist prior to meeting the doctor, which means they double checked everything.  Our nurses are mostly white ladies, but the anesthesiologist was Asian and the doctor was middle Eastern and the receptionist was black and seemed to be a personal friend of Obama according to our conversation.   If it was not for these immigrants I would get very little health care out here in the sticks.  Regular white doctors want to live in the city with their families, it seems.  Even my primary care doctor who is Asian Indian left for greener pastures last year as I wrote in a prior post.  (My new primary care doctor is Latino.) Well, the procedure went as planned with the primary pain being the injection of the sleeping drug through a vein in my hand.  For some reason it must have pressured a nerve because my arm was in so much pain before I finally went under that it felt as if I had broken it!  The anesthesiologist told me it would feel like a pinch...WTF!!They found one small flat polyp which was removed at the time of the procedure and sent for biopsy  although the doctor told me he was pretty sure it was precancerous.  At my age, everything they find seems to be precancerous which I  guess justifies all of this medical care.  We must keep us old folks alive as long as forever.  And the young think it is a waste of money...until it is their turn.The sleeping drug wears off within 5 minutes of stopping the drip which is very different than it used to be years ago when I felt very drugged all day long.  I was not allowed to drive myself home even so.You would think I would be starving for a big breakfast after this, but I was only a little hungry and very disappointed that either the sleeping drug, the oxygen in my nose drying the olfactory surfaces, or the excessive dryness of my mouth hindered my taste buds and the breakfast at that high calorie place called I-HOP tasted like cardboard.  The only thing I welcomed was the hot tea with honey.  That taste issue lasted until evening when my dinner, prepared by hubby, of some of our frozen crab, asparagus, sesame oil and roasted red peppers over a pasta was delicious as my tongue or nose seemed to be working once again.I hesitated writing  about this, as medical stuff  is not very interesting and sometimes icky,  but I  felt some who had not had the procedure might find it important or informative.   I am now good \"to go\" for another 5-10 years.  Sorry,  but I could not resist."},
{"title": "Books Now and Later", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2016", "text": "Well about 20% in I gave up on the Baldacci book that I had written about in an earlier post.  It was written too much like a movie with James Bond types, perfect warriors with chips on their shoulders in wild situations.  David Baldacci is a best selling author and he appears to be a good person as well.  His books are too much like our over-the-top TV shows for my enjoyment.  They would make a perfect movie with strong characters and lots of action, which is also not my type of movie, and...they are clearly written for the big screen.  These are the books that seem to fit the need for escapism among the average reader.  They require little in terms of critical study or detailed thinking on the part of the reader.  This is the stuff that always seems to sell.  Yes, I am a bit of an elitist.I instead have picked up \"Istanbul Passage\" by Joseph Kanon.  Much better.  Good description of the country and city and creates the exotic, dark and scary mood of this country as WWII is winding down.  It is a spy novel, but with a nice tapestry of the culture thrown into the plot.  I really want to get to Turkey some day.  I am about 25% through reading this one.I also just finished reading a collection of short stories, \"Half an Inch of Water,\" which I bought for my e-reader on Amazon after a PBS review.  The short story format has always fascinated me as a challenging format.  This collection was a good read, taking place in Wyoming near and on an Indian reservation, written by Percival Everett, who is a well-respected author.  The descriptions of the animals, the desert, the horseback riding and the types of people that live there reminded me of growing up in Colorado.  The stories tend to end a little abruptly and have sort of a mystical  tone, but it is so different from what I usually read, that it sticks with me long after I have finished.I also just finished reading \"The Sense of an Ending\" which I did not \"get\" until I read a review or two.  It had a bit too much navel-gazing for me.  I think it is a novel for younger readers.  They love all that angst type of stuff.A book that I read last month, \"The Color of Water in July,\" was an OK read although it got pretty good reviews.  It is an easy read with one of those story lines that jumps back in time and then forward to the present and then back, etc.  For some reason writers are using this method a lot these days.  It works, but not for everything.  Good scene setting of an old summer house on a lake.In the cold winter months I read quite a bit as you can see.  In between I read my multiple books of poetry, but the house has to be totally quiet for that to work!"},
{"title": "Again With the Small Talk", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2016", "text": "Not everyone talks to their wait staff when eating out,but I frequently do.  I am \"elderly\" in the sense that I may not talk to anyone other than my husband for days at a time.  Here in the country we usually only run into repair people.  They are on the clock and not usually chatty...although some are very polite and endure my husband's insistence on bending their ear.  But recently I talked to my wait staff.Since this country is one of the wealthiest in the world we do get a number of immigrants, in spite of what spiteful candidates may tell you about how we need to close our doors.  Our service industries are run to a great extent by those from countries with no democracy, no opportunity, and no promise.  People who have no choice, but come to us for a fresh start.My trip this fall during Thanksgiving to Florida resulted in quick talks with a young man at the restaurant who was so very helpful and polite in waiting upon us.  Since we loved the view of the setting sun, we went twice to the restaurant for dinner and got to know this waiter better. The place had an elderly cat that pretty much had the run of the place and caught my photographic eye.  He worked around the tables like an old sailor at a bar.  I am sure if he had had better eyesight he would have joined me on the table for dinner!Anyway the young man, who actually was very androgynous much like \"Pat\" on Saturday Night Live and caused my husband and I some quiet discussion, had medium length curly dark brown hair and wore a gold earring.  He explained that all of his family still lived in Cuba.  He told us that life in Cuba was very hard.  People were very poor and the newly opened tourist industry from America may make little difference.  He said he did not bring money to his family who he visited every other year because they had nothing to spend it on.  They could not buy any more food than allotted and it was against the law to raise animals for food.  Obviously Cuba is still very restrictive and still very much a harsh country.  So sad that being hungry will not be alleviated by any harder work or more money on the part of the citizens or a growing tourist industry. Just a boat's ride away and I am sure that they are thinking very much about change.  But change comes slowly.There is another person I met the other night when my daughter took me to dinner for my birthday, just she and I at a new Spanish tapas restaurant in her neighborhood.  It was expensive as are many innovative places just outside the city.  Most customers from that neighborhood make six figure salaries some even mid-six figures, and that supports such places.  I rarely get to these interesting restaurants and have fun with my daughter buying all the odd foods and great wines---even though I think some are overpriced.We had to get there early because we had another activity at 7:00 PM and so we were one of the few customers .  Our waitress was a short and medium built blonde with attractive features and a very attentive and pleasant attitude.  She had an accent that we could not place, and I, being the nosy elderly one, asked her where she was \"from.\"  She explained she was from the Ukraine.  I mentioned I hoped I would  have an opportunity to visit her interesting country some day and she said that she  hoped it was not too soon as it was a very sad country right now.  Poverty, war, and  Russia had made her sad about her family and the living conditions.  She said it was not the wonderful country it used to be.  We did talk about the way they celebrated Christmas with a 12 plated dinner of wonderful foods, which were then stored outside on the very cold patio and eaten throughout the rest of the week.  The 12 dishes are meatless and represent the 12 months of the year, pre-Christian and something to do with honoring their ancestors.It is not totally irreligious as \"After a prayer the father will anoint each person present with honey, make the sign of the Cross on their forehead, and say, \"In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit: may you have many good things in life and in the new year.\"\"I do love the way many countries hang on to such traditions because parts of our country move forward into the next year ignoring all the symbolism replaced  by sales and economic success while pretending we are celebrating a religious holiday.I asked her about her social life in this country and she explained that at first she used to go to the bars with the young people looking for a social life but found all young American's wanted to do was get drunk.  She was looking for conversation, music, and maybe dancing.  So now she hangs out with a few close friends and has given up the American bar scene.  She did not tell this tale with any anger or criticism.I find it important to be able to talk to people from far away countries without the work and expense of a plane trip and I like to see the world through their eyes instead of  my well-coddled view.   We are a global melting  pot an becoming more so."},
{"title": "It Is Late", "date": "Friday, January 08, 2016", "text": "It is a little after 1:00 in the morning.  Hubby's snoring pulled me from the light  sleep I had fallen into.  I poked him to roll over and he immediately but quietly fell back into  the  deep sleep of the innocent.  I  had to pee.  When I got to bed and tried once again to fall into sleep the clang of the geese on the river started up.  The weather is now cold, into  the 20's F at night and thus our Canadian visitors have begun to arrive with their rude middle of the night noises.My neighbors across the river insist on using bright lights at their  dock and shore.  The lights are like little moons and crisply reflect on the smooth black surface of the water and somewhat blind me to everything else.  These are the kind of lights that they ask you to turn off in southern beaches when turtles are nesting as they compete with the directions given by the real moon.I admit defeat in falling back asleep and get up and make some decaffeinated Earl Gray tea.  I am careful to bring the water  to just boiling and steep the bag just enough and am rewarded by that perfect cup of tea.   I sip the hot liquid and try to read the David Baldacci book with the tiny print.  I am spoiled by the font size I can create on my electronic reading devices, and now that I have tried to read the many physical books in tilting piles around the house, I remember why I have almost given these up.  The font is most certainly 10 point and Baldacci always write over 400 pages of this stuff.The Friday tomorrow has a small list of few tasks and that does not worry my brain.  I do hear in the back of  my mind the drum beats of volunteer season starting up again shortly.  Soon there will be lists to make, tasks to organize and marks on the calendar.  I do so love the dead of winter when everyone seems to be in hibernation and leaves me alone.The house is quiet except for the heater that kicks on and the click of the metal on the fireplace still cooling from the fire in it a few hours ago.  We have lots of wood in the outside pile since winter just started and the propane tank was just filled last week.  Hubby still loves to split wood and I am glad his health allows this.  The fires are perfect for taking  the edge off once the sun sets in the evenings.Well,  I should read some blogs if I am not reading my book.  So I will leave you until another day."},

{"title": "Thoughts for Those Who Protect this Land", "date": "Sunday, January 03, 2016", "text": "A \"National Wildlife Refuge is a designation for certain protected areas of the United States managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Wildlife Refuge System is the system of public lands and waters set aside to conserve America's fish, wildlife and plants. Since President Theodore Roosevelt designated Florida's Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge as the first wildlife refuge in 1903, the System has grown to over 560 national wildlife refuges and other units of the Refuge System, plus 38 wetland management districts encompassing more than 150,000,000 acres (607,028 km2).\"  according to wiki.  Sounds like a lot, doesn't it?I am one of those people who, when seeing this designation  on my road map as we travel, get all excited about the possibility to visit.  I know intellectually it is not as pristine as my inner vision hopes.  Sometimes it is smaller than we wanted.  Other times it is pretty inaccessible and I accept that.  I do sense that there are thousands of creatures and plants being left alone to blunder along in their lives through drought, flood, fire and storm and mankind's ever-reaching  pollution.  The area is called a sanctuary...a refuge and that is the mission..\"National Wildlife Refuges manage a full range of habitat types, including wetlands; prairies; coastal and marine areas; and temperate, tundra and boreal forests. The management of each habitat is a complex web of controlling or eradicating invasive species, using fire in a prescribed manner, assuring adequate water resources, and assessing external threats like development or contamination.\"Does mankind do this successfully?  No,  of course not.  We do not play God very well  at all, but we keep trying.  60 refuges exist primarily to protect endangered species.  Some of these refuges provide fishing  and hunting opportunities to sportsman who cannot afford a refuge of their own.The National Wildlife Refuge System must work with issues like urban intrusion/development, habitat fragmentation, degradation of water quantity and quality, climate change, invasive species, increasing demands for recreation, and increasing demands for energy development. But the worst and most dangerous threats are people like the Bundys and other \"hardcore militia men\" (one wonders why they are not fighting for their country overseas) who think they own the earth and can take it from the rest of us to use as they wish."},

Perhaps it is because yesterdays temps reached 70F that I decided I am just not going to do that this year.  I am going to take a break from it all.  Hubby has not asked about decorating nor seems to notice we are not doing  it.  I did purchase a wreath from my granddaughter's Girl Scout troop and that is not even hung because I cannot find the stupid wreath hanger.  I have TWO!  The evergreen circle, which seems to be shedding worse than any house cat, sits in its lovely glory on the top of the wood stack on the porch waiting for me to do something.Oh, I haven't written about the best news this month that means my funk is more than valid.  My PC crashed two days ago.  Totally started eating its own files.  I had booted it up and while waiting for my photography software to load I click on the trash icon to empty and it started deleting files like crazy.  I saw that it said it was deleting 39,000 files and immediately interrupted that process, but not in time to avoid disaster.I took it to the Geek squad as we have paid for annual technical support and they studied it for 24 hours and then called to tell me that it was the Windows OS that had crashed.  They said it rarely happens to Windows 10 but it means a back-up of the personal files they can get at their end and reinstall of Windows 10.  No wonder the W10 upgrade was free.  (They may be wrong because my photography software has been giving me a test of  patience, so we will see.)  They insisted the hardware was fine which was a surprise.  Of course for the software reloads I have to find the CDs, DVDs, and serial numbers, etc.  I am writing this at 1:30 A,M. on my tiny laptop and would be doing the searching now, except I do not think hubby wants to hear me rummaging around at this time of night!Do not worry.  I will dig myself out of  this funk.  My PC fail is far less worrisome than the state of the world I think and I can do only a little for that, so I will lift my chin and carry on."},

The receptionist finished with the other patient and looked over at me and said \"Name?\"  I gave her my name wondering why she never knew me?  \"You DO have an appointment?\"  she then asked.  I made some comment about just loving dentists and dropping by anyway over the holidays...snark!  We both laughed and she input my arrival into the computer.  She looked up at the elder woman and said hello to her by name and entered her into the computer.  A few minutes later another woman came in and sat down and the receptionist greeted her by name and then logged her in.  I sat and read my new book on poetry and still was a little miffed that she did not know my name, but I barely remembered hers----names are a big failing on my part as I age.A man came in next and she greeted him by name.  I was beginning to wonder what was wrong with my personality, demeanor, appearance that I was  the only stranger in this reception room.  I  was in a bit of a funk now because I was remembering that people usually remember my husband when we go somewhere, yet if I am alone, they often do not remember me!And I as I thought about this,  I realized it was NOT an elder thing.  It was not because I was  a lovely shade of  camouflage gray.  This anonymous thing has been  true most of my life.  I  would just brush it off during those busy years.  I remember once being introduced to someone who had actually been to my house for dinner but was a passing acquaintance over the years.  I was younger then and remembered him!I guess  we all like to be memorable to people.  We like to be known as the \"humorous \" one  or the \"charming\" one or the \"intelligent\" one.  (I am sometimes remembered as \"hubby's\" wife.) Yes, of course I have people who know me on sight, thank goodness.  But it is most disheartening to be the gray person in the room at various times.  I mean I WAS the Prom Queen in  high school and the editor of the school annual---it was a very small  school.  How far the great have fallen!"},

Early this morning, I look out my windows at the deck and see that the gnarly branches of the trees are bare of leaves, the frost is on the lawn and there is that pale pink sunrise painted fog that looks as if wood smoke hangs in the air over the silver quiet river.  Sipping my first cup of coffee I am avoiding making the long list of things that need to be done after weeks away.  I see the spiders in the corners have filled their larders with bugs that must be dusted out the door, the fan above me is covered in dust and must be wiped clean before I turn it on, one of the kitchen lights has burned out, there is almost three weeks of mail waiting at the post office, and the pantry and fridge need replenishing.But for now, I can watch the pinks and purples of  dawn kiss this very still morning with both man and animal still snuggled warmly in their beds.  I do not think there is a God, but I pray for peace anyway, always someone who keeps her doors open and does not disregard any opportunity for help from a wiser and higher power.  Everyday, I pray for peace before I begin my jumble of stuff to do.Now I will go blog reading and begin an hour of catching up with all of you, knowing I have missed huge chunks of your lives."},

Said \"Goodbye\" to them yesterday (hiding my tears) as they boarded the plane and then we drove to Hollywood Beach on the other side of the state.  I slept 10 hours straight last night and hubby slept 11.  We must have been more exhausted enjoying the grands than we thought.  In and out of pools playing shuffle board, pool, boccie ball, putt putt golf, beach walking and shell collecting.  Yes, it was one of those perfect family holidays with as little tension as can be expected with six adults and 3 kids.Today we drive out to visit my husband's parents' grave site in Fort Lauderdale and then probably we will find a nearby park to explore. We are in Hollywood Florida now which is surprisingly very Cuban in mood.  Not the rich Cubans, but middle class and other Cuban families enjoying a vacation with the grandparents and kids on the beach and brickwalk on the Atlantic Ocean.  Lovers holding hands, children trying to kill us with  wheeled little trikes, and adults helping an elderly aunt down the promenade.   Almost like an Atlantic City without the gambling.  We do not hear much English, although there are some white heads like us.  Photos to follow.Almost ready to go home, but hubby is not, so we will be on travel another five or six days."},
{"title": "Bright Ideas", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2015", "text": "Years ago, when I lived on a tropical island just north of the great continent of Australia, I would run into the lone or pair of Australian tourists enjoying the moderate Muslim culture in which I lived daily.  I think it was at an ex-patriot dinner party where the length of the evening found many had slid into more than moderate drinking and comfortably into politically incorrect talks, that an Australian fellow on his fourth (or fifth) bottle of beer said he would never want to live in America.  What a bunch of wussies we were.  Rules and more rules.  \"My God you cannot spit on the sidewalk without some Jack telling you to hold your spit.\"  Of course, most of us who live in the U.S. do not see that kind of  petty rule enforcement and we are probably the first to take a somewhat dim view of police officers wasting their time on such.  Unlike Singapore we CAN chew gum in public. Still many Americans think we are a land of too many regulations which put a stranglehold on business and growth.  This may be true, but I have been unable to get a small business owner to give me an actual example of some ridiculous/unnecessary rule that brought his business to a standstill or cost an unreasonable fee as a follow-up to his statement. They are there, but we cannot protest against them if we do not publicize them.BUT I can think of rules that I want kept in place that protect citizens from highway robbery.  For instance we now have more homeowners using solar and wind power to reduce their consumption of energy.  This costs them money up front in setup, but over time the effort reduces the size of the bill from the power company.  Every dollar saved by a homeowner reduces revenue for power companies.  The power company may attempt to tack on fees if you install a renewable system, and they may try to charge you for sending power back to them by a process fee.  Currently we have regulations that do not allow utilities to raise the cost of energy just because they are selling us less and they want to improve their profits!  I like this rule because heating our homes is a necessity, unlike other things we may buy.  Other consumers are buying more efficient appliances that reduce their consumption of power from the grid. Replacing light bulbs with high efficiency LEDS means you use up to 80% less electricity. Smart thermostats cut back on use of heat or air-conditioning when no one is at home.  All of these are cutting into the bottom line of your utility company.  I can guarantee you if we did not have consumer protection regulations, you would be using less energy from utility companies and paying just as much if not more for that.This is just one of the many, many regulations I support."},

It would mean adding more than half a million new homes.  On a map of their region, each table had to place all of that new growth...The idea was not to discourage growth. This state, like most states, avidly courts economic expansion, more jobs, more people. The Reality Check conference organizers hoped to promote “smart growth,” or to place as many Legos as possible around places where growth was planned and roads and sewers already existed, thus protecting farms, forests and undeveloped Bay shorelines.It was nonetheless a sobering exercise as Legos piled higher and existing towns began looking like little Manhattans. You could hear sighs and mutterings: “The traffic’s already hell there” or “my pile fell over…there goes the countryside.”  An Eastern Shore contingent built a paper boat and set their Legos sailing toward a coastal city, which has been losing population since the 1950s.  It was a good laugh — maybe a good idea — but the directive was firm: Growth is coming your way and you must accommodate it.\"But at my County's table, a County commissioner, Ms. C, chose to differ. She swept a bunch of Legos off the map and into her purse. And it was not an exercise like barging people across the Bay to a coastal city.This is what our County leaders do.  Respond with unrealistic solutions or ignore growth issues it seems.  Our County is long and thin and no more than 4 miles from tidewater in most directions.  Therefore our growth impacts the rivers and oceans.  Yet, if we have no growth, it means our county dies---well, goes into a coma.  And to give the good-old-boys their due, I realize what a difficult problem they have.This week I was talking to my neighbor as we planned a dinner out with them before they leave for Florida for the winter.  We have lots of fried seafood places down here, but in the last few years several new and more delicious venues have emerged.   This County's population has double the median household income of the U.S. and one could hope that would support this growth.The conversation went like this:\"How about The Basil Basket?\"\"Nope, closing next week due to owners divorcing.\"\"OK....Lets go to the Lime Pie Tree.\"\"That place has had to close due to the foundation crumbling on the water side.  Don't know if it is a permanent close or not.\"\"Gee.  That leaves the Brasserie.\"\"Well, we better get in next week, because they are also closing for good very soon.\"\"Oh dear.  I heard yesterday that the Chinese restaurant is also closing.\"I am well aware that the restaurant business is very difficult and most restaurants close within a few years...but all of our new ones are closing!  And then, last month as we drove by the rock quarry on the other side of the river and just across the county line we saw this:Some people say this other county is growing too fast and others wish our county was as progressive.  We got curious and drove down off the main road to see if we could find out what was going on with this new development:Much closer and nicer than the old movie place we go to.  This even has reclining wide seats...I wonder if it will succeed?  I did notice that their ticket kiosks did not have the technology for chip cards, so someone wasn't paying attention.  I also noticed the impermeable surface of the largest parking lot I have seen in a while!"},

To remember is, more and more, not to recall a story but to be able to call up a picture\"  Susan SontagFor readers who do not know Sontag, she was a fiction and non-fiction writer who became interested in photography and its affect on society and its implications as it evolved into what we have today with the ease of digital documentation.  She was a very demanding, smart, and exotic woman.  I have not read any of her fiction, but may tackle that someday.  Her interest in war grew with several trips to Sarajevo during the war there.  I have been reading a Susan Sontag book about the brutal photography taken duringwar.  Oh, yes, a nice after dinner theme to sink my teeth into after watching the photos and videos on TV covering all the devastating news.Decades ago in the old Russia, people were removed from dignitary photos without guilt as certain leaders lost favor with the regime over time.  There were usually a few other non-doctored photos that revealed the editing to the world.Most people remember the famous photo taken by AP photographer Nick Ut of the naked 9-year-old Vietnamese girl running from the rain of chemical napalm from a South Vietnamese Air Force attack that incorrectly thought the village was an enemy group. The photo won a Pulitzer prize and yet history tells us that President Nixon doubted its authenticity.  Was it too awful to be real?Recently a photo of a Syrian toddler lying face down in the surf on a beach near a Turkish resort was published around the world.  This very moving photo touched many people much more strongly than all the boats of refugees crowded in rafts or trudging along railroad lines in search of a new life.  An investigation later revealed that the boy had been moved from a small cove to the beach area for a better photo opportunity.  So now this becomes a bit of a staged photograph!  Would it have had the same tragic punch if the original site of death was the one shared around the world?Also this year some videos of Syrian refugees refusing water and food and in another case carrying some flags in protest were sent out with the information that these were examples of how Islamic zealots were willing to protest for their religion with the sub-text of how dangerous these people could be if let into \"Christian\" countries.  Not given enough attention was that these photos had nothing to do with Islam.  One was not even part of the current refugee crises but another protest entirely at a different place and time.  The other videos reflected frustration at being stuck behind a fence for days with no where to go, rather than rejection of \"Red-Cross\" meals.  If someone had not followed with accurate context, could this have mushroomed into a larger rejection of Muslim refugees?There was also a photo this week from Peru that Kay Davis lawyers insisted was a mass meeting of Christians in Peru (of all places?) supporting her stand against gay marriage.  It took less than 48 hours for photographic detectives to reveal the photo was taken more than a year ago and had nothing to do with her protest.We are going to have to question photographs we see as photo-shopping a digital photo can be even more confusing and less able to detect as we move into the future.  What we once relied on as photographic truth is not necessarily so."},

{"title": "Failure Is Not an Option", "date": "Friday, September 18, 2015", "text": "I'm a little nervous so I arrive about 20 minutes early to check out the study room in the public library.  The room is small with a built-in table against one wall and clearly designed for no more than two people.  It is cold!  I should have brought a sweater.  I spread out my notebook, two pencils, the first lesson, and tuck my purse into the corner.  I look around, and satisfied, head out to the main part of the library.This library used to be about 25% of its current size.  There was a plan to build a new library for the community in the budget, before the deficits raised issues a few years ago.  In the old building the librarians had a workroom/storage area about the size of a large broom closet and there were two tiny offices.  I had done some volunteer work years ago in the old library building and was cramped into a corner trying to enter subscription data with two other librarians within touching distance of their tiny desks.  The two children's librarians had only plastic bins on the floor to store their tools.  The circulation desk was slap up against a wall.  When the local gourmet food market on the main road could not get a buyer, the county bought the building and using less money converted the space into a new library.  The new space is lighter, roomer and closer to the main traffic.  This library was used a lot when it was smaller and off the road near a school and some woods and within walking distance of the Senior Center, but it gets even more use now that there is room and it is closer to town.I look at the shelves to pass the time and find Harper Lee's book \"Go Set a Watchman\" which I had been wanting to read and take it to a comfortable chair to peruse.  After about ten minutes I hear a conversation regarding the location of a study room and I hear my name.  I stand and walk over to where the librarian is pointing and I see an attractive, casually dressed (in clean jeans and a wine colored T-shirt), stocky, black woman.  She looks like she might be in her 40's-50's.  Her stance is energetic and I am sure she is my student.  I approach her and indicate who I am. She waves her arm in my direction and begs  \"I just have to get something to eat!  Just a few minutes.\"I respond, \"No problem.\" as she is fifteen minutes early.I go back to the study room as my student disappears outside somewhere.  There are a few restaurants on the strip mall and the gas station has food.  I sort the lesson and wait.Five minutes after our start time, my student comes back energetically into the room.  She does not smell of food, so maybe all she had was a granola bar and a drink in the car.  She is a talker like me, so our greetings topple over each other.  I formally introduce myself and offer my hand.  She introduces herself and we shake hands, talk some more, and she offers her hand again and we shake ... again.I do like her and we settle down into learning about her study issues, etc.She is so eager to get through this training in order to graduate in October of 2016, that I am worried about how she is setting her short term goals.  She explains how she had to drop out of school at 17 because she was pregnant.  She has at least one child now in college.  She wants so much to get her degree in front of her children and grandchildren and then as tears come to her eyes, she apologizes and gets a tissue.  She does not once mention that the diploma is for a job opportunity.  It seems this is a personal goal for her.Yes, I can feel the pressure on me to make this training successful.  She talks about teachers she has liked and the class that she has to go to that very evening for math.I start with a few charts and vocabulary sheets that were given to me to help with approaching word problems.We start with the basics of trying to decode a word problem.   I read her the first exercise which involves determining how much a waiter made in tips when we know his hourly wage, number of hours worked, and total money he gets at the end of the day.  She is slow to figure this out and I am wondering if I am helping her too much as we multiply, add and then subtract.  I have her read the next problem and this takes me back to fourth grade when some fellow classmates would nervously struggle with reading a paragraph out loud.    Now I see that some of her problem is reading and not just math.She is bravely not too self-conscious although she apologizes too much.  I am totally positive and full of encouragement reminding her these are steps of the journey, reminding her to take her time, and then giving clues when I need to.  We struggle though the problems for an hour and then I give her an exercise sheet and ask her to do a few of the problems for the next class.  We do the first one together and when we both come up with the same answer, which according to my \"Key\" is wrong, it takes a few minutes for us to realize that the exercise has a major typo!  This is going to be more work than I thought!We talk about learning styles and then I suggest a later time for our next Tuesday class because it will give her some free time before she has to drive further up the road for her other class.  Both my class and the other class are about 20 minutes from where she lives.I think she is feeling good about the session and she insists on giving me a hug when we leave.  I am a big hugger, so feel good about that. Now I have to do some serious research on learning styles, learning strategies, and real teaching...not just training which I do with my grandkids.  This is making me reach just like her, so I think this may work out for us both.  I do not want to fail her!"},
{"title": "Too Old to Learn New Tricks?", "date": "Wednesday, September 16, 2015", "text": "Way back in January of this year when gray snow and blistering winds were all that greeted me as I left the house, I decided I needed some activity that was more inspiring for me and more useful to others, before I turned into a winter hermit.  I perused the listing of volunteer activities in the county newspaper and the Adult Basic Education program caught my eye.  I used to teach many decades ago, and figured my skills were not that rusty.  Some one on one time with someone who needed my help could be pretty rewarding for me as well.After placing a call to the ABE office I was told that they would place my name on their list...there would be training...there were others also on this list.  January came and went and February was almost over before I received a call that there would be a meeting/training session in March and did I have a date or two that suited me?  There was much juggling as there were four of us who led complicated lives and finally the ABE office admitted they would have to have two sessions to accommodate us.I drove up to the old concrete block building across from the fire station.  It was uninviting and sparse in decor.  It reminded me of an old school room in the the 1950's with walls filled with workbooks and reading materials and some old fashioned desks in the middle of the room.  Budget constraints were clearly visible everywhere.  There were two women of pre-retirement age and gentle personalities to explain the program as we two potential tutors sat at a small round table.  Lots of paperwork.  The training consisted of some simple rules, ideas and paperwork forms and took a few afternoon hours.  I was asked to complete a form on how many students I was willing to tutor, whether it was English and/or math, etc.  I said one student to start, and although I do hate math I was afraid I would never get a student if I didn't check that box also...everyone wants to teach reading comprehension or grammar, etc.  They said it would take some time as they had to run background checks on us among other things.I went home to wait for an assignment.  Spring came and my volunteer garden work and travel filled the months.  Summer came and my grandchildren visits filled my time.  I had almost forgotten about this teaching project.  Then the last week of August I get a call to tutor a math student.  My heart sank because I really had forgotten all my math and in the back of my mind I had been hoping for English.  Who does math anymore with computers and calculators everywhere?  But having a Puritan work ethic I said I would be happy to tutor this adult woman in math.I was given the name and phone number of the student but told to wait two weeks while the office put together a packet of lessons for me.  Oddly, I was beginning to panic more!  What made me think I could teach basic math?  I researched some exercises on the Internet and tried hard to remember how to reduce fractions, figure perimeters, calculate percentages, etc.  Gosh, I was going to have to re-learn everything.I drove up to the local high school and picked up the lengthy study packet and reviewed the lessons inside and then called the student.  She was thrilled to hear from me, desperate to get her high school diploma, and willing to meet on any day, any place, and any time for tutoring.  Yes, having an eager student is golden, but I was still very nervous as I set a date to meet at the public library the following week.  During our phone conversation she was interrupted by noises of children in the back ground.  Excusing herself, but not bothering to put her hand across the receiver, I heard her yelling at them and scolding them to behave.  When she got back to me she apologized and explained they were her grandchildren!  Shoot, if she could do this, why not I?While I sorted materials and made a flexible plan, the day of the lesson arrived and she called to cancel because her niece had been taken to the hospital.  I am well aware that adult students have all kinds of reasons for not moving forward with their goals and that they have real lives to interfere and that sometimes they use excuses to avoid doing the work.  Yet, I heaved a sigh of relief to be given a short reprieve.I called a few days later to re-schedule.  Yesterday we did finally meet for our first lesson and I will tell you how that went in my next post."},
{"title": "The Rest of the Story", "date": "Friday, September 11, 2015", "text": "Hooper Straight Lighthouse prism, Maryland -- Let there be light!I neglected to add the postscript to the story of the young woman who has entered my life.  When I went to her wedding in early summer I had the opportunity to meet her parents who came in from out-of-state.  Her father is ex-military and I honestly forget what he did in between before his retirement.  He was a short, stocky, healthy looking man with gray hair and a well-trimmed professorial beard.  Her mother was attractive but did look a little timid at times as if she wondered how she ended up at this wedding with a deer in the headlights look.  The older sister was a very different type of person from my young friend.  I cannot explain, but she was the exact opposite in looks, style and personality that one would have expected.  In retrospect both the sister and mother looked very intimidated by the whole evening rather than the joy one would have expected.  I did talk to the mother briefly and she expressed surprise that her determined daughter had decided to marry.  (As an aside, the groom is a very Westernized Chinese American man from Hong Kong.)The ceremony was performed by a Chinese-American pastor.  It was a small wedding with about 60-70 guests.  There was the traditional father-daughter dance which looked lovely.  Then a few months later I learned the following:She had asked her parents to stay with her at the new home over the wedding weekend.  They instead brought up a trailer and stayed in a campground outside the city.  When I asked why they did this, she explained she did not actually know, but she was pretty sure it had to do with the fact that her father carries a concealed weapon and that is not allowed in the city.  I guess he felt safe enough to stow it during the ceremony, but not staying with your daughter and/or supporting her because you needed to have your weapon is something I cannot get my mind around.When I had the young woman down for the weekend a few months after the wedding, I asked how her parents were doing.  She said she thought they were OK, but her father had unfriended her on Facebook because of her liberal ideas and so she wasn't sure what was going on with them.  I read her posts and they are hardly radical or in-your-face.  She was very calm about this statement, but I cannot imagine how painful this is for her.  Being rejected by your parents publicly is harsh. My step-nephew unfriended me (most likely because of my liberal posts) but I am fine with that, as he is not an essential part of my life.  I still like him, but it seems we cannot agree to disagree.   I would only unfriend someone if they were nasty in their posts to me.  Their political agenda is their own.\"I was fond of Pop, in a way.  He had been terribly generous financially, but we did not connect spiritually and had become quite detached.  He never said much about my years of cookery-work, our book, or my appearances on radio and television.  He felt that I had rejected his way of life, and him, and he was hurt by that.  He was bitterly disappointed that I didn't marry a decent, red-blooded Republican businessman, and felt my life choices were downright villainous.  From my perspective, I did not reject him until the point when I could no longer be honest about my opinions and innermost thoughts with him, especially when it came to politics.  As I looked back on it, I think that break---my \"divorce\" from my father---began with our move to Paris.\"  Julia Child, My Life in France."},

I will be busy.The second week of September looks like smooth sailing except for my volunteer work.  I realize this is a very normal life style for some people.  But it is NOT for me.  Please tell  me this is keeping me young and not aging me unduly faster."},

{"title": "I Won't Be Here", "date": "Friday, July 31, 2015", "text": "Our summer weather (not climate) has been unusually pleasant.  Hot but not hotter than hell, humid but not a sauna, and as a result we have enjoyed being outside for a change.  The other day my dear spouse wanted to \"run the motor\" on the boat to make sure it was still working.  (He really wanted an excuse to fish the Bay.)  We hadn't used the boat in weeks and he gets nervous if it sits/hangs on the lift too long.The weather was predicted to have clear skies and the wind was minimal so we decided to take a longer trip across the Bay, and burn our share of fossil fuels,  a twenty minute ride to the other side which is part refuge and part old-school fishing village.We first visited an eagle's nest.  The eagles had fledged months ago, but the nest remained in stark contrast against the sky. The coast line is mostly marsh which is home to red-wing black birds, boat tail blackbirds, marsh wrens herons, and marsh ducks.  Most of the birds were not there when we coasted in.  You can see the crow(?) on the left snag in the photo above checking out the eagle's nest.  He is probably remembering a number of arguments on the wing as he chased the eagle incessantly this past spring.  I have seen three crows gang up on a bald eagle and cause him to have an emotional breakdown.  Really!  He/she sat crying on a lower branch of a tree in my back yard for twenty minutes that time.Above we are cruising slowly into a wider mouth of a distant river off the Eastern side of the Bay.On the other side of this river, the pine trees shown above have no lower branches because the trees that were on each side of them were hiding the inner trees from the sun.  What outer trees?  The ones that have now died and lay in the shrubs/small pines below.  These tall still-standing sentinels will be gone in a few years as well.Above is a starker example.  Why are all these trees dying?  Old age?  Actually, this is real evidence of ocean rise, and brackish water intrusion to freshwater root systems.  Yes, the water levels are being measured by scientists and the water has been rising for quite some time.  Pines were the last to hang on at these little spots of high ground.A new study ( by a NASA scientist who has studied the issue for decades) indicates that ocean rise is going to be even more dramatic than scientists thought.  Ten feet in fifty years is just one estimate, although bolder researchers say we will see dramatic coastal damage in fifteen years.  It is always an unpredictable thing, this research.  A Smithsonian scientist recently found that with marsh grass species one species likes a certain amount of the brackish water intrusion while another does not.  Scientists are always conservative in their approach to future predictions and welcome (intelligent) argument from their peers, so it may very well be worse than we hope.  If you do not live near the coast, it will still impact you because much of our industry and commerce happens near the coast in countries around the world.Some people refuse to believe scientists.  These are the same people that questioned health experts about vaccines until we had a measles outbreak.  The same people that question researchers regarding dangers of living near fracking sites, even though an increase in fetal mortality has raised its ugly head.  Scientists \"have ulterior motives\" say politicians, who of course, have absolutely no ulterior motives nor expertise in the area.  A minority of scientists that are employed by the fossil fuel industry also chime in but I do question their motives since they are being paid by the fuel industry.  Even Senator Lindsey Graham, (R. SC) has seen the light and admits that we should listen to the experts, which seems to contradict the majority of his party's views.What should you do?  What can you do?  Nothing.  You really can't do anything to slow this roller coaster ride now.   You are way to late to this crazy party.  You should have jumped on the bandwagon twenty years ago.  I talked to a scientist (researching this impact on the coastal grasses) the other day and he said that stopping CO2's emissions fully today would not show results for 30-40 years.  The ocean is currently absorbing all the heat and taking it deep below where it will be covered by glacial water from the big melt and it will be years and years before it gets released back into the air, all after ocean currents change dramatically, another long term impact of global warming.  Maybe it won't be so bad for me after all.  I don't live on an island.  My drinking water is 400 feet down, not 100 feet like most.  As a bleeding-heart liberal, I will miss all those cute little critters that crawl and fly and need the coast for their habitat and breeding.  Some of the more dire predictions envision turning London into an Atlantis!   By the way, if you have not seen Venice, Italy, you really should schedule a trip while it is still there or take up SCUBA lessons.  This is going to happen over decades and not fast enough to catch the attention of the reality TV generation that sees marriages dissolve in months, follows crazy celebrities crash and burn scenarios, and relishes how an other's life disappears in an instant.  I won't be here to see the transition anyway.  Maybe my grandchildren will be engineers, city planners, inventors, water chemists...we are going to need those big time!  And, yes, you can do something.  Tell your representatives, local, state and national, to begin planning for this transition NOW."},
{"title": "Wishes and Pipe Dreams", "date": "Monday, July 27, 2015", "text": "The \"photo-painting\" above is deceptive in the story you think it tells.  Maybe this boat rarely gets a chance to raise its' sails?  One thing I have learned as I moved to this area near the water is that you can read the owners by their boats.  There are new fancy boats both fast and slow, well-used work boats, small pleasure craft and old, old boats.  Boats are usually (not always) like the Velveteen Rabbit.  They can be old and worn, but if well care for, they most certainly are used on a regular basis and used with respect.  If the boats are shiny and very new looking they are either NEW NEW or something that someone with more money than brains bought when his bonus came in.  But they sit idle representing a pipe dream that is slowly dying as the owners find they really do not like the regular outing on the water.  If the boat is worn and beaten down, maybe the owner cares less about life and just wants to make it through the day or has abandoned the effort to use the boat altogether.I think the boats above are used on the old-fashioned and very wasteful passive fixed gill nets that the owner is supposed to check on a regular basis for trapped turtles, sting rays and other animals as well as make sure that they remove gilled fish before they die.  Fortunately these gill nets are grandfathered in and no new ones are being staked on the water.  They are also a boating hazard in the evenings when fishermen are supposed to put a solar or battery operated night light and do not! Usually getting a boat ready for any outing and maintaining a boat while it sits idle at anchor or at the dock is for people who love the job or people who rely on the boat for food or people who have lots of money to hire help while they are raking in more money at the office. But for many who depend on the wild harvest for income it is becoming a rare industry that provides little income as the prices of boat maintenance, fuel, and loss of animals in the ocean available for harvest bring profits down.  As few may know, most of our seafood comes from cultured places outside the U.S., some sustainable and some not.  It is even hard to get blue crab on the East Coast in the summer that does not come from Asia and you have to ask at the restaurants where the seafood comes from.  We always do that just to keep the restaurant owners on their toes."},
{"title": "How Many Lives Do You Have?", "date": "Thursday, July 23, 2015", "text": "Writer's block or blogger's block is not something I panic about.  I know that I will write about something eventually because it is an addiction for me and I am not dependent on income from what I write.  I love how words combine on pages, make nice rhythms or sounds, and paint rudimentary pictures of what I want to express.  When virtual readers join in with remarks or comments, that is the icing on the cake.  Well, this block thing I had was finally broken by death.  Not my death, of course, nor the death of anyone close to me, thankfully,  just several incidents that made death more real than usual.  It got me thinking.I have been close to dying (in a vague way) several times.  Once when I was about seven(?) I had the mumps.  I got very sick and remember my throat actually swelling shut.  It must not have completely closed because I remember telling my mother that I  couldn't breathe and I remember clearly how frightened I was.  We were poor and did not visit hospitals or doctors needlessly, but this did cause piling brothers and sisters into the car, rushing down the canyon to the nearest village and seeing a doctor who applied cold compresses, gave me some medicine and advice, and I thus I lived!Another time that I came close to danger and perhaps death (I did say these were vague encounters) was when I was playing alone at about the age of 10 in a big field below the foothills. A man stopped his car on the country road near the field where I had been collecting rocks.  He opened the passenger door and ask me to come over.  I did.  He asked if I would like to go for a ride and as I was wondering why this man was asking this, he tossed some pieces of candy across the car seat beside him.  A major warning light went off in the back of  my head---good survival instincts---and I turned and ran like a gazelle back up the hill toward my house.Once when I was eighteen and on a first date with a local boy we drove up the canyon to a popular tourist dance hall.  We had both consumed too much beer over the evening and not been able to dance it off before heading home.  While going down the canyon we skidded around a curve and did a complete 360 before coming to the edge of the steep side of the road and were lucky no one was coming either up or down the canyon at that time.  Both of us were suddenly sober realizing we were inches from death as we headed on home.  I never dated the boy again, as I guess we decided we were not the best for each other.In my early twenties while living on an island in the South Pacific I got food poisoning.  It was a dreadful case and there were no really suitable doctors on this island.  I went for almost a week unable to down much more than a tablespoon of water every now and again.  On the sixth day I actually remember thinking that I wanted to die.  I was tired of this horrible intestinal battle and just wanted to \"give up the ghost.\"  The seventh day I made the turn around as luck would  have it and survived!In my thirties my husband and I visited a ski place in New Zealand.  We had gone up just for the day and not even planned to ski.  We just wanted to see the scenery and enjoy the lodge.  During mid-day a big snowstorm started to fall.  It was so lovely and heavy and steady that almost all of the skiers came in to wait it out as you needed windshield wipers on goggles if you were heading down on skies.  In the late afternoon we boarded the bus to take us back down to the parking lot at the bottom of the mountain.  I  will never forget that trip as the bus fishtailed from side to side either threatening to dash us against a rock interface or throw us down the side of the mountain.  Even hubby who is pretty carefree said he was going to get off the bus and walk down several times getting louder each time.  We made it without serious incident, but it was really pure luck.I have had other scares such as getting the early stage of the bends when SCUBA diving, getting caught on a rushing muddy trail during a torrential downpour in a tropical rain forest, being stuck on the canvas of a trimaran in an electrical storm while pregnant, etc. but none of these brought me close to death...injury perhaps..but not death.  All of the above were nothing like being caught in a war or riot or plague outbreak and many were the result of carelessness.  But they affected me enough to remember them clearly.Please feel free to share in a comment below or link to a more lengthy blog post telling my why you are lucky to still be here!"},

{"title": "The Problem", "date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2015", "text": "I have been trying to post something about a book I am reading, a minor controversial book, but a book which is important to us all and I cannot seem to get my thoughts into several cogent tangents or a few reasonable ideas or even some significant retorts...so you are going to get some quotes from it.  (Tell me if you have read this book.)\" Calculating the background extinction rate is a laborious task that entails combing through whole databases’ worth of fossils. For what’s probably the best-studied group, which is mammals, it’s been reckoned to be roughly .25 per million species-years. This means that, since there are about fifty-five hundred mammal species wandering around today, at the background extinction rate you’d expect— once again, very roughly— one species to disappear every seven hundred years.\"“I sought a career in herpetology because I enjoy working with animals,” Joseph Mendelson, a herpetologist at Zoo Atlanta, has written. “I did not anticipate that it would come to resemble paleontology.”\"But extinction rates among many other groups are approaching amphibian levels. It is estimated that one-third of all reef-building corals, a third of all freshwater mollusks, a third of sharks and rays, a quarter of all mammals, a fifth of all reptiles, and a sixth of all birds are headed toward oblivion.\"\"SINCE the start of the industrial revolution, humans have burned through enough fossil fuels— coal, oil, and natural gas— to add some 365 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere. Deforestation has contributed another 180 billion tons. Each year, we throw up another nine billion tons or so, an amount that’s been increasing by as much as six percent annually.\"I have only read a third of this book thus far and it carefully follows the extinction of species over billions of years as we have grown in our knowledge and comprehension and insight.  It discusses the causes, the patterns, the results.  It introduced me to thousands of living things I never new had existed.  Complicated life forms that hold my amazement at their survival.Of course, there are those who say we will all go extinct anyway in the future, why focus on it?  My response is:   why go extinct sooner rather than later?  And why at the expense of everything else?Kolbert, Elizabeth (2014-02-11).

{"title": "Dinner at My House", "date": "Sunday, July 12, 2015", "text": "I am fortunate in that my husband likes to cook.  He is very good at making sure a steak or piece of fish is not overcooked...both of which require different attention.  The only thing he overcooks is scrambled eggs, but he likes them that way!  He also likes to make sauces and use spices and has a few stir fry Thai dishes he has developed.   He is an intense cook because he really does not cook  often enough to be a casual cook.While I also like to cook, and am the primary chef in the house, I try to step back now and again to give him an opportunity to find his creative talents.We finally caught some perch for bait the other day and were able to bait our crab traps appropriately to FINALLY catch blue crabs.  We did not get a lot, but were able to steam five big crabs for dinner.  Hubby was excited and so I asked if he would like cook dinner while I continued to photograph with my new tripod (my old one broke!)He was excited.  We had our first harvest of eggplant, there was a bunch of lemon basil growing, blueberries on the vine, etc. etc.I had forgotten that as a cook he gets easily distracted by reading a recipe or two or 40 for ideas, spending extensive time meditatively harvesting in the garden and then beginning the sauce or two!  An hour before we usually eat dinner he had a pound of lemon basil in the sink being washed.  A pound!  I am a medium fan of  lemon basil, preferring Italian, or red or many of the others, but he likes it.  And lemon basil was the only basil that had not been eaten to the ground by a rabbit or ground hog in my un-fenced herb bed.  Yes, I know!  Basil!  Never eaten before in my herb bed, but with the tons of rain, perhaps it is less pungent to the animals.There was lots of chopping and mashing and slicing and dicing and steaming in the kitchen.  I  begged him to use one pesto recipe if he was going to try to make a pesto after he asked if he should  use sugar in it.   So there was walking back and forth studying the cook book and several thousand trips to the pantry. While dinner was late we did have steamed crabs with a lime butter sauce, fried eggplant with a lemon pesto basil sauce, corn on the cob and freshly sliced cucumbers as our salad.  The pesto was a little strong in lemon basil, but complimented the gentle nutty flavor  of  fried eggplant nicely.  Crab is always good and the rest of the veggies were a nice change from the rich and spicy foods.My payment for this good dinner was about an hour of cleaning a kitchen that looked as if six chefs had prepared some banquet and then left in a hurry.  I clean as I cook.  Men do not usually do that.  They just move to the next clean counter and begin again.  The counter was covered in tiny green  leaves, oily puddles, the floor in tiny garlic skins, the sink in corn husks and there were measuring cups and bowls everywhere.  But I stuck to my guns and worked off those calories nicely as I returned the kitchen to its former glory to use another day."},

I followed hubby when he decided he wanted a Nook a few years ago and since they were on sale...I also got one (orange)!  I have a bunch of books on it, some in the cloud, and I also check out from the local library when I do not mind being rushed to finish a read. It works for blogging, FB and other stuff as well.  Easy to transport, uses the charge pretty fast.Since my old laptop was scary, I decided I had better get a new one and back up stuff from the old laptop.  I researched and bought a laptop/tablet...Lenova (the silver gray).  No detachable keyboard,but folds completely back and works like a tablet.  Geek squad was supposed to transfer stuff, refused to transfer software, etc.  Now I have to figure out how to do that.Oh, I also have a phone where I can pretty much do virtual reality stuff on a tiny keyboard if I am in a self-flagellating mood and even do some photographic stuff on a very small scale.BUT, this story is not over yet.  I want a graphics tablet!  I want it so badly I can see it...just out of reach.  My photography hobby is reaching new levels that only a graphics tablet can meet.  I have limited time on this earth and want to try that out!I will need a larger surge protector to keep all of these charged!  So much for a small carbon footprint. I have to label and keep together all charging cords...a real nightmare.Now, you may ask, why is this good for an elder brain?  Well some of these devices have touch screens, various devices use various control key commands (and while most are OS Windows, they are still different), menu drop downs are sometimes sideways, ESC key works for some and only for others in certain windows, in some cases I have to remember some other key combination, some are touch screen and I forget others are not, one uses a mouse and two others a touch pad....I find that my brain strains to learn each of the subtle language differences when communicating with, through, and on these devices.  That must be good for the brain if not the pocket-book, right?  And, just think of all the extra  chances to have my ID stolen, now that the Federal database has been broken into and my Social Security number is available to some nefarious Chinese entities!"},

{"title": "Geography or Finding Your Way Home", "date": "Friday, July 03, 2015", "text": "On the restroom wall at the Newseum in Washington, DC.My world grows even smaller in this little county of mine on a daily basis.  Some days I feel as if I have crawled back into a little cave and rolled back a large stone behind me as I settle in with the strange but nice cave people who are afraid of bright white lights because no one ever told them about electricity or perhaps even the sun.What has brought on this perspective you might ask?  While I was talking to my doctor of less than one year (who did indeed give me a referral/transfer to another female doctor in the same practice and from whom I already have an appointment for follow-up blood work in a few months) we discussed the culture of this county that she was gleefully leaving---see prior post.The doctor and I are both well educated and have opportunities that allow us to seek answers to our questions in this universe and to which we can sometimes add actual experiences. We also do not fear questioning our experiences.I had mentioned to this Doctor that upon our return from France my husband had been talking to one of the landscapers at the museum, a young man of about 35 with a pleasant disposition and a happy personality.  The young man asked my husband where we had gone.  When my husband told him \"France\" the young many looked up and then asked, \"France?  Where is that?\"Hubby had the good grace not to laugh or ridicule or disbelieve and said it was in Europe.  The young man said. \"Oh..,\"  and we will never know if any of this made any sense to him at all because the subject of the conversation changed.After relating this tale to my Doctor she responded with another more disturbing tale.  She had been in line in the local hardware store, and while waiting, struck up a conversation with another customer.  The customer asked where she lived.  She responded with the name of a small town in this area (let us say for this story's sake it was called Colorado).  The person she was talking to responded, \"Oh, that is across the bridge and by the military base.\"  She smiled and said, \"Yes.  Some people think I mean the state Colorado when I say that.\"The person said, \"The state?\"She turned to them,\"  Yes, you know, the STATE of Colorado, not the town.\"The person responded in all seriousness with,\" Oh, is there a state named Colorado?\"In both of these cases the persons in these stories were well dressed, bright eyed, spoke English without an accent, and would give no indication they were tremendously sheltered or unsophisticated or part of a dysfunctional education system.  Anecdotal stories like these help me understand accept why some people can take seriously a Presidential candidate such as Donald Trump while people in Europe shake their heads in wonder at us and our backwardness and wasted prosperity.  (I do not live in Appalachia or the Deep South, I live in a place much like where you live.)\"Public education does not exist for the benefit of students or the for the benefit of their parents.  It exists for the benefit of the social order.  We have discovered as a species that it is useful to have an educated population.  You do not need to be a student or have a child who is a student to benefit from public education.  Every second of every day of your life, you benefit from public education.  So let me explain why I like to pay taxes for schools, even though I don't personally have a kid in school:  It's because I don't like living in a country with a bunch of stupid people. \" John Green"},

I had a good doctor but I felt he had social issues.  He never asked me to take a single item of clothing off in the eight years that I saw him.

I live in a county where it is not easy to find a good doctor, a doctor who takes my insurance, a doctor who is still taking patients, and I also was hoping to find a woman doctor for a change.After a six month's search I found my female doctor (a geriatrician but that is OK) and have been seeing her for about a year. Prior to changing to her, I had heard a rumor she was leaving but I ignored that, and sure enough, last week was my last appointment with her. I asked her where she was going and she said to a medical practice up north affiliated with one of our Universities that maintained a better budget.  She then opened up to explain that this county, in which I live, (very conservative and never going to raise taxes) was just too backward for her.  Her heart patients had to drive almost two hours to the north to get decent care. She said that the elderly could not get decent care, elderly that were used to good health care, not poor elderly.  County health support was nil and she felt she could no longer do her job.  She also added that at least five doctors she knew were also job hunting outside the county further reducing our limited selection of doctors and putting strain on our one hospital.Our county once had a surplus budget years ago and continues to have a record number of wealthy residents with the highest of incomes, mostly retired, but some working.  What happened?  Is it that we have a large population of very poor and uneducated people.  Was it the recent recession from which it never recovered?  Was it because the state moved education retirement funding responsibilities to the counties without warning?  Is it because two of our seven elected county commissioners are owners of liquor stores rather than something reflective of a broader view of society?  Is it this conservative county's refusal to even consider raising taxes as we plunge in tighter budgets?Salaries of teachers have been flat for two years.  How long before the more mobile and smart ones also head to parts up north putting our children at risk?The county is in the process of supporting the development of a liquid natural gas facility within walking distance of many homes.  No other facility of this kind exists so close to where people live in the United States.  There were months of protests, but like Texas, these were overridden.  Do they think/hope this will save the day?  Maybe by blowing a number of taxpayers sky high?  I wait to see how our conservative liquor store owners work this out.  I am afraid it will be like sports stadiums that never create the job markets they promise while forcing the move of lower middle class home owners elsewhere. No, I would not want to be Commissioner.  Since I do not run, maybe I should not complain.  Since I do not have a clear cut solution, maybe I should just sit down.  But I would accept a ding in my taxes."},
{"title": "The Volunteer Snob", "date": "Monday, June 29, 2015", "text": "During the summer months I am involved in master gardener projects.  One project could involve several hours 4 days a week, but I have decided that as much as I love sharing my love of growing things, I do not want to spend that much time in other gardens!  I like doing nothing and running a house (which was always my secondary job) continues to take some time.  Hubby, on the other hand, seems to be driven to find something to do every single day.  I  think  it is much harder for men to retire and not have the responsibilities that they used to have.  I also was looking for a change in types of volunteering.  I wanted to maybe work more one on one with people.  I also wanted something more intellectual and less physical.  I am still searching.This past January I called our local office of Public Literacy to see if they needed teachers of English or reading  or similar.  They asked me to fill out a few forms, welcomed my skills, and set up an afternoon of training.  I went and one other woman was there for the training at the same time.  I learned that five of us had volunteered and they could only get two of us to come on this particular day and would train the other three the following week.  The training was easy and predictable.  The structure of the process for each class and data input from the lessons with a student would be more challenging, but something I would learn to do with time.I left them eager for a call to assist.  It is now 6 months later and I have not received even a follow-up call from that office.  It is not clear to me why no one needs assistance in my part of the county since I have been told they don't have any literacy volunteers down this way.  I realize that before the days of fall and less gardening start I am going to have to research once again for some volunteer work of an intellectual nature.  Both Hospice and Meals on Wheels need help, but neither of these are something I want to do.  Driving is something I hate and I do not think I am ready yet for  hospice work emotionally.   The museum wants someone for data entry...lonely and tedious work.I think I just realized that I am a bit of a volunteer snob."},

{"title": "All About the People -- Part III", "date": "Thursday, June 11, 2015", "text": "(First, Hattie asked a while back if all the photos from my French trip were mine and they are!   I am a little flattered.  As a copyright freak, I always clearly provide a link to photos that are taken from elsewhere or by someone else.)  ( As another prescript you will note that the demographics of these cruises is elderly, upper-middle class, white (except for two Asian women) and therefore, not as interesting as it could have been in other ways.)I did not get many pictures of the passengers on the ship because I am not one to store these away and try to remember who was who (or is that who was whom)?  There were close to 190 passengers on each of the two ships that I took.  I must have met about 40 on each due to guided tours we took together or eating at the same table.  (Photos included below are street shots of the French and tourists and no one I met.  You can tell the French, as they are in great shape!)We never talked politics or religion at meals, but with our country as politically divided as it is and with some groups making subjects more politically argumentative than they need to be, we found ourselves tiptoeing around subjects such as the environment, the weather, education, French protests, French labor, French socialism, French economy and even the global economy and  ship labor.  Yet we seemed to find that most of the passengers regardless of the state from which they hailed or the career they chose were in philosophical agreement with us, and thus we were able to be more honest in sharing and learning about others ideas for solutions to problems.  It was easy to be in agreement with the University of Wisconsin young (50s) professor who was devastated by his governor's cuts to education and then seeing the gov applying the same amount of money as in the cut to a new (unneeded) sports venue and as we later learned selling the public land valued at 9 million to the billionaire sports owners for one dollar.  At the next dinner it was even more interesting to find that the retired geologist, who had worked for decades for most of the big oil companies in the U.S., was very much in agreement with our ideas toward the environment and also our hope to move toward more sustainable energy.  He also had a hobby working archeological digs in the U.S. and encouraged us to contact the Forestry Service to volunteer on one of their expeditions!No one seems happy in this photo, neither the tourists in the background nor the Frenchman in the foreground.  I can see where this could lend itself to a story.We were energized by the 80-something British couple who had many grandchildren.  We loved that the male part of this duo was able to walk on all the tours after a double knee replacement surgery a few years ago.  There were at least two other gentlemen with canes that did not let some of the more challenging walking tours up the hills on cobbled streets slow them down. We enjoyed the couple from California.  The wife was originally from Georgia and we both loved the gentility of the south and the southern authors that we read and mutually enjoyed.  She was the gracious lady that made sure one of the passengers got a birthday card signed by many of us and was also a help with her command of the French language.It is the same everywhere.  Wouldn't it be funny if they were talking to each other?We enjoyed the Arizona couple who were not deep conservatives as we expected and fully on board with funding more science research and supporting socialized medicine.  Their son has been working on both an Ebola vaccine and a bird flu vaccine and now so close to success trying to get funding for both projects.  It was fun listening to how much work raising the boy was as a rebellious teenager and then evolving into such a success.  The other son, more conservative and less difficult to raise, was a success on Wall Street.  Proud parents they were.Must be a new mother model.We did find one gentleman our age that seemed to be on the verge of a heart attack in the middle of each walking tour.  His face was flushed and he sometimes seemed disoriented.  On the way back from a castle walk up a reasonable hill he actually collapsed just as he was going to go onto the gangplank of our ship.  They put him in a wheelchair and rolled him on in. Later on the second cruise he got lost and was left behind on one of the tours, missed the departure of our ship, and stayed two nights in a hotel in the French town before he contacted the Viking company and finally was reunited for the last two days.  We (the whole group) worried about him until we noticed he did a lot of drinking as well as taking pain pills on this trip.  He was wealthy, traveling alone, and we just shook our heads and felt sorry for the crew who were responsible.One of our last dinners was with an 80 something woman traveling with her unmarried 40 something daughter.  The daughter was beautiful and wore expensive clothes and jewelry to dinner each evening, good taste stuff, not the turn your head stuff.  She was in real estate in Seattle and seemed to be very successful.  She was strong and opinionated and plotting about her future and search for a marriage partner.  She was trying to date online, but the questions she posed to possible candidates were pretty incisive and like a scalpel cut to the heart of things.  I am sure she was way over the head of most candidates that approached her.  She also seemed concerned about some woman in Seattle who had been on welfare her whole life who wanted her wedding paid for by the government.  I had no real comment for this, as I felt very strongly no one was going to pay for this welfare wedding! I will let you add your own caption here.Her mother was also very strong and outspoken and with some quiet \"under her breath\" comments, made it clear that she did not like the service in the dining room.  (In all honesty they did get my order mixed up twice!)  I later learned from another Seattle resident that this elderly woman lived in an area of multimillion dollar apartments.  Clearly they both were used to much higher standards.  Yet, even though both were strong headed, they seemed ever so supportive and polite and loving to each other and disagreements were quickly brushed aside.In one of the conversations, the mother ever-so-lightly mentioned she had won a number of medals in the Olympics for Alpine skiing many years ago.  She did not brag, did not elaborate, but it fit into some part of the conversation, some yacht racing story, so she dropped it like a little diamond.  When I got home I researched Olympic medal winners and I am pretty sure that one of the biographies I came upon was her!  The photo was a dead ringer, although taken decades ago.  I now understood her so much better as she has always set high standards for herself and for others.This post is too lengthy so I have to leave out the details of the Nigerian brother, a business man, and the Nigerian sister, a nun, who were leaving our airport going back to Nigeria with the body of their father who had been honored with an Army military funeral in Washington, DC.  He had been a chaplain. There was the robust engineer with the terrific laugh and his quiet wife who used to teach school that told the story of how they met in the elevator of their apartment building.  There was also the funny lawyer who let his wife do all the arrangements on the cruise, the Jewish history teacher who was so soft and inspiring and such a fount of knowledge for us along with his Catholic wife who had been a high level administrator for some state education office, and I will even leave out the fun wine tastings/map readings with my sister and brother-in-law or my sister's too much wine conversation scolding the Brits (gently) for their support of the \"expensive\"' monarchy and the Brits explaining to her how the Queen pretty much gave more than she got.  Oh well, just shows I had a great \"people\" time.  But I do love people and their stories."},
{"title": "It Is All About the Stories--People Part II", "date": "Wednesday, June 10, 2015", "text": "Before I travel I tend to collect a few books of fiction and non-fiction on the place I am going to visit.  I involve myself in the idiomatic expressions, the geography that molded the history of the country, the foods that are most traditional and I try to see what makes the people laugh.  I read one Gertrude Stein book on the people of Paris, but did not find it enlightening.  She refuses to use commas, which can be a distraction for someone, like me, that uses commas like salt.  I also read the novel \"The Paris Architect\" which I mentioned in a prior post.  It is a fictional account of two very different French sisters that found themselves fighting the Nazis from within their own limited world of that time.Stop for a minute and think back to when you were 18 years old.  Imagine waking up to a war in your country.  Imagine your father leaving to fight that war and not seeing him for 9 years.  Imagine blackouts, bombings and ration cards.  This prologue leads me to writing about the people one meets on a cruise.One of the best experiences on these cruises is the open table where you eat breakfast, lunch and dinner with other passengers.  You can avoid people to some extent, but the true pleasure is meeting and talking to people who have lived very interesting, long lives and are strong survivors of those lives and are in a great mood because they are on a travel vacation!  (Even an introvert like me gets sucked into the small talk.)This lady wearing the red scarf above was on the cruise.  She was always dressed to the nines.  Earrings, several bracelets, finely knit sweaters, etc.  She stood about five feet tall and was full of energy and enthusiasm.  She was 80-something and traveling alone. She was also very religious as I saw the time she almost missed the bus because she forgot her audio guide machine she crossed herself while rushing back to her cabin. One evening as we sat at one of the round tables she asked to join us for dinner.  Oddly I had not noticed her on this trip until this time.  Her accent was unusual and while she spoke clearly I had to lean in carefully to understand her.  Asking enough questions I slowly got her life story.She had owned and helped run a cattle ranch in Ohio.  She even raised meat for the Cincinnati Zoo.  She talked about the price of beef on the hoof and the hard work ranching entailed.  When I asked where she was from originally she said France!  (I thought about it and realized that her accent was a version of French, but after decades in the U.S., not easily identifiable.)She smiled and said that she had fallen in love with a U.S. soldier when just a teenager in France during WWII.  She and her mother and sister were trying to survive while her father had gone to fight the war and they feared he had become a POW.  She married the U.S. soldier while in France and lived in France with her mother and the soldier where he was stationed for several years.  Late one evening there was a knock at her door.  Although the Germans had fled and the war was almost over, she and her mother were afraid to open the door.  Then they recognized the voice.  It was her father!  They had not seen or heard from him for nine years.  She said she almost did not recognize him when she opened the door as he had lost so much weight and was so bruised and weak.  I cannot imagine the emotional reunion, repeated many times across Europe.Later when her husband was called back she moved with him to the U.S. only to find he was not the man she thought.  He was cruel and demanding and she eventually divorced.  Perhaps the war had changed him more than they both knew until he was back home.  (I did not know at the time she told this story that she was Catholic, but I should have expected as she was French.)  She tells of meeting  another soldier whom she marries and they went on to Ohio to ranching and that is where she spent the rest of the decades of her life. (A lot of the best story of her life is unquestionably during these times.)  She was most certainly a survivor, one for whom the twists and turns of life were just a dance move to be mastered.   She is now a widow and said that, at the end of the cruise, she was going to visit her married sister who still lived in France.  On these two cruises we met many people of interest and perhaps in the next post I will touch on a few more."},

This sweet lady worked behind the desk and we later found she was married to the Chef, who himself was a handful!  Here is her husband guiding us through an oyster tasting.Viking is based in Basil and handles 40 river vessels and 2,000 staff.  They are now adding ocean vessels to the mix (I will most likely never take one of those as I hate big cruise ships). I do know that the upper level staff work about 3 months on and then 2 or 3 weeks off.  They are on 24 hour call, so eventually need such a break.  I am guessing it is unpaid leave?  But I do not know.  Higher level staff are paid decent wages, it is those that work in the bowels of the ship, which are of concern to us all.Think about having a job where you must be polite to stupid elderly Americans that forget what you told them, do not read their brochure and booklets carefully, assume they can walk cobbled streets and in some cases (a future post) are privileged enough to feel that staff should behave as personal servants expecting perfection and in other cases (perhaps a future post) drink too much and miss the boat.  These staff earn it!During one of our mooring experiences I saw the woman crew member rushing off and decided to follow and get pictures.  These are for Mage who loves the operations on ships.  This gal (no spring chicken) tried twice to throw the bow line over the dock pipe without a using any pole.  Photos taken from inside the terrace room windows!She threw twice and failed to capture both side hooks on the mooring bollard.  Immediately the big \"guy\" shows up to assist.  They seemed to be speaking in German.  He took the rope from her with an air of confidence.I am sure he thought he was going to do it better than she, but after four failed attempts he looked up and smiled at me and I politely quit taking photos and went back to my wine.  We must have eventually gotten docked correctly as we soon disembarked for our afternoon tour.Next a post on other people."},

How about a sad and thought-provoking experience to share and one of the primary reasons we chose this particular cruise?  The beaches of Normandy.  Our cruise company took us to the American cemetery early one day before the crowds, and held a small ceremony playing both the U.S. national anthem (Brits and Canadians had a separate tour) and Taps and gave us each a rose to place on any grave we wished among the 9,387 crosses that stood starkly against the green.  Absolutely no one was dry eyed that time and very few could sing the anthem!  So many brave young men who gave their lives to save our lives from a wave of horror that spread across Europe.  My father was in North Africa a few weeks after this invasion and was one of those moving up through Italy sweeping the Nazis back.  It was only the luck of the draw that he lived to come home and share in the freedom that he and others had fought for.The veterans were called to come to the front so that we could honor their service.  Yes, we were all the old folks.  Our French guide thanked us for fighting to free his country and hubby later went up to thank him for his countrymen and their role in ensuring our revolution's success.liberty equality fraternityJust a few yards away were the bodies of so many souls and a debt we can only repay by continuing to make sure our freedoms are safe.  The names of 1,557 Americans who lost their lives in the Normandy campaign but could not be located and/or identified are inscribed on the walls of a semicircular garden at the east side of the memorial.We also stopped at the German bunkers where Naziis had watched the landing and even delayed their response waiting for orders from a higher command.Above is the Statue Les Braves.  \"The Wings of Hope ---So that the spirit which carried these men on 6th June 1944, continues to inspire us, reminding us that together it is always possible to change the future.  Rise of Freedom ---So that the example of those who rose up against barbarity, helps us remain standing strong against all forms on inhumanity.  The Wings of Fraternity---So that the surge of brotherhood always reminds of our responsibility towards others as well as ourselves.\"And that event in history was today June 6 back in 1944."},
{"title": "Once a Limit of 122 Feet", "date": "Friday, June 05, 2015", "text": "Prior to my trip to France I read The Paris Architect which was a novel more about WWII and the Nazis in Paris and how an architect handled that time and less about architecture in itself.  It was a good read, if not a great read.  But it helped me realize how important architecture was to the Parisians.According to one article that I read, French architecture is a gradual movement touching on all eras:  Roman, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Rocco, Neo-Classical, Empire, Art Nouveau, Art Deco, Modern, Post-Modern, and Contemporary Architecture.  From my quick view of Paris and the rest of the country, this was certainly true. Paris began as a Roman city called Lutetia.  But this architecture, while found in other places in France, was pretty much destroyed in Paris as the Roman empire fell.  The medieval period was chaos with no plan for design in the city.  Then came the revival of Paris in the Renaissance period with the introduction of Italian architecture.  Much was done under Henry IV who some say was the earliest town planner.  It was not until the 1600s that Paris began to devise its own classical style with a hint of romanticism.  If I had time and more money I would spend months in Paris just studying the architecture.One of my readers asked about high rise structures in the capital.  The high rise shown in one of my prior photos is the Tour Montparnasse,  built over 40 years ago, and most agree that it is the most hated building in Paris.  It is ugly, bold, and out of place.  A 2008 international poll named it the world's second ugliest building.  \"planned developments are pushing up to levels where they will be visible across large sections of the city. The Norman Foster and Partners-designed Hermitage Plaza, expected to be completed in 2019, will consist of twin towers taller than London’s Shard, currently Europe’s tallest building, but just shorter than the Eiffel Tower. A mixed development combining offices and shops with apartments, its Russian developer says it will resolve what he sees as Paris's lack of luxury property compared to New York and Miami.\"  Times are changing and Paris is beginning to allow high rises into the city, especially in places where the structures are becoming ugly in age.  It is a slippery slope in my opinion, but money drives everything.The foreground of this historic area in the photo above does leave something to be desired in terms of architecture. \" Paris currently has office vacancy rates of over 7 percent, as companies reject high rent levels in the city core to relocate farther out in the Paris region. What Paris needs more of may not be taller, shinier spaces to rent out but customers for vacant spaces that already exist, plus improved transport links to get to them (La Défense’s metro and train links aren’t the best).\"And, below, where our boat was docked, right next to a new shopping center and yet just a few blocks from the Eiffel Tower...how convenient."},

(Click on photos for a closer experience.)I used to think 1950's culture and Audrey Hepburn romances, etc. when I saw photos of this structure.The reality is tired and bored guards waiting to go through our stuff, but a very festive mood among the crowd including one rather portly teenage French boy dressed in black slacks, white shirt, beret and fake mustache with artistic easel in hand---but I failed to get a photo. \"After Gustave Eiffel experiments in the field of meteorology, he began to look at the effects of wind and air resistance, the science that would later be termed aerodynamics, which has become a large part of both military and commercial aviation as well as rocket technology.

He watched his biggest project to date go up like a gigantic work of Lego: 18,038 pieces of iron were fitted together with 2.5 million rivets by more than 100 workmen who functioned almost like acrobats and stuntmen. Not one man lost his life during the construction.\"Long lines waited ahead to ride the last elevator to the top if you purchased the more expensive ticket which we did....But what a view!!   And it reminds me, as it should, of Washington D.C.Above you can see the Left and Right banks of the Seine.  Do not ask me which was which.  The river is not very clean in appearance, but there were no smells.  We were high enough to see the curve of the earth.With binoculars you could watch a soccer game, although why so many are on the field I do not know!The boat in the photo below moving in the center was the size of our cruise vessel and you can see how sometimes the height of the river closes the cruises that cannot pass under bridges and you must go by bus.And, as in any good tourist place, there are many wanting to take your money in exchange for souvenirs.  These folks appeared to be from North Africa...Algerians?This was one of my favorite views as I love that butt!!  Yes, I am getting weird in my old age.And, of course one must have a romantic photo.  A quick and data filled video on the construction of this tower can be found at this link that follows next.  (http://www.history.com/topics/eiffel-tower)"},

{"title": "The Tropical Season", "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2015", "text": "I am currently away on a trip in Europe as all of my blog fans know.  Who knows what weather I am experiencingas this was pre-written.  I left the U.S. during concerns of long drought that have impacted how people shower,  how people garden, how  farmers grow crops...to say nothing of how factories may have to change the way they do business in California... which is facing the result of years of severe drought.  During the same week friends of mine were faced with huge rains flooding dry river beds and closing roads followed by 6 to 12 inches of snowfall in Colorado!  In the middle of the country entire neighborhoods and infrastructures were damaged by huge hail and terrifying tornadoes for days, not just one storm front, and there were deaths.  Here in my neck of the woods we hunkered down for the remnants of a tropical storm that had come ashore south of us, but got no significant weather as I packed.  (And this is just in my country!)So, I repeat, who knows what weather I may be facing on my river cruise?This is called global climate change---which is really warming.  You know how weather seems more moderate (less cold or less hot) nearer the ocean?  That is because the ocean takes up the heat of a warm season and hangs on to it as you enter fall.  This means those coastal folks have a slower change than the middle of the country where it gets very hot or very cold overnight.  Well, corals are dying, ocean animals are dying, and energy release is greater because our ocean has taken up all the heat from the surface of the earth that it can stand and it now has to release it back into the atmosphere in the form of those el Nino events which create dramatic storms.Some Congressmen make fun of climate change by showing how ice cubes melt in a glass of water with no overflow (i.e. ocean rise) when all the ice melts, therefore how can the ocean rise?  Even if this very stupid analogy were accurate, it does not explain how the entire planet will change when all the \"ice\" melts and the cold goes away.  And glaciers are melting and each month is warmer than the last.  But this is happening at a very \"slow\" paces and not like a disaster movie, so most Americans do not believe it.Trophic levels (food webs) at the lowest end are breaking down as temperatures change.  Grab a knit shawl and take scissors and cut through the edges in places and wear it every day and wash it every evening and you will see how fast it unravels.  This is what is happening to our food chain.  Huge holes are appearing which are threatening life of all kinds as their food disappears.  (Not just due to climate change, but add in a few toxins/chemicals/hormones and you have a stew of amazing deathly proportion.)The lands of the haves and have nots are going to be even more defined in the decades ahead and the anger of various groups (religious/political) as they try to survive probably means greater wars (local/global).  I apologize for not doing enough on my part to advocate for a better world for my grandchildren.  Recycling, using less power, using fewer resources was hardly enough.  Taking large carbon footprint trips is certainly not helping. And, oddly enough I thought the challenges were going to be because of overpopulation by mankind years ago, which is no longer the case !!"},

On the day that we visited a farm, I see this big, hairy, galumphy, dedicated, muddy pawed animal in the photo above and cannot resist calling him over for a good ear scratch.  This is a working dog, but even he is not above a visit from an admirer.   I forget all the hair, dust, slobber and sand that they bring into the house.  I forget the body scratching in the middle of the night that jangles the tags that wake me up.  I forget almost tripping over them on my way to the bathroom in the dark.  I forget the water spills from the water dish next to the kitchen counter that appear in a line across the floor and the bits of stray kibble under the cabinets.  I forget the endless hours of puppy raising that one must go through at the very beginning...almost. We travel way too much to have a dog (no neighbors we know well enough to help) (currently in France now).   There is a new wrench in the canine discussion...ticks.  Our ticks in these woods carry all three of the major diseases.  Both of my neighbors have gotten the two least known illnesses and many years ago I had a meet-up with Lyme, the third and most well known.   There is now a new tick borne illness in some Southern states that is more lethal than all three above and that has killed some people!   I do wonder if we will ever get a dog....so sad.  For now it is going to be relegated to these farm visits, I guess."},

{"title": "Getting Out of the Jungle Alive", "date": "Wednesday, May 06, 2015", "text": "Hubby got an email from an old college roommate a while back, someone he had not seen or communicated with for over 50 years!  The roommate had lived with him and some other college friends for only one semester.  Hubby needed someone to help with rent and after meeting him at the local laundry place and finding he (lets us call him Rodney) needed a place to stay, invited him to join them.Hubby is super friendly and rarely thinks to the future results of certain decisions.  The reason that Rodney had no place to stay became immediately evident in that he was demanding, annoying, insecure and needy.  Hubby and the other roommates spent most of the semester dodging him, although knowing my husband, he was probably very kind and helpful at times.  At the end of the year Rodney went back to his home town to finish college and went on to get his PhD in entomology.On this week Rodney was delivering some insect specimens to the city museum and wanted to stop by on a free day to visit us.  I suggested to hubby that we eat out so that I could disappear on the boardwalk if I found the meet-up too intense or annoying.Rodney arrived, a short and chunky man, wearing glasses, a white mustache and a healthy head of white hair.  Within minutes of inviting Rodney to sit on our deck and putting out some cold Thai tea he began to pour out his life-story.  Explaining that during his time at university he was in a terrible mental state.  He explained that he had been abused as a child, his father demanding he become a concert pianist and he wanting to play basketball instead (which he explained he did very well in spite of his height), being depressed throughout most of his life, getting married twice, divorced once, estranged from his biological son, but very close to his step-son and two grandchildren, having faced death last year during surgery contracting a hospital infection and being put in a 6 week coma, going through years of mental therapy and still belonging to an international therapy group, becoming a world-renown insect expert on a specific group of insects and now facing retirement.This was all before we went out to lunch!   During lunch he talked about his work (really somewhat fascinating since I like science), his hatred of state bureaucracies and his feeling we are leaving our children a world in a disastrous state with the extinction of species every year.  He did give us time to talk every once in a while.Upon getting home and completing a short tour of the yard and riverside and some photo taking, it still took a couple of hours to get him out the door, into his car and on the way back to his hotel.  I printed out a scan of a map, since he was a bit of a Luddite when it came to phone GPS help and had gotten lost on the way down.  (He seemed to find that when he stopped to ask for directions on the trip down, everyone working at the quick stop stores seemed to have difficulty getting pants on correctly each day, therefore having no clue how to get around the area...his interpretation.)I knew a young man in high school who might have been much like Rodney, although a different personality, painfully shy and physically unattractive.  He was a very odd duck, but well accepted in our small town which was somewhat like a big farm family.  When he went on to college, he committed suicide his first year as I am sure he faced extreme loneliness if not worse.  I remember thinking about him for years later and this visit brought up that memory, reminding me that the world turns for us all and we never know how important, positive or negative, the energy we might contribute to someone's life."},

{"title": "Contrast and Maybe a Little Whiplash", "date": "Friday, May 01, 2015", "text": "Baltimore Harbor, March 2015Ellen wrote a great post about the difference between poverty or oppression and poverty AND oppression all stimulated by the current issues in one of my favorite love/hate cities, Baltimore.  While I knew this, I must admit I never really thought about it as carefully as I should have.  But to jerk me around and muddy the clarity, this little incident below happened yesterday.I was shopping for clothes for my upcoming France trip.  I still flinch when I write something like this as it seems like bragging.  Anyway, I wanted some dressier slacks or jeans and after hitting Bloomingdale's where the jeans started at $160.00 I moved on to another store.  I could have afforded these, but I would have been sick with regret every time I put them on.I next went to Lord and Taylor for some type of cruise-wear and prices were pretty much the same, so I put out $60 for some diaphanous top that will both hide my fat waist and be cool on warmer afternoons.  Almost everything I looked at and much of what I bought was made in another country, but I managed to find a couple of pairs of Capri pants and another top.While waiting to check out, hubby sat on a bench behind and against some dresses working his email on his phone.  There was a well-dressed 40-something black woman sitting next to him.  She was talking in a clear but not loud voice to the register clerk (the one I was waiting for as well) about how she was a \"very busy\" person and needed to get her tailored items and could NOT wait any longer.  The clerk (also dark-skinned but with an accent from the middle-East) was explaining that she worked in cosmetics and did not know where the clothing clerk was or where tailored items were kept for pick-up.  She said she would call the manager and headed back to the counter.\"I just don't have time for this, I am a Doctor.\"  The black woman called after her.I stood waiting until the floor manager was summoned by phone and then the clerk proceeded to check out my items.  While this was being done, the store manager, also black, came up and was directed to the lady who once again, looking up from her phone, explained how precious her time was.  He hurried off to find her items.After a somewhat convoluted process (the more expensive stores have the worst check-out procedures as there is some stupid security tag on every item) I got my items paid for and turned back to hubby.The black Doctor smiled at me and once again apologized (to us this time) for being so demanding, but her time was precious.  I commiserated and then added something about how there were too few store clerks and the check-out process was too complicated.  I explained we lived an hour and a half away and tried to complete all our shopping on those rare afternoons two or three times a year.As I gathered up the bags at my husband's feet and hubby shut down his phone, the Doctor proceeded to ask where we were from and we told her and she said she 'loved' that area and then mentioned the suburb outside the city where she lived and dropped the name of the hospital where she practiced medicine.  \"I am a Doctor.\"This all took an even weirder turn when she told us it was much better shopping at Nordstrom because they gave you 'points' that you could apply to purchases, or on your bill, or online shopping.  She felt it was much better to buy from them and then proceeded to show us an email she just got from Nordstrom where she had purchased some black HIGH heels recently and wanted to know if they had them in red.  The store sent a picture of the red shoes but explained they were .5 inches shorter and as she showed us the picture comparing the two types of HIGH heels she proceeded to explain that by spending $1,000 on this first pair and another $1,000 on the second pair she would get $100 in points to apply to her account!  I bit my tongue, smiled and wished her luck.  (The only things I own at that price point are appliances.)She wished us a safe drive back home as we also wished her in turn.(What goes around, comes around...or I have no idea what I am trying to say in writing this post.  But to prove that it is far more complicated than we can every know...here is an article from another African-American doctor.)"},
{"title": "My Annoying, Unfocused and Lovable FB Friends", "date": "Monday, April 27, 2015", "text": "Do you remember the days when someone would be surprised that you were on Facebook and that you sent a message wanting to friend them?  If you had gray hair, older children, and/or an established career or were retired, you were joining the college (young adults) kids hangout.  You had entered their little social club and they were not sure that, as much as they love/like you, they wanted to let you into their fun and \"edgy\" lives.  You were an archaic part of the world, part of the more established and boring social world and you would water down their happy little group!No?  You have forgotten?Well I can remember a 20-something being amazed in comments on FB to my son that I, my son's Mom, was on FB and wanted to 'friend' him!  My son did not respond because he was probably crying in the bedroom of his apartment.  I am an in-your-face snarky kind of mom, so he knew this could be the end of his social life as he knew it.   Well, as we all know, 20-somethings are now closer to their 40's than their 20's and have families of their own whom they worry about allowing getting a FB account in the immediate future.  FB has become less edgy and less young and more like the rest of the social world full of people wanting your money, your ID, your time and in some cases your soul. I still like FB.  I have some great friends on FB and am able to keep in touch a little better with long lost friends and far away relatives and to actually see some great images after I wade through all the memes and useless personality tests and directed ads. Still I have \"those\" friends on FB who are gentle and very social souls and whom I view with some condescending superiority (I'm sorry).  They post endless posters of sunsets or kittens with uplifting quotes, photos of baby animals, photos of wounded veterans they do not know, photos of animals in shelters, photos of missing teenagers they do not know.  Others find it necessary to post photos of their latest meal, photos of their latest manicure, their latest haircut, and of course, those photos at the bar with friends celebrating endless birthdays and get-togethers.  (Maybe I am jealous that I do not get out more...not.) I have friends, like me, who post news from Public Broadcasting sites, \"interesting\" arguments on political issues, and interesting studies found about demographics or psychology or this insane Congress and its add-ons to bills, and volunteer group items.   AND I post endless photos that I am addicted to sharing.  I also do communicate with friends in my comments.  Of course, none of this is annoying to MY friends. FB has changed in that members can now create groups and post certain things to only those groups, so some folks (son?) can now keep me out of a certain part of their life.  Oh well, it worked for a while and while it has competition with other sites, I will still hang out there for a short while in the morning and late afternoon.

{"title": "Spring Silliness", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2015", "text": "Did you read about the canoe trip on my other blog?  Not yet?  Go there and then come back here for the after party....Did you read it?  OK. I had to set up this story with the afternoon canoe post you just perused so you can see that I was not on Prozac...just some Tequila, too much sun, hungriness, and good spring weather.  Yes, it was a LARGE Margharita, but in my defense they only listed LARGE and EXTRA LARGE on the menu and in further defense I actually drank only 75% of it.Well, as elderly people who are off schedule and eating dinner later than usual and who combine that dinner with a cocktail (only me), we easily slid into super relaxed mode after the end of an afternoon in the spring sunshine.  Hubby guessed that we had paddled about 3 miles, which is not a huge amount, but proves we did lots of poking about.I was dressed in ratty old denim jeans and a denim shirt that had also seen better paddling days.  I had a royal blue Stephen Colbert duck bill cap on my head (in this very conservative county) which mashed my short hair cut and gave me a more boyish/mannish look than I ever wanted.  My face was sunburned and it was shiny from sun-tan lotion.  I just write this, because I am vane enough to state I rarely go out to dinner looking like this and I was self-conscious on top of being tired.   We ordered our drinks and having been together all afternoon we became silent and began people watching from our window at the restaurant. While waiting for the guacamole to arrive, I saw a sleek convertible pulling into the parking lot.  There were three people who emerged, an elderly man and woman and one younger woman.  Very conscious of how others were dressing on this beautiful spring evening, I realized I had even forgotten to bring a brush to fix my hair when I removed my baseball cap, so I must have looked like a very lost soul.  Hubby retreated to the restroom while I watched the two woman wearing long flowing skirts and looking so summery nice.  The younger woman was helping them carefully put up the convertible top and returning some new plastic cover to the trunk of the car.  As they shut the car trunk the younger woman reach up to loosen her hair from a tight bun which had held her hair neatly for the windy top down drive.  As she released the pins, silky hair flowed in a wave of the most beautiful brown and shiny sweep that fell across her bare shoulders.  Ummm!  I was feeling even mousier as I took another sip of my Margarita.When hubby returned from the restroom I made note of the fancy convertible in navy blue and brown to him.  We think the car was an AUDI, but not sure.  I pointed out the lovely lady as they were seated at a table nearby.  Hubby nodded and then said there was a much nicer car catching his eye, but it was behind a more closely parked car and I could not see it from where I sat.  I saw just a bit of the bright yellow hood and silver hub cap.We continued to people watch, as two young teenage girls with actual flower crowns in their hair entered with their parents.  Just before our entree arrived hubby commented several times again on the fancy yellow car.  I suggested as our meal ended that we go out that way and look at the car.  By then I was feeling a bit fuzzy from the drink and mentioned that we could give customers a laugh as they saw us walking around and around the building thinking we were looking for our car and forgotten where we parked our car---which was on the exact opposite side of the building from this yellow car.  Would they shake their heads at two old people walking in circles...or would they even notice?  Still hubby wanted me to be able to see the car so after we paid the bill we took a right instead of a left at the front door.A woman in her late 40's with a man in his 60's followed closely behind us as we exited and I suddenly became self-conscious once again of not actually walking to our car.  Being in a silly mood as well, I turned as I held the door open for the woman and said that we were not parked on this side of the restaurant and we had not lost our car!  We KNEW that it was parked on the other side of this building, but wanted to check out a car parked on this side.  She smiled (patiently?) as she held the door for her companion.\"Oh, I get distracted by cars as well,\" she said and winked at her companion. I went on to explain it was fancy yellow car.She put her hand on my shoulder and said, \"You know, yellow is my favorite color.\"I laughed. We turned the corner of the building and I pointed out the car at the end of the row.  She smiled again and said \"That is my car.  I like to check it out every once in a while as well!\"\"Your car?\" hubby and I said together.\"Really.\" she smiled.\"Well, we were admiring it through the window during our dinner,\" Hubby replied.\"I like to look at it through the window when I eat dinner also!\"  she laughed.\"What brand is it?\" I asked stupidly.  I know nothing about cars and neither my husband nor I would ever crave such a status symbol, but we were both in a silly mood on this evening...obviously.\"It is mustang.\"  she smiled.  Her male companion could barely contain himself as he watched our surprise at her having such fun with us.  She had read us from the beginning, I guess, and knew exactly where we were headed at the outset.  Maybe this often happened to her?Yes, it was their car as we saw them drive past us out onto the highway and we must have made their day.  (The only thing I regretted later is not having children or grandchildren around so that I could have embarrassed them.)"},
{"title": "Found It!", "date": "Saturday, April 18, 2015", "text": "Shortly after posting the prior post I found a plastic shoe-box-size container that I had moved all of my seeds into sitting on the top shelf of my closet way up in the dark with the spider webs and dust to keep it company.  I opened it, noted most of the seeds are now years old, went outside and scattered a bunch of seeds everywhere in my wildflower bed and raked them in gently and watered.  Keeping my fingers crossed.I then planted small potting containers of sunflower seeds as these get eaten by critters before they get a head start.  Some of the sunflowers we might give away at one of the garden events.  All of this stuff is now going into the ground here and there and anywhere, because the seeds are probably not viable.  I certainly do not need to save them.  I have two packets of Forget-Me-Nots and most people know that these are hard to kill even with time.I have resolved to empty this box and start fresh this fall.We are now planning some more weeding and then maybe a sunset canoe trip from a nearby woodland park boat ramp.  I will, of course, take the camera, and if I see anything worthwhile, I will share."},

The only downer is that few people ate my soybean salad.   I always try to bring something vegan and healthy, but the chile, pulled pork, baked beans, cakes and pies all seemed to be the favorites, as usual.  Next year I am bringing fudge---or some really decadent pie.  Screw it!I spent today looking for my file container of seeds.  I keep in storage folders and plastic vials with seeds collected from last year and new packets from the seed exchange a while back.  I opened the portable carrier that was labeled \"Seeds and Plants\" and not a single seed was inside!  All my notes and plant information and plant stakes were there...but not a single packet or container of seeds?  I know that I cleaned out the old seeds last year, but am totally lost about where I put the new stuff that I got from the seed exchange.  I am also missing a batch of plastic vials that may or may not have seeds?I looked into another file carrier that had a lot of travel brochures, maps, notes, etc.  AND another carrier that has some older files.  As an elder it is easy for me to get distracted, so, I spent the better part of the day sorting through this old stuff.  I actually had old pay statements and evaluation reviews from my last job!  What a fun time I had shredding those files for the compost pile in the garden!  I threw away a number of items that were dated regarding national and state parks and hotels we had visited, saved some of the old stuff from trips (Jamaica, Ireland) as memories, and made newly labeled file folders for it all.  What a good girl am I.  Still I cannot find my seeds!I was going out tonight for dinner and then maybe buy some seeds, but I gave in and have made mole' chicken, friend rice and leftover green beans and we will stay at home. We have never seen House of Cards (the American version) and maybe we will watch two episodes of that.   Hubby is now water spraying the oyster flats of their winter growth and he will be both dirty and exhausted upon his return.  (Maybe he will remember to bring up some oysters for tomorrow's dinner!)  Thus dinner should be waiting for him...not a shower and trip to our local restaurant.Oh, our osprey (Fred and Ethel) are having a rather risque old time and I will try to remember to post something about that on the next blog.  They returned close to St. Patrick's Day as they always do.  The photo below is not good as it was taken through a window on a rainy day...but you can see how drenched the poor thing was."},
{"title": "Hypocricy", "date": "Tuesday, April 14, 2015", "text": "I do not know why age and aging are more on my mind these days.  April is spring and renewal and getting to start new things.  Yet, I am drawn to articles about aging, loss of faculties, changes in outlook and reduction in activities, and even poetry on dying.  Not in a depressing way, but in a thoughtful and curious way. It does not help that every month or so I notice some new mark on aging in my body or my ability to do things.  I can still put on my pants standing up and I can still get up off the floor without too much difficulty...both actions which I hold close and dear as hallmarks of good health.As a result of this gloomier mood, I have been more prone to avoid getting together with others unless they are family.  I used to be this way when I was middle-aged (decades ago), but it was just a light mood.  Now when I have a meeting to go to, as I do this evening, I really want to just stay home and curl up with a good book or TV British mystery and some hot tea.  The meeting is a \"meet-and greet\" for new members and almost everyone that shows up is a wonderful person!  We all have the same interests anyway! Yet, I am not eager to be in welcoming mode and small talk mode and eating a buffet of homemade goodies, for some reason.  It all seems like taking a 5 mile walk in the heat of the day.  I can do it; I know it is good for me; but I do not want to.I wonder if this is a natural process as we age, because we have less energy and are less eager to think quickly.  I mean, if you looked at me, you would not see someone doddering or slow.  You might actually think that I look fairly good for my age and be impressed that I have many interests.  But maybe this process is to avoid being exposed to illness, avoiding energy draining talk, and preparing us for a time when we will naturally be less active and less conversational?  Of course, there are many elderly, like my husband, who live for \"meet and greets\" and who will hold audience with many at his deathbed.Oddly enough, I just wrote on someone's blog that they should look forward to the challenges of getting out and about and not be so withdrawn when they complained of  avoiding going out to dinner with loved ones...little hypocrite that I am.(I think I figured out how to change the font size in html with this template..not too old.)"},

{"title": "Being Honest(?) With Myself", "date": "Tuesday, April 07, 2015", "text": "My blog is anonymous and one of the reasons for that is this odd post below where I am sticking my neck out. I remember a lecture about prejudice that I attended many years ago when I was \"probably\" in college.   A black man gave the lecture and one of the very first questions he asked was \"Who in the room was racially prejudiced?\"  A very few tentatively raised their hands before I cold even get the question around in my mind.  Then he went on to say that every single person in the room was prejudiced to some degree because of their background and experiences.  He included both black and white people in the room.  This was a new concept to me at that time; remember this was almost 50 years ago and I was very young and naive, which brings me to this past weekend.Easter Sunday was a day my daughter had scheduled for one of her son's birthdays.  Her other son's birthday party was on the Saturday!  They were both born close to Easter.Daughter selected a museum in Baltimore for the little guy and allowed him to invite his closest friend from preschool. Since my grandson had mentioned this friend a number of times, I was glad to have the opportunity to meet him.  The friend's family came as well...parents and their 2-year-old daughter.  We ate at a seafood chain restaurant and then spent time in the museum designed just for children.  Exhausting for us old types, but lots of fun as well with all the unusual physical activities. It was not until well into the afternoon that I realized I had been very careful of my behavior (internally) for most of the day.  The mother of this family was black and the father was white.  I realized that each time I approached their young boy to help or distract in an activity I was conscious of trying to be as 'politically correct' as possible.  Stupid and odd on my part, but I subconsciously kept making sure my actions were balanced and fair and \"liberal\" between the two four-year-old boys.  I did not want a hint of accidental prejudice to show!  I did not want to make some mistake.  This is a really odd feeling and I have no idea where it came from.  (No bleeding heart liberal comments please!)I am not prejudiced.  At least I think (hope) I am not.  Then why was I so conscious of  the possibility of making a mistake?  I will honestly admit in my little old lady white world these days, unlike my younger years, I am not around black children very often.  I have a few adult black acquaintances at meetings, etc., but my life is so white bread. ( I am trying to change that with some new volunteer work which is not evolving as I hoped..not even getting off the ground.) Am I too old for words?  Or am I just overly sensitive?  Am I a relic of the older generation that millennial types try to ignore??  Am I prejudiced and just don't know it?  If you are black, do you sometimes go through this when you are around white kids or is that too dumb a question?One fact, which is undeniable and which I really do not fear, is that my world is becoming far more plural each day."},
{"title": "Please Tell Me This is Over", "date": "Sunday, April 05, 2015", "text": "You know how they say that things come in threes?  I am beginning to think they come in 33s.  Our nightmare began when we left for Florida to escape winter last month.  On the way out the door Hubby noticed that the keys to our other car were hanging on the key rack just inside the garage door.  He thought it would be prudent to move these elsewhere in case someone did break into the house.  The keys sitting there would give them easy access to stealing the car.  I was busy loading stuff into the other car and said \"ok\" casually over my shoulder on the way out the door.Upon our return almost three weeks later, Hubby comes up to me and asks where he hid the keys!  I explained that I did not even see which room he went back into as I was loading the car.  Well, it is now almost a month later and while we have torn the house apart we have not found this second set of keys which will take $500 to replace!The week after our return hubby's car starts acting up in that it refuses to lock.  The lock on this car was an add-on many years ago when we lived in the apartment and the landlord's son tried to break into the car destroying the lock.  We got a brand new system that worked (somewhat) for years.  Last year we replaced both keys to the tune of several hundred dollars, and now, this year, once again we had a key problem.  Hubby took the car up to a company that fixes locks in cars and they had to replace the entire system (computer chip and all) and we now have two NEW keys for that car!  I would tell you how much it cost,but hubby won't tell me!Yesterday, after driving hubby to the town up north to pick up his newly re-configured car, I came home and went to unlock the garage door to the house  It is a bit tricky and you have to remember to always turn it to the left and NEVER to the right or the key sticks and you can neither unlock nor get your get back out.  Well, I was hungry, had to go to the bathroom, etc. and completely turned the key the wrong way and was stuck!We have a hidden key around the back of the house at the patio door and I hurriedly headed in that direction down the hill toward the river side of the house and pulled the key out of its hiding place and put it into the french door lock and TA DA...it also stuck and would not turn or unlock the patio door, no matter how much I jigged or jagged!  I was seriously thinking of going to pee in the trees but walked once more back up to the garage and fiddled with that door again and luckily it broke free of its stasis and I got it unlocked and went inside!Is there some universal key god that is punishing me for some sin I have committed this year?  And what can I do to repent and end this expensive nightmare?  You may remember in a prior post that I have been trying to hire someone to fix the front door latch as well since the front door fails to close correctly and therefore makes it hard to turn the deadbolt with that key.  There must be some bad spell about keeping things in or keeping them out that has been cast my way. (Oh, I almost left out that they lost hubby's luggage (over 4 days and waiting) on his trip to the tiny island school in the Caribbean last week where there were NO stores and where he had only one pair of underwear.  I also almost forgot to throw into this mess that the breaker outlet failed in the basement for on our chest freezer resulting in the loss of hundreds of dollars of food yesterday!  Good luck has to be around the corner....right?)"},

{"title": "Paris in the Springtime", "date": "Wednesday, April 01, 2015", "text": "I am in the process of planning a spring trip on a river cruise through France in the spring.  Please do not be jealous of my opportunity, but share my joy and I hope you will enjoy my sharing the trip in photos, a few, later.  Yes, I am very, very lucky to be able to afford such an expensive trip, and in truth, I am spending my children's inheritance, but I also have TIME chasing behind me and reminding me that these travels will not be so easy or even enjoyable as I age.Some folks (those who have discretionary income) spend money on homes or jewels or sports or fancy cars or even fancier hotels, or their children and grandchildren but my money goes to travel.  So much of the world still to see before we destroy it all and find ourselves involved in global terrorism and maybe even war. I have been reading about the history of France and feel that much has not changed from the 1600's and 1700's except for the speed with which hatred and prejudice and war and rich taking advantage of the ignorance and powerlessness of the poor can travel and spread.  That does sound like a depressing note, but we are an ugly species and hard pressed to see others viewpoints.  They have their history of genocide just like we do.I never really wanted to see France among the many places of the world, but this will be a trip with my sister whom I see so few times and really am looking forward to the close memory making.  According to Gertrude Stein the French did not invent the \"croissant\" but it came about as the result of Ukrainian soldiers making bread and using a Turkish recipe during a war.  I have no idea if this is true because Gertrude Stein rarely uses commas and writes in a sort of stream of consciousness style but it is a lovely idea.  In my reading I am surprised at how France has come about much like us from disparate groups of people over the years.  Gauls, Romans, Flemish, etc. have combined to create this complex culture.  The mapping of the country over the years created three major and many other meridian line claims and maybe I will see one or two.  The Tour de France was a commercial enterprise that became more successful and very different from its original race with country picnics along the route.Anyway, I will be leaving at the end of May and hope it is not too canned an experience and I just thought I would share."},

{"title": "Word Play", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2015", "text": "Writing is a compulsion for some of us.  We love the tidiness of words that fit like soldiers in a march toward some end and the untidiness of words that erupt like a volcano leaving bits of fire everywhere.  When we spill these words across a page, they mean different things to different people, and if we are a good writer, writing critics, just like art critics, spend precious time analyzing and deciphering and admiring.  Yet most of us are mediocre writers at best.  We know that and do not stop because it is a scratch that we just MUST itch. Most of the time what we spill is not deeply intriguing or even interesting beyond the single reading.  For some of us, it can help us understand ourselves and our place in time when no one else does.  We think our words become far more than a spontaneous and uncontrolled communication with the universe.Some of us have a turn of phrase tumble out of our heads onto the paper that requires deeper analysis before we share, and so we tuck it away into a note for it to ferment.  Another time, maybe it is something we have seen that strikes our fancy and so we paint that scene with words.  We never for a second allow the thought to enter that this unique combination of words might be trivial and we might be lying to ourselves about its potential importance when woven into a paragraph, an essay,or  a scene.  We hope and nurture that it is a tool clearing the passage to something more magnificent down the road.  When we pull it out once again months later, we might possibly read it as the ramblings of an idiot full of sound and fury signifying nothing...someone famous wrote that and I just stole it...sometimes what floats to the front of the mind it is something that someone else wrote which we admired such a long time ago.A few days ago, while cleaning up my laptop (digitally), I found a file labeled philosophy.  It consisted of about 14 lines of questions and interesting statements about life.  I was intrigued by what I had written, and at first, assumed I had been very erudite at the time I made that note.  I must have been humming like a finely tuned violin.  The more I re-read the words, though, I realized these were phrases captured from some movie I had seen...where the dialogue (I think from some detective) had been intriguing and intellectual, unlike most movie dialogue.  The questions he asked were so thought provoking that I guess I had hoped to use it as a stimulus for future meanderings of my own.Have you ever done that?  Is your life cluttered with your notes, others' notes and jumbled words just waiting to be woven into a cleaner more interesting tapestry, or am I the only one stumbling in this cluttered and indiscriminate universe of words to which we are exposed every day?I have been taking a digital course on writing and love being a student again.  I was never one who hated school.  I am working on bits and pieces of a \"short\" story in three parts as part of the course.  If I find it worthwhile and do not fear being naked, I may post it if I can actually finish it.  It is going to be close to 20-30 pages, so perhaps translating to a blog will not work...too long.  I am struggling."},

They worked fairly and split the money equally and soon had the largest entertainment enterprise in the 1880s. In 1905 he married Mable Burton.  It is my understanding that he gave her full reign in the construction of the house.  It was named Cà d'Zan, \"The House of John\" in theVenetian dialect of Italian.  Easy to see the strong influence of European design and architecture...mostly Italian baroque..  Personally I think the 30 room mansion is a little over the top for my tastes.  Yet, I am sure others find it a lovely home.  As it sits right on the water, you can imagine the terror that the curators face every time Florida gets a warning of a hurricane!You may just be able to see the houses and keys in the distance on the horizon in this photograph above.Does the maintenance alone not boggle your mind?  Most of the staff are volunteers.  Perhaps history or archeology or architecture or art students at Florida State University?You do not arrive at dinner here under dressed and without grand expectations.I think this place tries very hard to capture the elegance of Europe but ends up looking like a dictator's ego-filled palace.But, again, I must remind myself that these people made their wealth from the entertainment industry...from the circus.  Why should I be surprised that this place has that atmosphere.  Note John Ringling's portrait behind that large brown organ.  He was a very good business man and created a wealthy life with his talent."},

Back in the 1950's there were three giant train systems:  the first section being 22 cars with tents and poles and workers, the second section of 28 cars carried the ushers, canvasmen, and side show workers, the third section was 19 cars long and included the sleeper cars.   After merging with Barnum and Bailey the trains consisted of 100 double-length railroad cars transporting 1,200 employees, and was arguably the largest traveling amusement enterprise up to that time. Only a very small portion of the older train is in the museum - personal travel cars of John Ringling and his staff.No expense was spared for decor!Looking down the train from the back end.Above is the  lounge where John and his wife read and listened to music and watched the U.S. go by.  Such luxury ! The bedroom. The kitchen was very efficient and the cook prepared complete meals. The bathroom...with actual bath!!  Since they had to have access to water for the animals, I guess bringing/getting water for a bath was not that difficult."},
{"title": "It Never Forgets", "date": "Thursday, March 12, 2015", "text": "The news has recently said that the Ringling Brothers Circus was going to phase out its elephants from the circus.  I saw this elephant act decades ago in D.C. and that event made me decide I would probably never see circus animal acts again.  I could sense that the elephants were frightened.  You could see it in their eyes and by other things they did.  Ringling Brothers had, over the years, been receiving criticism for revealed behind the scenes harsh treatment toward these animals.  As we have learned, elephants are far more intelligent and complicated than we ever assumed.  In some atonement Ringling now has created a 200 acre conservation center in central Florida to retire these elephants in a phase out program.  I also remember years ago another video going around showing elephants using their trunks holding paint brushes to paint rather nice paintings in some place in Asia bringing in lots of amazed tourists with their money.  Behind the scenes training revealed unimaginable cruelty being inflicted to get these elephants to do something so unnatural.As I wrote in a post before, I visited the Ringling Brothers museums during my trip down south.  In the photo above is the patio that John Ringling created just outside his large and rather garish house in Sarasota, Florida, now owned and maintained by Florida State University and on the same grounds as a circus museum, an extensive art museum, a miniature circus model and other interesting venues along with a beautiful garden.  That day was the warmest we saw...maybe 55F?A large room houses a fascinating model of the three ring circus.  The model took years to create and is built in 3/4 to the foot scale.  Fifty-five train cars were also handcrafted and can actually be packed with all the circus figures.  It is a reproduction of the Ringling Circus in the 1920's and fills a large room.  This venue is very popular with all ages.  I did not take pictures inside the actual building as I guess I got distracted, but you can Google \"Howard Brothers Circus Model\" and get an eye full and experience a bit of the big tent excitement. Ringling Brothers Circus was an important part of Americana and while we have many more distractions and entertainments in our modern world, this little bit of nostalgia was enjoyable.  (Let me know if you want to see the house or actual train.)"},

Then it changed to snow.  There is nothing more lovely and surprising than a heavy dry snow storm coming through on a late afternoon.  While we have had cold weather in these parts, we have not had lots of snow like so many others.  One storm of a few inches I missed while I was on travel.  This second one came through the second week of march and left me with beautiful scenery.  Such snowstorms (when not in super abundance or brought with frighteningly high winds) are so soft and clean when they cover everything.  They purify the sins of the earth.  Everything is virginal once again.Snow is initially fun to watch because it is gentle and quiet and not intimidating like a summer electrical storm.The clickity sound of the hail on the skylights was replaced...by...no sound at all.Birds came in from everywhere and began to wait patiently for the sun to set.The storm place a layer of soft fluffy crystals with bits and pieces of loose down sticking to the barks of trees and building in drifts pushed by the wind catching bunches and throwing them high.  A true pillow fight of large proportions. By nightfall every edge was smoothed in crystal white.The evening meant a fire in the fireplace and some apple spice cake making from all those apples I picked and froze  last fall.  We each had a big slice.By morning the sun arrived boldly and the yard had been dressed in a new smooth white silk with only the fox's footprints in the front yard and a lone deer's hoof prints in the backyard to break the perfection.  (This post was written days ago as I have been busy with kids doing lots of stuff.)"},

We waded through 6 inches of snow covered in ice to the front door and carried our gear ever so carefully.  By the next day a rain that originated with warm air high above us in the atmosphere fell through the frozen air and as it reached near our ground it became liquid ice and this is what we saw when we woke the next morning.I put on my camouflage gear and winter boots and headed out early for just a sneak at what the river looked like.  The dock was wrapped like a silver package in a sheet of ice with a glitter dusting of snow and my concern for both my camera and my bones made me stop short of the edge where it hung over the water.  The nets in the left foreground are oyster floats.  I think the oysters are down in the mud right now, but I will have to ask hubby if these are just empty or set-asides. Other oyster farmers in the area are worried about their oyster stock in this frozen water.  The plastic owl leaning drunkenly below is supposed to chase away birds from leaving calling cards on the dock, and now askew, he is hardly looking intimidating.  The boat was pulled in late fall for some motor maintenance and sits on a trailer in the front yard and not on the boat lift below.  This finger of the river is frozen all the way out the day this photo was taken.  An unusual event, certainly.  This is as far as I was brave enough to walk."},

{"title": "Drawing Attention To Ourselves", "date": "Monday, March 02, 2015", "text": "It has crossed my mind more intensely these days about why women do certain things in this Western culture.  Wearing earrings and necklaces and bracelets is really to draw attention to our shell shaped ears, our thin wrists and our soft curves just above the ivory decolletage.  Little bits of sparkle and movement to draw the male eyes toward us instead of to another.  (Ignoring the status symbol aspect of this.)We used to wear long dresses that flowed with feminine movement and swirled with a flirtatious swish sometimes just revealing those sexy ankles that drew a man's attention. We paint our lips to emphasize their plump juiciness and outline out eyes to give an exotic deepness to them waiting for the male to just dive in.We paint our nails to draw attention to our delicate hands that we want held.I have become dismayed (not depressed) that I no longer have the attributes that I would like more closely inspected.  Hands are veined with tan spots, lips are still plump but losing their shape, my neck is thin skinned and freckled and my decolletage, while still there, is not youthful looking nor sustained without assistance.  I still wear jewelry and make-up, and sometimes paint my nails, but realize it is being done for me, myself, and I.  Hubby still loves me even in muddy canoe pants and only misses my long hair which he has for years. He, while commenting nicely if I get dressed up, really has seen me without the camouflage and knows me like no other.Yet having a bit of the soul of the artist, I do miss that smoothness and symmetry of youth, not to flirt, but to add beauty and a bit of power to my day.  Yes, age has its beauty, but I tend to be drawn to the other less complicated form.There, now that I have depressed most of my female readers over the age of 50, I am glad to read in the weather report that the snows are melting this week and we may even get shirt weather!  Spring is around the corner and not around the bend."},
{"title": "Protection", "date": "Saturday, February 28, 2015", "text": "Owning and using a car is a big responsibility.  A car is a useful tool for getting you places and transporting others who do not have a means of getting somewhere.  It can open doors to new worlds.  It is also dangerous if used carelessly.  You can kill or maim yourself or others.  Therefore substantial training, testing, and licensing of both you and the vehicle is required.  Cars can be stolen by others and thus we have gotten much better over the years in providing locks to prevent this.  That is not saying cars don't get stolen, but we have more complicated preventions, such as more complicated locking devices, silent alarms, cars that stall when stolen and GPS tracking devices so that we know where cars are at all times.  Not all types of vehicles can be used on public roads.  For instance, if you own a tank or one of those big wheelers, you must get a special permit to go from point A to point B and if you want to move a bus you have to have a specific license and testing in the majority of states.  Cars are not cheap to own and most states require insurance to protect the driver and others from tragic expenses and lawsuits.  Those that do not require insurance do require a vehicle fee paid to the state or the posting of bond. You cannot drive when under the influence of a drug and if caught can lose your license and/or car and must find other means of transportation if needed.  You may need to be re-tested for an understanding of the laws or even re-tested for eyesight and reflexes as you continue to drive. You are required to have your vehicle certified over time to make sure that it still has all the safety and other features working.  Law enforcement can check fairly easily any information on a vehicle by checking the license plate number in a database.  All of these protections can be bypassed with effort, but that does not stop me from supporting the laws and technologies now in place even though it makes owning a vehicle an expensive privilege.I feel the same way about guns and would like to have similar rules implemented.( I should be home tomorrow...back into the polar express area of the world.  I saw the sign above and realized it was not something I would have seen years ago.)"},

Idealists are abstract and compassionate day dreamers, activists, writers, diplomats, counselors and healers. You're the magician or medicine man of all the personality types. You're a deeply emotional and abstract thinker with cooperative and communitarian goals. You long for deep, meaningful relationships and you constantly contemplate how you can help the common good. You're guided by strong personal ethics, and you often have an ideology, cause, or way of viewing the world that you take very seriously. You're easy going until someone challenges your values, at which point you can be the fiercest of opponents. At heart, you're a natural healer with a great depth of empathy for those around you. As an Idealist, you're in impressive company! Martin Luther King Jr., Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, Princess Diana, and Oprah are all famous examples of Idealists! Do you feel more like Gandhi or Oprah? Let us know!Since Gandhi is one of my all time heroes, I guess they got it right this time.  Of course much of what is written above can apply to all of us."},
{"title": "Not Vexing", "date": "Sunday, February 22, 2015", "text": "(Another post I pre-wrote before I left.)Along the open area near the stairs on the third floor (I think it was third?) are the American Indian flags that were hung at the National Museum of the American Indian that I visited weeks ago.  The American state flags of Oklahoma and Massachusetts use American Indian symbolism.  They both have Indian symbols representing peace...ironic isn't it?  There are at least 200 tribal flags identified and about 30 are in this photo.  It is my understanding that some flag designs are still awaiting approval from the U.S. government to represent some smaller tribes.  There are over 500 American Indian tribes! As you probably understand the use of flags is a new type of representation for the American Indian, mostly begun within the last 50 years.  Prior to this tribes were identified by costumes and totems.  But since the U.S. requires identification for sovereignty the tribes went the way of the Europeans and developed flags.According to vexillologist, Donald T. Healy, \"Another major inducement for Native American peoples to adopt flags has been their increasing involvement in the gaming industry. More than ninety-five tribes now offer gambling in one form or another on federally recognized reservations. This has brought millions of visitors to lands they would never have thought to visit. With this massive influx of visitors tribes now find themselves in need of a readily acceptable symbol of sovereignty. Replies to surveys and phone inquiries in at least a dozen cases have directly attributed the adoption of a flag to the opening of a casino or bingo parlor. The impact of gambling upon the adoption of flags within the Native American community may be a unique occurrence in vexillological history.\"  By the way, the study of flags is called vexillology. In the above photo is the view that you get when you walk past all the flags and look down to the central lobby of the museum.  This open area below is where you see and hear demonstrations of songs, instruments, and other culture activities throughout the day.  And, I might mention that not all Indians are poor.  The Pequot Indians of Connecticut were sufficiently wealthy that they donated ten million dollars to the Smithsonian Institution toward the construction of a this museum."},

Yes, they have lots of money.  We went to an art fair and dinner with them, something we never do at home where they live next door. Some people do not know when to stop with the self-indulgence...see photo below. (Yes, now with the added photo the 13 numbering is off, but I cannot seem to fix the HTML coding.  It does add up to 13.) I did see a gopher tortoise in the Florida shrubs sunning himself about 30 pounds and I was told that it was not common to see that.  I had never seen one before, but he headed down into his hole the minute he saw me raise my camera.I am beginning to think all the angry white people live in the Miami area, because everyone I have encountered here on the West Coast is friendly and laid back and I remember some rather nasty folks in the southeast years ago.We are half way into our vacation and I have not gotten a single good beach sunset.  Weather or other things do not cooperate, but I really had no photographic agenda anyway.A tri-colored heron perched on the side of the canoe we had tied to the dock here, and pooped into the boat, and I took that as a welcome to the tropics sign.  I will post on my other blog when we return.Yesterday was an all day canoe ride over some slightly choppy water between the mangrove islands with a rather cool wind.  At least the sun was shining and I think I got too much of that.   Doing the Ringling Brothers museums today."},

{"title": "Since You Asked", "date": "Monday, February 02, 2015", "text": "One (or more) of my blog friends was wondering why I could not post photos of works of art that I had seen in my museum tour on the last weekend.  I, perhaps, phrased this poorly.  It is a matter of not being able to render the actual beauty of any work of art by just taking a photo.  The art oozes its charm or shock or nostalgia with the surroundings of the room in which it was placed and with the specific lighting and even the atmosphere such as the quiet clean sound of a gallery.  I must also take the photo without flash, which sometimes works and sometimes does not, since I do not drag a tripod through the gallery, even if they would let me!But below is a small example of my take on this room of over abundant stimuli-The Peacock Room.   It was painted by Whistler-the same man that painted that severe and austere portrait of his straight-laced mother-and you can see he has a much broader style and palette in his soul when he gets away from mama.  The colors rendered by this photo are NOT accurate, and that is why I hesitate trying to share works of art via blog.This is the Western wall of the \"dining\" room and the painting for which the room is named.  Below is the controversial painting that hangs on the opposite wall.The owner of the home became ill and was surprised at all the liberties that Whistler took with his elaborate painting and tours of his work to the public while the owner of the mansion was at his 'regular' home recuperating.  The painting above became controversial over time.  The Greek Anglo beauty above was in Japanese dress of popularity at the time and this was later considered too risque and too much like bedroom wear to be shown to guests.  I was truly surprised at this because Greek nude sculptures were accepted everywhere at the time.Having written this, let me share in a better representation my tour of The Peacock Room owned by Leyland and painted by Whistler that you can take.  There is some good story behind the creation of this room and its final destination to the Freer Gallery.  You can go here for a beautiful tour of the room and here for more information.This Freer museum is due for well needed renovation soon and this room will be taken apart and not seen for a number of years, so I was glad to be able to tour this winter!"},

{"title": "What the Camera Captures", "date": "Thursday, January 29, 2015", "text": "Many of us watch the historical/hysterical soap opera Downton Abbey on television.  I enjoy it because of the tremendous attention to culture and historic detail that is interwoven into the everyday lives of the upstairs and downstairs crowd.  There has been discussion about the somewhat romanticized version of this oligarchy.  The rich were kind and reasonable with the lower classes as long as the lower classes knew and maintained their place.  The new 2015 (14 in Britain) season is slowly introducing the disintegration of that relationship as a more democratic culture begins to  seep into England led by the changes from World War I. Intelligent viewers know that this television version of the culture is somewhat glossed over because the Crawleys (Lords and Ladies of the Manor) are pretty benign in their treatment of the servants.  They do not see them as equals in any way, but do not put barriers in front of them if they wish to pursue other careers or get married.  Certainly a very liberal view at that time.  I have read recently about how many of the upper class land owners treated the Irish tenant farmers with such cruelty when the potato famine spread across Ireland.  Most of the aristocracy left the farmers to their own devices and fled back to England to live in well-fed luxury while many of the Irish that were left behind died of starvation. There were bodies of men and women lying along roads as if there had been war.  These were truly tested people.  Some of the more determined headed for America to start a new life with nothing but the shirts on their backs. Upon arriving in  America they banded together to strive and survive.  (Yes, in some cases their was a nice little crime unit formed...the Irish Mafia.)When I visit Ireland last year, I (most serendipitously) came across the National Library Photographic Archive, located in Meeting House Square in Temple Bar in Dublin.  It was near the open market where we went to grab a walking breakfast.  It is a small space in a very contemporary structure and the exhibit that I saw was a series of black and white portraits of the people in the Limerick Milk Market by photographer Gerry Andrews taken in the 1970s.  These were the grandchildren of the people who lived through the potato famine and their character shows in each precious and honest portrait.  I was crying as I walked through this exhibit, a truly magnificent archive from a truly talented photographer.If you wish to see this terrific slice of history you can go to this link, but be prepared for some serious soul-searching.  This post is for Mage who is now working on a B and W challenge of her own."},

Our weather yesterday was in the 40s with no wind, so hubby headed outside to get his exercise after finishing a novel he was reading.  He split a lot of wood as you can see in the photo, and if we lose power, our heatilator fireplace will keep a part of the house warm at the very least.  I truly think the storm will miss us once again.  Our luck has not run out in this new year regarding weather."},
{"title": "Meetings", "date": "Saturday, January 24, 2015", "text": "Our garden group is starting its meetings once again after a two month hiatus.  I find that it takes all my willpower to go forth on these cold gray evenings and attend these.  Hubby who starts to fade without something social happening, even if it is just chit-chatting some stranger up at the pool, is the opposite of me and ready to go a half hour before we need to leave.  I sulk out of the house like a dog being told he has to sleep in the dog house. I dread making small talk and am so stupid to think it is all about me.  I think I have the small soul of an artist wanting to be on the other side of the glass observing human nature rather than being observed.  Hubby is an open book and when we were first married I kept feeling as if my clothes were being stripped off of my body piece by piece as he stood beside me telling personal tales to people I hardly knew.  For him it was sharing and for me it was giving away ammo and increasing my vulnerability and taking away my \"mystery.\"  I am sure that a psychiatrist could have a field day with this by exploring my youth and my relationship with my parents and maybe siblings.It is all silly stuff, I know.  But I do envy those who sit right down in the crowd and are so comfortable with the brash and the quiet and the smart and the dumb, fitting in everywhere and being welcomed with open arms by everyone and not noticing the eye rolls when a joke is retold.Yet, if you saw me at the meeting not long ago you would find that I am the one who volunteers a comment at least half the time, I am the one who talks with those on each side of me about their holidays, I am the one who looks like she is a social butterfly having a grand old time.  And when I am finally back home, I find that indeed I did have a nice time and it was good seeing faces I had not seen in some time and I am glad that I went but will forget all of this before the next time."},
{"title": "Thanks for the Memories", "date": "Thursday, January 22, 2015", "text": "While I was scanning a few of the hundreds of slides that sit in a dozen metal boxes in a cupboard, hundreds of slides that may well be meaningless to my children, and therefore, not survive much beyond their memories of their parents, I ran across this photo of the second place that I lived in the South Pacific.  It was taken from a tall rock that you can hike up to and then get such a breathtaking view.  This slide below does not show the house itself which would have been behind the trees in the lower right hand side, a brand new prefab built with a Japanese war reparations money.  Yes, I know, do not ask me to explain.I will look for a photo of the nice little house, if I can.  What you see here is the rudimentary structure of a marine laboratory in the making.  Something only a young and optimistic person such as my husband would take on and see to completion.  Later there were ponds and pump houses and other structures and even electricity every once in a while to pump the water!Isn't that water stunningly beautiful?  There was a little pocket beach off to the right side in this photo and we would snorkel there on lazy afternoons.  I would watch an octopus that lived in the corals just a few feet from the seawall.  Oh, you do not have to tell me, and as young as we were, we knew what a marvelous memory in our lives this was going to be!"},
{"title": "Research, An Expensive Vitamin", "date": "Monday, January 19, 2015", "text": "Hubby got an email the other day from someone he had never met.  She was the niece of a research scientist that he had gone to school with many decades ago.  She was doing some historic exploration on her uncle, but not because he had passed away recently.  He had died a long time ago and she wanted to know more about him.  This uncle had taken a night dive off the coast of Oahu back in the 1970s and was never heard from again.  Some surmised that he had been taken by a tiger shark that had been cruising the area, but since he had had a diving partner who also never returned, there were other guesses of an accident and perhaps heavy currents.I think this is a gray shark...photo taken by me back in the 1970'sI used to S.C.U.B.A. dive fairly often when I lived in the South Pacific, and I have posted on this time in my life earlier in this blog.  I look back on those years as if I was some other woman, because I never got out of the water until my tank was nearing empty; I was fearless.  Over the years, I preferred snorkeling, because there was more flora and fauna in the less than 30 feet water.  It was a wonderful time in my life.  We were young, just married, in good health, and the cost of diving, since we had just purchased a small outboard motor boat, was easy to swallow, as was the ability to enjoy the remote beaches sans clothing.  I should tuck a story or two away for my grandchildren to read someday so that they can think Grandma was just a little fascinating and not always a boring old lady sitting at home, because this was where my love affair with the earth kicked into high gear.This is I next to some soft coral.Crinoids which were my favorites when they waved their feathering \"arms\" in the current.An other life form bored by all the paparazzi. (squid)I remember seeing small sharks (3 to 5 feet long) at the edge of reefs on half of those diving days.  They ignored us and we just kept an eye on their distance and dorsal fin to check their mood as we cruised looking for interesting stuff.  (A dorsal fin is like the hair on the back of a dog.)I digress.  Getting back to Hubby's email, Hubby thought back over his relationship with this former colleague and said he remembered that the guy was super-focused on his work which was to research cave fish that came out only at night, and therefore he had to do a lot of night diving before his grant money ran out.  There are always those that take dangerous chances for their passion and sometimes inadvertently give their life.  In spite of what conservatives like to tell you, scientists are like policemen, teachers, journalists, doctors, nurses, parents etc. They feel their work is important even if it revolves around cave fish, they do like their work, and they are as honest or dishonest as the next guy.  The huge majority of scientists are truly focused on finding the facts, taking that chance and making the world a better place with their discoveries, not on beating a drum for a preconceived agenda, or doctoring results so that they can get that pittance of a grant that barely pays for the boat fuel once a graduate student's salary is paid and lab materials are purchased.I have worked very briefly on a committee reading and reviewing grant applications, and politics never came into the discussion on whether a grant should be awarded.  It was always whether the grant was well thought out, well written, had an accurate budget, fit the discovery of the granting institution and of compelling interest to the citizens. There were always many more grant applications than money to grant.  Scientists and their assistants spend much time writing even while researching and many good applications fall by the wayside.  Regardless of who gets the money the search for INFORMATION is the key.  (In this cave arena information involves bacteria that may have applications in cancer research, data showing changes and evolution in species adapting to environmental change, etc.)There was a recent bill passed in the House of Congress (H.R. 1422--little chance of it ever being moved and signed but let's continue to waste the taxpayers dime) that has restricted independently funded scientific environmental experts from being appointed to boards of the EPA, because Congress feels these scientific experts \"have an agenda.\"   It also restricts scientists that get grants from EPA to serve on the boards; I am assuming that Congress feels their results will be questionable as well.  The same bill makes it easier for petrochemical scientists to be on the boards of EPA though, because this will erase any \"appearance of impropriety\".  Pretend that someone who studies viruses finds that his data foretells a preventable epidemic and he gets his funding from NHS, but he must pretty much keep from talking to the primary institution and hope they read it and grasp its importance.. but those who could take action on it are well informed by pharmaceutical companies that have a new weapon against this self-same virus. (Can you tell I am furious with this ignorance or actually the greed of self-serving politicians?)Research scientists that work for universities and the government are not the ones bringing down big salaries and making money off of polluting the air and the water and causing this documented increase in small earthquakes near fracking sites or the tremendous increase in carbon dioxide being now held in ocean waters---soon to reach its limit.  Yes, it will cost you and me money to breathe clean air and drink clean water and stem the tide of the rising oceans and mitigate the long droughts.  But at what price is a healthy world?  Although in reality it is too late to prevent some of this---islands and low lying parts of countries are going to go underwater and we will have waves of refugees leaving their sunken land in coming decades.  (A glacier recently calved a piece of ice the size of lower Manhattan and three miles wide!.)As an aside, in my research, the FBI website lists eco-terrorists as more active in this country in causing havoc than ISIS.  I am NOT advocating that! By the way, neither political party gets even a B from me on their environmental report cards. And sadly I think most people do not seem to care what kind of world the meek will inherit much less what they leave their grandchildren because many of faith in Congress leave it all up to God and those of money know they can build their castle high on a hill in a better climate.  I think Sophocles wrote, \"No good e'er comes of leisure purposeless; And heaven ne’er helps the men who will not act.\""},

{"title": "Shoes", "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2015", "text": "Chiharu Shiota is a Japanese contemporary artist.  It is difficult to find much on her except she was born in Osaka and now lives in Berlin.  She attended schools in Japan, the United States, Germany, and Australia.  Her works are original and interesting, and perhaps, full of social commentary more than artistic spirit.  Below is an exhibit that was on display at the Freer/Sackler museum which I seem to be writing about endlessly these days.  It is an exhibit of 300 discarded and found(donated) shoes (not pairs) and donated notes about each shoe tied to a piece of red yarn that goes back to that point in the corner.  The artist has collected these over the years because they are reflective of the bits and pieces of our lives that we leave behind.  I could not read the notes while I was there since most were in Japanese. I later found this link that tells the story of many of these notes. In this photo above I included the guard who was there, I am sure, to keep small children and evil adults from playing with the display.  (I wonder if some days his feet hurt?)  You can find some interesting information on the installation here.Shoes are often symbols of our travels across this earth via our life.  I have not had enough courage to visit the Holocaust Museum, but they have a room full of shoes that once belonged to living human Jews with precious and important lives.Shoes represent who we are and what we think of ourselves sometimes.  Symbols of our essence maybe?  Sometimes given more importance than they deserve.  I recently posted about shoes on this blog."},

If it were a country, New Orleans (with a rate 62.1 gun murders per 100,000 people) would rank second in the world.   Detroit's gun homicide rate (35.9) is just a bit less than El Salvador (39.9).   Baltimore's rate (29.7) is not too far off that of Guatemala (34.8).   Gun murder in Newark (25.4) and Miami (23.7) is comparable to Colombia (27.1).   Washington D.C.

{"title": "Prejudice, That Sticky Companion", "date": "Saturday, January 10, 2015", "text": "Prejudice: a precomposed mindset, a foregone conclusion, seeing something through the smallest of lenses.  We all have our prejudices even though we do not like to admit it.  We think we see things fairly and test both sides before coming to our well-thought-out conclusion.  We tell ourselves that we are trying to see things through the eyes of the \"other\" side.  We sometimes even rally our defenses in the event that someone will point out we are being a little too one-sided in our response. Let us face it.  We do not have even half the tools to overcome any prejudices we hold.  The emotion is the first to clog our conclusion.  Emotion:  love, fear, and anger are too strong to make us sit and count to ten and then see where we stand and do more research.Last year my husband and I had planned a trip to Turkey with some friends.  They had gotten a \"good deal\" through their Catholic newsletter.  Hubby and I were a little hesitant as we are not Catholic and actually not religious.  We assumed it would be an overdose of the history of the Christian religion without the balance of the \"other\" in that area.   But we also assumed we could pull away from some of the tours and balance our time with more pagan or other religious explorations.  Then the war in Syria grew more intense and certain factions came right to the southern borders of Turkey.  Intellectually we knew that our tour group would not go near this area, but emotionally we realized that as part of a Christian tour group we would stand out like flag wavers at a rally even in the North.  There was always a slight chance that terrorism could erupt in the northern part of Turkey.  Needless to say, the increase in security itself might be an issue as our tour bus went from location to location.We cancelled our trip.This spring we are planning a trip to France as part of a tour group.  The group is non-religious and the tour is much more expensive so the travelers will all be upper middle class and mostly westerners.  We are not even considering cancelling this trip in light of the now tragic terrorist activities in Paris and surrounding areas, even knowing intellectually that a rich group of tourists is just as attractive to hostage taking as a group of devout Catholics.  I think this is partly because this is just a non-religious tour group, but also because France is a \"western\" country.  France is in Europe and not the mid-east.  France is more like us. We are certainly prejudice thinking we could be safer on this tour and that the uprising will not get worse than a few crazy zealots by the time we begin our travel.  We have no facts to base this on.  Just our prejudice and level of emotional reaction."},
{"title": "Art in Many Forms", "date": "Friday, January 09, 2015", "text": "My recent visit to the Smithsonian museums before the holidays was fulfilling and exhausting.  One of the venues at the Freer/Sackler gallery of art was the display of the personal art collection of the Cosby family.  Bill's recent fall from grace did not prevent me from wanting to see works of art that are not normally available to the public and I was glad that I did.  There was an enormous range in style, medium, and history.  Much of this collection was social commentary.  While there I took one photo of the large space and was immediately told they did not allow photos of this particular exhibit.  I am guessing it might have something to do with insurance, but who knows.  I was a little frustrated, but I do not really like to take photos of art anyway, because everything gets lost in the digital translation.  I was just trying to capture the variety in style that this collection has and also the interesting juxtaposition of art that the Smithsonian curators displayed next to Cosby artworks.Not to be thwarted I captured some really 'cool' expressions in the architecture that you can take in a museum and I am putting up a few below.  This building was designed by Charles A. Platt at the turn of the century. The Freer was the first of his public commissions in 1913.   I am not sure to what extent he was involved in the underground passage between the Freer Gallery and the Sackler Gallery (both devoted to Asian Art and an odd place for the Cosby exhibit unless it was chosen because it was the most secure or had the most free space.)  Platt favored Italian Renaissance in both buildings and garden design.  I read that his design philosophy emphasized the integration of interior and exterior space through strong visual and circulatory connections, so probably he was indeed an influence on the underground which I photographed below and which you can see reflects that philosophy.  (As an aside and a very small brag, I sold another photo that I took from this subject area recently.  Amazing what a thrill one gets to see someone else likes their expression of art even if so little money is made from it.)AND I just learned that you can go here and see over 40,000 works of art from their collection digitally.  This is their 2015 gift to us all!"},

The bad side of the messing about where we should not:We are winding down and ending our War in Iraq...at least that is what they tell us.  What a sticky tar pit we have entered.  The cost in money?  It is anyone's guess.  Some say $800 billion, a low-ball estimate.  Others say it has cost  $1.7 trillion with an additional $490 billion in benefits owed  to war veterans, expenses that could grow to more than $6  trillion over the next four decades counting interest.  Money your grand-children will have to pay.   I think the Bush administration predicted the cost would be about $50 million to $60 million dollars.  Ignorance is bliss, but if you are Dick Chaney, you are making lots of money for your grandchildren, so perhaps it is all in how myopic you are.  And what did we get for this?  Where is Iraq now, 13 years and more than 2,300 troop deaths and over 13,000 wounded later?\"Ali Allawi, a former minister of trade, defense and finance, and author of two books on Iraqi history, agrees. \"There is so much up in the air,\" he said. \"There are the trappings of a functioning state, but it is like a functioning state lying on a sea of Jello...The ground is so unstable and shifting.\"\"Kurdish business tycoon Sirwan Barzani, a nephew of Iraqi Kurdish President Masoud Barzani, sees this as a moment to advance his people's nationalist dream and take his country back to 1916!  Back when another developed nation meddled.   \"They asked about my plan,\" Barzani told Reuters in a military base on the frontline near Gwer, 48 kilometers (30 miles) south of the Iraqi Kurdish capital Arbil. \"I said, 'My plan is to change the Sykes-Picot agreement'\" –\" a reference to the 1916 agreement between France and Britain that marked out what would become the borders of today's Middle East.\"  He goes on to describe the situation we leave...\"Iraq is not real,\" Barzani said. \"It exists only on the map. The country is killing itself. The Shi'ites and Sunnis cannot live together. How can they expect us to live with them? Our culture is different. The mentality of Kurds is different. We want a divorce.\"  Clearly our Western marital consultation skills are shiiite!  No pun intended, just trying to be polite.And the Shi'ites?: \"\"We are like a sinking ship. Whoever gives you a hand lifting you from the sea whether enemy or friend, you take it without seeing his face because he is there.\"  The sheikh's changing perceptions are shared by other Iraqi Shi'ites. They once viewed Iran as the enemy but now see their neighbor as Iraq's one real friend. The streets of Baghdad and southern Iraq are decorated with images of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\"Ignorance is artificial bliss, and unless you know this, we will follow other well-meaning or ill-advised or corrupt leaders into other wars."},

In answer to my reader's questions:  There is ONE alternative to my cable company, but it runs the same bait and switch on costs.  I live too far for antenna reception.  I, like many of you, watch only about 5 channels off and on, none of them premium channels, and I scroll past hundreds of others.  I have a son who is a sound engineer and if I begged he would come down and help BUT he is currently fighting the flu, lives over an hour away, and has a full time job which requires the longest hours just before the holidays.Anyway, I am feeling much better moving onto the next steps and will stop blogging about this stuff!"},

I pulled the dongle from the back of the screen, and much to my surprise (hardly) I could no longer get my cable box and my amp to talk to my TV.  I fiddled for an hour.  There are about 10 options each on the various remote controls.  Multiply 10X10X10 and you get the idea.  I am exhausted and now have to call someone to come help and it will probably cost as much as my monthly cable bill anyway.I felt really defeated because this has been one of those days.I will not even go into the well water issue that has raised its furry head!Nor will I dwell on the bill coming due from the outboard motor shop due to the diagnosis of the \"cough\" in that engine this fall.These are three items, so I am thinking that if trouble really does come in threes I am done for a while.  Right???"},

I saw this plant in a fall herb garden at the National Arboretum one year and was intrigued since it was so hearty in late fall and still full of blooms.  I bought this plant last year for my herb garden as its common name is pineapple sage (Salvia elegans).  As a Master Gardener I did my research before planting...NOT.  I buy stuff and stick it where I need to put a plant and then hope it makes it without a lot of mollycoddling.  Fortunately it was in a place where it gets morning sun and afternoon shade, which is the perfect niche.  All of my soils are relatively rich and thus it grew like a house on fire.  I did my research later, and discovered this baby can get to be FIVE FEET high.  There goes a third of my small herb garden.Does it smell or taste of pineapple you may ask?   I will copy text from one garden that sells it \"Did I mention that it really does smell like pineapple? You may be skeptical about the fragrance. After all, the orange and chocolate mints may smell like their namesakes, but only if you concentrate really hard and use your imagination. Pineapple sage, on the other hand, really smells pineapple-y, and it's also an attractive plant in its own right.\"  No, I did not find a strong pineapple smell, but my old olfactory glands are not what they used to be.  The leaves are edible, but not striking in pungency like mint or sage.  The flowers can be used in fall salads and are a nice colorful addition.  The flowers are also a favorite of hummingbirds as the days grow short.  I think they look a little like hands giving directions ;-).This plant, like a chrysanthemum, uses a photoreceptor protein and blooms as the day gets shorter.  So it is a nice accent to late fall gardens when other bloomers are going to sleep or forming seeds.  Pineapple sage forms blossoms as the day grows shorter and the nights longer which starts on June 21.  Cotton and rice are also short day plants.  Next year I am going to try more carefully to see if I can get the hummingbird at this plant.  I do not get many hummingbirds to my yard.  The plant freezes back to the ground after the first freeze, but may survive a harder winter if I mulch it carefully.  (It is not expensive to replant each year.)I think the \"elegans\" name comes from the shape of the flowers - like ballerinas hands arching.   It is dainty, discriminating, and elegant."},

{"title": "Washing the Brain and Coming Clean With You", "date": "Monday, November 03, 2014", "text": "I had promised in my last post to talk about my addictions.  First you need to accept that all addictions are by definition compulsions you cannot control based on the rewards that your brain receives from them.  But, with the exception of drugs and certain weaknesses in personalities, there are varied degrees of addiction and sometimes the addiction is strong on one day and weak on another.  I will not dwell on to what extent all addictions can be bad.  Years ago, when I was young and surrounded by diapers and baby food and bills and long days at home, I started watching a few soap operas on television during baby nap times.  As I look back I realize it was truly escapism because my life was boring and the over-the-top adventures of Audrey and Mike and Dr. Whats-his-name with their perfect hair and breasts and shoulders kept me distracted just long enough to be willing to face dinner.   Eventually soap operas seemed repetitive, and predictable, and boring, and as my life was no longer tied to the house,  I said goodbye to Barbie and Ken and their trials and tribulations.Recently as my life has now slowed and I spend more time in my house once again, my entertainment addiction has become British mysteries.  I love trying to solve them alongside the expert and befuddled detective, or in other cases the unofficial detectives Miss Marple or Hercule Poirot.  If I watched an episode three years ago I may re-watch it because I have forgotten most of the details and the brain reward is the same.  Hubby is most generous in sitting through these with me but usually he cannot understand half of what they say with their chin wags over a half-pint at the local \"Swan and Blind Beggar\" pub.About two years ago I began to fold laundry, plan dinners, prepare food or pay bills in front the TV in the late afternoons and I returned to my former addiction.  Low and behold I came across a soap opera, one of those that fed my elder brain nicely.  If you research the title of the show a description reads \"An English Priest is transferred to a small Irish village.\"  The show is called \"Ballykissangel\" which is the fictional name of the village in the show, and it is, of course, in Ireland.  In the first episodes a very young and naive priest struggles with an overbearing Parish priest and a bunch of quirky parishioners.  Eventually sexual tension between the priest and the pub owner surfaces, and while a soap opera trick, it really is done nicely and without lots of prurient plot scenes. (My opinions about Celibacy among the people of the cloth is a whole other post!)  This soap opera moves beyond this priest as new priests arrive to replace him and the yearly episodes involved each of the quirky characters in amusing and sad adventures and I loved each and every odd villager, and the Irish culture and scenery was so addictive.Yes, I will FINALLY get to the reason for this post, and it is not to show that I know how to waste time watching TV AND do work OR write wordy posts about nothing.  The real name of the Irish village where this soap opera was filmed was Avoca in Ireland.  One of the reasons, and probably the primary reason, I selected Hunters Hotel for our first night, was because it was about 10 miles from the small town of Avoca!  This is what addictions do...enforce you to make arbitrary and illogical decisions for that brain reward.I dragged everyone traveling with me to that little village as a bypass on our way to a national park.  I immediately found the famous pub, and just up the hill the Catholic church and crossed the bridge where many a plot point had been revealed.  We pulled into the nearby parking lot and I spent about two minutes taking quick pictures and giggling.  No one with me understood a wit about my school girl reaction, except for my DIL who had visited the house in the movie \"Goonies\" just a few months ago and posted her giggling self in front of that same house.  My intellectual mind knows that this is 'scenery'...a 'location shoot' because I was a drama minor in college.  I understand the smoke and mirrors part very well.  I also know that the little town made money for some time on this series.  I am guessing the actual name of the village in the TV show is copyrighted and that is why the name of this gift shop in the photo below is a little odd.And, of course there was that magnificent and powerful and important character that had no lines in the series...the church.But I also understand the magic of a storyline and how it captures you and compels you and makes you reminisce and puts you there in the lives of the characters.  And when it all comes together at the right time, it is magnificent.Now aren't you glad you followed me all the way to the end? ( It is too bad for those others that stopped reading and went to get the mail.)  Do I not seem more human?  No? OK.  Go ahead and see if the re-runs of this show are in your TV schedule on PBS or BBC .  I won't tell anyone.  Try to start from the beginning or you will not get the full soap opera effect or addiction."},
{"title": "The Silliness of Life and Getting to Know the Locals", "date": "Saturday, November 01, 2014", "text": "As I wrote earlier, about our recent trip to Ireland, our fellow travelers made most of the reservations and selected most of the places we would visit.  We had no problem with this, even though we had never visited the Emerald Isle, because we have been blessed with tons of travel and lots of adventures in our life, and this was a rare trip for them.You may remember that hubby had a fall from a ladder a few weeks prior to this trip, and with his compromised neck issues, I was a bit concerned about how he would feel after such a long flight.  Therefore, we went a day earlier than everyone else and checked into a country retreat just outside Dublin to get used to driving on the \"wrong\" side of the roads and the difference in an earlier time zone.  I must admit that I did not spend hours searching for a perfect and inexpensive place to stay.  It was for only one night, and our friends had already reserved all reasonable places for the rest of the trip, etc.  I found a place with an afternoon tea garden and a kitchen garden and a long history for 130 Euro for the one night breakfast included which translates to about 162.00 dollars in the US.  Some would say it was too much, but I found it acceptable. It was in Wicklow County which is a beautiful area and I wish we had had more time to explore more than just a few hours in this area where a number of well-known movies have been made because of its beauty.I came across a website for this Hunter's Hotel in Wicklow County  which is about 20 minutes outside of Dublin.  The photos were very inviting, of course.  Built originally in 1650 as a forge, it was then converted to an Inn that had been owned by a wealthy family in the 18th Century and had a long and colorful history of owners following that.  Now Europeans might read through this and think cold, damp, dark and old.  I thought 'romantic escape.'  I thought 'nostalgic dream.'  Mel Gibson and Daniel Day Lewis have stayed at this hotel!  It sits out in the middle of nowhere and we almost could not find it on our tracker.  Signs in rural areas can be hidden in Ireland.The hotel was mostly what I had expected in a creaky old way and the furniture definitely showed a history.   It was a bit of a hodge podge in decor, and when I showed my travel photos, my daughter said it looked like staying a Great Old Aunt Somebody's place.  She has no sense of history or atmosphere.  I felt right at home!  We had a glass of wine in the beautiful garden out back while waiting for our room to be ready.At dinner that evening I observed at the nearby table two rather healthy-looking women in their mid-fifties that could have been Lesbian hikers in a Hercule Poirot story discuss plant species and birds that they had seen in a sharp and efficient conversation over their meal.  They did not mention that they had come across a body in the woods, though.  Later I sat in the lounge just across from an elderly British couple after our evening white tablecloth gourmet dinner and closed my eyes and entered an Agatha Christie mystery as I eves dropped on their gentle conversation about people they knew and gossip they shared as only elderly Brits can carry off.After a wonderful breakfast the next day I walked in the kitchen garden and met a lovely bubbly Irish lady about 55 who was an artist and explained that she was known for her paintings of naked men.  She was a plump lady wearing a lovely silky flowered dress with a small fancy hat perched on her blonde head.  As the small talk progressed she was very willing to share her recent divorce issues after a long time marriage, her husband's awfulness in the process, and the new art studio and business which she had expanded with her two sons.  She also indicated how she could certainly be willing to paint my husband as he was a good body shape!  Her grandchild had been Baptized that very morning and that is why the family was all there to all have a late breakfast together.When our other group of travelers arrived in Dublin and joined us later to head further south they asked if the hotel could fix a late breakfast for the four of them.  The hotel kitchen which is only open very specific hours was most generous in accommodating them with both a hot and cold breakfast.  Later they toured the gardens while we checked out and they met a landscape expert whose house was being fumigated while he stayed at the hotel.  They were able to get lots of information on all the exotic plants we might see and also some good places to visit on the island and how to avoid a few tourist traps.  All in all the casual elegance of this place was a perfect place to start our Ireland adventure.My next post ... a soap opera addiction."},

{"title": "The New Recipe for CRABapple Pie??", "date": "Thursday, October 30, 2014", "text": "50 apples for $14.00?  That sounds like a deal.  Mix and match even?  I could choose as many as I wanted from the Virginia gold bin, the Winesap bin, the golden delicious bin, the Stayman bin, the Roma bin, the York apples bin and the granny smith bin.  There may have been a few more bins, but I had already filled my half bushel paper sack and was studying the shiny reds, peach blushes and yellows with anticipation as I carried them to the wooden counter just beside a small barn. Since I grew up in a family where money was scarce, bargains on foods tend to catch my eye and the fall abundance of apples always calls to me.  We drive three hours West in a hybrid car and find a local orchard and then buy apples.  Some we eat before we get home and all the others I process and freeze for desserts.  We also were invited to walk the orchards up the steep hill, which after sitting for hours in a car, and with camera in hand, was the best offer I had been given all day.  Almost all of the apples had been picked from the trees, but there was still beauty to capture as the afternoon sun fell across the hillside.Now, back to processing apples---but with a twist!  Stick with me here.  While the texture of a frozen apple is not as crisp once frozen, that fall apple flavor does remain.  We core them with an apple corer, peal them and then slice them into equal sizes keeping the species types apart just for our own preferences.  We immediately put them into a bowl of water and lemon juice to keep them from browning.  Our sweetest and crispest were the Winesaps and they seemed to brown the fastest as well, no matter how snappy we worked...chop chop.When the particular  apple batch is are all done, I take out the slices from the huge bowl and let them drain in my hands before dumping a full pie serving amount into a freezer Ziplok bag labeled by apple type and date.  I add a pre -mixed mixture of cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice to taste, about half a cup of sugar or 1/4 brown and 1/4 white sugar together, and a little salt and a teaspoon or more of cornstarch depending on their juiciness.  I toss the slices a few times to coat them with the bag sealed.  Then, squeezing all the air out of the bags, I pop them into the freezer for winter desserts.With 50 apples hubby and I got an assembly line going.  We were moving like a Japanese train on schedule, but my one glitch was that I had just cleaned out my pantry closet a few days before.  Shelves washed, items moved and reorganized, some items taken to the basement, others to give away.  A photo below showing a part of the closet and clearly illustrating how neat and organized it was!  All the bins were labeled!  The spices in pseudo-alphabetical order.  But a bit of a mistake because ... well, perhaps you can see in the second photo.Yes, I used the jar on the right side.  I did not read the labels!!  Into the first 5 batches of pie filling went Old Bay crab spice! (Something those of us who steam crabs use tons of in the summer.)  Once I discovered my mistake by licking a finger I changed jars and into the last 6 batches went the cinnamon that I was supposed to add.  We labeled those freezer bags that had Old Bay spice because I am too cheap to throw this food out and figured I may find some way to use that mistake. (Maybe stuff apples into chicken or use with a pork roast?)We decided to make a pie that very afternoon with the mistake spices (Old Bay) package...and much to our surprise, while it was not super good without the cinnamon, it was really quite delicious and just a tiny bit unusual.  But we each ate our entire piece of pie and we will certainly finish the rest of the pie!  In the future I will add the pie spices to those batches and perhaps another bit of fruit or nuts and top with butter bits.Hubby just dumped the slices into a pre-made pie shell with some disdain after draining the juices which he felt might be too salty and then he watched it bake not anticipating an edible snack.  But we were both pleasantly surprised.So I posted on FB that I am going to call this my \"Crab Apple Pie.\""},

So, throwing caution to the wind (or whatever trite expression you want to insert here), I dropped hubby off at the son's house, plugged in my destination, and headed deep into the bowels of the city.  The mapquest folks wanted to take me straight through the heart of the city to the other side, but with a major marathon taking place as well a numerous streets under construction, I was smart enough to program a bypass way.I allowed myself about 20 minutes extra time, and I still arrived 5 minutes late!  Every parallel parking space left on the side streets was 4 inches too short for my compact car.  I finally found a space just in front of the bus stop and three blocks away, but not blocking any city buses.  I backed in and locked the car rushing off all the while praying I had not misread the signs and would not be towed!When I had gone online I saw that the meeting was in one of those tall brick apartment buildings on a tree shaded street.  I had written my gal friend about an apartment number, but she said she did not have one, so I assumed we would meet out front, in the side yard or the lobby.   I got to the building exactly 3 minutes late, opened the door and found I could not move beyond the little entry room and was faced by the dial-in directory.  It has been years since I have used directories in apartment buildings but I figured out how to scroll through the two dozen names and nothing seemed familiar.  I paused.  I did not have my gal friend's phone number...just her email.  I dialed into the email on my phone and just 15 minutes earlier I saw she had emailed the name of the person giving the class and the apartment number.  With a little old-age dyslexia I finally got buzzed in and headed up two flights of stairs.  Reading small print on apartment directories and going up two flights of stairs...challenges that rarely give the 30-ish crowd pause...already had me a little out of breath.As I entered the cute little apartment, I saw the other young ladies had already started on their  mimosas and brief introductions were made.  I found it easy to fit in and soon the class was started.  It was nothing super-special...something I could easily have picked up in a book on my own or watching a YouTube video...but my learning experience this day was far more important than this class, and perhaps, not something these single gals would not understand at this time in their lives?Oh, this is what I took home at the end of class...yes it got knocked around a little in the car...but so did I!So what thing gives you more than pause...what gives you a terrifying bit of time?"},

{"title": "Broken", "date": "Tuesday, October 14, 2014", "text": "I was thinking about the comments that I got from my last post about the young man in the grocery store.  I guess I did give the impression that I looked down my nose at grocery clerks.  I do not, although it is not a job I would want to have.  I respect anyone who can stand on their feet all day and deliver a presence in their work and still have the energy to be pleasant and make small talk.  I also realize that it was my shortsightedness that indicated he would have no future in this career path.My own view on savings, though, comes from my history.   I had to save money all of my life, even when I was a kid.  Money was set aside for holiday gifts long before stuff for myself.  As I got older, a certain percentage was set aside for college expenses.  Maybe I felt free of money pressures when I was under ten, but never after that.  I grew up in a family where saving money was as important as praying is in other families.  Save for life improvement, save for a rainy day and if there was some left over save for something fun.I never went on vacations (except for camping or visiting relatives) until much, much, later in my life.   As a young woman clothes were purchased when necessary and repaired as needed.  Fashion was considered a way to lose money easily.   We grew much of our own food.  I sewed most of my clothes and those of my children...all as a means of saving money.  I am now in a very different economic group ( I think, due in part, to being frugal in my youth), and feeling thankful if sometimes a little embarrassed for that. I have a republican nephew who feels strongly that poor people are poor because they are lazy and stupid and that liberals are short-sighted in wanting to raise the minimum wage to reward these low-class people who have demonstrated a lack of effort in furthering themselves.  He thinks that hamburger flippers are stupid for taking such a low paying job in the first place.  He feels you make your own breaks.  To a small extent he is right.  But to a large extent chaos reigns in peoples lives and many people get broken through no fault of their own.But for a liberal such as I, when in front of such a cavalier young earner as my grocery clerk in this day and age, I almost think a little more like a republican."},

The whole point of travel is to stretch your mind and test your ideas and learn new ways of seeing the world, and to be happy that the ugly American has not ruined it for us all.  You can see all the stone edifices, drink and eat at all the pubs, and take all the tours, but the real richness is in meeting the people, the ones you can actually have one on one time with.  While I have photos of lots of interesting buskers, tour guides, shop owners, etc, the time we spent at two B&Bs on our adventure is one the best ways to talk to real citizens of the area you are visiting.  B&B owners are some of the most interesting characters because they usually love being a host or hostess, and therefore, you get a genuine feel for the area.  They love to answer questions, to tell tales of their country, and tell tales of other visitors.  Unfortunately, while Ireland has many B&Bs, as the older owners retire, new B&Bs are not being opened and the numbers of B&Bs are shrinking.One B&B where we stayed was just outside of Galway.  The owners were the ones that told us that the first day of the International Galway Oyster Festival was the very next night ...which also happened to have free admission!   So, we headed out that Friday evening and Hubby was looking forward to tasting a few of the famous Irish oysters.   He was impressed...although the prices were not cheap.  The festival band was truly energetic and fun!  I had a camera backpack and camera and had no where to leave them (that is my excuse), but hubby was hands-free and joined in the merriment.  By the third Irish dance the young girls were down to their tank tops and other young men joined the circle.  I was a little surprised that more people were not dancing.  The band also played for professional Irish dancers in between times.  What a pleasurable experience!  You cannot listen to Irish music and not at the very least tap your foot.Since my readers seem to want to learn more about this trip I will next post photos of our two hours watching people hurl in a bar in Dublin...;-)"},
{"title": "Those Oldies But Goodies--Part I", "date": "Friday, October 03, 2014", "text": "I selected 14 photos to represent the vast history and the interesting architecture of the island of Ireland.  If you have no desire to see someone else's \"slide show,\" I will understand.Ireland has a rich and ancient history and  we were able to see all kinds of buildings and ruins in our quick week.  I will post just a few here.  Lets start with the oldest.  A neolithic stone circle dating to the bronze age and also known as Druids Circle.  This one is the Stone of Kenmare which is a five minute walk from the center of the town of Kenmare.  There was an honesty box for a small fee to enter, and we were the only ones there on that afternoon which made it most spiritual and enjoyable!  There was a thorn tree hung with prayer ribbons and whatnot, but not so much stuff as to clutter the tree or the peace of the place.Keeping on the history time-line we visited the burial tombs from the 12th Century.  This one in the photo below found in the area called the Burrens, named after a clan that lived and ruled in the Cork County Area, was haunting.  The Burrens is 260 kilometers of limestone pavements criss-crossing the hillsides.  In the 1640's Cromwells surveyor described it as a \"savage land, yielding neither water enough to drown a man, nor tree to hang him,nor soil enough to bury.\"  The limestone surface we saw dated from 10,000 years ago.  Winters rarely go below 43F in winter and above 59F in summer and thus it has a long and mild growing season with lovely alpine flowers in the cracks in the stone in the spring.  The last photo below is the Poulnabrone portal tomb where human bones had been found.We also saw the Cliffs of Moher on this region, but I will spare you at least some photos!More modern in time are the ruins of castles and we saw three in one day.  I wish we could have stayed in one, but it was too rich for my traveling companions and it is always good to leave some reason to return. There are ruins of castles all over Ireland!  The most famous is, perhaps, Blarney Castle.  The Blarney Stone is believed to be half of The Stone of Scone upon which the Kings of Scotland were crowned and was believed to have come from Jerusalem.  Half the stone is now in Edinburgh, Scotland and the other half in Blarney according to legend.   The owner makes money on these legends, but it seems that no one really knows the real history of the stone.  To kiss the Blarney Stone you have to lean backwards out of the parapet.  While some of my party kissed the stone, I am full of way too much blarney and passed.The Rock of Cashell has a stunning view of the countryside as well as the ruins of a distant Abbey in the second photo below.   The buildings included in the complex: 12th century round tower, High Cross and Romanesque Chapel, 13th century Gothic cathedral, 15th century Castle and the restored Hall of the Vicars Choral.  You must take the tour as the history is worth it.  You can see in the photo below that they are working to maintain the walls of the chapel which are beginning to erode from moisture.And then on our trip we saw the more modern buildings such as Christ's Church Cathedral in Dublin where we actually got to ring the bells!!  I had watched an old British mystery on TV which revolved around the bell ringers of a small village church.  I never realized how much strength and balance goes into ringing bells as well as how dangerous it can actually be!  I was totally out of breath by the end of the few minutes I pulled that rope. Three of us rang at one time and we had to remain in sync.  The first one to ring had to get the rhythm and ended up ringing for the longest,  I was the last to join in with the assistance of the \"Towerkeeper\" and I was certainly out of breath by the end. And finally Trinity College also in Dublin where the young man, our guide, was both funny and knowledgeable.  It was his last tour as he had graduated and was on to bigger and better things...journalism.  We, of course, saw the Book of Kells and passed by the shelves of the many rare books in that same library.  (Note his \"Harry Potter\" jacket which all tour guides are required to wear.  It is so old that the black has faded to green.)It amazes me that these leather bound books are in bright sunlight and even some areas had windows open!  We were told that books were shelved according to size rather than subject!Well that is a brief review of the structures made of stones.  There is a lot of stone on the island!!"},

Then I arrived home the same Monday around 9:00 P.M. in the evening East Coast time but about 2:00 A.M. vacation country time, and I yet I still survived!  As some of you guessed it was a trip to Ireland.   I never had the chance to visit this Emerald Aisle, and this time ventured forth with my son and his wife and her parents.I took over 2,000 photos, the sun shined about 80% of the time, we got lost very briefly a few times, we saw a LOT of the island, we lucked out several times, and we had a stupendous trip. We (hubby) was successful in driving on the left side of the road in both the cities and along the very narrow country roads.  We mostly followed our son's car as his phone GPS was more accurate than our rented Garmin GPS.I will not bore you with all the pictures as travel photos can be a bit of a drag after the first 4 or 5!!  I will post a few in a themed review in the coming posts just to share for those who like to see another's travel experience or who have an interest in going someday.I learned that paying for most of the tourist tours is really worth it.  The Irish are great at telling tales and keeping you informed about the castle, or factory, or garden, or history of the place you visit.  They are truly friendly and VERY helpful.  We did not make it to Northern Ireland, which I am told is more somber and reserved and really another country.All of the people I traveled with had various percentages of Irish blood in their veins (and since there are more Irish people outside of Ireland than on the island, perhaps even I have a drop of such blood ;-) and perhaps this is what made the trip so wonderful.  Bits and pieces to follow.(My cough was suppressed by heavy duty codeine which also helped with sleep!  I am slowly returning to normal.)"},

{"title": "A Review:  Movies and Holidays", "date": "Monday, September 01, 2014", "text": "We had those 4 young people Friday and Saturday.  The first day was quiet with wine on the dock and good conversation.  A crab and salmon and freshly harvested oyster dinner went off without a hitch on the deck and the mosquitoes held off until late evening.  Since one of the young men was from Hong Kong, he fully appreciated the fresh seafood even though it was not prepared as he was used to.  The next day was full of loud and busy boating.  Everyone was out on the water from noisy ski-doos with teenage boys hanging on to drooping swimsuits to those super fast useless speed boats filled with bikini-glad dyed blondes and the guy who owns the boat.  Little guys were driving(?) small flat-bottomed fish boats and others were pulling floats behind with small brothers.  We cruised to a nearby pocket beach and snacked on cheeses, deli meats, olives, dried fruits, etc..  The heat was a bit much, but we survived well, except for one small accident by me which I will save for another  post.The couple that is friends of my son and his wife admitted to us they were thinking wedding plans!  It is not an easy road for the following reasons:  her parents are traditional, southern, and very conservative and somewhat religious, his parents are a big noisy Chinese family from Hong Kong with that Asian energy the Chinese bring to any celebration which can be somewhat overwhelming and demanding.  They are also not Christian.  I did not ask what religion or if they belonged to any religion at all, but the young couple were clear it was NOT going to be a church wedding.  They are not wealthy so having to keep all decisions frugal or give in and then let the families fight over who pays for what and thus runs the show...not a good scenario.  (I will let you in on a little secret in that they were thinking and we encouraged that they go ahead and get married secretly by a \"Justice of the Peace\" so that the future husband he can get on the bride's health insurance plan and they \"plan\" another wedding in a few more months when they have saved more money and had time to create a strategy.) The young man from Hong Kong has become bored with his job, and because they have no mortgage, no children, and are in their early 30's, he has decided to leave this job to join a start-up with greater risk but far greater potential but with no health insurance.  I am excited and hopeful for both of them and want to help them in any way without adding to their stress.At the end of the second day this couple left on their way to do other things and son and daughter-in-law stayed on through the evening and next day.  We talked and talked (DIL was drinking wine so I did not ask about their plans for children...although I do know from another source that she is trying to get pregnant.)   Son helped us with our wi-fi and set up a password which I have been trying to do for months.  He also fixed some hardware on a window which had boggled my mind.  We have a great relationship with both of them.  Years ago we were not as close to our son who wanted to be on his own and not keep us in the loop of his merry-go-round life, but he has matured and she has also influenced a change in him.  Our times together are fun, peaceful, and rewarding.  I feel very, very, very blessed.  I am not the easiest person to hang out with if I care about you, so we all have adjusted I am guessing.We did all watch the movie \"Noah\" on TV one night and may I warn you that it is the biggest waste of time.  The acting is the only thing of any merit.  The script is terrible, the plot is weird, the character development non-existent, special effects ho-hum...so do not waste your money.Well, I am now off to do 7 (yes SEVEN) loads of laundry."},

{"title": "Tag, You're It!", "date": "Saturday, August 23, 2014", "text": "While I was roaming the land of Big Skies with two of my favorite males, I got \"tagged\" by Colleen Redman.  I must state that I usually ignore memes, surveys, blog-monkeys...whatever you want to call these infectious bugs that dash through the social networks of digital song and make you dance/sing to their rhythm.  Yet, I have read Colleen's blog for years and since she herself is infectious, I accepted her challenge.This is a very difficult challenge because it is for \"writers.\"  I have just recently begun to see myself as a photographer, and now before I get too old, I guess I must get my mind about whether I am a writer or not.I started writing for fun when I was in grade school.  I kept notebooks that were pasted with photos cut from magazines or bits of nature collected and then I wrote prose or poetry that had emerged (like vomit) in my brain.  It was an addiction and I really never thought about it.  But I had to do it.  In primary and secondary school the writing assignments (fiction or non-fiction) were my favorites.  I am a story person.  I even made up stories about my math figures to get through Algebra!  Blogging is my adult panacea, but I do wish they provided a free editor.Anyway, that is the background for my answers below:What am I writing/working on now? My blog posts, of course.  I just finished a short photo-journal book of the trip for my grandson and it will be a memory gift.  I tried to write in the mind of a 9-year-old and thus it was pretty yucky.  I had started a fictional book months ago and it was such a disappointing venture that it gathers cobwebs on my laptop.  I am always writing poetry in my mind, which sometimes makes it to the page.  I keep thinking I will follow through on a few ideas that are germs in my mind...but this is why I do not see myself as a WRITER.How does my writing differ from other writing in its genre?Unfortunately, I do not think my writing differs much.  My voice is a common one.  I strive for honesty and try to avoid bluntness, but they seem to come hand in hand.  I think that Gandhi had it precisely correct when he said the only God is truth...or something to that effect.  Truth is very hard to capture in words, though.  And I have not yet decided if it is truth that changes or my mind.Why do I write what I write?It is like eating and breathing and loving.  It is something that I HAVE to do.  I am a seeker and I hope that by putting the pen to paper I will find what I seek.  I hope to make astonishing connections and sometimes I actually do, on a smaller and more comfortable scale.How does my writing process work?I do not have a process, which is, of course, the problem.  Consistency is the engine of great writers.  Coffee and early morning and being the only one up are the keys to getting my writing engine going.  I procrastinate on keeping a notebook for all my treasured thoughts as I work through my day.  Colleen keeps a notebook and even more important she can decipher it when she needs to!  I am a people watcher and do have a skill for recognizing a good character...now if I could just weave that into a tapestry of a story.What are my future blog plans?Since I do not have deadlines nor do I get paid for this, I do not have to have a plan.  I still feel a calling to write and would do so even if no one read these words.  When I began blogging in 2004 (before you were born?) I had no plan and thought of it as a private journal.  Then I may have been a better writer in purity of thought and tone---who am I kidding?  Now I am somewhat addicted to \"my readers\" and have them in mind when I write.  It is probably not good for writing that you care how your readers perceive you and sometimes bite your pen.  I will not tag anyone, but would love if any of my readers desired to pick up this tag/flag and run with the ball and any other metaphor you care to use...just let me know."},
{"title": "Time Travel", "date": "Thursday, August 21, 2014", "text": "I have heard of jet-lag but I think I had become infected with time-lag this trip.  I went from seeing old, old, old, friends where I had deep and emotional touchstones, where it was almost as if they were on the other side of a time warp and while my fingers touched quickly, that only happened if my eyes connected at the same time.  Otherwise it was somewhat like rapidly flipping pages in a dusty old photo album.   You try to hang on to the memories of you and them that happened and created part of the puzzle pieces that form bits of what you are today, but you also realize, at least those of us who live great distances away, that this is like visiting an old and favorite movie.  It brings back feelings, but you are not sure that you were a character in that movie...maybe you only watched it one time long ago when you were most impressionable.Those of you of live near where you grew up may not have such a jolt when your paths cross with old friends.  I do not know.  I do know for me it is a bit of  an acid trip.  My energies get drained and I lose my place in time and understanding.This may very well be the last time I see old classmates all together.  It will not be the last time I visit family.  We see each other every few years, but that is mainly due to weddings and children moving across the country.  These will soon dwindle and we will have to make an effort to meet up.  Someone, a sister-in-law whose family lives across the Atlantic Ocean, suggested we needed a big family vacation together.  The last one was in Italy well over a decade ago.  I am up for it this decade, but may not be up for it in decades to come.I do think part of this sweep in emotions was that in the middle I shifted gears to share 9 days with my nine-year-old grandson who is a treasure of a traveler.  I hope he keeps happy memories of this trip because we were all in a super genetic link with similar interests and energies.  I do not think the link will be so smooth with the other two when their time comes for such a trip.OK...next I will take on Colleen's TAG...!"},
{"title": "As Luck Would Have It", "date": "Tuesday, August 19, 2014", "text": "So the first Sunday in Colorado was going to be a rather long day.  I had a 50th High School reunion at a local small town restaurant (there were only 21? in my graduating class and only 7 showed!).  It was an emotion-filled thing with many having passed recently including one of the men helping to organize the event.  We all are talkers and I did not get to any really in depth conversations with anyone as we sat around a rather large square table with our spouses and significant others.  No one has changed in personality or interests though. The horse girl is now a horse lady and she forgave my best friend and I for TP-ing her house every Halloween.  It was a big old mansion at the end of Main and we just could not resist.  She is about four feet five with a lovely long gray braid down her back and drives a BIG truck.  My two best girlfriends sat on either side, and as is true with best friends, we found plenty to talk about and started right where we had last left off.  The star quarterback and main basketball player who went to STATE our senior year had shrunk!  He was small in build and shorter than I. What happened???  My old boyfriend was in the process of his second divorce due to having an affair with the pretty blonde lady that he brought to the luncheon.  He is fairly wealthy owning lots of land in the area and seemed to have no problem leaving his house on the lake in a nearby town to his former wife who sadly was fighting cancer. Whatever did I see in him?  The class Valedictorian was still somewhat of a snob, but had spread in size and looked less like a book worm and more like the life coach she had become with her PHD in psychology.  Two of the spouses (men) sat like cigar store Indians, but were not bored, just quiet.  My husband talked almost the entire luncheon with my ex-boyfriend...wish I would have been a fly on the wall there.  Below is the class with partners, only 12, and faces blurred to protect the innocent, although I am guessing that none of us were innocent anymore.Then later that afternoon my family had a get-together BBQ in a nearby town with even MORE food.  Hubby had his birthday that day and I was helping carry out a HEAVY strawberry/chocolate/poke(?) cake in a glass casserole when I missed the 1-inch step down on the patio and went down like a drawbridge just missing the metal table where everyone was sitting.  I landed on two knees and one elbow with the cake in my arms.  I managed to save the cake!  I had whipped-cream on my nose as I struggled up after someone took the cake and no one DARED take a photo.  Actually they were in shock when I stood up and you could have heard a pin drop.  My knee and elbow bruises were ugly...but no broken bones, even though I have osteoporosis.  I sat with ice on the knee for a while and broke out in a sweat due to the shock, but managed to maintain my cool.As luck would have it, all the bruises were superficial and I was able to do all the walking and hiking the next two weeks in Colorado, Wyoming and Montana although the knee bruise got much uglier!  Oh yes,  I did say I saved the cake...didn't I?  (Post Script...my dress pants tore in my fall and luck had it that this happened AFTER the reunion so I did not wear torn pants!)"},

In a press statement released Thursday, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and other House Republican leaders indicated that President Obama could address the crisis “without the need for congressional action,” a statement tinged with some irony given that just the day before, House Republicans had slammed the President with a lawsuit claiming executive overreach\"   This lawsuit is the GOP suing the President for using executive action to delay the implementation of a part of Obamacare...the very bill they tried to repeal dozens and dozens and dozens of times.The House can find no middle ground on an immigration bill which their members claimed three years ago would be done by now.  They do not agree with the Senate version.  Now they want the President to use Executive action to solve the issue so they can take off on five weeks away from the job with perhaps less guilt for their inaction.At least I may be away from the news for some time and that may prevent me from pulling out my hair until I am bald."},
{"title": "Beefcake? and Perhaps a Little Cheesecake?", "date": "Monday, July 28, 2014", "text": "One reader asked if I was writing a romance novel based on the subject of my last post.  No, I am not a big reader or writer of that genre, although I must admit as a much younger woman I consumed my share of bodice rippers with lantern-jawed mysterious men.  Fellow blogger, Rain Trueax, is the romance writer that got me thinking about abs because she has written a number of books that require covers with abs. We talked about cover designs for such books as she does her own.  She has a passion for our country's early history and the wild west and the cultures of that time.  She does extensive research to make her characters come to life so that the story she weaves is more than just romance, and her women are as strong as her men.  If you want to know more about her writing and her books you can go here. Anyway (please read this in an Ellen DeGeneres voice), I had an opportunity to explore more Beefcake the other day.  I went to an event with my children and grandchildren.  This is an event that I would never have gone to on my own, and unless you are a former marine or married to one, I doubt very much you would have ever gone to one of these either.  (By the way it costs $25 a head just to be an observer, so I probably will not go to one of these again!)  Oorah!!There was lots of dust and mud and sweat and blood.  You may not know, but it seems that the term cheesecake actually may have originated in Britain way back in the 1660's!  Sexy (and promiscuous) women were referred to as cheesecakes and tarts.  The few women in the last of my photos in this post are NOT cheesecake and certainly more beefcake.   The theory on the word beefcake is that movie cameramen were the first to use the term in the late 1940s and early 1950s when they discovered that women liked to look at well-honed men and actors started taking off their shirts and smiling in that certain way.These guys above are serious because they clearly are willing to get dirty.  We all know how bad dirt is.This beefcake (with hench woman and child in tow) is not too proud to wear his glasses when the challenge is done.(No comment on the dude immediately above!) Get down there and eat that dirt!NO, the woman in the foreground is not dead or tired, she is actually rolling all the way across to each log.They were moving very slowly by this time as the ropes were super slippery from all the mud.As they walked up to the last few challenges they all looked like the walking dead to me!BUT before they could shower and reveal all those six-packs they still had this last challenge to leap over!  \"Oorah!!\"I know, you are disappointed that these are not as sexy as you had hoped.  Maybe you can go on over to Mage's ComicCon photos as she always manages to catch a sexy type or two and the costumes she photographs are far more intriguing.Oh ... one last photo to let you know why in the heck I was there.

Today I have to vacuum.  It is crazy, please try to keep up.Granddaughter gets picked up on Sunday, tomorrow, for a week with us.  We are making felt fairies, cooking stuff, having a chocolate tasting, swimming and dragging her to the garden class I am teaching with other children on Monday.  I am tired already, but loving the opportunity.Then the week after next week is a break before hubby and I are off to Colorado and Wyoming for two weeks with the 9-year-old grandson to explore geology and nature and sleep in the bowels of a volcano.  He will visit great uncles and aunts and I will attend a high school class reunion as well --- of about 10 of us really old people who are in good enough health to show up!  I am not looking forward to the emotional roller coaster of that luncheon, but I must go.Then it is back home and another week to recover before we get the littlest grandson (four-years-old) for his week of being indulged by grandparents. Summer will be over in the blink of an eye and then just one week to get ready and pack for our Ireland trip.  Son's in-laws are making most of the plans, but, thus far, we have only the Dublin arrival, two days in Ballingcollig, a rental car and two days in Dublin before heading home.  We have the whole middle of the week to fill and I wish they would get on it!Yes, I am tired, you are tired, we are all tired...but we are keeping one foot in front of the other because the alternative is not something I want to dwell on."},

(We were slow enough at one time that I grabbed the camera and shot through the windshield.)We got home to find absolutely NO RAIN in our yard.  It had stopped just a few hundred feet before our neighborhood.  What a bummer.  No glorious sunset either just the last of the clouds above the trees.But I am not complaining one twit as this was a very nice visit to an emergency room and it could have been so much worse.  Do not even get me started about hubby on a ladder without me!!!"},

They have to text messages from cell phones to get confirmation when they think they have solved a part of the puzzle.   I do not think this part of history gets enough promotion.  Oldest grandson, who loves puzzles, did very well.Re-entry after our week away was a slow process as I caught an intestinal and other illness (probably from sharing water bottle with granddaughter or visiting two 'amusement parks') and had to schedule an appointment for antibiotics yesterday.  I actually enjoyed sitting around and reading and going through the mail and sitting close to the bathroom and not seeing the problems in the yard yesterday.Gardeners are the type of people who would rather stay home during the growing season than go off and explore some other parts of the world.  It was daughter who chose this time of year and because we want very much to be with them, we agreed.  We came back to a lot (A LOT) of rabbit devastation.  Almost every one of my sunflowers, some over 6 feet tall, brought down by little teeth.  We were not there to spray with a noxious minty smell every few days and they discovered that sunflowers and parsley were not mint but a delicious breakfast and dinner!  They also dug under the fence of our vegetable garden and we have had a real set back with almost everything planted except the tomatoes, of course.  Fortunately gardeners have a strong heart.On the plus side, the five bluebirds have hatched and are being fed by mom and dad throughout the day.  Feeding five!!  That keeps you busy.I did take a short time to visit the used book store in the store area of Williamsburg and purchased a collection of poems by Pablo Neruda, motivated by my recent read of \"Paula\" by Isabelle Allende, and a memoir written by Katheryn Hepburn on the making of \"African Queen\" which is one of my FAVORITE movies. Today we begin to move deck and patio chairs and small items to  prepare for the tropical storm that is heading up our way. I have many  photos to process.  Actually I took less than 500 for the whole week, so  I am getting more precise in what I want to take.  I have a house to  clean.  We are picking quarts of red raspberries which are not being  totally removed by birds and squirrels.  I have to make an apple  raspberry pie and hubby is putting up pints of raspberry jam.  I have to  do all this before we may lose electricity in the next day or two!!"},
{"title": "A Summary", "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2014", "text": "Did you ever stop and look at yourself in the moment and think ... \"I never thought I would be this cliche.\" ?  Perhaps most of us like to think we are unique and a multi-prismed person of fascinating interests and activities.  We are thus different from the masses.  Yet, I  must admit that I am not.I am one side of a set of grandparents that own a time share that is movable.  I am one of a set that vacations with grandchildren in all the traditional places such as beaches, cottages by lakes, amusement parks, major historical monuments. I am one of a set that loads a car to the brim and overflowing with bicycles, towels, coolers, snacks, games, drinks and DVDs.  One of those people I used to observe never thinking I was anywhere like that.  (Just look at that knobby-kneed grandma attempting to fit one more cooler into the back of that van!  Look at that balding man trying to get his bike lock around both old bikes!)I have a son-in-law and daughter who manage to program every single hour of every single day on a family vacation.  We can go to a place that my husband and I went to years ago and see far more of it than I ever knew was there!  Of course, much of it is geared for a younger audience and that is why we bypassed it.Son-in-law is adamant that every single thrill ride MUST be experienced.  He does push to include the kids, but since they are young he cannot get them on EVERY ride.  He is into mathematical data and knows which one has the most turns or goes the highest or has the biggest drop and maintains a memory list of those he has experienced as closely as a birder keeps his life list.  As he described a ride I would be terrified.Of course time must be left to stand in lines (they were very short this year) for rides that barely move but make the small kids think they are running the show. And grandparents forced time to be left for the animal shows, the stage shows and the diving shows.  With the price of tickets we felt these shows were really high end and professional. No, it isn't Broadway...it IS an amusement park.Daughter wants to hit the TravelAdvisor's top rated restaurants and we include as many as we can within limited budgets and small children's tastes.  Both parents set aside an evening to hit the outlets.  Son-in-law got several free vouchers for the golf course so he worked that into the very end of the day and skipped a few dinners with us.Hubby really wants to be anywhere on the water, but when he cannot do that he is happy with a history lesson or two or just spending 20 minutes talking to the stranger next in line.  His neck surgery means he can no longer go on crazy rides, but his ego is small and he will ride the smallest of rides with grandson.We did sleep in every morning until about 8:00 and then were out of the unit by 9:30 and not home again until after 7:00.  I was amazed and glad that the little ones had no melt-downs and were able to keep up with their parents.  It was a very telling time when the oldest boy, nine, did say on the last day he was looking forward to getting home as he was getting tired of going to \"fun places.\"  When I commented that they were so upper middle class, I did get a surprised look from Dad.Never knew I would be one of those folks who go on master vacations.  I used to be the weekend camper.  Times change."},

{"title": "Long Weekend", "date": "Thursday, June 12, 2014", "text": "Last weekend we celebrated Father's Day, yes, early.  My daughter had planned a long weekend away in a (another) state campground at some rustic cabins knowing that my husband loved being in the outdoors hiking all day and then sitting around a campfire as the sun set and dinner was cooked over an open fire.  My daughter, who has a very demanding job as a director of some such or other and is the mother of three all under nine, planned all the activities, made the reservations, planned the menus, and packed all the food, and packed all the stuff needed for her three children as well.  This cannot be my gene pool, but perhaps I can ride the thrilling tail of this rocket.  My son and his wife also joined us.We always have S'mores (graham crackers, campfire toasted marshmallows and chocolate sections all put together like a sandwich) for dessert in the summer if there is a fire.   But this time daughter saw one of those new Pinterest ideas and also packed some sugar cones, miniature marshmallows, chocolate chips and sliced strawberries and whole bananas to slice.  When the oldest grandson saw all this chocolate and sweet stuff he said gleefully, \"Wow.  This isn't going to be a very healthy camping trip!\"  We filled the cones with the above, wrapped them in heavy duty foil and then placed them on the very warm coals at the end of our meal of foil dinners (meat, veggies, etc.) to heat up for a few minutes before dessert.  They were delicious and cool enough to be handheld!I could post a bunch of photos to prove all the fun we had on trails, on rocky outlooks, at the top of spruce forests and at one huge waterfall, but instead I will tell you that we went to the mountains of West Virginia and got lost several times on winding dusty roads with no signs before we found our cabins tucked away in some lone valley.  When we reached the campground we struggled for some time before we got the lock combination on the road gate to work so that we could get in.  Hubby forgot the fire starters, but being a former Eagle Scout he managed to get enough twigs, with grandchildren help,  to start a great campground fire.  Son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter were the only ones who could carry a tune while son played his guitar, but it still made for a lovely accompaniment to our evening fire sitting.  And one little mouse managed to eat through the plastic cooking oil container during the night which kept me a bit awake in my sleeping bag in the dark and otherwise silent cabin.  We still managed to end up smiling all the way there and back.Some of the pretty photos of the great outdoors will go on my other blog."},

That is an amazing thing,” they told me. When you consider the nearly infinite number of forks in the road that lead to any single person being born, they said, you must be grateful that you’re you at this very second. Think of the enormous number of potential alternate universes where, for example, your great-great-grandparents never meet and you never come to be. Moreover, you have the pleasure of living on a planet where you have evolved to breathe the air, drink the water, and love the warmth of the closest star. You’re connected to the generations through DNA — and, even farther back, to the universe, because every cell in your body was cooked in the hearts of stars. We are star stuff, my dad famously said, and he made me feel that way.\"The man, of course, was Carl Sagan, a magical, happy, elf of a man who loved his universe.  The newer version of a Cosmos explorer, Neil deGrasse Tyson, is more of a teddy bear type who can scare you ever so slightly with his passion for knowledge.  Yet, I feel safe with him as a guide through this universe, as well.Thus, when thinking about death, I think about Carl Sagan and I get more Zen about life."},

I missed the busy sound of the neighbor on my left side this week and find from a phone call from his wife that he had a \"hard\" pearl shaped blockage in an artery and had to have bypass surgery.  He is still in a lot of pain.I used to joke with my husband that if he kept going down to check on his trees in the ravine he needed to let me know because he could pass out and I would never know where he was.  This is no longer a joke. I admit that I think about how I would deal with life if he passed on before me.  I envision we have decades ahead of us, but no one really knows how much time they have, do they?  I wonder if I would have the strength I see in the women around me and the bloggers in front of me.(About fifteen years ago I told my son at dinner that I hated when the phone rang because I was afraid that one of my parents had passed on.  He looked at me with that insightful realization we all get at sometime in our lives. Both parents have since passed on, but I still hate the sound of the phone ringing in the early evening or at night. )"},

I have problems with our soldiers families living on food stamps after protecting Afghans from an invasion in their country with a U.S. Congress that has vetoed several veteran's support bills this past year that may have also avoided this health care issue.

{"title": "City Conversations", "date": "Friday, May 23, 2014", "text": "I was at a LARGE eyeglasses shop trying to select new frames for my new prescription.  I update my glasses about once every 5 or 6 years because insurance covers such a small part and I tend to like only those designer frames.  I think eyeglass frames are the biggest rip-offs on the face of the planet and if I had decided to be a designer, that is the direction I would have headed.But this is not about my going slowly blind and broke.  This is about the people one meets on that journey. On my drive to the large shopping center with the large eyeglass store (I spend way to much time the country and am impressed by size) I noticed an unusual number of women wearing headdress in hijabs walking along the roadways and in the housing areas as I approached the mall.  These were the traditional dark lengthy coverings with neutral head covers...not the exotic mysterious clothing where only netted space for eyes is allowed.  They were all ages, some alone and some in groups.  It reminded me years ago when shopping this same mall I rarely heard English spoken in the stores.  I rarely heard any accent I recognized spoken although all the shoppers were at that time all in western dress.Now I see many Middle Eastern people in western and traditional dress wandering the mall.  The eyeglass store employed ONLY Mid-Eastern people, all dark skinned, dark haired, dramatic looking people speaking with Mid-Eastern accents. When I had selected my expensive eye wear and handed the tray to one of the clerks, she bubbled brightly helping me choose among the selection as hubby has not a clue.  As we measured my eyes, talked about the gazillion choices in lens types she was most friendly before turning me over to a young man for the sale.  He and I discussed  discounts, insurance, and warrenty and as we waited for the computer to change screens, I said something about data and expressed that probably the NSA was inputting my eye prescription to their database and that was the slow-down. The young man with a mustache and wearing glasses looked away from the computer screen and smiled and said (he had little or no accent) that he was sure the NSA was tracking him and his computer and phone calls.I asked if he thought that was because he was from the Mid-East.  He responded that \"No.\" he had been born in Connecticut, but his mother was from Afghanistan and currently worked as a contractor for the US Army and was in Afghanistan translating.  We talked briefly about the book \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\" by Khaled  Hosseini and \"In My Father's Country\" by Saima Wahab, the latter a true story about a woman who was doing what his mother was doing. Like US Southern writers, Middle-Eastern writers have their unique style which means they tend to have a rich way of describing things and a great complexity in their characters.The flamboyant, dramatic looking woman returned at the end of the sale to measure me for sunglass frames which were next on my way into debt.  Since we had been chatting so comfortably about love and marriage and having children...something us old folks can get young folks to do...I asked why there were so many people from Afghanistan in this area.  She responded that the Afghan government paid for them to go to school here, paid for their airfare, their schooling, their living expense and their health care!  She could not explain why this area was the one selected, but we were close to DC so that might have something to do with it.  Clearly they brought their large families along.I could not help but feel chagrined that we send our young men and women to live in tents, eat canned or dried food, and risk their lives every day, so that these very wealthy citizens of another country can come here.It did not ease the sour feeling in my gut when upon leaving I passed a beautiful young woman in a flowing pastel silk hijab sitting on a bench in the mall center using her cell phone which was attached to a huge jewel-encrusted chain around her neck looking like someone who belonged on Rodeo Drive in California...or more likely in a nightclub in the Mid-East."},

{"title": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Not What One Would Think", "date": "Friday, May 16, 2014", "text": "(This post is lengthy but important so please take time to read it all the way through.)I am pretty sure that the average person has a pre-conceived idea of what a Master Gardener is.  Perhaps you think they are people who know the names of 99% of the plants in a garden, people who know what soil Ph is by looking at it, people who have answers to every disease or pest problem in your garden, and people who have truly lovely yards.  Well, you are wrong, wrong, wrong.  Yes a very few Master Gardeners can fit into this mold above, but most are really environmentalists with a tendency to like learning about science and a lot like you in other ways.  Their lives are busy and they get distracted and they make mistakes in their yards.  But, having written that, I admit that I got a little anal before having 12 Master Gareners come to look at my yard for an evaluation on whether it was Bay Wise ... good planting decisions to improve water quality for our rivers and bays.Wanted colleagues to see my yard in the spring when things are blooming and weeds have not taken over.I am the type of gardener that just lets stuff grow when and where it likes after I plant it.  This is the Master Gardener hodge podge bed.  I almost lost all of this dianthus to moles but soaked the bed with a mixture of cod liver oil and soap and that seemed to discourage them this year.Master Gardener yards can range from floral displays to woodland hollows, to a simple lawn and vegetable garden.  They do view yard work as therapy and prefer that to watching TV.  They do have a love of eating fruits and vegetables and tend to be purists if these are not freshly picked.  They do tend to avoid planting exotics that can be invasives.  You will not find a butterfly bush (Buddleia) in a Master Gardener's yard.  Yes, we love butterflies.  But this bush is somewhat invasive (in 8 states), does not provide any food for the larva of butterflies and other beneficial insects although it does provide nectar.  Therefore, why not plant something that allows butterfly babies to grow? I will not ask you to dig up your butterfly bush, but please do not plant more when there are other shrubs that are good for butterflies.  (It is a controversial plant but I tend to agree with this lady.)I had to wait sometime before I would allow Master Gardeners to judge my garden as to whether it would pass the Bay Wise test.  The test is really easy to pass, but I did not want them to see the mistakes I had made.  I dug up my butterfly bush, my black bamboo (it was lovely for 4 years before it started to take off), and all of the Miscanthus (a tall grass that looks very lovely but is also invasive and is not eaten by deer and seeds are not eaten by birds.)  Some nurseries will tell you they sell a non-invasive version of this grass...yeah, they tend to say that about a LOT of plants.  They also sell or sold thousands of ornamental pear trees for subdivisions and road sides that were supposed to be sterile and they can be found growing extensively along the edges of roads and highways in the mid-Atlantic.  (We do have a native Miscanthus but no one sells it.)In the photo above was the last invasive I had yet to remove (red arrow).  It is isolated but still spread seeds in the cracks which I have to pull.  It is Catmint Walker's Low.  Yes it is related to the mint family and that is why it is an invasive.  It spreads by seeds and runners.  It has the most beautiful blue fringey flowers each summer  and gets to stay one more year until I can find something that is the same color, shape and bloom time.If you research you can find nurseries that sell native plants and can tell you where they grow best.  Yes, SOME natives are as invasive as some non-natives, but you can feel less guilty and know that there are natural predators. Above two photos show my ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolias).  This one is a cultivar as it is lime green and tends to be smaller than the 8 feet high version.  It is native, tolerates a huge range of soils and moisture levels, and blooms in May, and makes a lovely hedge or single mounding plant when trimmed.  Called ninebark because the bark exfoliates.  NOTE not everything in my yard is native.I was judged on whether I encouraged wildlife.  I have bird houses, piles of broken branches, bird baths, and hummingbird feeders and lots of downed trees as food for everything under the sun.  We do not (actually in my area ... another post...CANNOT) bring down dying or dead trees (example is second photo below).  In the photo immediately above the right arrow is pointing to my butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa) related to the milkweed.  I thought the winter had killed this native.  It is hard to grow from seed, but I will keep trying.  It is one of the few plants that the larva of Queen and Monarch butterflies eat.  Butterflies and humming birds love it.Above photos are NOT the ugly.  The compost container which hubby waters and shovels monthly from side to side makes the best compost for top dressing of our gardens in the fall.  We have a jar in the kitchen for all scraps except animal products that go into this area along with shredded leaves and grass that we add later in the summer.  Right now all grass is mowed with a mulching blade and returned to the lawn.  Yes, it makes for messy walking and grass clippings in the house, but it is much healthier for the lawn.  Beyond that is a pile of weedy roots that we hope to cook through out the summer.  And then in the far end is the weeds that need to be burned and cannot go into the compost pile.  I learned from this recent yard visit that timing for burning weeds has to be carefully done.  If the pile has been sitting a while and it is spring you should avoid a burn because you will kill a lot of insects!  (And of course you have to check for those silly wrens.)  The photo above the compost pile is a holding bed where I dump the extra iris (an other stuff) until I can find them a home.  We also hang on to most of the wood that falls into the yard for winter fires.Now to the ugly.I do plant about 6 to 8 roses in my garden.  But these are really the bad children of the garden.  They require too much fertilizer that can run off onto the storm water, they require applications for fungus and pests, which can kill important pollinators and insects and they require lots of water.  Master Gardeners do grow roses (one in my group just bought 30 new plants to replace his winter kill.)   But we have to be aware that they are not the most environmental part of your yard.  I am using a systemic fertilizer/pesticide applied three times a year at the base of each plant to avoid sprays that are soooo dangerous to everything and to keep the toxins as local as possible.  Fungicides (and pesticides) are killing our honeybees and many other pollinators and larva...PLEASE BE CAREFUL with them.  Hubby is going to a colloidal spray (clay) for our fruit trees this year to avoid toxic applications.We were evaluated on how we watered our plants, how we treated our lawn, whether we had native plants, whether we planned for wildlife, our use of chemicals and how we controlled stormwater runoff.  We were not evaluated on flowers and landscaping.  And we passed!!  I got a \"Demonstration\" sign which is one level up from a Bay Wise sign.  No, it will not stay in this bed as it looks odd, but this is where we took the photo.  The sign cannot go out to the end of our long driveway as I understand some idiots steal them!  So I will move it to the beginning of the beds and hope people notice and ask about it!  (And yes I am a bit anal as all the pottery is color coordinated with the house.)"},

This is an important visit that I have promised this group for over a year.  I hope I pass their test, but what they really want to see is a living shoreline that we put in.Do me a favor.  Scratch all that stuff off your list and enjoy spring for me.  Tell me what you see and how you feel.  Thank you."},
{"title": "Rainy Mondays or Tuesdays or Whatever", "date": "Tuesday, April 29, 2014", "text": "During rainy days, instead of sitting back and reading or watching TV, I let that Puritan work ethic define most of the hours as I discover lots of little chores to complete indoors.  These are chores that I put off because they usually offer little reward when they are finished and many of them are tasks that I will have to re-do again and again in the months ahead.  It seems that I have this impracticable goal of getting everything tidy and pristine permanently.  All I need to do is just try hard enough.  I naively think that once things are straightened I just have to use some self-discipline and they will stay straightened indefinitely.  After all, there are no more children or pets to rearrange my life. But there IS still me, myself and I!   All three of us are like dervishes with a consumer fetish.  I have an endless dyslexic reading habit, leaving small piles of magazines, bits of mail, brochures and maps, to-do lists and various books (even with the Kindle) upon coffee and bedside tables and counters.  The piles grow in height until they start to lean, then slide and then in gay abandon tumble to the floor in a loose fan of spontaneity.  You are about to enter the dark world of Tabor, which guests never see!I have an endless photography habit and leave my cameras, lenses, filters, binoculars, batteries, chargers and manuals in little corners and on shelves, where I place them out of the way but not out of sight, until the photography bug bites me again with a special angle of the sun or sunset or tweak of bird.  The tripod must not be closed into compaction and stands with legs askew to trip unwary visitors (or burglars) at the front door, because who knows when I might need it?  (That elephant artwork was done by my oldest grandson and will hang in that space until I die.)My camouflage jacket will hang carelessly over the bannister until warm weather prevents me from using it at all.My huge, it IS huge, walk-in closet becomes a repository for a small pile of garden garb worn just that morning that is not dirty enough to put into the laundry but it is still too dirty to put away.  (This habit is a hangover from living on a farm where one saved work clothes for just a while longer.)  My closet also has the overnight bag, from a recent visit to my daughter's, that I have not yet unpacked, sitting in the middle of the floor.  Then there is the exercise apparel draped over a chair that sometime in this century I will wear once again for a brief session in the basement in my attempt to remain forever young.My box of purses sits on the floor under other containers just to the side since the transition to spring causes me to go through a series of selections of ugly bags before I finally settle on something to get me through the summer.  None of these are designer items, and therefore, they are really ugly.  (Not to say that designer bags are always lovely, and not to say that with courage I could throw half of these purses away and never miss them.)The kitchen always needs tidying up, but we actually eat at home, so that is and always will be a normal endless task.The garage has a fertility corner where pots reproduce like rabbits and garden tools form a tangled clutter like wall flowers at a Sadie Hawkins dance.  I restack them once again.  For some reason, long after fall has retreated, dried leaves tuck themselves everywhere and must be swept out monthly.  Various plant stakes and wire supports tend to lean away from the wall where they have been carefully hung to grab me with devilish glee as I unload groceries, so on a monthly basis I tuck them flat again and again.And, one of these days, I will remember to get at all those cobwebs that weave and wave on all the hanging light fixtures hanging nine feet above my head and which I only notice five minutes before company arrives. Bring on the rain.  Rainy days never ever get me down.  I am too wicked, and anyway, there is no rest for people like me."},
{"title": "Buying Love", "date": "Sunday, April 27, 2014", "text": "Have you ever paid for love?  I think that is what I was doing last night but not consciously.  Really.  I invited my daughter out with her husband for dinner in honor of her 39th birthday.  There is no way I am celebrating her 40th!  I said I would pay for the babysitter and dinner.  (Did you know babysitters get $17.00 an hour where she lives?)  I told her to pick the restaurant (the more expensive was already booked, thank goodness) and she wanted very much to try some new one that had just opened in March on the Harbor in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.  We invited my son and his wife to join us in this birthday celebration of their sister/sister-in-law.The pre-dinner special cocktails were grand - mine was Stella Credente (rum and lime juice).  The appetizers were marvelous and exotic - mine was blue runner jack sashimi with fried sea beans. The salads we did not try to save room for entrees.  The entrees were small and sophisticated - mine was a half order of smoked potato gnocchi followed by olive poached halibut.  All were delicious and different.  The desserts were good and even some were great. This restaurant sits on Washington Harbor and as a good omen, the heavy rain stopped and the sun broke out just as we got there!  We stayed for about an hour and a half and did not leave until dark.  We laughed, told jokes on each other, shared memories of recent trips, bragged and complained about the grandchildren, and in general, had a MAHVELOUS evening.Kennedy Center in the background.I could look around the spacious dining room and the main crowd did not even start showing up until 8:00 P.M.  The customers were so high-end that even hubby, who has not a clue about fashion, mentioned to son-in-law, \"Did you see those guys in the power suits at that long table?\"  (My daughter wore dress jeans, so you realize nothing is formal anymore.)The Chef's wife who is the \"Director of Customer Relations,\" stopped by to see if we enjoyed our meal, which we most certainly did, and joked with us and talked about her Italian husband.  They also own another high end restaurant in the city.I sprung for the 6 dinners, drinks and asked S.I.L and son to pick up the tip. Perhaps, most of you would find the amount of the bill a jaw-dropping shocking amount, as did I,  and a few others of you would be pretty passive about such figures if you are in a higher income bracket, but I really wanted to treat them all and I cannot take money with me into the next life.  I do not think I have ever spent this much money for a night out!  And the wine was not $100 a bottle! Young folks as my daughter who take clients to dinner, do not think twice about spending money like this on a dinner, but we are on a fixed income and not that cavalier on a monthly basis.Maybe I was buying love, but I felt I was throwing a party!  You can't take it with you and there is always the chance that someone will take it away from us in future years the way this world is going.  Anyway, if you are ever in town, get someone to take you there and pick up the tab!"},

(Oh my.)  AND I finally got my bedroom window coverings last week.  I am not a drape person and so I went with the clean lines of Roman shades. Below you can see why hubby hates to cut off the view of the river.But there was an interesting aspect of these drapes I had not expected.  They even play nicely against the sunset.  On the window ledge are silhouettes of bottles that I collected off of a reef while living in the South Pacific decades ago.  They are probably hospital medicine bottles with one ink bottle (the largest) from a Japanese hospital that was there in the 1900s.I am now a happy camper."},
{"title": "Volunteers", "date": "Monday, April 14, 2014", "text": "I went out today with a group of volunteer ladies that work regularly on the nearby museum grounds.  I had become in involved in this volunteer effort full force last year taking leadership responsibility for the bureaucratic problems in trying to buy plants, getting the mulch scheduled, sending out updates via email, maintaining email lists, coordinating suggestions and editing plant lists and keeping it all on an environmental track.  I discovered that it was a bit like herding cats.  Some of the women were at the museum several days weekly and took it upon themselves to make plant removal decisions or schedule other decisions without letting everyone know.  Their husbands volunteered in other departments at the museum and they were there more often than I.The hired maintenance staff (two men) while praising us when they saw us, clearly saw their job as sitting on a mower once a week and maintaining stuff indoors.  When they wear white shirts to work, you know they do not see themselves as landscape staff!  They actually seemed to think that 60-year-old and older women could maintain the rather large grounds of the museum on our own.  They made little effort to assist with hose repairs, getting the water unlocked, and keeping wheelbarrows easily available from the storage shed although I must admit they are very, very polite.  Today we actually had to lift the wheelbarrows out and over some new-fangled BBQ machinery that had been slid in right at the door for pulling out.  I also had to help these gals lift 40 pound bags of soil this morning as I was afraid someone was going to injure their back.  I am thankful that I can still do stuff like that at my age, but I also am very careful each time I do lifting anyway. Keeping moving...keeping moving.As you may remember, at the end of the last season I let the dear ladies know I was resigning as leader and would volunteer as I could, but my relationship to the museum was not as regular as theirs.  (There were also other politics going on that I was not sure of...\"he said we should do it this way and she said to do it that way\"... and that made me more than irritated some days.)Well, now I show up when I can squeeze in a morning.  Nothing, of course, has changed.  No one seems to know what is going on.  We had to redo two beds by the front gate and the water had not been turned on, so the plants were transplanted in the hot afternoon waiting for tonight's' rain.  I had been willing to haul plastic buckets of water to the gate...but since no one could find the water key, even that effort was not useful!  One dear lab technician went to his tool kit behind one of the labs and tried a small wrench, but to no avail.  A huge aster that was supposed to be divided and replanted in the fall never got scheduled and so I was told to shovel and pull and dig and tear at this monster with its new spring growth already 4 inches high.The museum director is a good guy, but he is in the middle of a huge remodel and a grand re-opening in just a few weeks, so I could not even begin to approach him on the issue and his assistant is gone somewhere---wise woman.  They will just have to throw money at brightly colored annual plants the week before and plant then everywhere that is needed.This is a textbook case in how to NOT treat volunteers that save you thousands of dollars in your budget."},

Yesterday we helped son level his lawn to his newly purchased home.  The side lawn was full of dog holes and tree root veins that had collapsed.  It was a great place for spraining an ankle or twisting a back in a fall.  We had agreed to help him with this (which I failed to mention in the prior post) and thus stuck by our word.  We had just not been good about getting a time solidified and that was why it was a bit of a surprise.In the photo below are 12 bags of top soil and compost...each weighing a ton.  He had to have them delivered this way because he does not have a driveway or garage and companies would only deliver like this.  The four of us moved all 12 tons, spread it on the lawn in two layers, pulled a 250 pound roller after each layer, then seeded with lawn seed, and raked it in.  Today, if son makes it out of bed, he is going to cover the area with peat moss (could not get straw/hay bales) and then spend the next two weeks watering it carefully twice a day.  My bragging rights are that I can now say I helped move 12 tons of soil in one day.I do know about lawns, and reminded him that the real fun starts when the grass begins growing like weeds and involves LOTS of mowing!  My joints ache just a little today, so I guess my body is admitting defeat in fighting me on this journey.  Today I work on my herb garden and planting those annuals that I have been trying to get into seedling pots."},

{"title": "The Horse is Now Dead", "date": "Thursday, March 20, 2014", "text": "Not to beat a dead horse on women's rights but...regarding equal pay for equal work:\"...Beth Cubriel, executive director of the Texas Republican Party weighed in further on the issue. “Men are better negotiators, and I would encourage women, instead of pursuing the courts for action, to become better negotiators,” I agree with Ms. Cubriel that women need to be better negotiators as our culture does not make it easy for a woman to take a more aggressive stance at the table, but that is NOT the reason for the pay disparity in the early years of a woman's career.  I think women are excellent negotiators, but they do it far more well for others than for themselves.\"You don't deserve equal pay on the merits, you just need to find out you're being discriminated against, then argue your way into equal pay. That is totally a sustainable solution that in no way privileges a certain class of women who can negotiate their wages or even find out they're being discriminated against and is way more efficient and effective than just paying workers the same amount for the same job regardless of their sex!\"  I think this was the counter argument.A most recent study proved that across ALL professions except for humanities, women are 20% behind in pay after their FIRST year of employment right after getting their college degree.  This is before they get married, have babies, and even have time to negotiate for a raise which are the various reasons given for not paying women as much.  This gap increases from 80 cents on the dollar to 70 cents on the dollar in some professions as the years go by even after controlling for variables such as part time work, lack of experience, etc..  Women are left struggling to pay their college loans with less income and permanently behind the economic spectrum and being blamed for not really negotiating well?This reminds me of my friend who was a Lieutenant Commander in the Navy decades ago.  He felt that women did not belong in the Navy because the minute they show up aboard ship they affect morale and command because they flirt.  Really?  Female engineers graduating from the Academy have a flirting problem?  Well, men harass sexually and even rape, which I do feel affects morale and command structure, so that makes it even in my book.  (Not really, just trying to be snide.)   This war is ongoing and women (and their men) are going to have to stand up and demand fair treatment, whether it is a promotion or an honest criticism of their work, but it has to be fair and transparent.   Thank goodness I am married to a fair and hard working man that agrees with me and sees this disparity and wants his daughter to get a fair chance in her career."},
{"title": "Maybe a Rerun?", "date": "Monday, March 17, 2014", "text": "I have just spent the better part of this early morning (4:30 A.M.) looking through my past posts to see if I ever blogged about my last day of junior high school.  I am sure that I wrote about this, but being rather casual about blog labels and being more cryptic than necessary with blog post titles, I could not find it.  Therefore, today you are in for a re-run.I was reminded of my last day of junior school because of some of the comments in my prior post.  Some readers wondered why I was so passive in those situations.  Perhaps, some of it had to do with my being brain tired at the time, maybe I was a little intimidated by the elevated position of each of these rude men, but I actually think it was a more practical decision,  a decision of picking ones battles carefully.  I would not have changed them or the world much by a female outburst.  Remember those scenes in the bar where one man gets accidentally bumped by another and then the bumped man confronts the other man with a snarl and in-your-face response?  Well, the snarling one is the one who always comes off looking like the idiot or the ego-centric oaf while the person who did the bumping comes off as being apologetically distracted.  These men did not impact my job or my family...just that brief time at that moment.  I did not let them ruin my day either.While I am not one of those in-your-face feminists, I have held my ground on issues when necessary and have tried to give that philosophy to my daughter.  OK...what does this have to do with my last day of junior high school and perhaps my very first feminist protest?I went to school in the mid-1960's.  This was the first decade of drugs, sex and rock and roll.  It was also a decade of the beginning of the women's liberation movement.  Liberation from dishes and babies to working 50 hour weeks and then coming home to dishes and babies.  I went to a tiny school in a farming community in the mid-west, which was pretty much sheltered from all of this.  An out-of-wedlock pregnancy was the most shocking thing that happened there.  Pot had not moved into the small town culture and we had sock hops in the new gymnasium for our rock and roll experience.  Girls danced with girls and the guys stood around trying to look cool except for the bad boys who would sneak outside the gym for a smoke.  The last day of school was only half a day and there were no formal classes.  We cleaned out our lockers, cleaned out various classrooms, ran errands for teachers, got our annuals and spent time getting them signed by classmates and talking about about starting high school in the fall.  The day was really a wash, and perhaps, that was why two of my best friends and I decided to shake it up a little.  We were thirteen and thus just becoming rebellious teenagers and women.   I wish that I could say I was the ring-leader, but one of the other girls has instituted the idea.  We had decided to wear jeans on the last day of school!  I felt it was a very practical idea since we had to spend time clean up dusty shelves and lockers.  But I also knew that it was against the school rules for girls to wear pants to school.  We lived in jeans on weekends, because we all lived on farms and had chores, but this public school required skirts or dresses.I don't think my parents had a clue, because they said nothing when I left the house in neat dark blue jeans, white tennis shoes and a shirt.We didn't make it past first period when the Home Economics teacher, a tremendously prim and proper little tornado standing 5 feet and weighing 100 pounds, came huffily into the classroom and announced that we would have to leave the school building!  When we asked her where we were supposed to go, she said to wait outside until \"they\" decided what they were going to do with us.  She glared and fussed and indicated that \"This was going to go on our school record\" as we carefully hid our smirking.  I do not think we knew what a quandary we had them in, because we were all top students and had held various leadership positions in the school.  But we were certainly having fun being rebellious, something that as \"good\" girls we had not considered before.We sat on the lawn on a lovely June morning for about 20 minutes talking and defending our position to ourselves. We could see the principal and the Home Ec teacher standing at the office window looking at us and talking and we somehow knew that we had the upper hand.  The whole thing seemed more than ludicrous to us and that is probably what won the argument, the total idiocy of the idea.  I do not know if they called our parents, but I am sure that my friend's mother would have given them a real piece of her mind over being interrupted by something so insignificant.While I am sure they had considered sending us home to change as the very least of what they could do, we finally were allowed to go back inside.  Within an hour we had forgotten we were in jeans as had all the other students and the last day of school continued without further event.  I wish I could say that this changed the dress code for the school, but it did not.  I don't think I was allowed to wear pants to class until college where crossing a snow filled campus pretty much demanded better leg cover.Anyway, that was my first but not my last feminist protest movement.  (Chuckle.)"},
{"title": "That Small Feeling", "date": "Thursday, March 13, 2014", "text": "A number of years ago I was crossing the lobby in a fancy hotel in Cairo, Egypt, to see if our reservation was ready.  It had been a rough airplane trip, a hot and sticky and dusty cab ride and I was already feeling jet lag.  I had almost approached the check-in desk with my last bit of energy when two tall men in white thobes covered by the traditional bisht trimmed in gold moved in front of me only inches from my face and called the clerk over.  They made no apology or even gave recognition that someone, a woman - me, had been brushed aside by their rude behavior.  They completely turned their broad backs to my face and began the check-in process.  I could have given them the benefit of the doubt, except I have been given the impression that Saudi men treat women as a much lower class and make all kinds of pretend excuses for the way the culture makes women behave and dress.  Clearly I was a level lower than their well-dressed women in my Western dress.  They wore shiny large watches and talked in firm voices and did not once look my way as they walked away to the elevators.  I could have been a potted plant.  They really did not see me!  How can you be rude to a potted plant?A few years later my husband and I had been invited to a reception in the South Pacific to celebrate the completion of a large bridge.  There were drinks and hors d'oeuvres.  Hubby and I had our brief chat with one of the high chiefs and every single time I made a comment during the conversation I was totally ignored while the Chief turned to my husband to talk.  The third time that this happened I walked away and got more wine and perused the table until hubby was done. A few years later my daughter and I had just finished a special tour of the catacombs and St. Peter's resting place beneath the Vatican (my daughter's MIL is Catholic and this tour was for her).  Once again I was tired from having been in an area with little oxygen and listening to rather dry history and having to stand for over an hour in close quarters.  We had walked up stairs into one of the many alcoves of St Peters church, and I was just turning to view but one more tomb of one more saint when two Cardinals dressed in crisp black robes and blood red sashes and red head cover walked right in front of me at a deliberate and slow saunter.  ONCE AGAIN I had become the potted plant.  The area was not filled with tourists and there was plenty of room for them to move away from me.  They walked so closely I lost my balance for just an instant and felt the robe of one against my ankle.  Not once did they apologize or act as if they had seen me.  They were deeply involved in some miraculous thought I am guessing, and when you are planning miracles how can you bother with a low level tourist.  If I had been Catholic I might have been forgiving and even a little honored, but because I have long had black issues with this church, I just frowned and turned away looking for fresh air and less gilded stuff.I could list other times like this happening at work or at meetings.  I am a women and for some reason on this planet the other gender does try to keep us feeling small.  Well, times are changing all over, if ever so slowly both by men and women to a fairer world."},

But, other readers did show up as the year moved on!  Readers did comment!  And when I ventured out and commented on others' blogs I got even more comments.  I started to write for my readers and not for me so much.  But I soon learned that I had not entered this medium just to comment and write and then see what people said back.  It is too important to treat it so shallowly.  I have come to realize the personalities of some of the other bloggers and find that my feelings force me to comment on their blogs. I think that is much of the key, getting the essence of the blogger's soul.  I decided to review the history of my posts and the two top ones which each got thousands of views were titled:  \"Did You Know...any of these Thursday 13? #37 in a Boring Series\" and \"Bloody Murder at Tabor's Yard.\" Besides being very poorly written titles, I am not sure why they were viewed at all, except for the bloody murder.  I am sure if I had put s*x in any of the post titles that would have been really popular.I have found when people get very personal, discovered a serious illness, have some tragedy in their family or with themselves, the comments do soar for a bit.  This does not mean that the good writers fail to get comments in the three figures almost always and do not have to be fighting cancer to do that.  But blogging is a crap shoot.   I mean you have to be funny, sexy, and at least a little youthful to draw a crowd these days.My readers also suggested in response to the prior post that should I make a list of what I want to change or do.  I am working on that.  And if it gets solidified I will share.  Even if it fails, I will share that also, because then the replies will grow in number ;-)Anyway, today is very spring-like so I should at least clean the deck.  I, sometimes always the realist, am hoping it lasts and we do not have the hot weather by the end of April, because this HAS been the warmest year globally in history and those of us in the Northern hemisphere are going to get our share soon."},

Also there, were hairy men in plaid shirts with lengthy beards that looked like cast members of Duck Dynasty,  There were two attractive women in heavy mascara, with large breasts and lots of jewelry and long dark hair who could have been rejects from one of the \"Housewives of...\" television shows, There were a few tourists blending in muted grayish colors who looked shell-shocked at the cold weather they had not expected,  And there were casually dressed middle-aged men who talked about their golf game and wore shiny watches.At another place, the Villages, (a Stepford-like conclave for middle class people who retire and want to live in an environment where everything is cotton candy perfect,) population 83,000 and currently lobbying for their own county status,  I saw old white people dressed so fine for a country club day.  But the only people of color that I saw there were the wait staff.While driving through Lake Wales past its version of Bates Hotel, which used to be a gentle tourist retreat, I saw people walking into one of three Bail Bond's stores, people with hunched shoulders waiting in line outside a second-hand clothing shop for their 70% off Thursday sale, and two skinny girls walking down the sidewalk arguing who appeared to be on drugs and were later stopped by local Police officers.At Celebration, an aging Disney version of the \"perfectly\" planned hometown, I saw happy children, well-dressed elderly, and teenagers in resort wear.  I talked briefly with an elderly man from London who lived there six months of the year walking his huge dog.  He said many of the homes here were upside down on their mortgages because of the recession.At Marco Island I saw tourists with cameras and binoculars not at all interested in their fancy condos but instead watching waves and birds with glee and asking us botanical and ornithological questions (as if we knew anything).Also at Marco Island I saw two young Latino men live-bait fishing and trying to avoid Hubby's questions on their catch since they probably had added fish that were too small to the stringer that was hidden under the waves and they suspected very much his claim that he was not with the fisheries office.At almost all of the restaurants I saw at least two beautiful blonde waitresses working their way through college.At the beach near Cape Canaveral I saw not one but two older men sun-bathing naked, one thin and gray and one a chunky-monkey,...not the kind of image one wants to retain on vacation.  I had been using our binoculars to look at the highrises in the salt spray distance (photo above)... when something bobbing back and forth ...yes you KNOW exactly what...came into sharp focus!  I am not a prude, but was not prepared, I must admit.  (Take note that parking lot #13 is the one leading to the beach for the free spirits!)Yes, I did not have to leave home to see much of this, but I am not as observant at home."},

{"title": "Best Laid Plans", "date": "Saturday, February 08, 2014", "text": "My daughter had taken time for a girls' get-away to Florida two winters before and came back just furious that the weather had not been warm and sunny each time.  She has limited leave and it requires lots of organization to plan a brief vacation with her girl friends away from family and career.   Goodness, they could not even use their swim suits!I used to be like her.  Vacations were expensive in both time and money and infrequent, and when they did not work out to 80% perfection, I was dismayed.  Now that I am retired, I am thankful for the smallest things, such as feeling energetic enough on a vacation morning to take a brief walk.   I am thankful that Hubby is by my side with his enthusiasm for everything, even though I do sometimes find that exhausting  I am thankful that I usually see something new and different.  I am thankful that I can still take vacations!This photo is our view from our room at the expensive Marco Island hotel on the early evening of our arrival.  A cold and foreboding sunset was leaving its footprint on the Gulf of Mexico.Here was the view after breakfast that greeted us the next morning.  Notice how many tourists are enjoying the beach?  I pulled out the wind-breaker I had packed.Cold and rainy weather chased us all over the state during the two-plus weeks we were there.  Mid-week we drove to the Atlantic side and while half the day was full of sunny warm weather, by mid-afternoon...Still one must remember, that for beautiful sunsets you must have some clouds!"},
{"title": "A Bit of Paradise", "date": "Wednesday, February 05, 2014", "text": "We are fortunate enough to have friends that live in a small portion of the state of Florida that is still pristine.  Well, sort of...We stayed at the former home of  Captain J.J. Dickison, \"Swamp Fox,\" and confederate soldier during the war between the States. Go to this link for more info:  \"Although he served as a captain for most of the war, he often commanded battalion sized groups of men and proved a formidable foe to Union forces in East and Central Florida.  Dickison and his men captured soldiers, officers, steamboats and even a Union general during the war.  Although he was promoted to colonel at the end of the conflict, he did not learn of the promotion until after he had been paroled by Union forces.\"This is a private guest house and will be released to the U.S. Navy in the decade ahead as the owners have sold the amazing spring nearby to the Navy that has been doing sonar testing for many years.  I will post on my other blog photos of a canoe trip as we started at the head waters of this lovely spring one afternoon.  This land has been in the family for at least two generations.  The interior of the guest house, which appears rustic from the outside, is filled with many memories of the owners' trips and adventures during their lives and those of their parents.  I felt as if I was staying at my great grandma's house, with newer appliances and wireless access!  The house was so solidly built with sappy pine that after all these years the floors do NOT creak.This modern artwork above the fireplace is a \"finger painting\" from their young grandson!This location provided a quiet step back in time when we stayed there.  At the end of our visit, Hubby was off on a week-long canoe camping trip in the Everglades with the owner and I stayed on a few days longer with his wife, a good friend.  During the days when I walked between the guest house and the main home after breakfast I was able to observe about 30 wild turkeys walking across the yard and patio, a blue heron walking the edge of the spring, and on another visit a bobcat sauntering down the edge of the woods.  It is paradise.  I do want to mention that I was sure I had heard an alligator's hollow growl outside my window one evening as I snuggled into bed.  It was their mating season!  Just realize that alligators, for the most part, are more frightened of humans than we are of them, unless you are an idiot and feed them!I hate the thought that this bit of paradise will be turned over to the Federal Government, because they will not see the romance and nature in the place and will run it based on uneven annual appropriations."},
{"title": "The Business Side of Living in Paradise", "date": "Friday, January 31, 2014", "text": "Florida has over 1300 miles of coastline with beaches and a semi-tropical to tropical climate.  This is the draw for much of America and the globe when they want a vacation break from snow and ice.  This is where you can golf, swim, and play tennis year round. (Except many of the days we were here were cold and wet!) And this is where snow birds and frogs descend to escape the winter weather up north.  Snow birds come just for the winter and then return back home each summer.  Frogs come to stay until they croak.  Demographically in Florida, 18.2% of people are over 66, which is not as large a segment as one might think although it is higher than the national average.  Mean household salary is about $47,000.00.  I wonder if this is a typical working salary or a retiree's salary?  (All photos taken at Marco Island, some blurred -  taken from a canoe.)Got beach??Paddling off into the mangroves.My husband was raised in southern Florida, so he is familiar with the entire state and can really see the changes that have happened over the decades.   He remembers hunting on vast acres of pine woods and palmetto scrub as a teenager.  Those acres are pretty much what the city of Orlando is today.  Back then Orlando was a small cattle town with a few orange groves and large cattle ranches and undeveloped land.  Today Orlando is theme parks, time-shares and anything else that caters to the tourist industry.  We spent a few days on Marco Island to the southwest and the geography from their to Naples above which used to be mosquito heaven is now the land of the very wealthy.  Castles that are homes on the beach and condos that cost a million dollars and hotel rooms over $300.00 a night are available, unless you want a water view and those hotel rooms are twice as much.  Further inland, as is the theme in most of  Florida, are less expensive condos, retirement homes and finally trailer communities on small lakes.  There are  more than 30,000 lakes that cover a little more than 3 million acres of land in the state, most natural but some are rock pits created from development and phosphate mining. The lakes range from very small to the nation's fourth-largest natural lake, 448,000-acre Lake Okeechobee. The temperature difference can be more than 10 degress warmer when you leave the beach areas and head inland during the summer and 10 degrees colder in winter.  Toward the Southeast lies Miami which is much like any city except that there are more flamboyant colorful types walking the streets.  Above Miami is Fort Lauderdale which struggles to survive as an old florida town now city.  They have built a riverwalk and culture area that is rather nice in downtown.There were lots of people not in as good shape as this dude.The very center of the state still has horse farms, cattles ranches, and orange groves (although I was told 80% of the citrus industry has collapsed due to \"green disease.\")  I actually received a gift of clementine oranges in a bag...that came from California!  This part of the state along with suburbs outside the above mentioned cities have communities struggling with poverty, drugs and illegal immigation.  Not unlike much of the rest of parts of the U.S.Rick Scott, the current governor, has been against the Affordable Health Care act from the beginning, but that does not stop him from taking advantage of its Federal dollars.  Prior to his becoming governor his company was involved in a nasty health care lawsuit.  He took the 5th amendment over 70 times during the lawsuit.  He now has awarded his largest campaign donor a huge medicare/medicaid contract which most believe will result in much higher health care costs for those using it since it promotes for-profit health care which means a shaving of services to make a profit although much of this will be in the health care system in prisons paid for by tax dollars to profit this company.  His HCA company was reported on in a Wall Street (August 15, 2012)  article which reported that it used the profit profile to increase certain private hospitals' bottom lines while slashing medical care to many.  My advice is to not retire in Florida unless you are a millionare.Yes, if the weather had been better, we would have had a great vacation, but we did have a nice time and staying indoors on a rainy day gave me time to blog."},
{"title": "Granny Alice in Wonderland", "date": "Tuesday, January 28, 2014", "text": "What had possessed us to stay in this area?  It was a coupon for a free week, of course.  We had spent money on a wedding and other things this year, and this resulted in us getting lots of points and the offer of a \"free\" stay in a condo.  The condo is in the heart of busy, traffic-congested, fast-food-filled, gift shop rip-off Kissimmee, Florida.  This is the center of the state and as if to test our vacation spirit even more, the very ridge of that famous solar vortex has edged here making the weather very cool and unpredictable with sun then rain then sun.  The condo where we are staying is a little larger than a postage stamp.  The swimming pool is even smaller.  We have a view of the large dumpster in the parking lot where they are currently dumping the building restoration materials from the other building that they are upgrading.  No shopping or restaurants are within walking distance, and the kitchenette is amenable only to cooking food via microwave.  At least it IS quiet at night and free!We had spent a long weekend at a lovely hotel (expensive) on Marco Island and then another week's visit with friends near Ocala prior to this, so this wrap-up week is a bit of a downer.Kissimmee, for those who do not know, is near three thousand (well a bunch of!) theme parks and shows and good and bad restaurants in Orlando.  You can visit Disney (3 theme parks), Universal Studios (2 theme parks), the Holy Land, Busch Gardens, Dinosaur World, and Cypress Gardens now LegoLand...just to name the most obvious.  You can visit Sea World and take a ride past penguins, blast off in a Jetlev personal flying machine, take a gater filled airboat ride, off-road somewhere in the jungle, swim with dolphins, zip line at the zoo or get tickets for their paint-ball shoot experience.  There are all kinds of Las Vegas type shows to fill your rainy afternoons and evenings.  If you have the money and time, you can do it all and stroll through the many outlet stores!We have 'been there-done that' with our children and grandchildren over the years, and while we have not visited every single theme park or seen every single show, we are life-time satiated.  We are also here without young ones and have no need to maintain a check-off the list.  (If you are young, I am sure this sounds depressing to you, but when you get to be our age, you will not find it depressing.)So, yesterday we drove to a state park, put in our canoe and paddled down a river to a lake.  I took a ton of bird photos (will share a few later on my other blog), saw deer, my first wild pig, and enjoyed a misty day.  The day before we visited the Orlando Zoo and a Florida spring, both which were nice if not thrilling.  Today they predict rain, so we may head to a shopping mall in the morning and then search out a show or movie later in the day.  Since we live in the country, it takes so little to please us.Thursday and Friday are supposed to be sunny and warm, so we will flip a coin and drive the hour and a half to the Gulf shore or the hour to the Atlantic and beach it for a day.I do NOT miss the weather that is happening where I live, but I am hoping my pipes did not freeze while I was gone!!"},
{"title": "Searching for Just the Right Symbol", "date": "Saturday, January 18, 2014", "text": "There were three of them, two men one younger and one older and a young woman.  Two did not want to be there; they were never big on symbolism or ceremony.  The young woman knew that she had to be the one to take the lead.  She firmly pushed her foot forward sliding into soft and impressionable sand out across the long beach toward the water and they dutifully followed.  The walk seemed longer than it had ever been.  Such a vast emptiness in front of them.Weather was moderate.  Wind was gentle.  Air temperature was innocuous.  It was as if Mother Earth was napping today, or more likely, holding her breath to see if they got through this.Was it just last year that the old woman had been sifting through these sands for shells and fossils?  Was it just last summer that they had to help her to her feet after a long afternoon sitting and crawling in the sand?  They gathered the plastic bags of finds, the water bottles and her small red cooler.  Then the young man had to find her wooden cane.  It was almost impossible to see it leaning against the pile of driftwood, already melding itself into oblivion, perhaps realizing that soon it would be cast out with all the other dusty and faded things which were no longer needed on this earth, those things that did not provide the warm memories needed for sustenance, those things that do not become interesting fossils returning after millions of years.Today, they just had to find one fossil.  That was the challenge they had set for themselves.  One simple petrified tooth of a shark, perhaps, would suffice.They were surprised at how therapeutic the sifting of sand through ones fingers felt after a while of the sun warming their backsides.  Like sugar it fell aside, just a few granules sticking to the inside of the fingers and leaving larger bits of flotsam and jetsam in hand.  How the old lady had loved this exercise.  Her eyes would light up with glee when she found something unusual or particularly lovely.  She would tuck it into her jacket pocket.  When her pockets got too full they would transfer the bounty to a large plastic storage container, to be further sorted and discussed at home for the rest of the afternoon until dinner.They had never enjoyed it as much as she did, and usually, they played cards on the blanket, walked the shoreline, took photos of water birds, or played with the baby after its nap.  She would recognize compatriot collectors on the beach.  They would smile and nod and then come over and show her their finds or pull out a special tooth from their pocket and discuss whether it was from a sand shark or actually an Otodus.  Since this creature had no bones, all that was left for man to view after unimaginable years was its many teeth.The young woman found the the first one, small but completely shaped and in two shades.  The men, minutes later, each found a tooth, almost at the same time, one larger than the other.  Three fossils and in excellent shape.  The old woman would have squealed in delight and would have ordered them to be careful and not lose them before placing them in the container.Tomorrow they would visit her grave and each would have a special gift to place at the stone.  And they would feel her smile, from whatever sandy shore she now rested her soul no longer needing a cane or plastic holder or help in standing.(Two photos completed with a skeleton of a story.)"},
{"title": "How Do You Feel?", "date": "Wednesday, January 15, 2014", "text": "So, tell me...what do you think about travel?  Something to look forward to?  Something to be endured?  Something to be avoided?  What about modes of travel?  Which is your favorite?  Cruising?  Train?  Plane?  Automobile?  (I would include biking or walking, but I am talking about cross country right now.)  How do you feel about packing?  I have a routine and am OK with it except when I have to pack for cold weather, moderate weather and warm weather all at once.  OK with it except when I have to pack hiking wear, swimming wear, and dinner wear for the same trip as I am doing this time.I used to love getting on an airplane, but with all the stupid restrictions, the tightening of space, the awful food, and the long security lines, I actually dread getting on a plane.  I do like train travel but have not done much of it, and so cannot really tell you if I would like it as a permanent selection.  Cruising on a large ship is my absolutely least favorite way to get somewhere.  I hate the fact that I am stuck on a manufactured moving island with too many people.  Eating, drinking high caloric substances and enduring manufactured fun are on the agenda and then you are allowed to disgorge somewhere for the day and fight everyone else to the museums, tourist shops and restaurants.  (I am not talking about the small cruise ships because they have much to recommend them.)Anyway, this trip is by automobile.  Heading down to Georgia (Savannah) for a few days and then to Kissimmee, Marco Island and Ocala before heading home.  Husband is staying on for a half week canoe trip into the wilderness (and yes I do have thoughts of widowhood as I send him off to do his favorite things) and I will catch a plane out of Orlando back home to my daughter's house where I will have left my car.  Will there be posts along the way?  Maybe...now go back and answer my questions in the first paragraph in your comments.  Oh, yes, those were prehistoric sharks teeth in the last post.)"},
{"title": "The Gathering Place", "date": "Saturday, January 11, 2014", "text": "Last month in between bouts of cold weather, we took two of our loved ones and headed out to the nearby \"beach\".  It is not on the ocean and the water remains shallow a long way out, but it is a nice pretense when one needs an open water type day.  It is a great place for a fossil hunt or beach glass find, and my son has married a gem of a girl who thinks something like this is actually a fun thing to do, explore vast amounts of sand.  (His last girlfriend had issues with a manicure.)There were strollers, in the photo below two each both with long witches manes deep in some philosophical conversation as they took their constitutional.  I would have loved to have kept up a bit and listened in as you know very much what a nosy people watcher I am. In stark contrast were two young ladies who had found some treasure on the beach and were eager to share with their mother.  How much would you pay to be that age again for just the day?  Maybe if you click on the photo, you can see their loyal best friend in the middle waiting for them to pass him so that he can once again catch up.There are those who come with everything but the kitchen sink pushed on a small trailer to stay for a full day and enjoy the cool (58 degrees F)  but pleasant weather.  I cannot help but think his wife is at home enjoying a peaceful afternoon ;-) Then there are the real solitary types for whom this communion with waves caressing the sand is a necessary or a greatly enjoyed restorative experience.  You can just see him in the far left.  I would give more than a penny for his thoughts.And we did find a few fossil and beach glass treasures as a reward at the end of the day.As person who loves stories, I wish I was creative enough to write one for each of these photos."},
{"title": "Hungry?  Let's Play!", "date": "Wednesday, January 08, 2014", "text": "I saw the second installment of  a movie, The Hunger Games, over the holidays.  I had read the book trilogy a few years ago, and wondered why it was such an easy read, because it was pretty good.  Then I learned that it was written as a Young Adult series.  When I was reading I felt that it seemed not that far-fetched, and then I saw the two movies and felt that it was not really the future...it was the present.Why?If you have not read The Hunger Games you can go here for a Cliff's Notes Summary.  Or you can read my quick summary which leaves a lot out. or you can read the books.Summary:  The books reflect a society that is under the control of the privileged few.  The privileged dress exotically, have exotic eating habits and hobbies, can indulge in almost anything and are happily ignorant of the fact that they are surviving on the backs of the various districts that produce food and products for them and keep the country going.  Each of these districts has a skill level, an important product or resource for the country, and in most cases a bare survival life style for its citizens.  They get money and food based on their contributions to the country and get additional bonuses if they have a winner in the hunger games.  The rich and powerful government tightly controls everything, has technological eyes everywhere, and finding out what is really going on is information only for the privileged few.   The games themselves involve an annual contest where children are \"reaped\" by lottery from each district and placed in a televised battle to the death with lots of science fiction animals, weather, and weapons and against each other.  It is a contest that reminds the citizens that a revolution against the Capital can result in annihilation.  I do not do the book justice with such a short summary, but it is a good (not great) read.Now, back to my premise that we are in a society much like the one above and getting closer every year:We have two societies already in this country:  1) The very wealthy and upper middle class  2) The rapidly shrinking middle class living on the edge and the growing poor.  Following are even more clues that we are strangely close to this story.  Our wars are not far from being battles to the death for our young (mostly) which we honor if they return, even missing pieces.1)  The NSA scandal which indicates they watch us more than we know2)  Fashion shows---I mean really have you seen anything more exotic than the parade of costumes the rich wear? 3)  News stories on men who dress as inflated dolls!4)  Digital grieving and lighting virtual memory candles via computer for the departed.5)  Edible packaging of foods6)  The woman who had plastic surgery to look like a Barbie Doll.7)  Clearly visible plastic surgery and Botox injections on male and female newscasters giving them the oddest places for wrinkles and dimples when they lift an eyebrow or grin.  Go ahead and check a few talking heads next time.8)  The legalization of marijuana which has resulted in pot hotels with pot smoking lounges, a surge in buildings that are designed for growing the weed, and a new Wall Street fund for pot that is growing like madness.9).  While the U.S. poverty level has been reduced in this country since the war was declared by President Johnson, world poverty is growing very fast.10)  One citizen worries about their next meal while another citizen buys the fancy package for their new car that will not only heat the seats in the winter but also cool those same seats in the summer.  And lastly...3-D printers that can print pets that do not need to be fed or cleaned up after......yes, maybe that one is made up, but do you really think that is very far away?Half of us get lazier and half of us work so much harder.  It is the Hunger Games."},
{"title": "Contrasts and Missed Opportunties or the Downside of the Holidays.", "date": "Friday, January 03, 2014", "text": "A series of pre-holiday incidents that made me think and wonder when I will get it right:In early December, when we were setting up our Christmas tree, the 'Thin Man' who had felled those large trees this summer knocked at our door for a reason we never finally understood.  He seemed to think we wanted more mulch, but perhaps that was Hubby's comment because the Thin Man never said that.  He began in a fitful fashion to explain about the recent theft of most of his equipment from his storage yard which resulted in  letting go all the staff but two for economic reasons, and a further ramble about police, his exploration of the 'hood' (a term which he apologized for using), and other tails of his activities in his pursuit of the missing saws and a generator.  Later he confused the story even more by saying that two of his workers had up and quit for no reason, and that he suspected them of the theft.  We surmised he had been drinking due to his glazed red eyes, although his manner was polite and his voice clear.  After lengthy anecdotes on his part and our sympathetic responses, he finally left us standing with tree ornaments still in hand in the open doorway and unformed questions.  There was no offer of a bonus holiday gift from us, as he claimed to have $1800 in his pocket (?) and there did not seem to be a way to help him without belittling him in some way.  He left us with a rather dour feeling in our hearts for days after.  There are so many people in this world that seem to be the victims of their own mistakes and behavior, but who are basically not bad people.The following week we headed up to Philadelphia to attend a 50th wedding anniversary of friends.  We spent a day layover to enjoy the city, and as luck would have it, we were there to enjoy a small and lovely wet snow.  Big sloppy flakes fell everywhere.  Within minutes struggling cities are transformed into postcard scenery after such wet snowfalls.  We slogged through the streets to look at holiday window displays, shopped at their famous downtown market center with breakfast crepes to die for,and watched the Macy's Christmas light show in the shoe department...yes, it is a family tradition here as we met a three generation example listening to Julie Andrews voice host the singing.We also thought we saw the Pie in the Sky guy...just an inside joke for British readers.By the time we returned to the outside, several ambulances were stopped at various intersections for various reasons.  We crossed the street only to see a large man fall to the sidewalk while crossing an icy patch just ahead of us.  He did not move after that.  Several people tried to help him up, but he did not respond and was too heavy for them to lift.  We hailed a nearby ambulance driver, who responded that he could not stop because he was on a call, but finally, at our insistence, exited the vehicle to check on the fallen pedestrian.  (Drunk, drugged, elderly, homeless hoping for shelter?)  Who could tell with all the bundled clothing and snow-covered face.We then trundled into a pub down the alleyway and watched an afternoon wintery football game over a lunch of mussels and pasta and wine under lots of holiday glitter before a foul-mouthed ardent Eagles fan made us return to our hotel room with our holiday purchases to watch the second half of the game in peace and quiet.  Then it was back out to dinner at a place recommended by the hotel.  One of those places where the servings are small (you order various tapas) and the seating is miniscule.  The only thing large, are the prices, of course.  We had become good friends of the young couple seated just to the side of us (another story for another day) before we had even ordered dessert since we were seated close enough to cut each others food!It was late, dark, and very cold as we departed the restaurant for our two block walk back to our hotel.  The streets were no longer busy with shoppers or automobiles.  We passed one homeless person bundled like a wrapped mummy in the shadowy shelter of an entryway to one of the stores.  I did not stare, only glanced, still focused on my walking and not falling.  The person's face was covered in scarfs and tucked down, never noticing the outside world in his struggle to stay warm. I was concentrating on walking carefully across the icy sidewalk and while I had finished only one glass of wine, I was not feeling as coordinated as I would have liked.  Hubby and I did not hold hands or take each others arms or take our eyes off of the treacherous terrain ahead for very long.  It was every person for him/herself!  Life can be like that sometimes.Then out of the shadows a man without head cover but in a warm winter coat and holding the hand of a small bundled boy approached us asking if we lived in the area and knew about it.  We glanced up, apologized that we did not know the area at all, looked down again and we continued to carefully make our way forward.  The man started to cross the street and then turned back to us explaining he was looking for a shelter where he could get a hot meal.  I took him at his word and pointed to the Catholic church down the block, because I had seen it lit for mass earlier when we went to our dinner.  He headed in that direction and we continued on our way.Stupidly, it did not occur to us to give him money for food.  Although the restaurants in that area were all very expensive and mostly took reservations at that late time of night.  The incident and my casualness haunted me all evening.  Was that a test from God?  Was that an angel in disguise?  Was I so focused on not falling and finding warmth that I let a child go hungry that night?  Later when I was inside and warm I wondered why did I not offer to take him to our hotel coffee shop?  ( I had written a check to a church with a winter homeless shelter just the week before, but it was a church far, far away from here and that in no way eased my conscience.)Homelessness has a long history in our wealthy country.  Philadelphia's first pan-handling ordinances were passed in the 1820's, so disenfranchisement is historic to this area.  It is a very complicated issue.  Many of our homeless are veterans and families of veterans.  Approximately two-thirds of our homeless are disabled in some way.  Mental patients were released from state run hospitals in the 1970s with a cut in Federal spending and these people ended up on the streets creating our first bump in homelessness.  Bigger cuts to housing subsidies, low-income mortgages, and HUD agency budget cuts happened in the 1980's.  That is when I saw more homeless people when I went into the cities.  “people who are sleeping on the grates…the homeless…are homeless, you might say, by choice.”  A quote from one of our former presidents who actually believed that and most likely never interviewed a homeless person in his wealthy life or lived in a northern climate.  \"According to the United States Conference of Mayors, in 2008, the three most commonly cited causes of homelessness for persons and families were a lack of affordable housing, cited by 72 percent, poverty (52%), and unemployment (44%).  The suggestions to alleviate homelessness included providing more housing for persons with disabilities (72%), creating more employment opportunities (68%), and building more assisted housing units (64%).\"  (Wikipedia)  We do not have affordable housing but we do have empty houses abandoned by the banks who wrote obscene mortgages.  Abandoned houses that no longer make the banks any money, but blight the neighborhood.  What if the banks wrote them off, and taking those not purchased by those fancy real estate flippers, found some way to sell the leftovers to the newly homeless?  I live on a street where a house, that might have garnered $700,000 to $800,000 dollars during the boom, has sat idle for years and is now falling apart.  Yes it is too far into the country for an unemployed family, so perhaps not the best example...just an example of the write-it-off mentality of mortgage brokers.This December Congress cut food stamps (which mostly go to feed poor children) and did not extend long term unemployment insurance with the view that it would encourage people to look for jobs.  No one ever cites a survey or study on how starving people makes them look harder for a job, so in my book, that is what they are, opinions to ease guilt of lawmakers doing this.  The few people I know who have used unemployment benefits are certainly not happy about it, and would take a job if they could find one.  But job creation is another very complicated issue.Thanks to this pathetic, disengaged Congress, there will be more homeless and hungry on our streets in the coming months and throughout the year.  There will be more sleeping bodies on the streets for my grandchildren to pass on their way to the museum.  One U.S. Congressman suggested we put children to work as janitors if we are going to give them a free/subsidized school breakfast.  (Then we could fire the working father janitor and get cheaper child labor?)  At least we haven't completed the grand immorality that Japan has.   Japan has a solution for their homeless people...!"},

Was it that toddler girl at the holiday party who stopped wide-eyed to look at the tree?Was it the patience from your loved ones when you burned the first batch of cookies?Was it finding Grandma's platter that had been stored way at the bottom of the drawer? (Yes, these are not universal incidents...but you can certainly add your own.) For me, many of these moments were savored reading the comments from my blog readers that I read and re-read this past week.  Talk about restorative!  You make me want to be a better writer/communicator/photographer than I am.  You remind me that the great fabric of life is both virtual and concrete."},

Is That a Resolution?", "date": "Saturday, November 30, 2013", "text": "I sometimes watch my adult children and wonder what genetic mix has created them with their energies, self-confidence, optimism, forgiveness and golden humor.  Where did they get the wisdom to see what is truly important.  I see these traits in the man I married, an only child, doted on and given opportunities galore to succeed or fail.  The only child of an aging couple in their second marriages who saw this child as their second and last chance to get it right.  And thus he sees himself as an important cog in the wheel of life.I thought I had the above traits, but age has given me the wisdom to see I am a punctual, list adhering soul given to joy only when all has been completed and put away and failure is no longer an option.  Only when the small rest time that is given as reward for work well done, do I allow myself to be open and less attentive.  I do not like these traits in myself and this past decade as my adult children have held up this mirror, I have tried to change and mellow out just a bit.  It is hard work to change oneself and also is an embarrassment to do this.  It is hard to stop and remember to look at the view on the way up instead of waiting until you are at the very top to relish the hard work and share the joy of the view with others.I was the oldest of five with many chores and responsibilities.  My mother was critical of much that I did and only gave praise for good grades as she knew this was the gateway for her children to a better life.  All else was expected and she did not forgive you if you became distracted by daydreaming.  Life was not a bowl of cherries but a tall cherry tree which must be climbed for any reward.  She focused most of her attention on the youngest as that was all that her remaining energies allowed and she expected me at an early age to be more of an adult.  I write this not to place blame but to see more clearly why I am the way that I am, why I am always the adult in my family, why I need down time, why going soft and making mistakes is scary for me and why I am critical of those who put fun before deadlines.But I will keep trying and little by little I will not be so focused on clearing the path, but picking the flowers."},

{"title": "With Lots of Cream and Sugar", "date": "Friday, November 22, 2013", "text": "Yes, that is the way I take it.  I like my coffee strong but I also buffer that with lots of cream and a good teaspoon of sugar.  What you drink in the morning pretty much tells me who you are.  You like it hot and black, then you face life as it comes and you handle it!  You like your coffee warm and weak, then you face life with hesitation and regret and wish the morning had not come so fast.  You don't drink coffee at all but would rather have an ice cold Pepsi in the morning?  Then you are a rule breaker and do not have much patience for those who make the rules. You need the hair of the dog in the morning, then life has you by the tail and until you let go you are in for a bumpy ride.  Me, I can take life as it comes, but want it frosted and creamy and hot.  (Pop psychology?  Better than Stossel's report...see below.)There are those of us who see poor people working through life as best they can under the crazy circumstances.  There are others of us who think poor people make their own problems and deserve the circumstances they are in from not dealing with those problems as they should have.  This in a nutshell is how I see the battle over health care.  Some people think that only the social network of help can make sure someone gets the healthcare they need whether they created the problem though drug use or drinking or over eating or over working or not being able to deal with fighting in an ugly war.  Other people think that life is a crap shoot and if you don't keep your eyes open and your hand firmly on \"the tiller, the wheel, the gun\"...whatever and your shoulder to the grindstone you are not going to make it through the week much less the rest of your life.  They rely on a few good friends and that is that, or they rely on the  church being able to sort all this out.Of course, as you know, I think it is far more complicated than that and the truth is all over the place.  There are the users and abusers who we have to keep from sucking us dry and we have to avoid being an enabler.  There are the unlucky whom we must help, because they can survive and make contributions of their own.  But since they do not all wear signs, we will make mistakes.  And much of this is perception.  Do we perceive that the majority that are in need are lazy and purposely greedy or do we see them as unlucky, not too smart, and fearful?  John Stossel (one of those talking heads on faux news who tries to present the image of a journalist, but never bothers to ask the ask who, what, where, when and why questions) demonstrated that anyone can panhandle (as he did again in a bearded disguise), and thus claimed that those who give to the homeless are dupes.  The demo only proved to me that most people are good-hearted and most conservative journalists find it too much work to research their subject matter in depth.Hubby talked to our investment adviser yesterday since the market is going crazy and hubby is reaching that age where he is required by law to withdraw a certain percentage of his investments annually.  (A rule that allows the taxman to get his share sooner rather than later.)  They talked about the market (as unpredictable as ever) and our adviser said something that brought me up short.  He was speaking from the millionaires point of U. S. view as I am sure he makes and has a lot of money.  He said that the financial folks see the demographics as a disappearing middle class, with the separation  forming that will break out to the top 15% and then everyone else.  It would be nice to blame this on conservative or liberal politics, but it started back in the 1980's. I blame it on the rich being able to make the rules.This will not impact me much, because I am not 20 or 30 or 40 or 10!  It will impact those I love who come after me.  There will be the vast wilderness surrounding gated communities.  Will it be a world like The Hunger Games...but without the games or will it be more chaotic than that?  Will cream and sugar be able to null the bitter taste in one's mouth as they look out their window in the morning?(On the other hand it appears that health care costs are going down!)"},

Your life story, at least with respect to the past, is not fixed,” says McAdams. “It’s always going through a revision. In the same way that historians revise how they see the past -- they see World War I one way now and maybe in 30 years they’ll see it a different way -- you see your childhood now one way and later a different way in part because of what you’re going through at that time.”  Apologies for not saving the link, but since I am not a journalist, I am sure you will forgive me.  If you are a researcher or librarian you will surely find the article above if you try.I guess if I wrote a small biography, it would be a little like Swiss cheese with chocolate sauce, having a small amount that was true and accurate and a goodly portion that made me a much better person than I am.  I would really like to go back in time and see it all as it really was!  It kind of bothers me that I do not see my life as it really was."},
{"title": "Harvest Time", "date": "Sunday, November 17, 2013", "text": "Someone, sweet blogger, asked where I was.  Such a sweet gesture which also makes me feel guilty for not writing in a while.  I haven't really had anything interesting or thoughtful to write.  My mind was blank like our gray skies these days.This morning I got up before the sunrise as I most often do on these shorter days.  The air was thick with fog but a nice temperature.  I put on warmer clothes and took my camera walking.  First I went to the end of the driveway and peaked through the deer gate.  Then I walked down to the dock where our winter loons have arrived and appeared just as black dots on the water's surface.Soon I saw the sun trying to get my attention through the mist.The weather here has been teasing.  Mornings can be cold or wet or even foggy or even warm and dry, mid-days with or without sun have still been comfortable, but the minute the sun hits the low horizon of gray clouds in the late afternoon, the temperature falls dramatically.  This crazy weather juggles my list of getting it done...whatever \"it\" is for that week, day, moment.We harvested the last of the persimmons.  They sit like golden eggs hard as rocks in my iron basket in the kitchen.  Two nights were below freezing, so we have brought them inside and maybe in a week they will ripen to their custardy sweetness...or give us an alum mouth and we will throw them out.The fig tree gave us hundreds of tiny figs this year...so few ripened that we ate them in hand while studying the carpet of green figs that had fallen to the ground.  A judicious pruning is in order for next year if we want fig sauce and fig bread.The oysters have been cleaned of summer algae with enough harvested that hubby made a Korean oyster stew (that is what he called it) which tasted more like a Thai seafood soup with an abundance of rice noodles.  I continue to use my Hungarian smoked paprika which accompanies many dishes these days. The weather was cold enough for us to safely eat a raw half dozen before the soup.The kaffir lime tree which now sits inside in the kitchen corner gave us many limes this year. I would lie in bed at night and hear the thunk of a lime as it fell to the floor and then spent the better part of the next morning trying to find where it had rolled.  I made a delicious lime cheesecake which was full of butter-fat and sugar and that unique flavor of kaffir lime.  Only 400 calories for a small piece!  The fresh flavor of citrus is such a rare treat when you do not live in the tropic or temperate climates.  Their gnarly skin shown in the photo below belies their floral fragrance.I took up the huge bouquet of dried garlic from the basement and began to peal and process for the freezer by tossing the cleaned buds in olive oil and putting a large handful into small freezer bags.  I know that they lose texture and flavor when frozen, but I have found the garlic buds are quite delicious when gently roasted before adding to any cooked meal.  I also put a few up in olive oil in the refrigerator in a jar for winter meals and saved three fresh cloves.  The white garlic parchment skins have flaked everywhere throughout the kitchen and it looks like snow.  I spend forever sweeping each morning finding a new white skin.  Of course, I have to spend an hour or less getting a photo before I begin my work!During one cold afternoon I also broke down and made chocolate chip cookies.  We limit ourselves to two a day!Today, with the temperature kissing 70F for a few hours, we cleaned out the garage, cleaned and oiled our garden tools, and threw out dated chemicals.  I took the amaryllus bulbs that have been going dormant in their pots in the garage for over a month, cut off their roots and knocked all the soil away from those fat bulbs and put them in a black garbage bag for the basement resting.  I will wake them up in 8 weeks for winter color.  I then washed all my clay pots and stacked them on a shelf in the garage.I sorted various seeds from pods and heads that I had collected and placed on the garden shelf.  Now I am going to fix a drink and read my book, The Luminairies by Eleanor Catton...thus far a good read, even if I am not sure where this going.  I slogged through the \"Bosnian Chronicles,\"  until half way and then found it did not capture me in spite of a being awarded National Book Award.  It was well written, the characters well drawn..it just moved way too slowly and focused mostly on how depressed the characters were living away from their homeland.  Thus, all the reasons that I have not been blogging."},
{"title": "Addictions and Fancies", "date": "Monday, November 11, 2013", "text": "I sincerely believe that anyone who has a passion for living also has an addiction or two or three.  Some compelling desire that follows he/she around, sits on their shoulder, makes them rearrange their day to accommodate space for the addiction, forces them to be distracted, and in general, can sometimes annoy others around them who do not understand this inner call.  Responsible life interferes with most of us making these undernourished addictions into fancies rather than compulsions.  Others, less responsible, go on to become famous by following their addictions...or destitute and alone.When I was a small child I was addicted to make believe friends and stories.  Each day when I could get away from chores and family I could return to my little world of Flash Gordon where we traveled through space and solved problems as I explored the mountains near my home.  I was also addicted to the outdoors and spent most of my free time playing in the Rocky Mountains.  My other addiction was collecting things such as rocks and minerals, little dolls, comic books, and maybe some other items that I have now forgotten.When I was in middle school it was collecting and listening to LP and SP albums of my favorite musical groups and singers.  These coming of age years were stressful as they are for most people, so I also spent much of my time reading as an escape to other worlds.  Getting books at the library was an essential orgasmic experience.  I played with monthly calls to draw and paint, although I was not very talented.In high school I became addicted to friendships.  Being with my BFFs was important in figuring out who I was.  I continued my love of reading and added writing as as a compulsion.  I also began my love of photography with the gift of a camera, but with little money for film and developing it was not allowed to blossom into a true addiction.   I continued my addiction to hiking in the great outdoors, although I had moved to the flatlands by this time, and that involved walking or biking around farmland.In college I took an introduction to writing class and that fueled the tender love that I had with writing in my youth into an addiction of sorts.  I had infrequently had periods writing poems when in middle school, but now that I had the rules and exercises I wrote something at least once a week and actually enjoyed the writing assignments in all of my classes.  I also took an elementary drawing class and got an A which left me feeling I might actually be able to draw!  I did not nurture this fancy in those years, as perhaps I should have.   I was also addicted to dancing and went every weekend if I had the money or the boyfriend with money.While newly married, and living in the South Pacific on a tiny island, I discovered the symmetrical beauty and texture of sea shells and became addicted to collecting them on weekend boat excursions to various reefs.  I most often collected shells that had died, but I must admit that I also collected many live shells and destroyed their lives just so that I could admire their skeletons on my shelves. I also drew them to fuel my drawing addiction.  I collected and cataloged hundreds.  My reading addiction continued and I added underwater photography to my fancies.  (I won't talk about the newly-weds addiction to each other, because that has more to do with survival of the species and we all have that.)When I had my two children, they became a very compelling addiction.  Even on exhausted days when I needed a break from their little antics, I was so addicted I could not keep them out of my mind or heart for a second. The withdrawal from being in their lives on a daily basis was a bitch.  (I now find that I go through withdrawal during the weeks I am away from my grandchildren while recovering from the exhaustion of those times.)During my career years my little free time was filled with reading, some travel when it was affordable, and outdoor camping and hiking satisfied my continuing addiction for the outdoors.  I still toyed with writing, but as an addiction it left me unsatisfied when I would review what I wrote in spurts of time.  (I personally think it is much harder for women than men to indulge in those addictions begun in their youth if they have a house and family to manage.  Many men, not all, continue spending hours working out, at sports, hanging with their buddies or whatever, and do not respond to pressure or guilt to spend more time with family and household as they hone these addictions.)As an elder I find the freedom to pursue addictions both wonderful and intimidating.  Just because you love something, does not mean you can do it or that you will be rewarded because you are good at it.  My outdoor activities continue but with a cold and serious eye to my aging body and what it will let me do.  I can no longer sleep on the cold hard ground, and my youthful fearless biking gives way to an honest review of how long it takes to fix something that gets broken from a fall.  My old eyesight is forcing me to be so much more careful as a photographer and age also means you no longer have a super steady hand.  Thank goodness for IES lenses.  Reading is still a love, but I cannot sit for hours with a book in hand as I used to and the freedom to read more than one book at a time also tests my weaker memory skills.  AND writing has gone from actually writing something...to blogging!  Although I keep toying with the idea of actually creating a collection of writing of some sort.  My gardening addiction (which I guess I always had but never knew) continues, but I no longer feel guilty if I have to hire someone to do the heavy stuff.  It is still my garden.So what addictions and fancies do/did you have and have you had to make compromises?"},
{"title": "Not All Grown Up", "date": "Saturday, November 09, 2013", "text": "We have lived in this community less than five years and while hubby collects friends like my socks collect seed burrs, I do not.  Oh, I AM friendly, just things do not evolve into luncheons with someone or dual shopping trips, or wood walks or weekly phone calls.  Hubby has a fishing partner--actually two, a project building partner, a \"business\" partner, etc.  He is easily liked by everyone.  I like to think I am easily likable but it does not transition into any BF or BFF profiles.I am long-term friends with women I went to junior high school, high school, college, and with roommates I had in my early career moves.  We are great friends, but live thousands of miles away from each other and our paths may cross only every eight years or so.While some of the women I have met here are compatible, it never evolves into anything.  I told the wife of one of my husband's fishing buddies that the week hubbies are gone to islands far away, we should get together for at least lunch.  She agreed, but I am doubting this will  happen because she has a high school son and a college son at home AND works full time at a hospital.  I will screw my courage to the sticking place and see if I can get something organized when the week transpires...my new mantra.Another volunteer I work with and that I like suggested we should get together for dinner with our hubbies. I agreed and waited to see if she wanted to initiate the dinner.  She didn't make any move, so as much as I hate inviting strangers for dinner I decided to be more pro-active in this social networking dance and invited them to dinner.  I prepared a careful (too fancy?) meal of curry squash soup, arugula-goat cheese-fig salad, roasted turkey breast with roasted fall root vegetables and tested my new kaffir lime cheesecake recipe since I got about 14 limes from our tree this year!  They brought cheese and crackers and wine.The dinner seemed to be a big success, the conversation went on until almost 11:00 which is really late for old folks such as us.  We have a lot in common including former working agencies, education and outdoor interests.  I will keep you posted if this goes anywhere!  (Let me know if you will be in town and I can practice on you!)"},

Three other figures going along for the ride are a man representing violence, a handyman representing a realist in present time and a mocker who represents resignation.  There are several works of art based on this satire.  (I was in Nuremberg less than a day and missed 99% of this intriguing city, but did get a photo of this garish sculpture which symbolizes far more than All Hallow's Eve.)"},

I made this the other day for the second time (and I have tweaked the recipe for my tastes) and found this so luscious in the cool fall.  It has a little fat, but is really healthy.Ingredients 1 medium butternut squash cut in half and roasted cut side down  in a pan with just a little water until very tender at 350 degrees...20-30 minutes.  (Be careful in cutting the hard squash!)1 tablespoon butter2 or 3 tablespoons coconut milk1 & 1/2 cups chicken broth or vegetable broth 1 tsp ground anise seed (If you do not like anise,  nutmeg or cinnamon can be used)2 to 3 tsps. ground curry (less pungent type is best)1 granny smith (or any other) apple peeled and chunked.1 small piece of ginger peeled (size of thumbnail)(You can also add a small bit of sugar if you want a bit sweeter taste...I like it both ways.) When squash is tender remove it and let cool before carefully scooping out the seeds to toss and then spoon out soft meat from the squash and put in food processor.  Process squash, apple and ginger in a food processor until smooth.  Warm butter, coconut milk, and broth in the microwave or saucepan and add slowly to the pureed ingredients.  Add spices.  Add salt if you think it needs more and puree briefly.  Pour all into a sauce pan and heat until it is the desired consistency, some like a soup and others like it more thick like a bisque.  Serve with a dollop of thinned sour cream or low fat yogurt and a shake of smoked paprika (from Hungary if you have it ;-))  You can also add a shake of hot red pepper if you like that.Yeah photo is blurred...but I was hungry!"},

(Shades of FEMA under Bush.)  We will see what the head of Health and Human Services says to get out of this.  There is no excuse!  The government does this all the time...under both parties...I have worked as a Fed and remember a Senator's nephew who got a job in our building for no reason other than that he was a Senator's nephew!Whether this ACA will work effectively or not, only time will tell.  I do believe that everyone in the richest country in the world should have access to health care, everyone, including young working adults, should carry the burden of this health care, and I would much rather pay for someone's health insurance subsidy with my taxes rather than their visit to the emergency room in the hospital!If you question how closely this subsidy will be regulated...that is up to each of us to question.  We don't do it with Defense contractors but maybe we will with health companies."},

{"title": "Need a Mantra Fast!", "date": "Tuesday, October 15, 2013", "text": "We had decided to throw away some money on a fancy seafood lunch on the porch/deck of the local tourist restaurant as a last fall fling.  The market was going to drop.  Our savings, which had finally climbed past their original high before the prior administration crashed the market with its deregulation of banks and investment firms, was going to thin once again.  One of the economists, those who rarely cry fire, said we should be prepared for as much as a 45% loss.  This time the crash would be because of love of power and the addiction to the sound of one's voice and the fear that one might be excluded from the club.  Even the rich puppeteers pulling the strings in the background were gasping at this monster they had created and backed off on their agenda because it meant they, too, were going to lose.  We were not confident they could stop the landslide at this late date.  Therefore, like sailors on the sinking ship we decided to drown ourselves in the last of the rum before all we had to drink was salty water.I was a little mad pissed off and determined to order the most expensive item on the menu in self-destruction.  But since I live in 'good-ole-boy' land, that item was a HUGE platter of assorted fried seafood while the next was a steak and seafood heart-attack on a plate.  I kept seeing in my mind the type of person that would order this and with greasy fingers pummel it to breaded crumbs in no time.  Thus I ordered the crab-stuffed shrimp, not the most expensive, but hardly cheap for a lunch.  I ordered a glass of Chardonnay and fully expected to drink two glasses in celebration, but found one sufficient.  Hubby ordered the largest order of fried shrimp they had.  Then we also added an expensive tuna sashimi appetizer just for the hell of it.  As we selected excellent slices of raw tuna to dip into a soy and ginger and wasabi mixture I looked up and saw a woman working her way between the close tables from behind us and heading to the private corner of the deck overlooking the water in front of us.  She seemed a little unsteady on her feet as she grabbed a table with one step and then a chair with the next and I was wondering if she had decided to get drunk in mid-day.  She smiled at us as she passed and then proceeded to blue-tooth her way into some conversation as she faced the sparkling water.She was pretty, pushing 40, and built like a stocky sex kitten.  She wore a soft blonde bob and dressed with casual chic.  There was some energy about her that caught my eye when she made eye contact.  When she finished her call she worked her way back past our table to the table behind us which was filled with other adults and children.  She winced as she leaned against an empty chair at our table.She smiled and look at us and then said, \"You two look like you have figured out this retirement thing.\"I said, \"I hope so.\" and then I asked if she was OK.  She looked in pain.\"Oh, 'Ma'am, I am just fine.  I am a warrior and working through this.\"Since she clearly was open to talking and we were waiting for our entree, I asked if she had been in an accident.\"Oh, no ma'am, this is the result of a long story...an experiment on my body.  I was part of a drug trial at Walter Reed.\"Because of her polite and frequent use of \"ma'am\" that clued me that she was either ex or current military or a southern raised lady.She proceeded to tell us in a somewhat disjointed and lawyerly fashion that she was planning on an anonymous lawsuit so that others who had been in the same drug trial that debilitated her would get money when she won it.  She said that the drug had been 'black-boxed' now due to her campaign and while it was still advertised on TV, she said it could destroy lives.  She had taken it 10 years ago right before/after FDA approved it.  She was now being treated in one of the best, small, unknown and black hospitals in the city and she would not tell us its name...but \"we could figure it out because we are smart people.\" She also indicated she was married to a doctor who had lost his privileges at his hospital because he was outspoken and a warrior like her.  He now worked as an emergency doctor rotating through three hospitals in the area.  \"We can afford this lawsuit and others cannot, so I feel it is right to pursue it.\"We talked a little more about the illness although she continued to be cryptic because of her upcoming lawsuit and a little about how she had captured her husband when they first met knowing this was the love of her life and then she hobbled back to her family as they began to leave the restaurant.Why people feel like sharing with us I do not know.  Hubby and I realized we must be looking our age, as she automatically assumed we were retired.  It was Memorial Day...so we could have both been off work...if we looked like we had the stamina to still work...which I guess we did not!  But we did look like the kind of people that one could share plans with for an anonymous lawsuit.Anyway, I know a little about the FDA and have a friend who had worked there.  I know how budget constraints over decades and political interference and the pressure from the pharmaceutical industry had compromised its mission so much, and I guess I now saw what might or might not have been the result of a rush to market drug in real life.But then we really don't need a gov'ment interfering in our lives, do we?  Pharmaceutical panels are just as concerned for our health and safety as insurance panels...right?  (I have got to stop this anger or I am going to need drugs...Om mani padme hum....OMG!)"},
{"title": "Life is in the Details", "date": "Sunday, October 13, 2013", "text": "Do you remember the good 'ole days of blogging when people posted photos of their view from there desks, or their bedroom window or even the view of the inside of their refrigerator?  No?  Well, I do.  It was somewhat exciting getting to look inside some stranger's home and you didn't even have to get out of your PJs!  That ability to reach across the Internet and peek into someone's life was kind of odd and exotic, at least I thought so.  Then we became familiar with their cat photos, dog photos, garden shots...they were still nice, but not nearly so exotic anymore because we had started to know the writers like we knew our neighbors.  Familiarity may not breed contempt, but it does breed boredom at times.  Some bloggers still post photos of their meals and their shoes and their pets.  Some, like me, post photos of garden harvests and food processing.  Boy, that is an exciting venue for readers. (!)Well, our weather here has been wet, wet like being in a 24 hour shower, wet like sitting in a leaky boat, wet like camping during the rainy season in South America.  When weather is moldy like this I try to avoid eating vast quantities of chips and salsa, drinking too much wine, or raiding the chocolate candy jar and screaming at Congresspersons on TV.  I instead pass the time re-organizing my life.I once had a blog about the building of this house.  I printed out all of the posts and then promptly deleted the blog as I felt it could be a security issue if someone nefarious stumbled across it.  Anyway, if you once followed that blog, you will remember that I wanted a walk-in closet.  Yes, I was no longer working and would no longer need a career wardrobe.  Yes, I could sleep in and not be bumping butts with hubby as I did in our former \"walk-in\" closet, but I still wanted a REAL walk-in.  I wanted a closet that did not smell musty, was not dark and had enough room to be organized. Well, I got it.  Wait for it.....I built a 12 foot by 10.5 foot walk-in closet.  Of course, it stores bedding, gifts, boxed photos, and other junk as well as clothes.  One would think with a closet this big it would be much easier to be organized...one would think.  It takes about 6 to 8 months before the closet shelves become messy, too full, and things starting getting lost.Here are some photos of the busy messy closet.I I re-boxed, dusted, vacuumed and gave away a bunch of clothes for the church.  Then I organized what was left and ta-da!You are awful quiet out there in blogger land...!  It IS neater and you will just have to take my word for it!  Doesn't it give you just a little thrill to be admitted into my closet?  Oh, the hole in the wall is where I dump our dirty clothes, there is a basket in the laundry room on the other side."},
{"title": "That Touch to the Heart from Bloggerland", "date": "Thursday, October 10, 2013", "text": "I opened my laptop and clicked into that world of writers, weavers, warriors and world thinkers this morning.  They post their photographs with stunning clarity, their arguments with stunning passion, their poetry with sweet love, and their emotions with bold and naked honesty.  They visit my screen with irregular regularity and come for so many reasons, both hidden and open.Sometimes I have to follow them for a while before I really 'get' them.  Unlike Renee Zellweger in Jerry Maguire, I am not always captured at \"Hello.'  I may have to read between the lines or pick through archival posts to fill in the picture as I am a detail type of gal.Blogger lost one of these members today.  He wrote poetry, the type I have to re-read to fully grasp the journey of words that he took me on.  He had met death many years ago when he was a young boy and that struggle haunted many of his poems.  His comments on my poetry and prose were so wonderfully gentle and dishonest, but I loved him for it.Once again I say good-bye to someone who had reached through the screen and touched my heart with startling reality.  I am so hoping, Dave, that you have found a lovely little pub where all the poets who came before you can sit and talk about your poetry and toast to your successful writing."},
{"title": "Storytelling for the Strong of Spirit", "date": "Wednesday, October 09, 2013", "text": "The evening was quite late for this group of four old-timers, the oldest having crossed the 8th decade of his life just a few months ago.  They had reminisced about times together decades ago, stories about their children and grandchildren, health issues, and as the candles flickered lower the conversation turned to the issues of the here and now.The Octogenarian, whom I will call Jack, twisted his empty wine glass and paused before saying, \"Most people today do not understand how it really was years ago and why the atmosphere is so toxic in politics today.  They live in a bubble thinking it is just an angry joke and that it has to do with differences of opinion on how to do something.\"The others sat back in their chairs knowing that the eldest of the group was going to begin story telling as he usually did when the energy of the conversation came to a pause.  He looked at each of them with his clear blue eyes and went back to his boyhood years growing up in Florida.\"Years ago when I was about eight my mother had sent me to town for some pickling supplies.  I hopped on my bicycle and headed to the local store.  This store was next door to our local bar, a wooden building that was two stories high.  The ground floor was a 'whites-only' bar and the top was 'blacks-only.'  I was in a hurry and had not put on my shoes when I left the house, and when I skidded to a stop at the bottom of the stairs on the side of the bar and jumped off the bike my foot came down on the sharp edge of the lid of a discarded sardine can.  I was in pain and starting to bleed and focused on what I should do...this day is crystal clear in my memory.   A shiny black top-less jeep with the Sheriff's star on the side pull up to the building near my discarded bike.  The Sheriff got out and reached into the back seat and retrieved a rifle of some sort.  He looked at me and told me to head on home and then walked to the balcony side of the upstairs bar where I had a clear view of three black men that were leaning over the railing and talking.  He raised the rifle and fired, and blew the head off of the black man closest to us.  He then walked back to his jeep and drove off.  I couldn't move for a minute, but soon hopped on my bike and raced home.  When I got home and told my mother what had happened she looked at me and shook her head and said, \"Son, you are going to have to realize that things like this happen.'\"To give this story some context, Jack's father was the local physician and his mother was a community leader and a member of the suffragette movement.  What he was saying was that his mother knew what battles to choose to fight and what battles would be dangerous to enter.Jack took a sip from his water glass and continued with a second story, \"When I was a teenager I was riding a bus to visit my Aunt in another city.  We came to small town and a black man and a white woman got on the bus.  They found two seats in the middle of the bus and sat down.  People on the bus murmured and looked around since blacks were supposed to sit in the back of the bus.  We waited for the time for the bus to leave.  In a short time two men boarded the bus, grabbed the black man, who sat across from me, dragged him off the bus and threw him to the ground outside my window and proceeded to kick and beat him mercilessly.  Then the bus driver released the brake and we drove to the next town.  I learned later in the paper that the black man had died the next day, the white woman was his wife, and they were visiting from the Bahamas.\"  He said all this without emotion in his voice.Then he turned to his wife and smiled.  \"Remember, Meg, that winter when we were walking on the black beach and collecting sea urchin specimens for research?\"  Meg nodded with resignation.\"It was a cold and windy day and the beach was bare of people.  Meg and I had been married only a short time.  We were filling a bag when the local park ranger walked up, gun in hand, and asked us what in the hell we were doing and did we not know this was a blacks-only beach?  We explained, as he raised the gun, that we were collecting specimens for science and that no one was beaching due to the cold weather.  He told us to get the hell off the beach and that if we were found on this beach again we would be banned from all beach parks in the State for life!\"  Jack smiled wryly.  \"Of course, this was an idle threat with no means of enforcement but the gun pointed in our direction made us scurry away apologetically.\"Tabor, who had grown up in the mid-west and not seen much discrimination, perhaps because there were few to discriminate against, was having trouble breathing as these vignettes unfolded.Yet, there was still another story to tell.  \"A few years later Meg and I had made friends with this musician from a black college and he had invited us to a concert the college was giving to hear him play.  Meg loves music and so we agreed to go.  When we arrived at the concert hall we were directed to four seats a few rows back and in the center in the auditorium.  The President of this black college greeted us with his wife and sat with us!  We enjoyed the concert tremendously.  A week later we received a letter from OUR university Dean that said we would lose all privileges at our university if we attended any more events at the black college while we were employed at the University.  I still have the letter.\"As you read this, you might be thinking...well, times change.  That may be true, but people do not.  One more story to tell.  When Jack and Meg were at a church reception following the funeral of a dear friend a few years ago, one of the grand old dames of the community was holding court from her chair.  When complaints started about this new President Obama and how awful it was that he got elected she raised her cup of punch for emphasis and this church going lady said clearly \"Someone should just kill the damn ni**er.\"Jack leads a life full of dramatic and interesting events and has no need to make up or enhance stories.  These are all true with the names changed to protect the innocent and may the guilty be forever damned."},
{"title": "Taking Action", "date": "Sunday, October 06, 2013", "text": "Yes, I have started taking a Vitamin D supplement as advised.  For the first few days I doubled the dose by taking a pill morning and evening to see if I could jump start how I feel.  I also renewed my calcium supplements.  Both of these were recommended by my physician a few years ago, but I did not follow through for very long as I should have.  (Thus, I am not taking these just because many of my blog readers recommended it.  We all should follow the guidance of our doctor when paired with blogger advice.  I do love you all for being so helpful and kind!)I will wait on the therapy unless my next meet-up with Doc says it would be a good idea.  (I AM feeling better mood wise and MAYBE energy wise.)  I hate that mental therapy in culture is so stigmatized! There was a delay in re-starting my exercise program because I have company coming this week.  These are old friends of hubby that we have not seen as often as we would like since they live in Florida.  They are the \"millionaires next door\" because they have received several mil from the DOD for their land.  They are allowed to live in their charming little house on this land until they die.  You would NEVER know they had this much money because they live a normal retiree life-style except for more travel to exotic locations than the average retired couple.I did finally open one of the two Yoga DVDs that I bought so many months ago.  This summer has been too crazy for Yoga and I have been too lazy.  I will try to follow one of these when I am through writing this post.  I have found that only the beginners Yoga levels can be done with any safety by me!I do think one of the stimulus for this downer period in my mood was a \"co-leader\" that I work with on one of my volunteer projects.  In the beginning she was very critical at the lack of communication from my end but this mid-summer anything from her role as the museum contact was deadly silent.  I would show up at our meetings to find that I was faced with some deadline or misunderstanding because the DD at the museum had met with her but I never got emailed or contacted on any of the decisions and/or resulting deadlines that she agreed to.  When I returned after my cruise and asked what had transpired while I was gone (so I could write the monthly report) her total response was \"We accomplished a lot!  Just look around!\"  It seems my resignation as co-leader did not release me from angst as much as I had hoped and feeling that I failed in some way...but I am moving forward on that.The final punch to my gut has been the TP group that with hubris, glee, confusion and ignorance has adversely affected the lives of many young and highly professional people I know.  (When you cannot win the game by playing by the rules, kick that ball into the woods and then blame it on the other team.)  The hidden frustration of my bureaucrat hard-working and furloughed friends on FB has worried me.  In a second fell swoop these past years the TP gang has reduced much enthusiasm for entering public service.  Big money has flooded the rural areas with radio and TV dishonesty and fed the frustration and anger most of us had with this world by advocating a slash and burn agenda.  And many have been boondoggled into thinking this is a good approach.  If this continues there is a good chance that my Social Security check will stop or at the very least pause.  I have saved several months of cash...but I know many, many, many folks do not have this luxury.  No wonder I am depressed, and not listening to the TV news doesn't remove what I see happening all around me where I live.  I have been waited on by an administrative assistant who lost her job at the nearby military base due to sequestration, I know scientists that have lost their research due to a lengthy gap in funding their work, and others whose federal budgets have been FLAT for a decade.  This President has lost my strong support by allowing the TP to put us in this corner with his lack of hard negotiating skills.  He gave away much with budget cuts with the sequestration months ago and now we are STILL in a corner and I do not have the stomach to go through this again in mid-November if we do move on.  He and his team have also failed to really explain the pros and cons of the ACA implementation...where it costs us more and where it saves us more.  (Although I will admit I am amazed at how stupid many Americans are about this. Sanjay guupta says 2/3s of Americans admit they do not know much about the ACA.   If you have not seen Jimmy Kimmel's street segment you probably do not know what I am talking about.)On an uplifting note the pottery below was our recognition gift from the County for being one of their \"beautiful\" people.  The dozen people we were nominated with were so much more \"beautiful\" than hubby or I and I was impressed with how carefully they made this ceremony more than a token feel-good event.  Each County Commissioner was responsible for reading the information on two or three of the people being honored.  (It did surprise me how many of these Commissioners could NOT read!)  The press from a half dozen news offices snapped away making me feel like a celebrity and they provided a nice lunch.  I met that one County Commissioner (yep, a TP dude) with his genuinely warm smile and handshake and the fact that he remembered my protest letter...showing what a good politician he is...even though his response to me had been somewhat condescending in the original email reply last year, he was super warm and friendly at this event.The wine cork trivets in the back were made by my lovely DIL as gifts from her wedding."},

I move lots in the gardens.  I hike.  I walk.  I move household goods.  My diet is reasonably good since fall is harvest season, so I get lots of fresh veggies.  I have not increased consumption of sugar or alcohol...although I think I am drinking more coffee these days.  At my age if one lets one's mind wander, it can drift down dangerous and depressing avenues.  Could this could be a mild health issue camouflaging more serious issues?  I watch the news too much and wonder if, indeed, our world and our society are coming to a sad end?  Is that the source of my angst?  As I age I realize various neurons do not fire as they should...am I slowly loosing my mind?  Why am I forgetting things that I don't really care about?  Why don't I care about stuff?My only plan for right now is to try to stop thinking about this.  And, yes, formal exercise should begin to filter its way into my web of days...maybe starting tomorrow?I just hate that at this time in my life I am not more stable and more 'normal'.  I thought life would be far less of an emotional roller coaster.  I sometimes feel like I am in junior high once again second guessing every decision and every conversation and wondering who I really am and what the h**l have I actually done with my life thus far?"},
{"title": "Trying to Find Time to Watch a Season Pass", "date": "Sunday, September 29, 2013", "text": "I have been waiting for down time to write in depth on at least one or two of the many thoughts that flit through my head just before I drift off to sleep.  I think of some 'great concept' or some 'interesting idea' that I could elaborate upon in my 'unread' blog, but by morning the idea has melted away like the mist in the valleys of West Virginia this time of year.  My mind is freshly empty as usual, or the idea looks like stale popcorn in the cold light of day.  We both felt a call of the mountains this week, and while there was much to do here to get ready for winter, we took off on a last minute trip to one of the state parks.  We lucked out on getting the last room because they were renovating (which we had not known) and everything was being torn up.  Noise and sawdust and hearty laughs of construction workers mingled with autumn colors, morning mist, evening shadows, fearless deer and wet mossy trails to hike.It is illegal to feed the deer, this tourist is just rattling some paper!The pool was empty of summer visitors.The tour bus and the convention started the following day, thus we had the old fashioned bar to ourselves.  It was slated for paint and new furniture that week!Even the sign above did not discourage us in our pursuit of peace.This trail was marked as \"more difficult.\"Finding a few last cranberries.These prior weeks before and after the cruise were busy:  we had been briefly honored by the County Commissioners (yes including the one I wrote that nasty email to a year ago about the trees) for our volunteer work, visited by my daughter's family with her three children and her two friends and their twins to feed and entertain, worked at the art museum for their Art Fest and filled other weekends by working/packing/painting at my son's house which has now SOLD!!

{"title": "You Know When It Is Time to Move On.", "date": "Sunday, September 22, 2013", "text": "I do not know if you have ever experienced working with a group and noticed something has changed or shifted in its personality.  You cannot put your finger on it, and you ignore it or forget about it because there is so much to do and accomplish. I have been coordinating a volunteer garden group of gardeners for almost two years.  I had been cautioned when I took over leadership that the last leader did not communicate well enough with everyone.  Thus, I focused on maintaining an accurate email and tree phone list, wrote a weekly update along with plans for the coming week, made sure that people were thanked and praised for whatever project they finished or started.  I asked for ideas, suggestions, etc. on the work ahead.  I wrote a monthly report for the museum, which the prior person had not done.  But since all the other volunteer groups write monthly reports I thought we should do so as well.I even took over the work of purchasing plants and equipment through the museum's various accounts (which is a nightmare!), because my \"co-leader\" had been doing it and felt she could no longer.  I had asked this woman to be a co-leader since both she and her husband were much more involved in the museum than I and I wanted an insider to make sure we were connected to the museum and its various activities and that we had a reliable contact and I had a back-up when I was on trips and such.This woman that I asked was a very hard worker but she was also a hard critic of others.  I ignored her criticism of others and tried to focus on what was working rather than what was not.The group's size has grown and shrunk and grown over the months as most of these folks are elderly and find the physical work challenging and new members to the area decide to join and give it a go for a while.  We can have as many as 10 volunteers but mostly we are down to a small core of permanent loyalists.  I have noticed in the last few weeks that some of the group are more reticent in talk and tend to work in a smaller group in areas of the grounds.  I try to ask questions of each person for input on how we were doing and for ideas on challenges.  One of the more communicative members suggested that we needed to get a fall schedule of projects formalized and she compiled a nice draft suggestion list.  I pulled this together and organized it for weekly tasks and added a few things that went with the plants and their growth habits as the cool weather began.Then I took off on my two week trip leaving all else up to the co-leader.  When I returned I sent out an email for input on what was happening and did not get any response.  When I showed up on the day of our volunteer work , the few that were there had already started earlier.  I assisted where I could although no one explained what they had been done and what they were planting.  At the end of the work session I asked how things had gone for the past two weeks and where we were on the fall schedule and what had been completed.My co-leader, without stopping in her walk back to the shed, said over her shoulder,  \"A lot.  Just open your eyes.  Look around!\"I was a little dumbstruck as she sounded impatient or at the very least short, but I smiled and said, \"Great!\" but also realized that I was not going to be able to write an update for the week or the monthly report with this much 'detailed' information as she walked away.  I also decided at that moment in time and with surprising relief, this group was ready for new leadership.  I was ready to move on to something else, many other projects, garden and non-garden, that are waiting for me and that are more in the gardening education mode rather than maintenance.  On Monday I am stopping by the volunteer coordinator's office and letting her and the Admin. Assistant of the museum know I am quitting.  I will not be able to meet with the group on our regular session as I have a bank meeting that morning, but on Monday afternoon I will email all the volunteers and let them know.  I will finish a plant inventory that needs to be done in the coming weeks.  Our group usually disbands at the end of October until spring, so this gives them plenty of time to re-group and me time to mellow out and quite second-guessing myself!"},
{"title": "Arrrgggh!", "date": "Thursday, September 19, 2013", "text": "Since today is international pirate day is seems appropriate to post about the boat/ship part of the cruise on the Danube.In one of the earlier posts on this series of posts about my river cruise I included a photo that showed how many times this Danube river floods and how high those floods go.  Actually, when booking the cruise, we had heard that sometimes you spend more time being shuttled by bus from town to town because the river is too dry or too high for using the long boats.  It cannot be helped.  We had read that the spring floods were more of an issue, so we booked in the fall and lucked out with gorgeous weather except for the colder rain on our last day in Nuremberg.These ships are high tech including 110 and 220 outlets, wi-fi for passengers, and a flat screen TV in every room!Since the Danube has numerous bridges across it, ten built in the last decade, the ship has a wheel house that lowers to go under the older bridges and sometimes the top deck will be closed to passengers if the bridge is deemed too low for safety.   Everything in the photo above, including that wheel house, collapses or lowers down to the level of the railing on the right side of the photo when going under a low bridge.This cruise also goes several hundred miles through three countries and I am guessing over 40 locks...but I did not count.  Most of them are entered during the evening when we were sleeping.  It took less than 30 minutes to go through most.  Some of the locks rise or lower the ship 100 feet and there is a high wall on each side of the ship during that time.  Lock time must be reserved ahead with the lock master since dozens of passenger and cargo ships go up and down the Danube each day.  Sometimes we had to wait for a ship to go through the lock before us and sometimes it was wide enough for two ships to go through at the same time.During our cruise there was a strike in Germany by the lock masters.  Technology has made these jobs more obsolete with the trend to have many locks being managed by one lock master via computer.  Therefore, our schedule was bumped up just a little so that we got through the regular locks before the strike.  We were bused back to one of the cities for our day tour as a result of that.These locks can be a tight fit and yet were rarely felt a bump!  But the piloting did require miniscule movements.  In the photo below is a boat transferring cargo.  The interesting thing about these is that they are called \"family ships\" because a family lives on them in the back cabin.  They eat, sleep and work there.  Usually these ships are operated 24 hours for economic reasons.  We were told that the husband does an 8-hour shift, the wife an 8-hour shift and then there is a mate that is hired who lives in the front area of the ship and he/she pulls the third shift. Children are raised on the ship until they are of school age and they are sent to a special school with the children of other families that work on cargo ships.  There is even a 'town' of 'family ships' somewhere on the river which includes a hospital ship and repair ship. etc.  It is like a little water world community.  The children usually follow in their parents footsteps when they become adults starting out as mates.Well, that is the end of my journey and I have enjoyed reliving it through my blog posts.  Yes, I did enjoy every bit of it and had not a single complaint for the whole time!  Thanks for enduring this memory and am so happy that some of you enjoyed this series."},

{"title": "Setting Sail", "date": "Monday, September 16, 2013", "text": "I went on a large Disney cruise years ago and the person who coordinated it said it would be wonderful because I would never have to worry about seeing my grandchildren.  She was absolutely correct in that I never saw the kids except at dinner and that made me rather sad.  There was manufactured fun on the ship or lots of sitting around on the ship or exercising on the ship and nothing to see but the ocean for hours.  I disliked the whole experience.  Our stateroom was small with no windows and very crowded since we also had the 'pac and play' for our youngest and tucked her in each evening.  Therefore, I will never go on a cruise with over a thousand people like that again.  Whenever we came into a port we disgorged lots of people and swarmed over stores and restaurants like nasty bees.  We got only one beach day after all the confinement!  There were lots of sticky sweet tropical alcoholic drinks, if that is your cup of tea!This Viking river cruise was so different in that there were no waves, no manufactured fun (well a little) and the room was just a little more spacious and the groups for tours were much smaller-one bus load.  The views were always interesting as you could see the shore each and every day and most of this part of Europe is not ugly industrial.  The cruise director and all of our guides had a wealth of knowledge about the area and its history and answered our various questions completely when we saw something curious or wonderful.One of the responders to a prior post voiced concern about how the lower level staff could be treated (mistreated) on a cruise ship.  It is my understanding from the upper level staff that Viking works very hard at keeping good working relations and decent living conditions among all staff.  I do know that the ship interrupted their schedule to stop at a small town to let off one of the lower level staff who had a family emergency, and they provided him with a train ticket to Vienna and a plane ticket home.  Yet, I am sure their living quarters were tight on board ship and I do know they worked very long hours.We did learn that the Danube can be a ruthless river and the flood this last May left devastation to these lovely old medieval cities all along its coast.  Where our guide is holding his hand is the level of the flood waters of that most recent flood in May of this year in the city of Regensburg, Germany.  All the other dates and marks written on the wall are other floods in this town dating back to the 1500's.  The people do not have flood insurance to cover losses and the government no longer allows them to live on the ground floor.  They may use it only for business.Perhaps that is why this tattoo parlor on the ground floor is so sparsely furnished?Most of the architecture away from the river is not as old as it looks.  Many parts of the various cities were rebuilt or restored after fires and wars and are not original...but you would be hard pressed to recognize that restoration except for their clean condition.  They paid great attention to detail creating buildings that looked like the original.  They are proud of their heritage and proud of their link to the past and their part in the history of the world.  But I did get the impression that the Germans were most happy to pause only shortly at WWII sites for tours and quickly move on to the wonderful medieval history that reflects their history so much more fully.  They know that those of us from the new world are most fascinated by this much older history and most depressed by the most recent World War.There was a small mix-up in the call for the tour guide and this lovely woman in black had left mass (it was Sunday) to come guide us through her hometown of Regensburg.  She appeared to be late until her son, the young man in the photo below this, appeared and said that he had been scheduled for the tour which resulted in the mix up in names.  Honestly ladies, which guide would you rather have??Just as an aside, our guide's lederhosen belonged to his grandfather and he had just inherited them from him as a gift and was most happy as they were far more comfortable than his newer ones.  He explained that it might take years to break in lederhosen to a comfortable wearing level. His shoes are a traditional Bavarian half shoe.  Isn't he scrumptious even right down to his shoes?"},
{"title": "Three Cities", "date": "Sunday, September 15, 2013", "text": "Our first two days after arrival at our hotel and before boarding our ship we relaxed in Budapest, Hungary.  This city a combination of the cities of Buda and Pest and the older community of Obuda.  Much of the city is a World Heritage Site and really, really lovely.  I think it was my favorite city, but we spent most of our time walking and walking and walking there over two days and that might be why.  We felt very safe and did not encounter any situation that made us uncomfortable. The city is full of professional people:Poor people who live on recycling:Striking laborers:Government employees:and tourists:This is not my husband. He would not be caught dead in those jeans or those shoes!.If we had more time in the remnants of our lives and more money in our bank account and fewer places in the world to still visit we would go back to Budapest for a week and just see it all more closely and eat more of the fabulous food and watch people more.  The strength and patriotism of these people is reflected so well in what they have accomplished after the devastation of recent wars and the evolution following past ancient wars.  First there were the Celts, followed by the Romans, then the Hungarians which were pillaged by the Mongols, followed by 150 years of Ottoman rule eventually to become a capital of the Austro-Hungarian empire (which was no small empire) which then dissolved after WWI and attack by Germany and then Russian rule.  Heroes' Square in Budapest gives just a small clue with statues of various Hungarian leaders across this history.So much city and so little time!"},
{"title": "Booming with the Baby Boomers", "date": "Friday, September 13, 2013", "text": "There will be time to write about the trip itself and all the wonderful things to which we were exposed, but first, I need to write about the culture of these cruises.  We went on what they call a Viking 'long' ship so named as an homage to the real Viking long ships...although this ship was one of the long rivers ships as well.  These trips are very expensive and so only a specific demographic is going to cross that aluminum bridge from foreign soil to the ship.  The passengers are almost all over the age of 60.  A few are very old and even use canes to get around.  One dear soul had recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer and he plowed through each and every day with much aplomb although he needed a wheel chair for most things.  The passengers are all former or current professionals or from successful well-paying careers.  They are mostly Jewish, Catholic, Presbyterian, and Methodist with maybe just a few other beliefs thrown in.  They are liberal, moderate and conservative.  Most are Canadians or British, a few from New Zealand and Australian, and all the rest from all over the world but mostly the United States.You usually eat breakfast, lunch and dinner on the ship at family style tables in the terrace cafe or the more formal dining room and thus the culture seems to be getting to know as many people as you can.  Most tables in the dining room seat six to eight.  It is not as artificial as it sounds because after such good food and wine that flows like water you find that the things you share with these people are substantial and the differences few.  Grandchildren, aches and pains, interest in the global economy, history of the world and the area in which you are traveling, and personal experiences are the topics of conversation.  I met a forensic scientist/lawyer who wrote a book on how to investigate a bomb explosion, a forestry scientist who saved a forest in Canada, several computer people who invented their own programs, chemists, a dermatologist, a dentist, an engineer on the Alaska pipe line, lawyers, educators, librarians, etc.  They played golf or violins or chess in their spare time.   They were not shy and were leaders in their communities.  They were upper middle class.  This is not a place that I see myself fitting into...but maybe I do?  Many were great at remembering names...but if your name was not Johan, Malcolm, Moira, Barbara, Bill or Sandy (both a male and female were named that last one) I had trouble calling you by name.  Meeting a dozen or so passengers each day is a challenge indeed even though many of us wore name tags part of the day!The staff that kept the ship clean and kept the wine flowing were mostly from the Philippines.  They worked 8 months on and 4 months off (the last unpaid I think, although Viking paid for their way home).  The professional staff (engineers, chefs, cruise directors, hotel managers) came from the local area: Germany, Austria, Romania, Slovakia, etc and work six weeks on and two off.  They are the most well-trained staff you will ever encounter.  They politely and with genuine permanent smiles put up with forgetfulness, hearing problems, stress over travel and just plan crankiness in people who were adjusting to time changes.  The staff were really wonderful and worth the recommended tip at the end of the cruise.  The food was delicious and fresh if not exactly 4 star.  Serving 190 people three meals a day does not lend itself to high end food. but the desserts and pastries were phenomenal, and they would take back anything you did not like and bring you something else.  'Malcolm's' wife had them take back the filet mignon twice before it was cooked to her non-pink preference.  (I think the Chef was considering slitting his wrists by then, but he overcooked it like shoe leather for her on the final try.)The cruise director has a full schedule planned for each day.  You can participate in all or none of the activities.  Some tours are more leisurely for the slow walking set.  We participated in everything and even added three optional tours which meant we were exhausted at the end of each day.  They even had evening musicians, dancers, singers and lectures if you could keep your eyes open after dinner or if you were hyper-active.  Needless to say, 80% of us were in bed by 10:00 P.M.The rooms were small but large enough to sleep in for a week's trip.  We got the cheapest rooms which meant the window was tiny and above our heads unlike all the balcony or french balcony windows on the decks above.  We reached it after a long walk down the hall on the lowest level and it WAS quiet.  We could still see out across the water from a window at the top of our wall and determine if we were moving or at dock.  The stability of the ship is so good that most of the time you could only tell movement by the sound of rushing water or the movement of the tree line past the window.  At the end, we did not regret getting the cheaper room because we were on the sundeck or the front lounge or off the ship most of the time.  The only disadvantage is if you wanted scenery without people you had to search for a little corner on the above levels.This little dog took hubby's book for a read, but did not lose his place.X-rated photo of hubby taking a

For those who cannot travel for oh so many reasons, I will bore you with photos and anecdotes when I return that you can skip until I run out of material and get back in a regular drain, chain, lane of thought."},

My DIL is a hoarder collector of all kinds of stuff and she gets very attached to memorabilia.  I can sell you two boxed and never opened Baltimore Orioles bobble head dolls! ( I also discovered that fancy letter boxes would be a nice Christmas gift.)  My son is a sound engineer and owns three four guitars along with enough sound system equipment to furnish a studio.  Various relatives have donated odds and ends furniture to the young couple over the years and if you add all the wedding gifts, mostly kitchen stuff and linens, then you have a two-bedroom 900 square foot house that has only pathways between rooms to move about.  For many days it has looked like an episode of Hoarders or some tragic accident of nature.They finally rented a storage unit and have it now two-thirds filled it with crap all their extra stuff.  We packed boxes, lifted heavy furniture, loaded a file cabinet, and threw out as much stuff as they would let us after we finished the yard.I remember one year when I moved my daughter into college and my mother-in-law into our house in a matter of weeks.  I had hoped then that this type of craziness would no longer fill my life.  ( I really have to find a way to be out of town when they make the move into the newly purchased house!)Monday, after this super weekend, I came home and realized I had to go over my house with a fine tooth comb after the departure of little ones.  I got 6 loads of laundry done, (haven't yet stripped the two beds upstairs,) and dusted, vacuumed and mopped floors, cleaned out the toy cupboard to throw away stuff, cleaned out the DVDs and separated children's books from library books, completing just the main rooms on the main floor.  Next, after Tuesdays volunteer morning, I have to do bathrooms, my master bedroom and the main floor closets.  The basement and upstairs will have to wait a day or two more.I am not writing all this to brag about my industrious life style.  This is just he way that I am.  I do get pleasure out of having things neat and organized for at least a short time.  I could also write about months being a couch potato, but that will happen this winter.At any rate one would think that restorative sleep is what my body would demand after all this physical and mindless labor.  But it seems that I get about 5 hours of sleep and then find myself wide awake waiting for morning to begin so that I can get more stuff done.  I am sure a therapist could have a field day with such antics, but unless they can help me sleep through the night, I have no desire to know why I am this way."},

Plans!  I frequently break them.Thursday:  processed Italian flat beans for freezer, made two loaves zucchini bread from new Cuisinart cookbook, was interrupted by various calls from son who has found a house they can't afford, thus,bread gets over processed and becomes brick pudding!Friday:  agree to provide financial backing to son until they sell their current teeny-tiny house so that they can bid on this other house---excellent location and move-in condition, prices will go up this coming spring and they will not be able to afford anything in this neighborhood!  Those of you who do not live in a dynamic city have not a clue how expensive real estate is/was and why we agree to jump on this.Saturday:  six loads of laundry after the grands left and straighten upstairs and basement toys!   Feed pets they accidentally left behind with garden harvest cherry tomatoes.  Roast garden eggplant.  Weed flower beds.  Take photos.Sunday:   finally cleaned out the inside of my car, shopped for walking shoes for a fall vacation trip (a really neat one that I certainly deserve after this crazy summer), bought new luggage as mine broke, and shopped for food.  Son calls and his offer is accepted.   (Between vacations and real estate support watching money dwindle fast.)Monday:  changed master bedroom linens, paid bills online, drove up to the city and took a walk through with the son's home inspector on this \"new\" house, impressed with small house and location, depressed when returning to son's/DIL's teeny-tiny house in its NOT move-in condition.  Tons of work to be done and they are not happy to hear us tell it.Tuesday--TODAY:  morning volunteer work on marine museum landscaping, then an hour at the art museum children's vegetable garden getting it wound down, then food shop for the grands, then trip up tonight or tomorrow to get them.Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday:  entertaining the grandchildren once again.  picnics, museum trips, boat rides, hikes, puzzles, movies, cooking....whatevah!Saturday:  drive the hour up to drop off grandkids, head over to son's/DIL's house and begin hours of yard work, mulching, cleaning up old wood piles and leftover gutter grids, pruning back invasives etc. then head home. (There is not room in their house to sleep with all the wedding gifts.)Sunday:  drive the hour back up to finish yard work, look at prepping outside house trim for painting, plan for installation of a fence on one side of the yard to hide the neighbors backyard which they have turned into storage for their landscape business. (Hoping neighbors fix the large work truck with the flat that is sitting in their drive way and hoping we can get them to clean up their backyard peacefully as they are probably illegal both in having the business in the backyard and in living in this country!)Monday: breathe and perhaps clean house and maybe just maybe get into an exercise routine once again(?)Tuesday:  start the yardwork volunteer schedule all over again!  Looking forward to future long empty days of retirement somewhere/somehow."},

{"title": "A Big Deal", "date": "Friday, August 16, 2013", "text": "We have lived for several years with three large tulip poplars on the side of the house where the storms arrive.  Most of the trees in the ravine that die fall in the direction of the house.  During hurricanes we go down into the basement and hope that they will not fall against our bedroom wall.I took the photo above to show the permit office, because you need to get permission to cut any trees, and I call these 'hazard' trees which makes it easier to get permission.  The permit costs $180.00...our lives and the lives of those we love...priceless.This photo is from behind the house and there are actually three trees we had to remove.  Two are very close on the right side of the photo.  The third is the one that appears to be leaning right beside it.We asked our neighbor for a good company and he sent us these good old boys.  I use this term with the greatest of endearment...because they really are!They use a slingshot with a weighted bag to shoot through the branches of the tree they wish to down.  It was not going to be topped or cut up for firewood.  We just wanted a safe 'drop', which is cheaper and safer for all when you have lots of room as we do.  They then feed a heavy-duty rope through the path of the slingshot and pull taught after the cutter cuts the wedge and the other side of the trunk directing the fall.The fellow above who weighed about 90 pounds was in charge.  He was in his 50's and had been dropping trees for decades, one of the few with the skill in the county.  He had been working with some Naval group in his youth and kept apologizing for the four letter words that the crew was using.  He said they were somewhat new and he was trying to train them.  I just smiled.  All I cared about was that they were being careful and concentrating and if that meant they had to swear...so be it.  The trees were tulip poplars which are considered shallow rooted and easy to rot.As you can hear in this video above (not taken with a fancy movie camera), I was quite impressed and just a little terrified!!  I feel so sad about the great gap that we left in the ravine and the death of these old ones, but I feel so much safer sleeping at night after the ground has been soaked for days and before the arrival of a nasty storm."},
{"title": "Getting Permission", "date": "Friday, August 16, 2013", "text": "Several bloggers commented on the fact that I had to purchase a permit to bring down those trees which were on property I owned.  First, the ravine, while owned by me, is considered an environmental easement and I am not allowed to do anything there without asking.  While I agree that it seems too much government in my life, I have seen properties where they cut down every single tree along the river so that they get a perfect open view and so that others can see their perfect open house and so that their lawn fertilizer and broad leaf herbicide can flow freely into the river!  Yes, they get fined.  BUT they are rich and the $10K seems a small price to pay for a full water view so they can show off and screw the environment.  I wish the county would make them also plant trees as part of restoration.  Other counties in this liberal state do that.Why do we care if people cut down trees willy nilly?  Well, our river goes back and forth on being clean and then polluted and then clean again.  Run-off is a big deal and trees drink lots of that water and keep the rest of the run=off purer.  They stop erosion and provide important shade and habitat for animals and clean the air.  I could go on and on about living in balance with everything else.Our county is so restrictive because I live within 100 feet of the water.  That 100 foot buffer I am not allowed to touch...build, cut, or clear!  My neighbor who owns a landscape company ignored this on his many acres and cleared his land under the trees and then paid the fine for clearing away too much brush.  They are rich and he just accepted the fine as the cost for what he wanted to do.  I feel strongly about trying to keep the environment protected and my footprint small and so I do follow the rules.  I am an environmentalist as well and terrified at what we are doing to the air, water and land.  I have seen more animals and birds in my yard each year.Our county also can ask you to plant up to 3 trees for every tree you cut under a permit!  But as the \"good ole boy\" tree cutter clarified, you can plant a seedling and if a deer eats it, it is not your fault and no one comes to check.  I will pay the permit, get permission and now that the county office knows we have planted lots of trees on our own and are not pushing our limits, they do not ask us to plant trees to replace those we bring down.  I can live with it."},

{"title": "One Night In Baltimore", "date": "Monday, July 29, 2013", "text": "Baltimore is an interesting and dynamic city.  It is also a dangerous city.  One can wander just a few blocks off center and find themselves in communities of extreme poverty, communities that are mostly black, and communities where people will fix your car if it breaks down on their street and then drive it away. There was a TV drama show called \"The Wire\" about crime and the drug trafficking in the city of Baltimore which got positive critical review for its honesty and acting.  It was dark and gritty and the kind of thing us white folks in our safe little homes watch with interest as we might watch a train wreck or analyze cultural diversity.All of the ugly racism which has crawled out from under our dirty beds and is being displayed on Facebook, Twitter and talking head news shows brought back a memory of something that happened to me a few years ago in Baltimore.  It was a very short incident, and had the city and the character types been different, it would not even be a memory.  I searched to see if I had written about this before, but could not find a related post.The time of year was August.  Hot town summer in the city.  My husband and I had taken this lengthy drive to celebrate an anniversary.  He was taking me to a favorite fancy restaurant in this town.  I was dressed up more than usual and had shiny swinging earrings and more make up on than I normally wear and was in a dress-up mood.  We had been ignored by our kids for the better part of the summer, and as a reassurance, we were purposely going to celebrate the end of the summer like we used to so many years ago.We were driving on a brightly lit street downtown in a main tourist area of the city where the weekend evening traffic was picking up.  We came to a red light and hubby stopped the car.  I glanced over to my right at the car next to me.  Inside were four twenty-something black men.  Their hair was in crazy shiny dreadlocks and one had gold earrings and their heads were bobbing back and forth to some music I could not hear.  One of the men said something funny and they all threw back their heads in laughter, their brilliant white teeth like tiny flashlights against their dark black skin in the dark car.  They were having a really good time.I instinctively broke into a broad smile perhaps feeling glad that others were also in a good mood on this evening.  (Perhaps in the back of my mind hidden way deep somewhere, I realized they might be drug gang members and carrying guns inside or high on cocaine or ecstasy, but this thought did not surface to the front of my mind.)The driver instinctively turned mid-laugh to look at me.  Our eyes connected for one of those seconds that seen to last for ten as we both sat just a few feet from each other, our proximity almost creating a personal space.  The whites of his eyes were as bright as his teeth.  He clearly saw my smile but I could see he was registering my race, my age and my attitude and so many other things in that second and evaluating me and what I had seen.  I did not stop smiling and since my smile was not some fear-filled reaction but a true feeling of enjoyment at their fun, he suddenly grinned an even bigger grin and tilted his head to me in greeting as the light changed and we both pulled away, hubby making a left turn and the car filled with black young men driving on.I have no idea what I am trying to convey by writing about this incident.  I am not saying I am some sweet person who can see the good in all and help change the world with a smile (although why not?), or that drug dealers are balanced folks and just need the reasonable smile of some old white lady, or that black men with dreadlocks and earrings and nice cars are even always drug dealers!  Maybe they were Ravens players!  Maybe they were DJ's heading to a wedding?I guess I am just saying that I wished the world was always like this.  Nonjudgmental and gracious and ending with peaceful departures."},

It is opposite of what I wanted to purchase and I hate the way marketers lie to us.I have grown more addicted to all those British mysteries on TV these days.  Please read the following in a nice British accent.  \"Why you might ask do I add this to my list.  I dare say, they do pass the time for one such as I on a warm summer night and the opposites that they bring to the evening are lovely cottages with bunches of pastel flowers hanging over rustic stone walls followed by entry into a room with a well-stocked library and a prone body usually covered in crimson blood.\"And my final news that I discovered this week is that space Scientists have provided a photograph of the tiny earth next to Saturn's rings from that distant telescope at a fun new angle from so many miles away.  Our planet is just a spark of light in the photo.  You and I are so small in the grand scheme of things.  But, for additional perspective, science also has discovered a new virus that is 1,000 times larger than any virus known to man and 80% of its DNA is brand new to us.  Science keeps looking inward and outward and finds many new miracles.(only 10...can you come up with the rest?)"},

{"title": "The Devil Is Too Dumb to Mess with the Details When I am in Charge", "date": "Sunday, July 14, 2013", "text": "(I will post this today although I am in an extremely angry and sad mood.  Another murderer has gone free and I do want to caution all parents of teenagers to make sure they get only slightly tanned this summer, to not wear that new sports hoody if a cooler breeze from a storm comes up, to not take any shortcuts on their way home, to not confront someone who asks if they are where they should be while shopping, to not attempt to defend themselves if a vigilante person pulls a gun (which he no doubt did), and to make sure they call the more erudite friend on the phone if they want a witness and advice on the altercation prior to their death.  Do not doubt that it is now open season on young black men by those who want to hunt them down, because if you have been robbed by a black man, then all are suspect.)Okay, take a deep breath, and lets get back to documenting this wedding for posterity.I lucked out big time on this new daughter-in-law and her very nice parents.  You cannot pick your relatives nor can you pick the relatives of the daughter your son marries, but these folks are the salt of the earth and just plain good.  All of the extended family seems to follow that pattern.  They are also big do-it-yourselfers.  They know the value of a dollar and do not waste a penny.Thus the rehearsal dinner (for which we were responsible) was held at a rustic Pavilion in a state park.  At the suggestion of my son's in-laws we selected an Italian deli to provide the food.  This meant they did not serve...just provided big boxes of food and serving utensils.  We were responsible for dishes, utensils, glasses, napkins, etc.  There were 80 people invited to the dinner and about 65 showed up.  I have to admit that while I am not rich, I am not poor, and tend to want to just write a check if I am giving a party for 80 people.  But this was not meant to be.  The food arrived in what are called 'hot boxes' and have to be carefully placed over warming trays filled with water that sit above heating candles.  The relatives did most of this while I was doing something else...decorating the room.  (I am not in this photo although I wish I was that thin.)I put on my moving sandals (the gal above is the sister of the bride) and spent the better part of the evening decorating.  We covered the picnic tables with some marvelous green paper (exactly matched one of the brides colors) that is used by metal workers to protect their floors and was purchased at the MIL's office.  I had purchased country flowers which we place in mason jars that the parents had from another event.  They had some lovely rustic lanterns that had come from a friend's wedding and we used those also.This rustic sign was placed to direct folks from the parking lot and I smeared the names to remain anonymous.Lemonade and iced tea were made and placed in beautiful serving containers on end tables, sodas were placed in coolers that had been filled with ice and we turned on the fridge in the pavillion for more space for cold water and salad and fruit trays.  The park did not allow alcohol which was a little disappointment to the beer and wine fans, but not a terrible sacrifice as the food was wonderful.  We had stuffed pasta shells, BBQ pork, lemon chicken, baked beans, cheese potatoes, mixed green salad and mixed fruit salad.  Homemade cookies and bakery purchased pastries were placed on platters for dessert.  Yes, I did spend time replacing the large aluminum trays of food when they were emptied and we did do some juggling to get them over their warming trays without burning ourselves, but we all survived.  One of the aunties worked part time as a caterer and she and her husband were the perfect helpmates.There were several full trays of food left over and I had asked the bride's family if they had a food pantry that would take prepared food.  They went me one better.  The next day they delivered the food to a good sized family shelter!  The shelter was so pleased to be getting so much good food that they said it would last several days and they would be eating really well.  The rains came and went ever so lightly, but we were mostly inside.  The bugs were nasty out by the parking gate and the gatekeepers (we had reserved parking but most people tried to ignore the sign!) used lots of OFF which did not seem to help much.   One of the bouncers (actually a guest) came all the way from Scotland, can you tell who in the photo below?  In the Pavilion, which was screened,we remained bug free.Good food, good people and only one late best man to the rehearsal dinner which made for a lovely rehearsal dinner evening all in all."},
{"title": "If You Are Getting Married, Remember the Dirt!", "date": "Friday, July 12, 2013", "text": "More than ready, I had packed everything, including the new summer wear that I had purchased at the Dressbarn.  (I only shop at the most fancy places.)  I had gone to the big mall, but the high end shops did not have anything that appealed to me.  Instead I bought a black and emerald green Capri pants and top set that looked pretty good with my newly smaller figure.  (I lost only a little weight, but with Spanx I looked better than I had hoped.)  I also bought a bright orange outfit for the rehearsal dinner which was a BBQ at a state park.  In the event that you did not get the memo...oranges and blue greens are the 'in' color this year.  It was hard to find anything in other colors!Son had to ride up with us and could not leave from work earlier than 4:30 in the afternoon which meant we faced a 6.5 hour drive in the evening.  Shortly as we were heading out of the city, the bride texted Son about an errand.  Son turned to Dad and asked if he brought the 'dirt.'   I looked at hubby's blank expression.\"Remember, Dad, I asked you to bring some dirt from the yard.\"\"Dirt?\" I responded.  \"Why do you need dirt?\"Hubby continued to look blank.  Hubby is not a good person for details.\"The Union Ceremony,\" son replied.I gave him a confused look.\"You know, like lighting the candle?  We are planting a tree.\"I began to feel like I had missed a good part of this wedding ceremony already.   Should have I packed garden shoes and gear instead of the jewel toned summer wear? Well, we did not have any dirt from the yard and were already an hour and a half from our home.  Son had not grown up or even lived in our current home, anyway.  So, hubby, who is a master at fixing his forgetfulness, left the freeway and pulled into a side street by a small stream that ran by the high school where son went so many years ago.  I had clean doggie doo-doo bags in the glove compartment which had been useful for grandchild baby diapers.  We pulled far off the road and Son went tromping along the weeds down to the stream and collected dirt into the little bag and was soon back in the car and we were once again on our way.No pre-wedding jitters from him as you can see in the photo above.  He slept most of the way, hubby drove, and I took photos of the changing weather front across Pennsylvania, hoping it would settle down in the coming days for the outdoor wedding. We got in just before midnight and the bride-to-be picked Son up at our hotel to take him back to her parents home about five miles away, which is a bit of a modern arrangement, is it not?  We checked in and found our room through the mouse maze of a newly remodeled hotel and collapsed on our beds for a restorative sleep before the busy days ahead.This \"tree planting\" union ceremony glitch was not yet over, though.  The next day we discovered that the Mom and Dad of the bride had purchased a tree at the local greenery.  It was the smallest one they could find and was over 4 feet tall.  Too tall to place on a side table at the ceremony.  You can see the tree table just behind the bridesmaids in this photo.  Not a good idea for a large tree!Eventually it was decided that they would dig up a burning bush that had been replanted from her grandmother's yard the year before.  It was very healthy.  It was the right size.  It came from her 90-year-old grandmother's yard AND from her parents yard.  We could work with that symbolism.  You can just see it between the two bridesmaids on the left of your computer screen in the above photo.  I will briefly explain another glitch was the rains at the in-laws house had forced an ant nest into the bush pot and we had to contend with that before bringing the plant to the ceremony by soaking the whole thing in water for a few hours.  (I really should have packed garden gear and clothes!)Now if I can just keep it alive in these torrential downpours until they return from the honeymoon..."},
{"title": "Exhaling ", "date": "Wednesday, July 10, 2013", "text": "The mother-of-the-groom is back, her house is empty of relatives, the wedding photos are waning on FB from all the friends of the bride and groom, tons of food has been eaten in both states, and people are finished with reviewing how - beautiful, cute, funny, energetic, loving, young-looking, young-acting, well-behaved, wonderful - everyone was.Back at the house only one argument hot conversation ensued on a conservative/progressive review of how education is handled by public and private institutions.  It was between a brother and brother-in-law, and they both were actually in agreement on about 90% of the argument, but couldn't see that.  It flared and the fire died and the rest of the visit went without incident.  The bride and groom are landing in Australia as I write this...both for some snorkeling/diving on the Great Barrier Reef...then touring other parts of the country and ending up in Sydney.  They are taking three cameras...so I get to live vicariously in a few weeks.Today I have about 60 loads of laundry to do and hope to get back into an exercise routine...although I no longer have the motivation of fitting into the fancy dress.  Photos?  You are asking  for photos?  I did not take any of myself, but maybe someone will post one or two soon.  Soon, after I have adjusted to the landing, I will write about the glitches and stitches that come with a wedding ceremony with 100's of details."},
{"title": "Where Did I Leave That Guidebook", "date": "Monday, July 01, 2013", "text": "I was sitting watching the movie \"Lost in Translation\" on television this week.  (I had vacuumed and mopped the kitchen floor, washed the cupboards, made cookies, cooked some marinated pork for later easy BBQ...all for the impending company and I needed a movie break.)  I had seen this movie originally at the theater years ago and fell in love with it at that time.  It is so well written and acted and so different from what one expects in a love story.  If you have ever been on a business trip to a foreign country or traveled with your spouse on such a trip or spent time on lay over in a country where you are killing time, this movie so expresses that lost feeling and that time for re-evaluation of where you are in living your life.  I have been to Japan several times for various reasons and all of the scenes in this movie reminded me of those trips in some way.Trying to figure it all out, trying to absorb the culture, trying to understand the culture, trying not to be so homesick, trying not to be so different, and being away from your familiar home as if on another planet and feeling a misfit and re-viewing what you want out of life and what decisions you have made thus far is kind of what what this movie is all about.  The lead man is Bill Murray playing an over-the-hill actor who has adjusted to fame and wealth, but is at that time in his life where he can see the world through the un-rose colored glasses.  He sees people as they are and with casual humor moves through each day with equanimity.  The lead woman is Scarlett Johansson who throws a wrench in that movement.  I do not know if this was her first big movie, but I had never seen her before in anything and her charisma  and charm and earthiness is all over the place.  She plays the young end of the lost generation.  She has followed her famous singer husband to Japan and finds herself spending most of her time waiting for him in a hotel room and trying to find herself.  These actors could not have been better cast.  They both come across as real people who through no fault of their own find themselves living in some exotic artificial emptiness and who are able to find each other in that maze growing toward a solid friendship.  It is far from a traditional love story.Well, perhaps, I have not made this movie sound as interesting as it is.  It is all about values, self-awareness, shallowness, and people who are 'stuck'.  We have all been there and most of us survive that period, and some of us jump off a cliff and find ourselves face down on the concrete.  Guess what?  I think that this is my first movie review!As a follow-up to my post below, it appears my blogroll on my sidebar is now working.  Do not know what the on/off glitch was yesterday.   So the death of Google Reader is not to be mourned."},
{"title": "Technology Tweaking is Tantamount to Torture", "date": "Sunday, June 30, 2013", "text": "Well, I ignored all the news blurbs on Google Reader and the concerns by select bloggers recently, because I try to keep my internet social activities to a minimalist experience when discussing coding.  I have not felt any need to make my blog commercial or to make sure it is discovered by many readers.  In my cases and with my subject matter, that effort usually results in more spam rather than more insightful comments from new readers who do not have the advantage of a depth of experience with me.  Yes, stunning writers capture you at \"Hello,\" but writers such as I have to grow on you a bit.  I get less Zen and more Zeitgeist if I try to be innovative in a technological way. Years ago when I taught HTML to myself just to get through web development at my job, I was glad to be nearing retirement and more able to ignore each new version and change and added acronyms such as XML!  I was the go-to person for many software projects, but it was all a false front because we were the blind leading the blind, and most of us had other things we wanted to accomplish with or without the ever changing technology.So, is this death of Google Reader, which is something I do not really understand, some type of RSS feed that affects the setting on my Blogs I Follow feed that I set up under Google Blogger years ago?  Is this why I can no longer get new blog post feeds from my blog pals and scroll and select as I did in the past sometimes and can get it other times?Yes, I get post updates if I go to the Blogger dashboard behind my blog page and peruse the Reading list that falls below...but I am not sure this includes all the blogs I now follow.  What about those under a different service?I have a wedding to go to and do not have time for this falderal (not a code).  It is like all of the blogs that I follow have fallen behind the iron curtain of coding.  Is this what I deserve for getting this for free for so many years and for naively believing it would continue forever?  I need to be archiving select posts!!"},
{"title": "Compulsions", "date": "Friday, June 28, 2013", "text": "I think we all have them.  Whether we are born with them or they come about because of our lives, we feel compelled to do something a certain way at a certain time.  We react in a certain way to certain people.  Some compulsions are stronger than others.  Some people can control their compulsions...but  if they are accepted by society, some of us find we must do them or explode.My compulsion is cleaning and beautifying.  I can live in a fairly messy, dusty house for months on end, but if company is coming I must get every dust bunny and streak and errant article of clothing out of sight.  If company is coming to stay...and if company is family...then I cannot control my whirling dervish energy dust bunny.  Yes, I can get a little testy during these times, but I think I try to realize that others are not as crazed with such goals as I, and I let them go cower somewhere until I am back to normal.For instance, I took the leaf blower and blew our the garage yesterday.  But that was not enough, because I then attached an ammonia cleanser to the hose and washed down the inside windows, the garage door, the garage floor and the steps to the house.  I straightened all the garage shelves and garden shoe and boot piles and assorted odds and ends by the entry.  Yes, I could have rearranged all the shelves in the garage and not just the most visible and really do it up proud, but I found my finished work acceptable.As my 'fans' know (and the rest will have to catch up) I will be leaving for the wedding soon and bringing relatives back to the empty house after five days away.  This presents a challenge regarding food.  What can I prepare ahead of time and leave in freezer or fridge?  Do I arrange the cut flowers for the bedrooms before I go, or will they all be wilted and petal-dropped when I return.  Thus, do I make a quick cutting trip to the garden while guests unpack on the late afternoon of our return?  Perhaps, since I am an early riser, I can cut and arrange small bouquets the next morning before breakfast?  I have checked the soaps and shampoos and conditioners.I will have laundered every single floor rug that can be washed.  The rest are vacuumed to within an inch of their nap.  Yesterday I hose washed the outside of all the windows and showered away the webs in corners.Today I will select the CDs that are most appropriate for dining and pleasant conversation and have them ready in the player for our return.  I have purchased a case of red and a case of white wine, a little more expensive than the wine I buy for myself.  I need to buy beer, but am at a loss, as I don't drink it.Now I am wondering if I should go through my shoes and straighten those...just kidding.Some of us have compulsions of a more personal nature...like watching that television series at a certain time, arranging the remote and coffee cup just so each morning,  combing their little boys hair in a certain way before he races outdoors, feeding the cat the exact homemade food formula, or insisting on sorting and reading the mail/newspaper first in the household.  Think about it a minute.  What are your compulsions?"},
{"title": "The Devil is Always in the Details", "date": "Tuesday, June 25, 2013", "text": "Regarding my prior post, please note that I am old enough to know that drawing battle lines over this wedding issue helps no one.  Least of all me!  My brother is the sweetest most hardworking and loving guy!  He is a really good looking and tremendous man and his first marriage was a disaster with a woman who cheated on him!.  Seriously, I had better never meet that witch face to face in the future or there will be blood...hers!Therefore, I am frustrated that this second marriage is far less than he deserves.  But I will not point this out to him...or anyone else.  I just had to point it out to you-all.  His wife is not a bad person.  Who knows what her childhood was like with divorced parents? Anyway, got my wedding haircut today and it is a little shorter than I hoped, but she spent 45 minutes and really layered it and it is probably the best haircut I have had in years.  Cost $50...which is more than the $12 I usually pay at the walk-in, but worth it.  Maybe I will post a photo of me at the wedding, if I can get someone else behind the camera lens.  I probably cannot post wedding photos as those are copyrighted.We are driving my son up after work next week three days before the wedding as his car cannot make the trip.  (There is another story in that!)  Since it is a 6 hour drive, we will not be getting in until midnight.My son has said absolutely nothing about the mother/son dance which concerns me a little.  I guess we are going to wing it.  Pray that we look divine as I can dance well only with a strong lead!I have finalized the rehearsal dinner number at 80...but since most guests are coming from out of town, that is not unusually large.  It is a BBQ on a beach catered by a BBQ place selected by my future DIL since this is in a town where her parents live.  When I had first called them months ago, they thought I had said the 3rd of July...not the 4th.  When I called again last week, they said they were closed on the 4th!  Yes, I had a mini-heart attack...but they said they could do it if I was willing to pay holiday overtime.  I threw caution to the wind and said I was...thinking this might add hundreds to the bill.  She said overtime would cost $50.  Don't you just love doing things outside the big city?  I do think Son has picked a '+10' when it comes to his bride-to-be.  We really lucked out on that and I could not be happier for him!  I will next look forward to my grand-children's weddings...and yes, I do expect to be here for that!"},
{"title": "Family!", "date": "Sunday, June 23, 2013", "text": "Family!  I think that the best of us, and the worst of us is brought forward at weddings and funerals.  I love each of my brothers (2) and my sister (1) and my dearly departed sister (1) tremendously.  I like my brother-in-law; I like my sister-in-law; and I tolerate with patience my other sister-in law.  None of us are perfect and we all come from various backgrounds and relationships, and if you love someone you tolerate those they love.  I am lucky in that I do not live too close, and therefore, find it easy to keep my opinions to myself.  When I used to fly out to visit them, I would have to stop by my \"baby\" brother's house, because he could never get away to see me the entire week I was there at my parents farm only 8 miles away.  He would fix me and my husband a lovely dinner and we would visit and enjoy each others' company.  His wife would never be there, though.  She was always off visiting friends or doing something vague which never was clear in my mind.  Years later I learned that her first child had arrived her Senior years in high school and resulted in a quick wedding that did not last.  She never went to college but I really think she never wanted to.  One marriage and two more children later, she married my brother.  That was when I believed her insecurity at being with us college educated types without such divorce histories was her reason for avoiding us.  I went out of my way to make her feel I was not judgmental in any way and made sure that she understood I thought her three children from two prior marriages were shining examples of good people...which they really are!  Yes the first two have illegitimate children and have never married, but they are basically good solid folk.  The last (under my brother's stronger influence) did make it through college without getting pregnant and seems to have a solid relationship with someone and without children at this time.Anyway, the stimulus for this diatribe post is my brother's public comment on FB (not the private messaging venue) that he did not have a suit for my son's upcoming wedding.  I thought he was joking and we commented back and forth over a few days until I finally explained that a shirt and tie would make him more comfortable than those in suits sitting in the late afternoon summer sun...the wedding is outside and a suit was not compulsory.  Now this week, just 12 days before the wedding he PUBLICLY comments on FB that there is a 'snag' in their plans to fly out for the wedding and the later drive to my house.  The dog sitter they had arranged for could not come and they hope to find one that \"they approve of\" before they have to leave!  He has never come out to see me in all the years I have lived on the East Coast except for my daughter's wedding ten years ago.  Although I have been to visit him at least three times since then.  I do love him, but think this is all someone else's insecurities coming forward.  I think someone does not want to spend time with all the in-laws and is hoping she will not have to.  Unfortunately, even her first born son had said to me years ago that she is a very selfish and self-centered person.  Do I sound just a little annoyed?  Well, I am.  This  is not a big deal to anyone, but me, of course.  OK, got it off my chest, now I can enjoy this wedding."},
{"title": "Taking It One Step Further", "date": "Tuesday, June 18, 2013", "text": "A few days ago Grannie Annie had posted a question on her blog asking her readers to name the historic figure they would most like to meet if they had such powers or opportunity.  It could be a celebrity or a dead historic person...whatever.  I said that I wanted to meet my great grandchildren and my great, great grandchildren in the future and not go to the past.  Why?  Because I have an ego that would like to know if any of my loves, beliefs, etc. filtered through the generations. Did I have the right perspective?   I would also be curious as to where they were in the grand scheme of things.  How they made a living, what they loved, what they fought for and how the world was treating their generation.  Did they still have the freedoms we fight for today?  Were they able to live their lives as they wished?  Did I recognize anything in their personalities that touched a chord?One of Grannie Annie's readers/responders (who is in the music industry) posted that they had met celebrities and found that they were just regular people.  I think that is true with most of the famous folks.  They are not super smart, super strong, super beautiful...they were just in the right place at the right time and made the right decision or history rewrote their story and it seems to us that they made the right decisions.  Or they were given a great talent and they were smart enough to nurture it.  (Then, of course, I would pay money NOT to have to meet some of these celebrity idiots today...like that woman who just had a baby and is married to a controversial rock star and whose accomplishments consist of pouting and sticking out her (plastic?) chest.)About 20 years ago I was watching a street festival in the Bahamas as part of a happy crowd. I glanced up at the over 6 foot thin black man standing next to me.  I recognized him but could not for the life of me place him.  After a time, I realized it was the man my children had watched on the TV show, The Electric Company.  It was Morgan Freeman, whose fame is far greater than that educational program...although he still works on education with a TV space science program today.  He even attended an international conference of physicists recently as a guest.  I was both too intimidated and too polite at that time to interrupt his Caribbean vacation and act like a fan, and therefore, I let him be.  I glanced at him now and again, and could have touched him we were so close, but we both had our privacy because it was dark at night.  I do sort of regret that, but I am sure he does not!We have all had these mental exercises of whose brain we would like to pick.  One fun exercise I read (or heard about) a few years ago was a dinner party guest list.  If you could invite 5 interesting people to eat dinner with you...who would you invite?  I would most certainly include Morgan Freeman because he is such an eclectic and good person.  Also at that time I  read about this exercise I was younger and enjoying and thinking of inviting the humor columnist, Erma Bombeck,...an early woman's liberationist's advocate who used a laugh instead of a bat to make her point. She could keep us laughing right into dessert.  Two down and three to go...whom would you invite?  And perhaps a neat additional question...what on earth would you serve?"},

Tuesday:  2 hours working with my volunteer gardeners at the museum, three loads of laundry done, transplanting plants into pots at home, cooking dinner.Wednesday:  1.25 hours running, lifting weights and stretching, cleaning the big closet, dusting upstairs bedrooms in the corners and cornices and under furniture, weeding flower beds, washing off deck, watering plants on deck, cooking dinner.Thursday:  Meeting on the children's garden at the art museum, grocery shopping, cleaned carpets in basement, cleaned sectional sofa and the loveseat and one rug on main floor (with hubby's help), returned carpet machine and did a little shopping at the small mall and ate out at the Thai restaurant.  Insomnia woke me at 2:00 P.M. so finished reading \"Me Again\"on my Kindle.Friday:  Put all furniture back in place on slightly damp carpet, washed down the elliptical and dusted other stuff, one hour heavy exercise, brief update on blogger, called Toyota dealer for appointment, sorted the dozens of magazines piled on and beneath the huge coffee table in the main room, cleaned out the laundry room cupboard under the sink and threw away a bunch of stuff, folded one load of laundry, checked off stuff on my list and added stuff to my list, took a nap, washed out and re-arranged the coffee cupboard in the kitchen, and cooked dinner (popcorn).  (It poured rain all day so this was easy!)  Doesn't it all look so shiny clean down there?Saturday: Washed upstairs bedroom windows (6) and screens and dusted the trim.  Changed the sheets in one bedroom.  Fixed (after 20 minutes of work) a stupid casement window that would not close--the left one in the photo below!  That is the area where we keep the kids books and toys.  (I hate Eagle windows.)  Cleaned the upstairs bathroom and put out new shampoos and soaps.  Selected two photographs and hung them in the upstairs guest bathroom (talk about tooting my own horn!) but they matched the orange accents in that room and believe it or not, I just eyeballed the placement.  Vacuumed and mopped the tiled areas of the basement outside the carpet and rug areas (in photo above), mopped the landing and stairs, cleaned up hubby's grow light area, cleaned basement bathroom and shower (and discovered the shower sprays everywhere when you open the door to use it so got a quick shower!!).Grow light unit.Sunday: I will clean the guest bedroom downstairs, wash the two basement windows and the one set of french doors in the basement, dead-head roses and sundry other dead-heading after the two days of rain. There is one hour of regular exercise that I have promised myself to complete.   Last week I painted these...they used to be white!  My goodness what a slump I will be in when I finish all on the list!  I realize I have to quit beating myself up on not getting organized for this...cause I guess I am moving it forward regardless once I started listing all that I do get done."},

{"title": "The Burial", "date": "Friday, May 31, 2013", "text": "Such a hot day to revisit the old barn.  The door is loose and swings open almost by itself when I release the metal latch.  The bright sunlight outside blinds me to the dark blankness inside.  It feels cooler and I relax in the shelter from the hot air.  Eventually my eyes adjust to the faint contrast of slices of sunlight as they filter through cracks and holes catching dancing dust fairies which hang above the earthen floor in stasis.  Their glimmer is the only movement in the quiet stillness all around me.  There are two empty but familiar stalls staring at each other on the far end of the building.  An old bit of rope hangs from one wooden support post.It is so stale inside as if nothing alive has been here for hundreds of years.  This is odd because there is only weathered wood between the bird and insect noisy traffic outside.  There must be mice and dark beetles at home in small corners and behind the wooden boxes stacked to one wall.  I tilt my head to one side and listen, carefully and with slow intent.  Such a peaceful quiet is foreign to my city ears and I hear just a soft creak as the big door moves when caught by the small summer breeze.It is not how I remember it at all.  This was once a busy place with milking cows, an old tractor with its insides open and undergoing constant repair, swallows leaving their mud bowl nests under the trusses to dive bomb the dogs beneath them, and above it all, unseen, was a loft of sweet smelling hay.  There was always movement and sounds and animals grunting.  I cross the uneven earth and test the first step of the wooden ladder to the loft.  It holds very firm as does the rest of the ladder as I climb it slowly to the very top avoiding splinters from the edges of the wood.  I pull my knee over the edge at the last step and scoot up onto the floor.  There is no hay, just dust and pieces of wood.  The large door to the hayloft is gone and light floods the area making it easy to see that some animal, probably a vulture or barn owl, had recently made its home here.  It smells faintly of must and poultry.I sit with crossed legs at the edge of the loft door, the hot sun on my arms, my eyes in the shade and look across the land.  It is fallow and growing mowed weeds these days.  Colored wildflowers fight for attention in the center.  It still looks familiar.That crazy summer floods back in my memory.  I had learned that I was a woman by the way the young boy we had hired for the summer watched me out of the corner of his eye.  It was an uncommon electric feeling that fed my soul and changed everything I did each day.  It changed how I wore my hair, how I walked, and how I modulated my voice.  We got to know each other over the weeks in between heavy-duty chores and lost our self-conscious pretenses.  We shared lemonade, jokes, and a swim in the river down by the cherry trees.  We loaded bales of hay onto the wagon and laughed as we grew sweaty and tired by sunset barely able to walk back along the dirt road to the house.  By August, we held hands and kissed and he smelled of raw corn or green grass and soap.Then we almost made love one afternoon in this loft.  He was the one who pulled away at the last minute as he felt my body give in and my arms welcome him close.  He was the smarter one, and I was the thoughtless romantic.  He had three years on me and plans for another three years.  I was still into romance novels and gossip and another boring year of high school.It is tempting to think what might have evolved if we had made love.  I am old enough now to know what a tragedy that might have been back then.  That foolish romantic in me is long gone.  I never heard from him or about him after that summer.  It was as if he was a character in those romance novels I read and had faded into a fictional fog with the end of the summer.  It was as if he did not really exist except in my imagination.  It was as if he was a canceled summer series on television.  It was as if that girl did not exist either, because I was someone else now.  I had responsibilities, I was sophisticated, I was working on a plan.  I had buried that silly child somewhere far away like a faded valentine or pressed corsage that doesn't look quite as wonderful as it did on the day it was given.  Today I was a foreigner in a foreign land.(Bits and pieces are true, of course, but the story is fiction.)"},
{"title": "Are We Having Fun Yet?", "date": "Wednesday, May 29, 2013", "text": "Yes, it does break the rule of thirds!While we enjoyed our son and fiance's visit over the holiday weekend the recent holiday Monday itself we spent canoeing.  We have been so busy with volunteer and social obligations that we have not taken the time to get the canoe out on the water before the mosquitoes and warm weather make it more of a trek rather than a trip.  We took the smaller canoe and that meant loading less paraphernalia.  The canoe itself gets balanced on hubby's upper back and transferred to the top of the car where he climbs up and ties it off in 4 places.  The landing was only 20 minutes away.  Still at our age we feel blessed to be able to do this.I am 66 and proudly taking no medications.  I am beginning to feel arthritis creep in after I exercise or do yard work and my getting up in the morning would give you a laugh as I hobble to the bathroom.  Once the joints are warm and greased I can do almost anything including touch my toes with no pain.  I do get a bursitis in my left shoulder if I exercise too much and that can last all week.  As I age I have noticed a nasty cough that catches me by surprise if I am not keeping up on my fluids and my less than stellar eyesight is most annoying as I love photography.  My desire to lose weight continues and I run on the elliptical about 6-9 miles a week, lift heavy (10 pound) weights and do stretching.  I do some yoga, but must be careful as I can push it too much and then regret the joint and tendon pain for days.   Still, I think I am very lucky for my good health at this time in my life.Hubby has always been very healthy as well, except for problems that started years ago.  He was diagnosed with prostate cancer and while some men are doing the watch and wait, he had the radiation seed treatment and by the year's end he was pretty much back to normal except for check-ups through these past years.  That was 6 years ago and his appointment last week was his last as they now have declared him cancer free.About 10 years ago hubby also started having problems walking and seemed to be stumbling often.  He is a reasonably athletic person and was able to recover without falling to the ground most times, although it did make for some interesting acrobatic moves on his part.  I thought he was just being careless as he talks a lot when he walks.  Then he got intermittent numbness in his hands and the eventual diagnosis was stenosis of the spine.  This meant the canal that carried his spinal cord was narrowing in places causing the nerves to be pinched.  If it was left untreated and got worse he could be paralyzed down from wherever the stenosis begins.  In his case it was his neck!  He went in for spinal surgery and had the back part of four vertebrae removed...yes removed...so that now his spinal cord rests in the open channel and is covered by muscle only.  I exaggerate not at all when I say he was out of the hospital the day after surgery and home and walking with a neck brace in the suburban neighborhood where we lived within days.  Within weeks he was back at work part time.  He was determined that this would not set him back one inch.By the end of the year we were hiking, canoeing, bike riding and continuing our fairly active lifestyle once again.  Unfortunately, now years later. the stenosis has returned as it sometimes does.  His neck is too stiff to turn too far to either side when driving,  it hurts if he hits a bump while riding the bike, and he is being careful many times by wearing a neck brace.  He does the assigned exercises.  The doctor has recommended painkillers and Valium as a muscle relaxant and are taking a wait and see approach. Hubby is being brave, but having a science background, he tends to be more analytical and also understands anatomy very well.  I put off the images that you know flit across my mind on occasion, and try to make him be more careful as we age together.  None of us knows what the future will hold, and we only hope that we hang on until the very last laugh or scoff depending on our mood.Old age is not for the weak of heart or spine, it seems."},

{"title": "Dinner with Wine and Water", "date": "Friday, May 24, 2013", "text": "While continuing to explore the issues of water in this country I was very disappointed to learn that this liberal environmental state that I live in has the worst water pollution in the country! Thirty-three percent of our sources have some pollution.  I guess I am going to have to start some letter writing on that.  Years ago when rivers outside of Cleveland would catch on fire due to pollution we had no regulations on what and how much disgusting byproduct that could be dumped into them.  They were gigantic toilets that became someone's problem downstream...we naively thought.  Under Richard Nixon's administration, Congress passed the Clean Water Act which  began the slow uphill climb to make industry and agriculture take notice of how they were treating our waters.  Then as the years passed we learned that we as individuals also bore the guilt of this and had to change our lifestyle.When you are focused on an issue it creeps into your conversations with others.  Hubby had done some connection recently across space and time and this connection resulted in a last minute dinner guest the other day, which throws this anal retentive into a bit of a tizzy.  I was busy reading up on my state's water plans instead of cleaning house.Anyway, as usually happens it all worked out very well in the end.  The elderly gentlemen brought both white and red wine!  We had fried oysters from the dock, bruschetta on French bread and roasted summer vegetables with herbs.  I made an easy strawberry cream cheese pie with fresh strawberries from the garden for dessert. We drank lots of water and wine.Our guest was a business man whose main focus in life was using some scientific biochemical technology he developed to help people in both our country and through-out the world to filter things on surfaces and through substances, including water!  He might be an idealist without a chance in hell or he might be a man with a viable mission in life, I really could not tell.  He seemed very nice, straightforward and honorable...a deacon in not one but two churches!He had recently returned from Poland where he was working but also assisting with a high school science fair outside the city of Krakow.  He had been assigned several children who were working on a water filtering project.  They were trying to filter radioisotopes from drinking water.  When he asked why they had selected this project, they explained that their drinking water was making their people sick from the radioactive particles in it!  He was shocked and also greatly saddened to see these young scientists working on such a tragic problem.   Then as a scientist he had to explain that filtering the drinking water was one small step as they were showering their bodies in this same water and it would be absorbed through the skin as well.  This was not Japan after a tragic earthquake, but Poland where the former footprint of the USSR is still ugly and the black market is more than healthy.  In Japan they are monitoring the radioactivity from the earthquake, but in Poland it is from the lack of regulation from their old power plants.As a liberal voter I am big on environmental regulation, and I know that means a greater cost in whatever I buy to offset the greater burden to the business owner, but at least it is a transparent choice and I accept, that with our growing population, it will become a more expensive way forward.  We may own less fancy technology and less of it, but our eyes will be open, our lungs will be clear and our organs will be healthy and our children will thank us."},
{"title": "Dinosaur Pee", "date": "Monday, May 20, 2013", "text": "Do you know where your drinking water comes from?  Many people think that it comes from the kitchen sink faucet or the refrigerator filter nozzle.  When I lived north in this state, my drinking water came from the Potomac river.  It was pumped to a filtration plant where they added things like chlorine (a chemical poison) to kill any nasties that might be growing in it before it reached my stomach.  It tasted OK and it smelled OK and we survived.  We did have to let the chlorine out-gas before we added it to our Koi pond, though.Many of the nearby well populated communities in the area pulled their water from underground.  They went down just deep enough to get to the first water table, as that is the cheapest when you are pumping for a city.  This water was less than 100 years old.  It was water was made from filtered rain, but went through some pretty disgusting soil before it was collected and then treated by the water plant.  It could have come from some grandpa's toilet!Today my water comes from an aquifer about 400 feet beneath my land.  A geologist told me the other day that my water is very old and goes back to dinosaur times!  It has sat in that underground lake for many thousands of years.  It probably was created from rain washing over dinosaur poop and pee before we were a twinkle in evolution's eye!  It is very safe to drink, and if you do not mind the hydrogen smell that occurs when we get lazy and do not treat the pipes, it is water that can be added directly to fish ponds or drinking glasses.  I find this mind-boggling.  According to the USGS \"Ground water may flow through an aquifer at a rate of 50 feet per year or 50 inches per century, depending on the permeability of the soil above it. But no matter how fast or slow, water will eventually discharge or leave an aquifer and must be replaced by new water to replenish or recharge the aquifer.  Thus, every aquifer has a recharge zone or zones and a discharge zone or zones.\"  These aquifers vary.  \"Rocks that yield freshwater have been found at depths of more than 6,000 feet, and salty water has come from oil wells at depths of more than 30,000 feet.Water is a finite resource.  We have become addicted to corn for food, food additives and energy, a crop that sucks up water like a sponge and we plant it across the land.  The drought across the U.S. has left water tables in Texas and Kansas and Colorado almost empty now.  Farmers go deeper and suck up sandy water and ruin their pumps in their desperation to grow a crop.  Yes, they are switching to milo and other crops that require less water, but it may not give us enough time to replenish that underground water source.  Refilling that large aquifer would require hundreds if not thousands of years of rains.  There has been a 30 foot decline in the water level.We are now moving into the Anthropocene epoch, a term coined by scientists because we are changing the climate and resources of our planet so rapidly.  An International Geosphere-Biosphere Program paper says, “On average, humanity has built one large dam every day for the last 130 years.” It adds, “Tens of thousands of large dams now distort natural river flows to which ecosystems and aquatic life adapted over thousands of years.\"  We are sinking river deltas and removing wetlands which are natural barriers to inland flooding and you can see this on the news everyday.  People in North Dakota are now fighting over water resources (even though they are still in abundance) to continue expanding their fracking industry which makes them one of the primary energy states in the nation.  Let us hope they run out of gas before they tap into the Great Lakes.Some even blame some of the tragedy in Syria to the lack of water management.  Their dictator (he who shall not be named) took land and gave it to his friends and they farmed it so vastly and carelessly that they ran the small farmers off their land because they could no longer get water from the ground.  Then drought ravaged 60% of the land even more moving 800,000 farmers and herders into poverty.Water is precious and we must protect and use it wisely.  Writing this has made me thirsty.  I am going to go drink some dinosaur pee."},
{"title": "Let Us Get Our Feet Wet", "date": "Friday, May 17, 2013", "text": "I live near the Chesapeake Bay on a river that feeds into it.  Five major rivers flow into this bay and numerous tributaries also dump water into this largest estuary in the United States.  Two theories hold strong for the formation of this bay.  One an asteroid collision or two a giant glacier.  If you are a numbers person, the Chesapeake Bay is 200 miles long. fed by 48 major rivers, and fills from 100 tributaries that drain across a 64,000-square-mile watershed.  These are rivers that run by highways, cities (including the Nation's Capital), subdivisions, and farms.  These are rivers that collect lawn fertilizer, farm pesticides, and runoff from highway oils on their rush to the sea.  The fertilizers from farms are one of the worst pollutants creating huge algae blooms and eventual die-offs falling to the bay bottom and resulting in dead zones where oxygen does not exist.  And the average depth of the bay is 21 feet..not very deep at all.  In fairness to farmers, they have reduced their use of fertilizers over the years through better practices.Cow poop and pee plus packing of the shoreline...not so good for the river.Two thousand seven hundred plant and animal species attempt to live in and near the Bay.  At one time there were so many oysters in this Bay that the water was completely filtered, ALL OF IT, in a week!  One Algonquin Indian translation of the word Chesapeake is \"great shellfish bay.\"  That was when you could wade into the water and see your feet---I am guessing if you did not cut your foot on the many oysters shells.  \"Such huge numbers of shellfish had a major impact on the environment.  Oysters are filter feeders, which means that they remove nutrients from the water as they siphon it through their gill system.  This filtering process removes the phytoplankton and other small organisms that grow in the water.  In essence, each oyster is a small, water-treatment plant that cleans the water passing through it as it feeds.  The cumulative effect of millions and millions of oysters feeding each day was to keep the waters of the Chesapeake clear and pristine.  Biologists have estimated that when the English settlers reached Virginia and Maryland in the 1600s, oysters were filtering the entire Chesapeake Bay once a week.  The result was waters of remarkable clarity, even down to depths of twenty feet or more.\"  Those days are past as we have less than 2% of the number of oysters growing in the Bay.  They have died off due to disease from pollution stress and also disappeared from over-harvesting.  Work is ongoing to restore oysters to the Bay... a slow, but perhaps ultimately successful process if we get a handle on the pollution and get better cooperation from the oyster fishermen which is a different species than the oyster farmer.We have a former state senator, Bernie Fowler, who was an avid fisherman as a young man, and noticed the declining clarity of the water on the Patuxent River when he would wade in each spring just north of where I live and try to see his feet.  In 1988 this 'wade-in\" became an annual tradition to remind people of the declining clarity of our waters and also gave energy to a movement where then Senator Fowler sued the Environmental Protection Agency for its lack of enforcement of pollution laws.  The Bay is no where near healthy, but at least has stabilized in its decline and Senator Fowler has brought it to the public attention.  He is now 89, but still does his wade-in.Pinkney Island, South Carolina, protected shorelineSince we live in the 'critical area' I only fertilize my flowers and perennials with a slow release food and I am super conservative with pesticides and fungicides.  I am removing those plants that require too much spray to survive.  We still keep a few fruit trees that are demanding.  We no longer fertilize or herbicide our lawn so it can look like a golf course.  It does look like mowed weeds and we have allowed more clover to take over.  The clover is good for the soil and rabbits like clover to eat instead of my flowers.  If you live in a first world nation and fertilize your lawn, allow run-off from your roof, are not careful when you fill your lawn mower with gas or any endless number of things that hurt our water quality...remember that like fossil fuels clean water is also is a finite resource.  (My next post is on drinking dinosaur pee...really)"},
{"title": "The Treatment", "date": "Wednesday, May 15, 2013", "text": "I had absolutely no idea what to expect upon getting a facial.  I did know that I would have to remove my glasses and earrings, but when the young lady took me to the dressing room and told me to take everything off down to the waist and wrap a towel under my arms when I emerged, I realized this was going to be a much more intimate experience than I had anticipated.   My purse and watch and jewelry went into a locker with the key on a cord given to me to wear around my wrist. When I entered the room for the facial the key was placed in my bathrobe pocket as I took it off and hung it on the door.The woman, maybe in her early 40's,  who gave me the facial was from Hungary originally (thus the European Facial ?).  We started out with a nice warm chat about paprika and getting fresh spices and other things as I nervously drove the conversation.  Eventually she got me to shut up and she had me lie down on a soft white hospital type bed.  I had neglected to put on the plastic slippers when I changed clothes so had to remove my shoes as she carefully tucked me under a warm sheet and wrapped my feet snugly. My  hair line was wrapped with cotton and my whole head wrapped in a nice fragrant towel.  The first treatment was  a minty soap wash on my face, neck, shoulders, arms and hands!  Next was a body scrub of some type which was rubbed in and then rinsed away.  Then (since I had my eyes covered for most of this) I think they put on some kind of oatmeal mask for the face and neck and I sat under a warm steamy wand while she massaged and creamed my arms and hands before placing them in warm mittens.  She was mixing stuff behind me as I sat under this fragrant steam bath for about 10 minutes with my hands so cozy. Then every thing was washed away once again and she applied a cold cream.  I mean a COLD cream.  I guess that is where the term comes from, because this felt like it came out of the refrigerator! Then came a 10 minute massage of my face with this cream.  It was really wonderful!  Firm in the beginning and ending with such a gentle touch I could not really tell when she had stopped!  I was allowed to rest for a few minutes before she once again removed all the stuff from my face with various cloths and tissues.The next step was a little startling.  She covered my eyes in some fragrant damp tissue and then brought a bright light over my face and I began to feel little stings.  I realized after a time that she was squeezing my black/white heads with some tool and cleaning all of my pores.  It was not the most pleasant experience, but I have a high pain threshold, so sat back and endured and felt just a little embarrassed...I mean, how much money would they have to pay you to squeeze someones pimples?Then there was one last wash with something else with a more flowery fragrance and a gentle pat dry and I was done!  I did not get a chance during that day or the next day to look closely at my skin, but I did feel really clean and refreshed and I would do it again if I was not so cheap!My daughter had finished just a minute or two before me, so we were completely in sync to head out for the rest of our day."},

(Is this bitch ever happy?)I was discussing the difficulty of weight loss with my daughter and she said she was sure if I just gave up bread I would lose weight.  In the spirit of self-defeat I am going to try that for as long as I can just to prove her wrong.Over a week later my bouquet of mixed cut flowers from hubby is still in beautiful condition.  It has taken 42 years of marriage...but he finally gets me flowers from the florist rather than the grocery store.I really do like being alone and if I was not afraid that it was a possible mental defect, I would rarely leave the house.  I will be really all alone this coming week, and I am a little sad about it.  Am I never satisfied?Since I have a cable DVR I rarely channel surf in the evenings.  It all waits for me just exactly as I have arranged it on my elitist list.  Thus I was both shocked and surprised to see that I had recorded some program that set a contest of people trying to get wheels of cheddar down a hill on a sled.  Boring.As a follow-up to the above, it depresses me to no end that people who watch the most popular shows on TV may also vote. After returning from Mexico and drinking their coffee, I cannot seem to find a brand that satisfies me anymore.I am still boggled and trying to understand the message that only 10% of the cells in our body are human cells.  I guess the message is that we are more connected to nature than I had hoped.A distant but long time friend died last week of a rare but nasty brain disease similar to Alzheimer's and left behind a sweet and smart wife.  I cannot stop running the scenario through my head on what I would do if this had happened to me.Next week I am taking my daughter to a spa for her birthday as her choice.  I never go to spas and will be getting a facial for the first time in my life.  I got my first pedicure in my late 40's.  It all seems so decadent to this former farm girl.I am thinking I should not do these Thursday 13's unless I really make an effort to structure them around a theme!  So lazy."},
{"title": "Grave New World", "date": "Tuesday, April 30, 2013", "text": "I remember, I must admit vaguely, my feelings when reading Brave New World by Aldous Huxley  years ago.  I remember it was depressing and intriguing.  I actually do not remember the specifics of the novel other than the frightening cultural and technological challenges it portrayed.  Now I have decided to re-read it along with the two additional ones that followed the first to see if I still feel the same way.  I am thinking it will have certain relevance to today's challenges. Innovation and change, both cultural and technological, are inevitable waves that rock our ship of fate.  We cannot stop inventing new things that make life better and easier.  How great the invention of computers/internet that opened the world to us from our desktop.  We can read articles and watch videos and communicate from all types of places.  But with this new access comes dross that wastes precious time (cats playing the piano), inaccurate facts (talking heads with statistics that are selective), lies (propaganda from companies with nasty objectives), bad habits (simple answers to complex questions) and things we do not want innocent minds of children to see until they have fully formed.  For the more conservative, the outside world is a direct threat to their beliefs and lifestyle.  I remember arguing with an Iranian boy I dated back in college over our Western culture having too much influence on his people.  His primary complaint was that Iranians were now eating at tables instead of on the ground on carpets that way they had traditionally done.  His view:  this was due to bad Western influence.  I cannot imagine how apoplectic such conservative groups are today when faced with the Internet.  Change and exposure to something challenging over which they have no control is terrifying to them.I am in the middle of reading Smithsonian's May magazine issue with the theme \"The Future is Here.\"  Smithsonian is one of the best lay magazines published today.  I usually end up reading it cover to cover and have subscribed for years. One article discusses the life of American-Egyptian journalist-activist Mona Eltahawy, who risks life and limb literally, to take on the mission of democratizing Egypt.  In case you do not follow current events, Egypt's dictatorship which was crushed in the \"Arab spring\"  was replaced in an election by the leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood. \"In other words, meet the new boss, same as the old boss, only worse because you helped get the new boss his job.\"  The future for Egypt is now very tenuous except for brave activists such as Mona and brave comedians such as Bassem Youssef (the middle eastern version of Jon Stewart).   But revolution, itself, has taken on a new form and new tools.Another article in the Smithsonian discusses the tremendous breakthroughs being made with microbial science.  Infants that died within weeks due to a deficiency of unidentified bacteria in their guts may soon be saved, not by some fancy new bacteria or identity of a single pathogen, but by a better understanding of the dance between all of the microbial community in our body.  Our body has ten trillion of our own cells, but also plays host to another 100 trillion cells .  We are only 10% human by cell count.  Researches are finding that along with the pro on antibiotics there are some serious cons when antibiotics kill off bacteria in the very young.  \"Infants exposed to antibiotics in the first six months of life are 22 percent more likely to be overweight as toddlers than unexposed infants.\"  \"A lack of normal gut microbes early in  life disturbs the central nervous system...and may permanently alter serotonin levels in the adult brain.\"  \"Just giving enough food to starving children may not permanently fix their malnutrition unless they also have the 'right' digestive micro-organisms...\"  I cannot leave this paragraph without mentioning about one treatment for ulcers where a combination of healthy excrement from one person is injected into the sick person.  Seriously!  With each pro there is a con.Finally, there is an article on the amazing technology of 3-D printers which not only print plastic toys and odd stuff, but also can print parts to cars and appliances which may render huge warehouses with shelves of various parts obsolete.  You may be able to hang on to that oven for a longer time, because the replacement part can be made far into the future.  This technology is also printing body part structures and adding cell growth media so that soon we may be able to print organs the way we print cat photos and no one has to wait for organ replacement!  Your daughter may be able to design and order custom shoes for the prom that no one else has.  You may be able to replace precious broken China in a very reasonable time.  BUT as a con, any idiot may soon be able to print his own gun and any revolutionary may be able to create a weapon of mass destruction on his kitchen counter much more easily,It is a grave new world and while at this time in my life I find such challenges a bit overwhelming, I also admit that I am going to miss not seeing it in the decades ahead."},
{"title": "No Sweat", "date": "Saturday, April 27, 2013", "text": "For those who follow my blog (all others will just have to catch up), I did go out and buy an 'off-the-rack' dress for the wedding.  I spent more than I wanted to but did not splurge outrageously although one woman's splurge is another man's golf allowance for the week.  I actually had little choice in style or cost, because after hitting 4 major department stores and two expensive dress boutiques, I found only two dresses in the right size, in a decent color and with a style that wouldn't leave them laughing.  That whole experience I will save for another post when it is far enough in the back of my memory and I can try to make it sound funny rather than pitiful.  Anyway, I got a dress that I liked if not loved.  I left it for alterations, so no photo.But, this post is not really about the dress.  It is about my health.  I have had a 'small' (small meaning I am about 5 pounds from being declared overweight) weight problem since I was in my late 40's and it has gotten larger...to overdo a pun.  I exercise sporadically, I try to watch what I eat, but I never seem to make the scale number or dress size budge.  (The few men who read this blog are now clicking elsewhere.)I have never joined a weight group as they are too inconvenient for me.  I do not buy those weight meals because I understand portion control and nutrition very well, thank you.   I eat a reasonably balanced diet and avoid desserts most times. (While I do not give up wine or chocolate I control them tightly.)  But I decided to begin tracking what I am eating and doing so that I can make sure I am not kidding myself.  I logged onto WebMD which has charts that track your fitness burns along with your food consumption.  It is not super easy to use, but reasonable enough for someone who wants a basic outline on what they are doing to reach a goal and it is free.I set my goal as the loss of one pound a week.  That is not a crazy goal and it was something I was sure that I could achieve.  WebMD suggested a daily consumption of 1,381 calories to achieve this goal for my age and weight.  That is not much in calorie intake, but if you exercise or do other physical activity that will compensate for more food that you eat and WebMD follows that.  Below is my second week's charts...food and physical fitness with caloric tracking in the first chart and fitness in the second.  I cannot access the first week (I guess because this is free), but it was almost identical to this week's work.  Please note that only one day did I go over my daily goal in caloric consumption---I ate a piece of lemon cream pie at a meeting.  My fitness activities include elliptical, free weights, yoga, walking, heavy gardening, etc.  I do these fairly vigorously, for instance, on the elliptical I will run 3.20 miles in about 35 minutes and I do this three times a week.  My hand weights are 10 pounds each. That is not bad for a woman past her mid-60s.  I am keeping well below my goals when I combined the physical activity with my food consumption.  Wednesday I folded laundry but was sitting that afternoon so did not include it.For the past two weeks since I began this detailed look at my lifestyle,  I have been afraid to weigh myself but became brave yesterday because I have been really good according to these charts!  Guess what?  I GAINED two pounds!  Do NOT appease me by telling me this is just muscle.  I am really discouraged for now, but not giving up.  I will work hard for another month, and then see how I feel and weigh.  (What is even more discouraging  is hubby goes off his feed for a few days and immediately loses 5 pounds!)  Yeah, I know this story is an oldie...but it is mine for now and I am sticking to it."},

I have also had time to ponder the blogs that I read instead of hurrying through them in order to be sure I do not miss anything.  As a result, I have noticed that some of \"my\" bloggers are a little low in spirit.  Some come right out and write about it, while others are more enigmatic about some struggle they or a loved one is having.  Deaths in the family, job losses, fights with relatives on Facebook, and serious health problems are all written about or maybe hinted at depending on whether the writer is bold or shy.  This is where Blogger falls short in a way.  We can get something off our chest and feel a sense of relief, but does it help when we return to the real world?  We can take some good advice from the wisdom of individuals in the general blogdom, but does that truly help?  For some of us perhaps, but I really wish I could look the writer in the eye and put my arm on their shoulder and bring them something sweet and decadent and just sit until the conversation could flow.  I would not have any fancy answers or successful suggestions, but I would have real concern to convey and a love of man(woman)kind to share and let them know how important they are in the grand scheme of things. We all are in this rocky boat, and some get more seasick than others, and that is when it really is hard to hang on tightly.  If you are one of those please note that I have a sincere and loving look on my face right now and I am reaching out to place my hand on yours until the seas calm, even if they do so only ever-so-briefly."},
{"title": "Awkward!", "date": "Sunday, April 21, 2013", "text": "Years ago, during the time that both my husband and I were working full time, we kept our community oriented  activities linked with our children's activities.  Whenever we participated in a bake sale or white elephant money raising activity it was usually tied to the soccer team or brownie scouts or some school event or for early years the church.  We operated within a small circle of parents and therefore knew almost everyone at the event.Now we are no longer working full time and are able to devote more time to slowly becoming involved in this new (to us) small community through various volunteer activities and events.  We are slowly beginning to feel that we are no longer the newcomers.Yesterday we spent seven hours on our feet promoting a children's community garden by getting children to plant a lettuce or broccoli plant in our demo garden as they attended a Green Earth Day exposition.  If this garden is not destroyed by a freak storm, eaten to the ground by Bambi, or some other unpredictable event, we hope to be able to harvest food throughout the season for a nearby food pantry.  Summer camp students will also be linked to the garden during their week at the art garden and learn and help.  As you can see above, the spring break school children have already decorated the stunning white oak that we obtained to make the boxes.Many of the children were eager to plant their vegetable which we allowed them to mark with a 'name tag.'   They were encouraged to come by and visit their plant throughout the month.  Some of these families are military families and not able to garden as they would like, so we are hoping we gave them some ideas and allowed their children some fun.Over 90 children helped us plant these vegetable beds.  At the end of the day, after we had planted the few plants that were left, loaded the remaining flats of lettuce into the car and checked to make sure all our hand tools were loaded, a well dressed handsome 60-year-old with a mustache stopped by the beds.   He greeted us by our name and praised our garden work.  Hubby greeted him back and the talk flowed back and forth for some time on gardening and the seasons and eventually descriptions of the pros and cons in each of our yards.When he left I turned to Hubby and asked:  \"Who was that?\"Hubby responded,  \"I don't know!\"\"Well, he knows us!\"  I said, \"I thought he might be that guy at the scientists club that had asked you to speak.\"Hubby replied, \"Yeah, so did I, but when he said he lived down by the point, I knew it wasn't that fellow because that guy lives near the cliffs.\"I must admit that I am much more used to people NOT knowing who I am.  I hope that this is not going to happen habitually, yet something very similar happened at a talk we went to just a few nights ago.  The couple who sat behind us and recognized us had to introduce themselves in context (two months ago an evening dinner at a mutual friend's house) and then the light bulb went on over my head.  I hate being that type of person...old and doddery!  I have become the cliche which I cringed at seeing in others."},

The mornings were still cold and Myong Ok pulled her coat close to her neck.  When she asked her mother when they would be coming back home, her mother looked for an answer in her shoes and then shook her head to indicate she did not know.  The little girl had left her home like this years ago when North Korea made threats, but she had been younger at that time and did not remember it well.  Her scarf was whipped by the early cold spring wind across her face and she stumbled on a crack in the road as she reached for the door to the car.Today was Elizabeth's eighteenth birthday.  Her stepfather was stringing balloons across the front porch for her party that afternoon when he shouted something that made Elizabeth turn.  She ran to the door and her eyes followed his to black shiny river that was coming down the street toward their yard.  She could smell something like old rubber tires and it burned the back of her throat.  While she watched the black river cover her sidewalk she heard her father calling 911 and trying to describe the scene of rushing oil.  By mid-afternoon they were packing their suitcases as were all of their neighbors, calling relatives and friends to cancel the party and moving to a Holiday Inn near the Mayflower Quik Mart.  Dinner was sandwiches and soda from the Quick Mart and dessert was her birthday cake which they had packed for the trip.  It was shared by relatives and friends that had come to commiserate.  Elizabeth asked when they would be heading back home and her father shrugged his shoulders in dismay.Walking slowly and carefully with his cane, Babur padlocks the front door and then the metal gate and slowly drops the keys along with the key to the paddock for his three cows into a neighbor's hand.  He is leaving his mountain home at this early hour before the sunrise to escape frightening airstrikes from U.S. drones which they called benghai or \"buzzing flies\" targeting militants near his home in the remote mountains of Afghanistan.  Babur turned to the American journalist who was asking him questions and said that you cannot see them but the buzzing sound goes on and on and then the bombing sounds begin.  When the journalist asked when he would return home again, he sighed and shook his head.Strong winds were whipping hair all around Alicia's head as she threw another garbage bag of clothes into the back of the pick-up truck.  She held a cell phone tight to one ear trying to keep her voice as calm as possible while she described to her husband the awfulness of the fire that had eaten the McDonald's house at the end of the street.  There were sirens screaming in the background competing with the noise of the helicopter overhead and men in fire gear yelling at her and her neighbors to get going.  Fire engines blocked half of the end of the street.  Smoke filled the air making her cough at the end of each sentence.  She turned and her son held up his baseball mitt and ball for her.  She had screamed at him twice to get into the cab of the truck, and this time she swooped him into one hand as she struggled with her phone in the other.  She asked her husband how long it would take to recover their losses if the fire got as far as their house, but there was no answer because her phone went dead.(All of these are fictionalized accounts of actual news I read this week.)"},

It is not without some sadness that I face realistically my future of less energy and ability to keep up as they grow.  But I am realistic in knowing they will not want me at their side during that future time as well. Well, I have a busy spring of volunteer gardening to distract me...if it ever stops snowing up that way."},

I try to read the raised 7 point font white print on the white background  in the inside of the battery casing with no luck.  I even color over it with a crayon...sort of like a person in mental therapy would do before they are given their meds.  That does not help except for breaking the point on the crayon.I say some more unladylike things and without the care that I should use unscrew the plastic case from its frame moving the ceiling tile cockeyed.  I remove and then reverse the battery installation and then wait.\"chirp\"I go upstairs and get the can of air from my computer desk and return to the scene of  waterloo and proceed to blast the hell out of it.  No bug, fleck of dust or other alien entity could possibly remain.  I wait.\"chirp\"I go back upstairs and talk myself out of bringing down the bourbon from the high cupboard and instead check my emails and work on some photos.  \"chirp\"After the chirping begins to resonate nastily between my ears, I return to the bedroom basement and pull the little  ##**%%%-^^&&@@  off the attachment to electricity. \"silence\"I have killed it.  Yes, I will have to do something about that, but right now I am thinking about a design on a voodoo doll for the inventor of this piece of %%$ and later getting ready for beach week with the kids."},
{"title": "Such Characters!", "date": "Monday, March 18, 2013", "text": "Travel is frequently about the people and since hubby and I are those annoying elderly talkative types that you try to avoid on the plane, we were able to meet a whole slew of interesting souls on our travels down and back.  I have given them made-up names and maybe they would work in your next novel...just give me a little credit and think about the test I give at the end.Flight #1 Melia:  I boarded the plane behind a thin wisp of a girl in her teens weighing no more than 90 pounds.  Her dishwater blonde hair was pulled up carelessly in a pony-tail and she looked very sleep deprived on this early flight.  Hanging limply over her shoulder was a tiny vomit-yellow patent leather purse and she clutched to her chest, like a life-saver, a beige pillow larger than her as she squeezed into the seat in front of us.  (What was unique is that she was on both of our planes down to Mexico; and we also were on one of the same flights back a week later.  She had not changed her appearance, attitude, or her soft round companion.)Juan:  My seat companion was in his mid-thirties, stocky with close-cropped spikey hair shiny from some tonic.  He had a pleasant round face with a gentle smile and Latino coloring.  He was retuning to California from the east coast where he had done some consulting as an electrical engineer.  I learned that he had been a policeman in Los Angeles but quit after eight years because of the corruption he saw in the police force such as racial profiling.  He was most proud of his 12-year-old son who was a baseball all-star in the community and even the state and Juan was hoping to make the connections smoothly so as to not miss one championship game that evening.  Juan eagerly pulled out his cell phone to share a series of photos of a this kid in a crisp baseball uniform who clearly had great form in his swing.  Juan was distracted and somewhat quiet later in the flight and it wasn't until several hours later when we arrived for our brief layover in Pheonix that I learned he was fighting the flu!Flight #2 out of PheonixBethany:  A lovely 15-year-old girl of mixed ancestry bubbled into the window seat next to me.  She had this seat while her mother who appeared white sat with her younger brother who appeared to be black across the aisle.  Bethany was full of energy and unlike the other teenage girl so eager to get to Puerto Vallarta.  I asked her if she was on vacation and she grinned and said that she was on a work trip for Eagle.  Hubby thought that she meant a small airline, but I guessed it was the clothing company.  I still could not understand why she was flying all that way for retail work when she explained that she had entered a modeling contest and while 20 others had won, she was selected anyway as an extra because of her 'niche' look.  She had a lovely face with big brown eyes and a head full of shiny curls flying every which way.  Hubby thought it was a luxury trip for her but I knew, as a photographer, it meant long days of work in early and late hours outside the window of the mid-day flat sun.  I was glad to see that as a minor she was being accompanied by a parent!Our plane had a late start due to some delayed passengers on a connecting flight and thus the stewardess did some switching so that the girl could sit next to her mother and the window seat became empty once again for a brief time.Manuel:  This handsome 23-year-old flew into the plane crashing and pushing his carry-on into the overhead bin with high energy and required both hubby and I to move once again into the aisle so that he could take the seat left open by Bethany.  I learned, before he fell into that abandoned sleep that only single college males can conjure, that he was a student at the University of Pennsylvania and on spring break.  He had decided only the night before to join some friends in Puerto Vallarta and booked this flight.  I could not help but be a little jealous over how nice it must be to be rich enough to head to another country on spring break while still a student in college.  (I was waiting tables on spring break.) He said he was a finance major, so I also squeezed in some digs about hoping he was planning to give the wall street profession a better name.  He smiled and said he was planning to make money.  I also learned he was fluent in Spanish as his father was from Columbia and his mother was from Costa Rica whch he shared as the plane took off.   Soon he had lowered the tray and fallen into a deep sleep to prepare himself for a week of drinking and beaching and bikini watching.Flight #1 heading homeMark:  Another good-looking male sat beside hubby on this flight, this time in the aisle seat, while I took the window and forced hubby to sit in the middle.  I am guessing he was in his mid-thirties wearing a nice white polo shirt that complimented the tan he had acquired in Mexico.  I talked little since hubby was doing the interrogation this flight.  Mark was not married, had no children and was glad of it as he seemed to be in a place (perhaps permanent) in his life where he could remain footloose and carefree.  He just shook his head as he watched the various families settle in with babies and toddlers for the flight.  Mark was a biochemist and worked for a company that made mulch.  The biochemist part seemed to have something  to do with the various colors that mulch comes in these days.  When interrogated further about the addition of tannins he made it clear that if he leaked even the smallest information on the formulas he would have to kill us.  He was good at getting hubby to talk about himself the rest of the flight...although in reality this is not difficult.Flight #2 heading homeVeronica:  Our last victim companion on our last flight was an attractive woman in her late forties or early fifties with shoulder length blonde hair and upper middle class make-up.  She was over-weight, but not obese, and dressed in jeans and a casual top accessorized with fashionable chunky jewelry.  Her smile was warm and friendly and her eyes were bright and intelligent.  She got the aisle seat next to us, lucky girl, while her husband had been assigned a seat several rows toward the front.  She had just spent a long weekend in Palm Springs \"holding down a chaise lounge\" while her husband had attended a bankers conference there.  As we talked we learned she had been a lawyer who had worked in the juvenile justice system before leaving that stressful venue and changed to the professional contracting business.  She took foreclosed properties and remodeled them and then sold them.  With the inside track provided by her banker husband I am guessing she made big bucks which she was putting toward a vacation/retirement home on a lake somewhere in North Carolina.  At one point during our extensive conversation she asked my husband if he believed in global warming.  We are always surprised by those who think it is a hoax by scientists (all 10,000 in ca-hoots across the globe) to raise more research money.  We tried to provide some facts, although it is complicated, to moderate the effects of the kool-aid she was being fed by her conservative colleagues.  She was enjoying this time in her life with her kids off to colleges or soon on their way, and she now had the freedom to travel with her husband and also plan for their future time together.OK.  Now, if you want a writing exercise, be brave and take one or more of these and make a tapestry of words for a brief story that I can read and enjoy and let me know of the link-back in the comments below."},

{"title": "Yes, You are Correct", "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "text": "Yes, in answer to my readers, (I actually missed you all and have been having fun catching up on your blogs...never guessed I would feel that way.) I spent a week in Mexico. Regarding the prior post the man in the photo is alive and is covered in some medium that allows the sand being thrown at him to stick to him.  He kept his eyes tightly closed.  We did not stay long enough to see him perform.Our point system offered a kitchenette in an \"all-inclusive\" time share facility in Puerto Vallarta which is on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.  This small city is very much a tourist spot for Canadians and Americans tired of their cold weather.  Most of the people I met were from British Columbia or Northern California, and while there were a number of students on spring break, most were old farts like me.  The city does not have the hard, flat, festival feel of Cancun, but is hanging on to its softness and culture although it is growing larger in size each day.  The buses are easy to manage and get the tourists downtown cheaply, if with questionable safety in terms of traffic, where there are lots of good restaurants and all kinds of shopping.  There are plenty of canned tours that get tourists out of the city as well. Tucked at the end of the city are several small, sterile, but lovely Stepford communities of ex-patriots homes where life is good.  Everything is cheaper in Mexico and the people are very polite and friendly and that is the biggest attraction for most tourists and those that live there half the year.Lovely young couple dressed up to welcome us to their restaurant.The greatest danger is getting waylaid by time-share sales staff who number in the dozens and wait like sharks at the airport in an interior corridor and pretend to be your contact for your shuttle to your hotel.  (They get paid $200 if they can get you to the sales site.)   Ignore all those men and women dressed in crisp white uniforms with name tags and head straight out to the waiting cars.I wish I had researched better to find more eco-tours as that is my preference. There are three million tours to swim with dolphins (for first timers, children, pregnant women) and those I do not consider eco-tours, so we passed.  There are lots of bungee-jumping, sky riding, zip-lining activities for thrill seekers as well.  Instead we took a boat out to the Marrietas Islands which is a protected wildlife sanctuary and marine preserve made famous by Jacques Cousteau and home to a rare species of bird: the Blue-Footed Booby.  We did some snorkeling, but since it was after December water was cold and visibility was about three feet!  A bit of a disappointment although we saw close-ups of boobies (the bird kind) and whales, dolphins and sting rays.  A few posts/photos about these on my other blog.We toured a tortilla factory or two, small family sized operations.  We toured a tequila factory or two and got to taste a variety of tequila's which fortunately I like...not the sweet ones...but at 80 proof that is a pleasure that has its limits.  We toured a botanical garden that was not near the tropical example it could have been.  We looked at a few small village towns with traditional churches off the center square, and we stopped at one Catholic cemetery where the Catholic church allows the rich to build large monuments to their dead and the poor to have small raised graves and where everyone visits relatives on the Day of the Dead.The white truck is a police escort that the government felt necessary on our trip to the petroglyphs in the remote country.Actually this was my first real vacation to Mexico as I cannot count the trip I took to Cancun 20 years ago as anything different than hitting Miami on spring break!"},

{"title": "Who is Responsible?", "date": "Sunday, February 24, 2013", "text": "I have posted on the artist Al Weiwei twice already and from all the interesting examples in the very limited exhibit that is currently touring this country, I will select just one more.  He did some beautiful works in wood and those I will save for another time, perhaps, when the writer in me is looking for something to say.  These next examples are about children, corruption and government ... in somewhat that order.  The photo below is one of my children when they were very small with some friends in Indonesia.The photo above is distorted because this post is about an earthquake and children.  We had earthquakes in Indonesia, but this is about an earthquake in China.This description above is blurred because in most museums you may not use a flash and therefore it was taken in dark light requiring a steadier hand than I have.  But since this is about earthquakes, I think a bit of shaken text is appropriate.This rebar in the photos above of the artwork came from the actual schoolhouses that collapsed like houses of cards after the earthquake.  Many Chinese parents lost their children due to schools built with very poor quality materials and questions about corruption and kick backs were made.  The metal bars are arranged a little like a river and seem to have waves across its surface like the waves of an earthquake.Chinese officials remained in denial about how many died, and about how the poor construction of the schools contributed to these deaths. The government refused to release the names of the children.  Thus Weiwei made his artistic protest.  An entire wall in the museum lists the names of the children who died and an audio track is run in this room saying each their names.You can learn more about \"Al'  here  <http://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2012/12/on-the-newshour-ai-weiwei.html>  and here <http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/12/dissident-artist-ai-weiwei-not-optimistic-about-new-chinese-leadership.html>  You will need a kleenex."},
{"title": "What is Valuable?", "date": "Thursday, February 21, 2013", "text": "The bowl is from Japan and the rice is from Italy and this photo was taken in my kitchen.  This is the beginning of an homage to Al Weiwei.  If you don't quite get it, you will have to read the prior post for help.  As I look at this photo I remember driving by a busy corner as I was entering the city of Jogjakarta in Indonesia and seeing a totally naked and very thin woman who looked well into her 60's with an empty rice bowl held out in her hand.  Others stood around her trying to cross the street and truly appeared not to see her.  That image will never leave my consciousness.If you  look closer at this photo above you will realize that these two bowls do not contain rice.  The bowls are made of the finest porcelain from China and the shiny objects are a half-ton of freshwater pearls.  (Weiwei 2006)  The bowls are exactly one meter in diameter.  I think I am in sync with Weiwei by putting these two photos in the same blog.  Which do you think is worth more?  Depends on who you are and how full your belly is I guess.  I was very tempted to let my hands feel the tactile sensation of of these shiny orbs.\"The choice of materials and the use of traditional techniques show his determination to highlight in these artworks both his “Chineseness” and his active subversion of it, as in Bowl of Pearls (2006). This sculpture consists of a pair of bowls one meter in diameter filled with freshwater pearls. While abundance of pearls can symbolize wealth and provoke a strong desire, the large number displayed in the bowl is such that it triggers an opposite feeling. The feeling of value and preciousness commonly associated with pearls, when displayed in a small quantity, is replaced by an ordinary feeling despite the pearls’ inner beauty.\" Review from Mori Art Museum.This is my small personal collection of both freshwater and salt water pearls, and since some were handed down from an elder relative, their value is much greater to me emotionally than practically."},
{"title": "Is It Art?", "date": "Tuesday, February 19, 2013", "text": "In what must seem as an addendum to my prior comments on art and artists, I expanded my experience by visiting an exhibit of one of the more famous dissident artists in the world.  This is his first U.S. exhibit which was successful on its first stop at the Hirshhorn Sculpture museum in D.C.  I am, of course, writing about Al Weiwei who is \"waiting\" for China to return his passport.  He was unable to attend the opening of this exhibit months ago, although over 200 diplomats from around the world were there to see it.Whether one considers his work art, a statement of dissident symbolism or moments of Zen interspersed with his black and white photography, I was drawn to each piece and it left me thinking about art and humanity.  Could he be as famous an artist without the repressive government in China motivating him and giving him fame is a question made by some.  He lived in the U.S. for twelve years and returned to China where he became more interesting and more motivated.In repressive China he has been arrested, beaten around the head (photos of the x-ray of the head concussion are part of the exhibit) and thrown in jail.  He has also had his newest studio bulldozed.  He currently faces charges on tax evasion.  He has won international awards and fortune which makes it awkward for the government to keep him out of the public eye.I feel that China is a bomb of youthful energy and ideas waiting to explode.  When, not if, this happens, the global community (art, finance, health, etc.) will be forced to sit up and take notice.The first work of art that you see when you arrive at the museum is outside in the courtyard.  It is the Zodiac of animal heads (12  bronze heads) that stand outside the Hirshhorn museum...an over-sized re-creation of twelve bronze animal heads that once adorned the Zodiac Fountain in Yuan Ming Yuan, the Old Summer Palace, in Beijing before being destroyed by  British diplomat James Bruce, the 8th Earl of Elgin after the Opium wars.  The history of this destruction includes burning people alive and looting.  This is a perfect example of Weiwei's desire to connect the ancient with the contemporary and to connect art and politics. \"The original heads had been made by Giuseppe Castiglione (1688-1766), an Italian Jesuit who, while living in China, had executed commissions for the Chinese emperor in the 18th century.In other words, Ai Weiwei, a Chinese artist who has been considerably influenced by Western Postmodernism and who lived and studied in New York for over a decade, had recreated works made by a European who had lived and worked in China in the 18th century. What had spurred Ai Weiwei to make another Zodiac?\"  John SeedIt gets even more complicated from here.  Questions are raised on authenticity, value, and who owns art anyway?  Just today CNN reported on some wall graffiti/mural by the now in-demand street artist Banksy being stolen right off the side of the building on a London street!"},

Well, it seems that my upload of 262 sunset photos is finished, and that number is just for 2012!  (As I said I tend to favor red.)   Hubby and I took a hike yesterday as the weather almost reached 70F in mid-February.  (Photos above and below) I always bring a camera and while rounding the path in the late winter afternoon sun a young woman with curly red hair (lots of hair) was holding a young baby in her arms and trying to take a picture of the two of them while she sat on a bench.  The sun caught the golden red halo of her hair and the soft fuzz of the baby's head and I wish I had taken a shot of this amazing silhouette.  But I was polite and instead offered to take photos of Madonna and child with her camera.  She had a small camera so I am not sure how they turned out, but I was really having fun!"},
{"title": "Captive Audience", "date": "Monday, February 11, 2013", "text": "The past few years I have grown more fond of BBC television programs that are purchased by our public television stations and then re-broadcast here in the USA.  Most of the programs are mysteries or detective stories.  Others are humorous stories taking place in small towns in the country side.  There is one series Masterpiece that re-broadcasts some fun costume dramas.  I have wondered why I find these shows so appealing.  The stories in small towns are simple and old fashioned, nothing that leaves me in deep thought after watching.  The mysteries are pretty traditional and usually have just enough red herrings that I can resolve them only in the last fifteen minutes.  But that doesn't mean anything because I even re-watch them the very next season!  The costume dramas are a guilty pleasure but not as fulfilling perhaps as reading an historical novel of several hundred pages.  So once again I ponder what it is that I like about these shows from \"across the pond.\"  ( I do watch too much TV, but I try to do something like folding clothes or sorting files or straightening the living room while watching so that my guilt in this addiction is not so bad.)I think the reason I like these shows is that:All ages are represented and not just in token small roles. Ruggedly handsome includes gray hair and a paunch sometimes.All ages are not usually stereotyped but presented as interesting faceted characters People look real with wrinkles, weight issues, and non-model proportioned faces. (NO Barbies)If someone has an idiosyncrasy that they were born with, it fits gently into the role they play (right now I am thinking of Chummy Browne in \"Call the Midwife.\")They can be edgy but still keep some sense of decorum and humanity.The one thing that is difficult in watching is translating, on a regular basis, when I watch with hubby."},
{"title": "The Soul of an Artist", "date": "Wednesday, February 06, 2013", "text": "When you pursue some skill that you love you reach a point where you wish people to take notice no matter how shy you are.  When I first joined the RedBubble, a photography website out of Australia (far away where no one knows me), I thought it would be a good source for feedback from professional and amateur photographers to help me grow.  I was most naive.  I posted a comment about how there was so much praise and no suggestions for change and improvement which was met with deadly silence!  As the months passed I submitted a few very veiled critical suggestions to others and they were taken with a grain of salt.  But I also noticed some very angry discussions unbecoming photographers when I perused other sites and journal entries.  It became clear to me that some artists have very sensitive egos and do not appreciate critical input.  Fortunately I was never on the receiving end of this, but I would not have been dismayed, and just accepted that I had bruised someone's sense of self.  Thus, I realized this was just a site to post and wait for praise or silence.  There is one venue for input from others, but it is somewhat complicated for me to figure out how to post the photograph for review so I have only posted one or two items!I have entered contests on this site which are primarily set up to stimulate membership and have over 100 features of new work or photographs that have been selected for top ten praise in challenges that are put forth by volunteers hosting the various groups.  Some of these groups leaders are professional photographers, so I am honored in this selection.  I have submitted photos for free for publication and been rewarded.  I have not won any of the local contests to which I submit.  I have sold a few photos as greeting cards.Some of my readers of this blog are artists.  They write, paint, take photographs and feel comfortable that they are a perfect fit into the artist mold.  They are not intimidated by anyone or do not show it.  I, on the other hand, have a tiny ego in this world of the artist and see myself as a really struggling persona.  (Please note, I am not a shrinking violet and do NOT have a tiny ego in other areas of my life.)  While I love the praise my readers send with love on my photos and my prose and poetry, I never really feel as if I deserve it.  I accept it as encouragement and a pat on the back from a loving parent, but not recognition of  small genius...which we all would really love.Okay, what is my point in this long, self-involved post?  I have recently been selected as a feature artist in a small (very small) online journal.  I do not know what is expected.  It seems to be not an interview but more so a write up by me of who I am and a selection from my works.  The surprise for me is that I have only entered two works into this group that selected me...others I have entered dozens.   I was told not to worry about that!  So, please wish me luck and tell  me how you would get in the mind set of an artist for this!"},

This little snippet gives me hope.  We may always disagree on any number of significant issues, but we really are good people under all the rhetoric and we really can compromise on most of the issues in a way that can move this country forward.  If we keep the moneyed lobbyists out of the argument, I fee that we can reach reasonable compromises."},

I am willing to pay more for all types of things so that my fellow citizens can have decent health care.  It is the lower wage employees, many times the ones exposed to the worst working conditions and the most unpredictable employment stability, that are going to suffer by employers reducing their hours.  I was trying to cheer up a cashier at BJ's when he pointed out it was not the long hours but the shorter hours he was suffering from.  He was only allowed to work 24 hours a week.  I thought it was an overtime issue, but he clarified that if he put in 30 hours they would have to provide him with healthcare support.Denny's restaurants in Florida said they would raise their meals by 5%.  Really!  I am willing to pay that during the few times I eat at Denny's.The Darden restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, etc.) also claimed this healthcare law was just too costly and too burdensome on their business...until they found within weeks a drop in business by about 37%  when people found out and a drop in their standards of customer service when employees were spread out part-time.Look, this national health care initiative is going to cost, but the cost will be spread out over us all and there are several provisions that tighten the waste and overspending done in hospitals and doctor's offices. Just THINK for a minute.  Do you really want to be eat food that has been cooked, handled and served by staff who avoid seeing a doctor until the very last minute because they have no health care?  Let us be practical here and little more generous with our money.I will watch the food industry and only eat in those places that care about the health of their employees.  You can take your own chances as you wish."},

With my Droid smartphone they gave me this many opportunities in the photo above to get it wrong and almost be reduced to tears on the day after Christmas.  The font size was 8!   How can an instrument that is primarily designed for communication get is so wrong?   Clearly they never learned the best from Cicero \"When you wish to instruct, be brief; that men's minds take in quickly what you say, learn its lesson, and retain it faithfully. Every word that is unnecessary only pours over the side of a brimming mind.\"  Well, I have definitely brimmed here.  There are videos online that you can watch in the tiny screen to learn more.  They move very fast.  You will have to watch them enough times to memorize them and then perhaps apply.  (Anyone under 50 who is reading this, get over your miraculous selves because you WILL be here someday with some great new technology.)I eventually went to the store where the phone was purchased and asked the 15-year-old working there if he could transfer my phone book from my old phone.  He fiddled for a while and had the same success that I did.  He took my phone to the computer and fiddled there and had more success.  I forgot to ask him to transfer the dozen photos that I had on the little pink device, but they were not important.  I purchased three screen protectors for the touch screen and a car charger and got out of there for about $40.00!  That used to be the price of a monthly phone bill so long ago.I have had this phone since December 25 and hubby set it up so that it was ready to run on that day.  I have received exactly one call since then, and it was from my husband in a test call.   I told my husband that I really did not want this phone, but he is stubborn and probably thought I was trying to save money.  Well he was right about that as I am not sure how much more on a monthly basis this gadget will cost us.  My most recent cellular bill was 60$ more than usual, and I hope that means it included the cost of this slick pink thing.  As I said before it will be most easy to drop---compared to the files in the photo below.I did figure out how to take a photo of someone and then add that as an icon to the favorites box for phone calls,  something hubby did not know could be done.  But he has probably 300 contacts on his phone!Yes, I am trying to be grateful, but I would have been just as happy with a box of French chocolate truffles.I have little use for the \"APPs\" except the GPS and mapping device which is like my Garmin GPS!  So, now I have two ways to get lost and two computer voices to ask me to make a U-Turn at the next available opportunity.  The game APPS are not free and who on earth can see stuff that small in order to play if you are waiting in a doctor's office?  I no longer need to carry a pocket calculator...I guess that is one of the things that will be obsolete in the future.  I do not know the difference between an APP and a WIDGET though.If you keep your phone on off most of the time in your purse and IF you have connected to FaceBook via your phone, be aware when you boot it up that it will go back an eternity to update you on your FB notifications!!!   See the very top line in the phone screen shot below.  It does not let you know who is making these comments as it scrolls and updates, so it is less than useful.Yes, I am trying to be grateful, but I would have been just as happy with a box (or a dozen boxes) of French chocolate truffles."},

There was a store just selling olive oils and few specialty vinegars...talk about living in abundance in a world that has many going hungry each night.  (That guilt did not stop me from buying several expensive oils!)There was an abundance of gifts in my life this year...two big ones that hubby bought me and which I did not ask for and am not sure I want.  One is a very fancy remote control movie camera (two actually) for watching animals, nannies, or neighbors when they do not know they are being photographed.  (This should just open up the world for more blog posts and perhaps resulting lawsuits.  Youtube here I come.) The other was a smart phone.  It is thin making it very droppable.  It has a touch screen that zips and zaps and gets it right 50% of the time.  There are features upon features ... 90% of which I will never use.  After some effort I linked it to FaceBook and was a little frightened that it picked up a bunch of phone numbers from that link as well!  I bet half these people do not know that I have their phone number!   Please note that I get maybe three calls a month on my mobile phone...maybe.  Usually these calls are hubby trying to figure out where I am in the mall so that we can meet up for lunch.The one abundance that I am always amazed about is the love of all the love-able people in my life.  I can never repay it, but that will be my New Year's resolution.(One final abundance note is too many fruit flies...not from all the wine I have been drinking but all the fruit that went to ferment while we were gone.  I actually have one floating in the dregs of my coffee cup this morning.)"},

{"title": "Godlessness Be Damned", "date": "Friday, December 21, 2012", "text": "As we get closer to a God-filled holiday, I am surprised, although I certainly should not be, at how many God-less situations are being pointed out to me by God-filled experts.  The most recent being a justification for tragedies in schools and universities because they are God-less bastions of compromising lifestyles and philosophies, and the next at the funerals of some of the school victims where church-goers were protesting their Godlessness.As my readers know I am not a religious person.  I am not an agnostic or an atheist either.  I am someone on a journey always looking for God-fullness and answers in religious and non-religious events alike.  I do not see God in my likeness but as a magnificent power or energy inside all living things, yet I do not see myself as a pantheist.  I would never have the hubris to point out places where God does not exist.   But I am bold enough to say that I think God is goodness and God is everywhere.  God is the quiet and tiny.   God is sometimes the bold and loud.  God is ALWAYS EVERYWHERE and we abandon God, God does not abandon us.  I do not think God is an evangelist demanding loyalty and creating punishment for those who stray.  We create our own punishment.   God is the softest act you will ever know seducing you into loyalty.  He is like the poet's (Autry) son who in his autistic struggle in this world caught not one but dozens of butterflies and hummingbirds in his child-hands in slow wonderment, named them and then set them free in love.I see IT/God in the face of a child whose life was shortened by violence.  I see IT in the eye of the whale.  I see IT in the dance of youth at a party.  I see IT in the hands of a nurse removing blood streaked gloves.  I see IT in the bent and gnarled body of an old woman crossing the street.  I see IT in all the music that man has created and invented.  I see this power for goodness in the poetry I read.  I see it in all the colored lights we string and all the candles we light when man celebrates any God-filled holiday anywhere in the world.  For that brief moment we concentrate outside ourselves.   I also see God in the anger and discouragement of mankind.  IT is hidden inside behind the fire waiting to be seen.  I see IT when we sigh and forgive ourselves for our mistakes each year and promise ourselves a better year.  There sits God deep inside our soul waiting for us to recognize IT and not give up hope."},

(Note:  This event and the writing about it happened days before the Oregon tragedy.) I had a list...somewhere...I thought...looking for that wrinkled yellow paper torn from my notepad and now lying hidden beneath a wallet, a small camera, hand lotion, a pocket calendar, and stale gum deep in the bottom of my purse.  I must use the list or I will kick into that addictive mode where I keep buying gifts for loved ones as if that could make them love me more or longer.  I MUST STICK TO THE LIST!I look around the mall filled with dazed shoppers and resigned children carrying bags of all shapes and sizes.  Down the center of the mall are young minimum wage employees standing expectantly outside their kiosks wishing to dab something on my hand or allow me to play with some automated toy.  They stand intensely watching for potential customers or absently texting wishing they were anywhere but here before displays of woven scarves or silver jewelry or brightly colored cell-phone cases.  I silently say a prayer (to whomever) that they make it through the season with a little more money than they had hoped for.  They deserve some reward after spending days rubbing lotion on old ladies hands.Sighing to myself,  I have given up on the list.  I do remember my son asking for shirts and sweaters in medium and I turn to hubby and direct him away from watching some flying toy toward the large department store at the very end of the mall.  It will be a trek and an obstacle course, but we will get there.Surprisingly, the men's clothing section in the back of the store is not in total disarray.  Shelves are neat and reasonably full of stock.  Some of the sale prices are very good.  I peruse tables avoiding the cream cheese golf look and the expensive European brands and turn toward the edgier clothing to match my son's 'rock star' personality.  After all, he texted yesterday that he will be opening for Sublime with Rome...whoever in the hell they are!  Striped shirts with thin bright bands or shiny black buttons which I match to a more subdued but very soft pullover sweater are my selections.As I turn toward the checkout a tall woman about my age is standing just to my left.  She turns to the (Indian/Pakistani?) girl behind the counter and asks if the shirt she is holding out is more blue or more purple.  The girl hesitates and then answers \"Purple\" with a distinct un-American accent.  Then the woman pulls up a bright lime green shirt, and looking at both the girl and I, asks if we think it is too bright.  The girl demures clearly not sure what answer her customer is looking for.I think her question is naive, but I tactlessly respond.  \"Depends on the personality of the man you are giving it to.  Is he bold with personality or more conservative?\"   She doesn't answer but tucks the shirt under her arm and then turns to me again with the blue/purple shirt and asks if I think it is blue or periwinkle.  I want to explain that looking at colors under store lighting is very deceptive, but being the photographer that I like to think I am, I boldly state that it has a little more purple in it and is probably closer to periwinkle.I place my selections on the counter and hand the girl my credit card.\"I do not know what color is periwinkle,\" she smiles as she begins to scan the bar codes of my selections.The tall, solidly built woman approaches the counter behind my husband and I, and looks around the store commenting that there is a lot of stock that still has to be moved by the holidays.  I respond that I have seen some stores that do not seem to have so much inventory and appear to be playing it more carefully.Hubby says something about the recession and something else that I do not hear about the economy as I finish my check-out.  The woman responds to him with some comment I miss and he looks at a loss for words.  I grab my bags of clothes and turn to leave as the woman leans in close to hubby's ear and says something to him in a low voice.As we are leaving the store and out of her hearing, I ask him what she said.He takes a deep breath, \"When all the goodies are gone, just make sure you have your gun loaded and ready.\"And yet, she had looked so absolutely normal."},

This is why (not really) that I no longer go to church.  I wonder what the parishioners' \"helping the poor\" programs are like, because in spite of their misinterpretation of that quote from the Bible, Jesus did preach that we help the poor.  Do they offer free gun training or free ammunition to poor families at Christmas?  It reminds me of the dorm at the Colorado University that was set aside this year for students who wanted to bring their guns to college.  Keeping a concealed weapon is so important to learning.  No one signed up, which gave me hope that we were not returning to the uncivilized wild west where we must be ready to defend ourselves daily using violence.  There are those who live in fear of almost everything and need to stock up on food, water, guns and prayer with the belief that victory goes to those who are prepared for the very worst.  There are those who feel there is a master plan of which we are a small part or if no master plan is unfolding, then we must accept that each day is an energy of events and we can control it to a small extent by the way we live our lives.  But the greater control we have is how we react over time to what happens to us.  You know which one I am."},

I heard the soft patter of feet and little child whimpers and then a tearful child was beside my bed crying from a nightmare.  I allowed the sharp kneed and elbowed girl into my bed and dried her tears and comforted her as we both attempted a speedy return to sleep which she succeeded in doing.  But unfortunately, my little grandchild was fighting a cold, sore throat, and mild fever at that time.  And she shared that with me.My husband developed the cold symptoms first on the day after Thanksgiving and two days later I came down with the same cold symptoms.  My response is always worse than his, and even though I have been taking Zinc lozenges regularly, I still have symptoms and feel tired from lack of a good night's sleep.But, because I am not super sick, I am kind of enjoying this gold-bricking excuse.  Tomorrow I will return to my lists, errands and duties.  But for today, I am being the grasshopper.In the photos above we are driving in and out of a little of winter on our return from the north two days after Thanksgiving."},

{"title": "Peacefulness is Here", "date": "Monday, November 19, 2012", "text": "I did not grow up in a family that listened to music, either at home or on the radio.  I never heard my father or mother sing that I can remember.  I could not sing with a bucket over my head and my flute playing in junior high school was a struggle for us all.  But I was able after my children were grown and moving out of their teen years to listen to music on the radio that was not just popular or contemporary stuff.  I was able to focus on what certain types of  music did for me during my pauses in busy work days.With no more college bills and reduced food bills at that time I was able to peruse music shops and buy a number of CDs from all genres.  Classical, broadway, international, jazz, folk and even some popular artists.  I today am listening to something called African Tapestries and it is filled with percussion that mimics the sounds of a lion, drum beats from some village, a flute that calls like the tropical birds and the sound of rain now and again.  It is as if I am sitting in some rainforest bamboo hut waiting for the storm to pass.  I have not converted these CD's to digital and may never spend the money to do that.  I also purchased an expensive sound system at the same time and have wallowed in this delightful decadence for years.Regarding my prior political post, it was not removed because I felt I cannot speak my mind on issues.  I feel strongly about my liberal social values and my more moderate to conservative fiscal values as well.  You can ask any of my relatives and they will tell you I am no wallflower when it comes to controversy.  I am willing to listen to their side, and they must listen to mine.  But this blog was not created as a forum for that, so I try to keep away from going down that road.  My conservative readers are moderates, I really think, and do not need my lecturing.  My liberal readers will only agree with me in spades.  My moderate middle-of-the road readers can find their way better through factual research than my specific arguments.  So do not feel that I removed it out of fear of making someone angry, only out of realization that the conversation tends to be more one-sided in blogdom.  I do worry about those who think that politics U.S. is too far gone for their voice anymore.  Every citizen that throws in the towel is more dangerous than they know."},

{"title": "That Canned Meat", "date": "Thursday, November 15, 2012", "text": "I doubt it is just me, but I have suddenly been hit with spam comments on a daily basis to both of my blogs.  I have my blog set up where I do not require those posting comments to go through that annoying word verification window that is set up to prevent spam robots from leaving comments.  I hate this gatekeeper because it also prevents real people from commenting on others' blogs. I also have no restrictions on who can comment on my posts...no registration,  etc.   I do have an approval requirement that kicks in on comments to my posts that are over 7 days old and this is where the spam comments are being posted.I mark these comments as spam so they never get published.  They are drug ads mostly...some clothing ads.  All of them annoying and clearly from non-English sources due to the bad grammar.I do not want to implement that nasty word verification window that Blogger has created which is so hard to read that I sometimes try three times to get the code right when trying to place a comment on another blog.  After that, if I still have no success I just don't comment on the blog.  Most readers refuse to use the word verification at all.At any rate, here is hoping we soon get a much reduce diet of that canned meat, SPAM!"},
{"title": "Relations", "date": "Monday, November 12, 2012", "text": "It was the end of a long day in the garden for hubby as he put his beds to sleep for winter and a long day for me going through all of my office files and moving an ugly wooden file cabinet out of my bedroom and up the stairs into my little office on the stair landing.  We had moved all the patio furniture into the shelter of the porch and finished the process of getting it ready for winter.  We both were basking in the success of a well organized day. We had just stuffed ourselves on spaghetti Bolognese with a side of garden vegetables while we were waiting for NPR news to start on TV when hubby turned to me and leaning forward asked:\"Do you think you will treat grandchildren differently from your new daughter-in-law than you do for those from your daughter?\"I thought for a minute and realized that indeed I probably would.I know my daughter intimately and while I allow her to raise her children as she wants, I do sometimes offer just a little advice when I think she needs guidance.  I also stretch the rules just a little when they are alone with me.  With my daughter-in-law, if they are lucky enough to have children, I will stand back more and wait for her actions to help me.  I already love her, but I only 'think' I know her.  She is very close to both her mother and her grandmother...my role will be much smaller.I will live closer to them geographically, so I hope they feel free to call on us for babysitting and child-watching.  I feel strongly that is my biological role in life.  I cannot explain. but being a grandmother is a calling in my book.  I think it goes to the deep root of reproduction that is the core of most of us.As I pondered on my husband's unusual question, I realized I had never given thought to how different these two families would be in my life.  I accept that our relationship with our children colors so many things that happen in their lives.  So tell me, if you have children of both sexes, who marry and have children of their own...does it make a difference in your relationship with the grandchildren?  I am not asking if you love more or less, that I know is stupid.  I am just asking about your philosophy in providing guidance to the children and interacting with them and their parents on a subtle and small scale."},
{"title": "Post Mortum", "date": "Friday, November 09, 2012", "text": "The results of this election have not really changed the egg shell mood of this country.  Deeply conservative people are angry and terrified.  ( I remember how I felt when George W. Bush was elected.  I was sure he was going to destroy this country or bring it to the edge of destruction with Chaney.  Guess what?)I have talked to (former) friends who are so mad they are no longer going to vote.  Trying to reason with that logic is hard.  Fortunately, most of my friends are moderates...they are Republicans married to Democrats and Democrats married to Republicans and Independents not yet married, who realize that politics is an evolutionary model.  It swings to the left and then to the right and makes most of its slow progress in the middle with compromise.While Trump was adamant that Obama was very secretive about his background, I was concerned with the fact that Romney deleted his emails and sold off servers and PCs to employees when he was governor of Massachusetts with the result that there was no information to send when freedom of information requests were filed to find out how he really governed that state.  I was concerned that he did not reveal his taxes.  If you want to be the Head of State I want to know everything about your finances and I think I have that right.  I did research Bain's success under the time of Romney and found that the huge majority of companies purchased were sold off and shut down.  Of those that Bain did help, only seven really became successful under Romney and only four continued in the black being able to carry the debt that Bain left them after he left.But I also want to point out I am not happy about Obama's record on the environment.  Neither candidate even touched these issues due to the recession.  Clean air and clean water are too expensive these days. The Keystone pipeline will be completed under this president...but perhaps that is the least of our environmental issues. This President is pretty moderate by standards of years ago. This article here (not really tongue in cheek) makes the case against a liberal president and shows you we are in moderate, if not totally conservative, hands.    Read it before the link disappears as they all do."},

{"title": "Nothing Shared", "date": "Monday, November 05, 2012", "text": "One of the most important and powerful things in my life as I age is that file of shared memories I keep nearby and open at the oddest moments to peruse.  While we remember the dark and sad times in our lives, I think that we most often allow our minds to turn to those happy and meaningful events that we shared with those we love.  These are our restoratives and reminders that our life has been good.  I realize that they do not have to be monumental periods in my life.  The memory can be studying a spider spinning a web with a two-year-old on your hip, brushing the pollen from the pants of a 5-year-old tree climber just before he boards the bus for school, the sweet/sad memory of a little girl sitting on her metal lunchbox as she waits for the school bus.  I also have a few big memories such as the memory of an evening in Hawaii standing on a hotel balcony overlooking the beach with a rising moon when my husband presented me with a new diamond to replace the one lost so many years ago and which was too expensive to replace at the time, or that time my husband, who greets life with endless enthusiasm, woke me at 2:00 A.M. during a camping trip so that I could see the tropical reef at an exceptional low tide under a full moon.But lately, being a bit greedy, I have been having regrets for all the memories I have not been able to make. Life moves on with those I love who live outside my house.  Their days are busy and full of tales and I am not there to see or hear them.  I might get a shortened version of the more interesting or dramatic, but the little memories are only for those who were there.  I have missed the grandchildren's first days at school and all the stories they might have shared when they got home and sat for dinner.  I have missed the weekend and after-school learning or successes they experienced.  I have missed the daily jokes and get-togethers of my own brothers and sisters that live so far away.  I wish I could be there for the new challenges they have tried as they move into the later part of their lives.I also think about the memories others missed.  My third grandchild will not know all the early fun times we had with his brother and sister over the years before he arrived and while this is natural and inevitable, it does cause me pause as I realize we all have missed so much stuff.  I then think of those whose families are broken and how difficult it must be to keep continuity to shared memories when some must be kept away in a quiet place that is visited only when everything is perfect.  It is a tricky dance and full of land mines when skipping over these memories.I know that I am reaching that time in my life when memories are going to be the most important tools I have and need to fill the sometimes big empty pauses in each day.  Looking back can be such a bittersweet time, can it not?"},
{"title": "Downfall of the Aftermath", "date": "Thursday, November 01, 2012", "text": "As those of us who are intelligent understand, this type of weather is the new normal.  We have had 7 national weather disasters this year and had 14 last year.  Those who deny global warming and our role in it, will not be spared the forest fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, or micro bursts to come any more than the rest of us.  We were spared the worst as I posted recently.  But while waiting for Sandy to arrive and a full 12 hours before we felt the strongest force of her dance, I looked out my formal room (I call it the library) window and saw this tulip poplar in the center of the photo leaning away from his compadres.  This tree is over 100 feet high and all the poplars that are the same height on this part of the yard have been compromised due to a septic drain field which was put in when we built the house.  We had lost another tree just like it and only a few feet from it last year.  I checked on it every 10 minutes and it continued to lean more.  I was fixing a snack when...I did not see the actual fall, but was not surprised.  More firewood for next winter.  Another section of deer fence to repair!  We also lost the lovely little wild fruit tree down at the dock.  It was such a little tree, but its roots had sat in the brackish water too long.  It had provided many lovely little white blossoms each spring, but will do that no longer.During the noon of Tuesday, long after Sandy had checked out and checked in up North creating more disaster, I went down to the dock at high tide.  The little dock platform on the right was not even visible.  Still this flooding was not as horrible as it could have been.But I think the biggest surprise was when I opened the front door just before the tree fall and saw my old Mazda with its sad expression.  I had clearly neglected it way too much after the purchase of my new car.  While my new Camry sat safe and comfy in the garage, the Mazda was left outside in the wind and rain.  I stood in the doorway and saw the Mazda which sat like a small wet mammal wanting to come in and dry off!  It had ruined the lawn  in its crossing I noticed.(Hubby did drive it here in the shelter of the garage. Sandy does not have a driver's licence and you should see what she had done to other cars!)"},

{"title": "Hurricane Pasta", "date": "Saturday, October 27, 2012", "text": "As I write this, Hurricane Sandy is just off shore from the north part of the state of Florida.  We are getting scary reports about how this will be a 'perfect' storm when it meets up with a strong cold front bearing down from the Northwest even though it has been downgraded to a tropical storm.We have spent the day moving patio furniture, getting the boat off the lift and on a trailer, and checking what errands we may have to run tomorrow to prepare for any loss of electricity for an extensive time.  We have filled the kiddie pool with water, frozen plastic jugs of water, checked our flashlights, finished all laundry, moved canoes and the kayak to shelter and started to eat lots of food from the fridge.Hubby also made the first harvest of his oyster mushrooms which he \"planted\" or whatever it is you do with mushrooms last spring behind the tool shed.  They are sprouting...like... mushrooms.I checked out the fridge and felt we needed to use up as much cheese as we could in the event we lose electricity next week.  Hubby went to the store for some half and half while I shredded some sharp Provolone, some Fontina and broke up the little bit of some left over blue cheese.  I melted butter along with all the cheese (nice and rich) and when hubby came back I added about two cups of the half and half that he bought..cream would have made thicker sauce, but I do draw the line somewhere.  Then I added salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Once the cheese was melted I discovered that we had a small package of turkey bacon and a leftover package of frozen peas.  I microwaved the bacon and added it along with the frozen peas into the sauce along with the first harvest of the oyster mushrooms which I had cleaned and sliced. I also had a small bottle of white truffle oil which I drizzled over the top...just to make sure there was enough fat in this meal.I cooked linguine al dente.  Then poured on the sauce and hubby \"roughly\" chopped fresh basil as a garnish.  Way too much fat in this soup, but with a hurricane on its way in a few days, I felt justified.   This made up recipe may now become known as hurricane pasta at our house in the future.If you do not hear from me in a week or more...it must mean there is no electricty here due to the storm.  Wish us luck!"},
{"title": "Meet-ups", "date": "Thursday, October 25, 2012", "text": "It is such a gamble when you agree to meet-up with a blogger that you have never met but have followed for several years.  You may know more about them then you do some members of your family.  They know where you stand on politics, religion, and life, because they have followed you for several years as well. You both know where you can agree to disagree and where you can be so totally in agreement that you can laugh out loud.  I guess the only time it would be of concern is if one of you was not very honest on your blog and portrayed yourself as something other than what you are.  (Then to add to the mix, you bravely bring you husband along who has no idea who you communicate with on blogger or even why you do it.  Throw in that fish out of water and who knows where the day will end.)It seems, to me at least, to be the anomaly of blogging.  People are so straightforward and honest when writing to 'virtual' strangers and more reticent when talking with real live folks each day.  Perhaps it is because we have to live or work with those 'live' folks and cannot dare to trample on feelings or embarrass them.  If it goes awry with a Blogger, we just stop visiting and push the delete key on our blog roll.I am sure that professional writers who blog have a much different take on these meet-ups because they ARE the writer. The greatest tension of the day was that we drove up in the new car, the car without a dent, scratch or smudge.  We were going to park near my daughter's house and metro in, but since the cost would be almost the same, we parked downtown.  We found a place to park in the Bowels of Hell.  Behind Union Station and several levels below ground and below the Kaiser health building and the Securities and Exchange Commission is a public parking area, one where you do not have to pay by the month or give up one of your limbs.  It is an enterprise run by a company that parks people every which way and leaves only room to pass by inches in the entry and exit.  $15 for the whole day, which in any city is a steal!  BUT the place is crammed and you have to loan your keys to young men who speak little English and they park your car for you in spaces in underground garages where you never should park a car! It is not without exaggeration that hubby turned over his keys with much trepidation, thinking our little Camry was on her way to a chop shop and never to be seen again.As luck would have it I suggested that we meet at a restaurant that unknown to me had closed a year ago and I left my cell phone in the car in the Bowels of Hell.  What an auspicious (always wanted to write that word) beginning.In spite of errors we successfully met up with Mage of Postcards and her husband yesterday for lunch.  She is an aficionado (always wanted to find a reason to write that word as well) of architecture.  So we met up at the beautiful building of Union Station in Washington, DC which is a little more than an hour's drive from my home.   I recognized them holding hands as they walked through the archway toward us.  They were on their last day of a 10-day trip, and I swear, even though confined to a scooter most of the time, Mage hit EVERY SINGLE place of significance in the city.  And she is not the type who 'scoots' through an art museum, for instance.  She reads up before she gets there and then reads all the information while she is there.  She explained why the netting was stretched above our heads in the Union Station lobby.  It seems that debris may still be falling from the earthquake a few months ago.  Then before lunch ended her husband took my point and shoot camera and showed me a feature that I probably read about years ago and yet never used!  Mage (or as I later learned to call her Maggie) has a newer model of my same camera.  I now have even less excuse for blurred photos.All four of us are talkers which meant there was little in the way of silence during the entire lunch.  We laughed and hugged and people watched and took photos.  An outside observer would think we were long lost relatives who had found each other after decades.  While many bloggers have meetings of each other lots of time, this was only my second meet-up of a Blogger, but I am most satisfied that it turned out much as I optimistically expected and I hope the same for them."},
{"title": "Chinese Apples and Wine", "date": "Monday, October 22, 2012", "text": "The world is a better place due to wineries and I am looking forward to the day when they are available on all country trips...well, at least that is my opinion.  We stopped at this winery in the photo above in the apple country in Pennsylvania last week.  It has only been in existence for about five years.  Yes, my European and South American readers can turn up their noses at this.  We are babies in this industry, at least on the east coast, and  I admit, most of the wines reflect that in lack of sophistication. This winery is called the Hauser Estate Winery and the building itself is brand new.  I was told by the visitors center staff in the town when asking for directions to the winery to look for a lovely building on a hill.  Well, one person's \"lovely building\" is another person's new and somewhat boring rock structure.  They do have the catbird's seat on the hill, though. This view is across an agricultural area known primarily for its apple orchards.  One can purchase a glass of wine and sit out on a very large patio and drink in the scenery along with the fermented grape juice.  They even have shawls and wraps near the door to borrow on cold days.  On our day there was no need for anything but a light sweater.But this post is more about the conversation that I had with the woman who poured our (my) wine.  (They have apple cider for those who want a less strong drink.)  She is the (one of the?) granddaughter(s) of the man who created Musselmans apple products in America, most famously you may know the applesauce.  Her mother and two aunts have built this winery as their new enterprise and 80% of the grapes they grow are used in their wine.  The daughter went on to say that they were moving into the wine industry because it now was cheaper to import apples from China to make applesauce then to grow them in our own country.  It now is cheaper to import apples from China to make applesauce in this country then to grow the fruit in our own country!  We no longer manufacture most things in this country...we don't even grow fruit economically it seems even with the rising costs of fossil fuels!  What would Johnny Appleseed say?  Or, perhaps, he viewed this on a much smaller more personal scale when he took his trek."},

As a matter of fact, my garage door opener fell in my lap while making a turn the other day which was an unexpected startle.  I have to find an auto store to buy a new visor container.5.  I hate more when I lose a thought than when I lose money!  Losing less money and more thoughts these days.6.  I invited two Mormon Bishops for an oyster lunch this past week.  One is a very good and old friend, a former Green Beret and parachute jumper now in his early 70's and the kindest most gentle old soul.  No, we did not talk politics or religion.  It never ceases to catch me up short to find the bravest and most dangerous men are very pure old souls deep inside.7,  I see Halloween and Christmas decorations in the stores everywhere.  Both have become such terribly commercial holidays.  While I am having fun creating photographic Halloween cards, my favorite holiday is still Thanksgiving which is so often overlooked, but has a message that resonates with me.(The photo has nothing to do with this post.  Just wanted to show how rich people can grandfather in stuff and then totally rebuild it.)"},

He asked if I was shopping around and I said, of course!Well, we went to the dealer after working on the museum grounds today and the deal ended up taking half as long as I thought.  Learning how the navigation system, radio, heated seats, gas saving systems, etc. worked took much longer.  The dealer linked up hubby's phone via Bluetooth to the car and now I have dozens of stupid names to sort through in making a call.  Hubby adds EVERYONE to his phone.  (During this week I am going to learn how to delete contacts from the car's database!)   I was encouraged by the salesman to get my own \"Smart\" phone.  I am not sure why I want a phone smarter than me...it hasn't helped hubby much that I have noticed.Anyway, after much training I was finally able to kick both of them out of the car so that I could drive this little beauty home.  I get 60 (90?) days of free Satellite XM radio so I selected a nice jazz station and put the car in drive and enjoyed the ride back to my house.By the time hubby brought home the \"old' car that had been a love only 15 years ago, I had decided we needed to celebrate by eating out.  We headed to my favorite Italian restaurant with him driving so that I could have fun with all the buttons and displays as we headed there.  We had a delicious Italian seafood dinner with several glasses of wine -- me only as hubby does not drink. and is therefore, always the designated driver.We got into the car and both noticed weather had turned colder.  I turned on the heated seats with such decadent pleasure.  I no longer had to wait until my butt warmed where I sat!  On the way home it started to drizzle and in the dark there was some quick discussion on how to turn on the wipers.  Hubby fiddled without success and I directed without solace.  Finally we admitted it was too hard to read buttons on the lever and other symbols in the dark and I looked for the cabin light.  There were a lot of buttons to select overhead.  I pushed a few randomly waiting for light.  Soon I realized as my face was becoming damp that I had pushed open the moon roof in the rain!  I had had enough wine that I got the giggles and it took me some time to find the button to close the roof of the car once again.  We finally got the wipers going and the right station on the radio and began to enjoy our ride home once again.Now for the part of the story that brought us back to earth.  We approached the bridge over the river and noticed traffic was very slow up ahead.  Once we got to the other side of the bridge we saw lots flashing lights and a detour sign.  As we left the bridge to detour from the main highway we were able to see across the median a good sized truck in the ditch sitting cross ways and just a few feet away was a sedan with a crushed roof and covered with white fabric to prevent those of us driving by from seeing the scene beneath the crushed roof as our headlights made the turn.  We slowly passed as two ambulances arrived and the rain started in earnest.We came back to earth with a jolt and hoped those involved would be safe as we were reminded the real reason for automobiles, getting easily but safely from one point to another."},

{"title": "Discussion for the Masses", "date": "Wednesday, October 03, 2012", "text": "I am sitting here in my bed with laptop at hand.  Hubby is waiting for the United States Presidential debates to start in just minutes.  I cannot watch them in real time before I go to bed.  It will start my mind like a squirrel in a cage or a hamster on a wheel and I will be up all night!  Thus I am recording the debate and will watch it tomorrow with breakfast.  I will play the DVD quickly to make sure the talking heads on the news shows do not skew what I am seeing before I see it.The moderator, Jim Leher, is a great old man who has provided many, many years of great news for me.  He gets criticized because he is not aggressive enough.  It appears that many people do not know what the role of a moderator is.  I also think that attitude means too many people think politics is about fighting and the presidential debate is about war.   They just don't get that it is about enlightenment and elaboration, as much as is possible in this powerful environment.Everything is so fine tuned, as I think they had to agree to 25 items regarding the debate.  I doubt it will reveal much that I don't know about either candidate, but maybe they will surprise me.  I also doubt that it will change anyone's mind except for the rare independents who are still undecided.  Got an email from the President stating that he was getting ready for tonight's debate but he would still like me to kick in a couple of hundred dollars to help him win.  That sure warmed the cockles of my heart. How many millions of dollars of negative ads do they think citizens can watch before they totally tune out everything?  It is wasted money.Anyway, below this graph from an artist on that famous Mad Magazine is being passed around on Facebook and I thought it was humorous enough to post regarding the debates.For those who are not U.S. citizens, please forgive us."},

This is an early morning photo from our east facing balcony.  I never saw anyone on any of the other balconies the whole time we were there.  Of course our free condo balcony did face the parking lot!We spent a good deal of our time seeking the shade of trees and buildings and yet I still came back with a really good tan.  Go figure.  The other thing that would draw my eye was the shadows beneath large cactus on hikes.  Sort of a tempting/not-so-tempting approach to sitting in the shade.The other respite that was welcome was spelunking.  Aruba has a number of caves.  It is interesting to see how many people while afraid of the cave residents (rattlesnakes and bats) did not mind \"hanging out\" in the cool shade for a while.  On the other hand, I tend to neither fear nor want to cuddle with either."},

Behind the church was something even more refreshing and inspiring.I do not believe in traditional religions but I do believe in the power of prayer.  I slowly walked this maze and said to my self with each careful step \"Peace on Earth. Goodwill Toward Men.\"   I held in my mind the embassies across the globe with their hardworking diplomatic corps wondering if they will be called home without warning on this day or if they might face a greater challenge through no fault of their own.And then we took a tourist photo for remembrance."},

Parents are now getting renters insurance for their college bound kids because they have so much expensive stuff that they bring to college.  When I went to college we were not even allowed to bring a portable radio.  Times have changed.A Sirs Barbet Capito fitzpatricki  is a new species that was found in Costa Rica this year, actually just this summer!  It is a beautiful bird and amazes me that we can still find lovely new animals this high on the biology tree in my life time as we continue to remove rain forests and mountains to mine diminishing resources. All grant and loan programs from State and Federal governments are socialistic in nature and the job of government (I feel in a democracy) is to provide a minimal social support floor for businesses and individuals.  But it might surprise you to learn that the Energy Loan Program (designed to help businesses fund high risk research efforts for energy resources) was started in 2005 under a Republican Congress and the Solyndra business was number three on the list for funding (high priority) under the prior administration 5 days before Obama took office.  High risk means high chance of failure and even some drug companies get this socialist help.  Of course we heavily subsidize the oil and gas industry and have for decades.  I hope they can soon turn a profit without our help.No matter which president gets elected and which health plan is instituted your health costs will go up.  We are the huge demographic bubble of aging boomers and everyone is going to be stuck with paying for all us old folks going through the health care system before we die, unless they kick us to the curb and the rich are the only ones to get comprehensive health care.  Medicare will have to change.Speaking of being old and penniless, Casanova at age 60 was forced to take a position as a librarian to Count Joseph Waldstein who lived in Bohemia in Castle Dux 60 miles north of Prague.  This castle is now open for selected touring.  Casanova's life, by the way, seems to have been much more complex than just adding up amorous conquests.  And, irrationally,  I have always thought there was something dark and sexy about librarians.Remember those strawberry pots with hanging plants on patios and decks?  Did you know that Singapore is starting a project which will construct 18 supertrees as high as 160 feet with trunks covered with vertical planters that will hold more than 162,000 plants of up to 200 species in a city park?  Above these trunks will be enormous metal rod branches forming canopies to provide shade.  Some rods will be fixed with solar panels to light them up at night.  The highest tree will have a bistro offering a panoramic view of the gardens.  I hope I can go see this someday.I rented The Hunger Games the other day.  I have read the trilogy and liked it well enough in spite of the tremendous violence.   I couldn't help but wonder if conservatives and liberals would see this movie in very different lights, one seeing Sutherland as a Tea Party dude and the other seeing him as a socialist dictator in control of all the money.I am Reading Operation Mincemeat by Ben Macintyre which is the true story of a very complicated British deception plan to fool the Germans during WWII and which worked.  Movies and books have been produced on this true story but I am loving the \"cast of characters\" some of whom we all know that come to light in this version...such as Ian Fleming and that British guy, Leyland, of the cypress tree fame.  I am also Reading A Hope in the Unseen by Pulitzer Prize winning author Ron Suskind which is the story of inner city students and their families in Washington, DC struggling to find their place in society.  It sounds depressing, but it is very well written with realistic characters.  I have met some of these characters in my life and their version of pulling up by their bootstraps is a little different that we know..On a related note, Princeton sociologist Sara S. McLanahan has shown, poverty is what hurts children, not the number or gender or age of parents.And FINALLY, number 13,  (drum roll please if you have gotten this far) back in 1988 it was called the greenhouse effect but the scientist who reported on it over 20 years ago says he would have changed his predictions with what he knows today.  He says he would have made these predictions much more dire with the speed of global warming going much faster than he thought and with much more violent weather and extremes ahead.  (Yeah one of those nerdy scientists that good-ole-boys love to make fun of.)  I am terrified at how expensive insurance on everything from houses to crops is going to become as companies try to pay for these huge weather disasters.  I am terrified about lots of other things about this as well, of course.(I am on travel with my son and future DIL, so no future posting for a while.)"},

There are a few things we have to push him to do and others which we let him opt out of as his days are super scheduled most times.  This generation rarely has time to do nothing.  We give him that and unlike his sister, who has to be endlessly entertained, he can amuse himself for hours with a Lego kit or a craft project.We have a local sculpture garden (out here in the boonies) and they have an annual \"Fairies in the Garden\" exhibit.

Do not let political leaders who state that compromise is a dirty word convince you otherwise!  This hard-lined Congress will destroy this country.I will be shortly saying goodbye to a Republican lady whose work in this community has been substantial.  She is an energizer bunny that few could keep up (grammar folks take a sigh) with.  I know about two of her many community projects that will require two people in each case to fill her shoes.  (I am one of these who had to get a buddy before I would take her place!)I guess what I am trying to say is that we need both sides of the Yin/Yang coin.   We keep each other from going off the edge.  Yes, there are a few issues that require too much tears and anger to discuss, but let us put those aside for now.  Let us just find a middle ground on everything else."},
{"title": "Small Town Politics", "date": "Wednesday, August 08, 2012", "text": "I volunteer at a local museum.  It is small and while important to both the state and county, it has a tenuous State budget and survives greatly with volunteer efforts and donations and fund raising activities.  The 'new' director has been a real force for change in a good way.  Unfortunately, the museum is tucked away on a small spit of land near the shore and tucked between private homes.  When it was built years ago it was not cheek to jowl with the homeowners, but waterfront property is always in demand.  A neighbor, who happens to have been a former state official and county official, has spent much of his time making lives difficult for the museum staff and volunteers.  Using his power he filed a complaint with the county commissioners (some old buddies) that over two dozen pine trees on the museum grounds needed to be removed as they were dropping needles on his lawn and clogging the gutters to a garage...built after the trees were planted.  There is a long and unbelievable series of events that led up to this with the museum making every effort to accommodate the requests of this idiot.  As you can see, these trees have been here a long time.I live in an environmental state where cutting of trees, especially near the water, is rarely granted.  A dead tree or dangerous tree might be given approval for removal, but over two dozen trees...on another's property...never would happen.  I will not go into details about why removal of trees is not good, but trust me, you want to keep as many trees as possible on this planet.  Well, our county commissioners not only granted this permission and pushed the permit office to move the paperwork along, but they had the audacity to require the museum to pay for the 20 to 30 thousand dollars in cost!  Since the museum depends on these commissioners for budget approval, it was in a difficult spot.Many of us were concerned about this blatant abuse of power and finally we went to several environmental groups as well as wrote and emailed the Commissioners' offices for an explanation.I was one of the first emails sent to request politely how this approval came about.  I mentioned my strong environmental concerns and how I had worked hard to keep my shoreline as natural as possible.  I also asked that since my tax money was going to pay for this, why was there not a public hearing?  One of the Commissioners responded almost immediately to my email:\"There is somebody passing along an incomplete story who does not have all their facts correct. May I suggest you go back to them and request they get the complete story before they spread stories?\"  Sent from my iPadThis is jaw-dropping.  An elected official indicating that I go find out the correct facts for myself!  And to go back to the original source.  Needless to say we had gotten a response from the county permit office AND the staff of the museum both officially stating that a permit had been granted (reluctantly) to remove these trees at the request of the Commissioners' Office.  I researched this prior to my email even being sent.  I was amazed that an elected official could be so rude and cavalier and actually lie!  Boy am I naive.  He added in a second email that he was sure a formal report would be forthcoming...in other words 'Don't hold you breath, you stupid tree-hugger.\"Well, as the day (less than 24 hours), passed, these turkeys in office had to back off on the whole thing and the museum was going to be contacted officially this week to learn that no trees would be required to be removed!  I am guessing they were inundated with emails and realized they could not justify this cronyism.I asked my co-volunteers how this idiot got into office and was told that our local Tea Party had worked hard for his election.  Golly, golly am I naive.  I keep forgetting that living in a 'good-old-boy' county is really scary and that I should read the minutes of meetings more closely!I am guessing since I am not a religious person, if God is on the side of the religious right, He may punish me with a hurricane this year or next that will remove all of these trees in one fell swoop...shallow rooted as they are!"},
{"title": "Sunset Cruise", "date": "Friday, August 03, 2012", "text": "For me, this warm month is just the opposite of that physics where the sun hits a balloon and expands it to a nice bold size where it can bounce around with joy.  The sun (and resulting heat) hits my soul and deflates me as if all that hot air (that some might say I have an abundance of and love to share) disappears into the cool air conditioning and I collapse in a semi-coma on the sofa like a limp shadow of myself.  I search about for just the tiniest bit of energy to finish one last chore but every ounce seems to have retreated to the shadows.My husband, on the other hand, is full of energy.  He has so much energy that just sitting still mid-afternoon might give him a heart attack and he cannot bob his foot long enough before he must jump up and begin another task.  He can always find some chore outside that needs to be done and come back in an hour later drenched in sweat looking like an Olympic swimmer with victory all over his face at the success of completing another chore on an unbelievable August afternoon.This week he asked for an evening canoe trip after dinner.  I had put him off too many times and with his birthday (number 69) just around the corner, I knew I had to agree.  I indeed felt too guilty to turn him away one more time.  This wasn't really a 'canoe trip', because he attaches a small wooden transom to the stern of the aluminum canoe and starts a small gasoline motor that moves us through the humid air drying the sweat from our brows as we skim the water.We crossed the inlet of the finger of the river and headed to the open waters where most boats had already reached their home dock in the waning evening.We disturbed two birds (barely seen on the far left of this photo above) as we passed the area of the shore that is an orgasmic retreat for the fossil lovers at our local museum.  The dirt is like cement, so only the most dedicated would dig for fossils here.I was concerned about the setting sun since our canoe cannot be seen by motor boats very easily.  Hubby handed me some bow lights and I spent a concerted effort while bouncing on a small chop trying to attach them under the lip of the bow in front of me.  Finally I was successful and when I tried to turn this red/right green/left light on I pushed and pulled without success.  I called back in frustration after my painful efforts.  Hubby explained with a carefree smile that that he had been having trouble pushing the light switch as well!  So we scooted on into the gray light without lights.We pulled into a quiet beach that was exposed at low tide just to poke and explore and say a blessing for another day.The beach was initially quiet and colored shells and pebbles decorated the shore.I was just beginning to enjoy the end of the day when two energy addicted folks crossed the sunset with more enthusiasm than I have seen in quite a while.  Why am I the only one whose account is empty of energy?I sat on a log and it groaned open mouthed.  No sympathy here.Finally we got the sunset we were waiting for to recharge our spirit.And just like an Olympic warrior in celebration of a great challenge hubby held the torch high as we made our way home."},
{"title": "The Rural Gourmet.", "date": "Tuesday, July 31, 2012", "text": "Yesterday, I had just finished weeding the rain garden on the grounds of the nearby museum, and since I did not look too grubby, I stopped by a grocery that I rarely use to pick up some basic food items. During this quick visit, something caught my eye.  As I passed the freezer cases I saw white 3-gallon plastic buckets of something sitting on the bottom of the case.  My curiosity got the better of me and I paused to read the top of the label and it said simply 'pork chitterlings'.  I was not exactly sure what these are, but I did not think they were probably healthy and I was sure they were a 'southern thing'.  It is a good-old-boy county that I live in after all. If you Google images of pork chitterlings you will get photos of what look like little gray white slimy unappetizing grubs.  If you go further in research you will see that this food, sometimes called chitlins, is pig intestines.  To be a more accurate connoisseur...they are from the SMALL intestine.  Boy that makes me feel mouth watering better.  While I feel free to denigrate this food on my blog and might assume it is the food of poor people since it was given to slaves in our early history,  my research reveals that it is eaten everywhere across the globe.  I know that the French eat strange animal body parts...but this part of the pig is eaten EVERYWHERE!  Yet I still wonder why someone would need three gallons of it!Nutritionally these rubber tubes are high in calories from fat.  What a surprise.  They get a C- in nutritional value but since their preparation requires detailed attention due to the fact they carry salmonella and e-coli, maybe weight issues are of no concern.  After a bit of e-coli, you can be very thin.I did read that in the U.S. a small onion is added to mitigate what might be an unpleasant odor when it is cooked.  Really.  An unpleasant odor...wonder why?  When you have to add an ONION to erase odors...well, enough said!  I do not think I will be eating these in my future.Now before my readers put me in the food snob column, as a small child I loved pickled pigs feet and did eat them as a snack with my dad.  Of course,  we were farm folk and food was never thrown out.  But when the pigs were slaughtered, I am sure we did not eat chitterlings.  We did have our standards."},
{"title": "Bigger is Better(?)", "date": "Sunday, July 29, 2012", "text": "(This post is not about what you are thinking so get a grip, although bigness in certain parts of our bodies is another part of the problem.) I think it is big that has got me in my funk this month.  Everything is big these days...too big.  A bigness that is suffocating in its presence is everywhere.  In America we are big on big.  (I am also not talking about the size of our butts, but that is certainly an area we can claim as big.)  I am talking about other types of big.  Americans go to big box stores to buy...big boxes of stuff that is essential to our lives.  We then buy bigger shelves to store all our big boxes.  When we run out of shelves we rent big walk-in storage units on the other side of town to store even more of our stuff.  Stuff that we will get to someday.  Stuff that we may use someday.Appliances are certainly bigger as is furniture.  We have to have lots of food and then larger chairs to fit those butts in place.  Even airlines are adjusting for bigger weight and bigger butts.Prior to the housing collapse, big houses, called MacMansions and named after the Big Macs of our culture, were the dream to strive for.  I have mentioned before that I live down the road from a lottery winner and I actually think she now regrets her big foyer in her lovely mansion.  She explained to me one day that she feels intimidated when entering her own house!  When I built this house that I now live in, I was a Sarah Susanka fan.  I bought all her books.  She is an architect and the author of \"Creating the Not so Big House.\"  She was all the rage back in 1998, which to me was not so long ago, but to the younger people ages ago. Her philosophy is to build a home that nurtures spirit rather than simply impresses with scale.  She writes about these \"impersonal storage containers\" we build that are \"only the hollowness of the promise of bigger is better.\"  Anyway, I digress.Our American society wants big in each and every way.  Our Presidential Election is now mired in big spending.   The DNC spent 70.8 million by this past June and the RNC spent 38.8 million over a similar time.  We still have months to go!  Figuring in all types of spending from those amazing super PACs on this election and the numbers come close to 2 billion dollars!  Such jaw dropping numbers must fill other countries with terrifying awe, especially since we are in the midst of a global recession.  Imagine what you or I could do with this money to improve the fate of a few citizens or perhaps an entire country!I watched a Sundance documentary the other day about the Barnes Foundation outside of Philadelphia.  This collection of multimillion dollar art had been housed outside the city where it could be available only to those who could appreciate its beauty and rareness as an educational foundation.  The founder and owner was aghast at how rich people used art like wallpaper and he wanted to prevent that by making the art available to small groups of those who truly loved art and keeping it set in a home where it could be savored.  Upon his death the movie indicated that big philanthropists such as Pew and Annenberg (yes those good guys who had wanted to get their hands on this collection for decades) manipulated the system without using much of their money but most of their power to get the collection moved to the city where it could be housed in a new art museum paid for by the taxpayers.  I will not argue whether this was wise or philanthropic, but I will say that they were able to overcome the wishes in the owner's will and the will of those who loved and worked for years on the collection without including them in the decision making process.  They were Big rich, they influenced state politicians, and even though it went to court, they got what they wanted.  They were Big.Do I even need to rant at all on Big corporations?   Time and our sighs as emotional fear has left the building have given us perspective.  We now know that the creation of derivatives, another name for selling junk paper, by big banks and big investment firms, are what brought this country into this horrible recession.  Time has shown that it is not the greed of the home buyers, nor the high pensions of retirees, that caused this debt.  Big Wall Street has gotten off free to continue to find new ways to fleece big money from all of us.  The dirty paper they sold to pension funds as far away as Australia and as close as your nearby city, has resulted in elected officials and board members being fined and/or sent to jail and towns becoming bankrupt, while bankers and wall street paper pushers are left to get bigger.  It is hard to follow the money trail, but it is not the greed of the little guy that started this nor finished it.  And you can complain all you want about the subsidized food program for the poor, but Uncle Sam has made sure that Big Corporations do NOT get cut in this. J.P. Morgan even insults us by outsourcing their management of the Food Stamp phone bank to India because it is cheaper.As far as I am concerned, nothing in this country is too big to fail, and Congress may even make sure it is the U.S. government that goes bankrupt if they refuse to pass budget bills this fall.  I guess they agree with me.  After all, Iceland filed criminal charges against it three Big banks and has come out on the other side way ahead of the Euro crises.    \"But others deem that Iceland’s purge of its financial  sector has been a success. For his part, Hauksson, who hopes to finish  his task by 2015, hopes that Iceland, whose economy is gradually  recovering, will one day “look behind and be proud of being able to  learn the lessons of the past.”As he told Le Monde,  “I don’t know of any similar procedure conducted in anywhere else the  world, and our work has shown the extent to which the banking system  that was put in place was a far cry from what we imagined it to be.\" Now I am going to go make me a small cup of tea...it is 4:30 in the morning here!(I have to really stop writing this way, my followers have begun to drop!)"},

{"title": "Money, Money, Money", "date": "Tuesday, June 19, 2012", "text": "Father's Day shone forth a clean light on my son's immediate future plans.  While we knew he was serious about this sweet woman he was dating, as parents we carefully kept the conversations to the general and casual.  He now admits that he is saving for a ring and will probably propose sometime this fall and wedding plans are most likely to occur around the 4th of July in the year ahead.  While it is a relief that he now discusses these important events so openly with us, I am now realizing I have to plan a budget as I was going to replace my car this winter.For my daughter's wedding (which was a somewhat elaborate affair) we contributed 1/3, the in-laws 1/3 and the married couple themselves 1/3 of the cost.  My daughter's in-laws are New Jersey people and while reality television tends to overdo the colorful culture there, big weddings are a necessity it appears.  Some seemed to feel that the wedding won't hold unless there is a large crowd in a fancy hotel dancing the night away.  Therefore, her wedding was held in a fancy catholic church in Washington, DC (neither hubby nor I are Catholic) and the evening reception was held in a ballroom of one of the largest hotels in Washington, DC.  Hubby and I held the line to the lower end of the 5-figure amount which we donated, as we are much more practical and just couldn't give more without acid indigestion for a one-day ceremony.  My daughter attended another wedding that summer in New York City where the budget for the flowers alone was $50,000!  I guess it is all a matter of perspective and values and disposable income.  At that wedding, with flowers everywhere, I understand both sets of parents of the bride and groom were barely speaking to each other and the priest almost had to perform some kind of intervention.  He actually lectured both parents (in a polite way) at part of the ceremony!  Yeah, there is some satisfaction in the rich being so dysfunctional. Maybe we were just out of touch and each generation is less conservative than the prior.  Lord knows my wedding cost less than $1,000...food, flowers, dress and all.  But I was a poor graduate student and my parents did not offer to help when I told them I was engaged.  Perhaps because I didn't want to spend what little money I had on flying home from Hawaii for a home wedding since most of my (our) friends were there at school and our first jobs were taking us even further out into the South Pacific.  Although I must admit that both of us were surprised when neither of our parents felt they could spend the time or money to attend!  Yeah this IS a tragic story of the strange ways depression era old folks lose sight of what is important, but we survived and still talked to them after we got hitched and our marriage survived without a ballroom and is now 42 years old.  Years ago my sister and her husband eloped to Vegas...so  much for ceremony there.  Yes, they are still married and could actually have afforded a huge wedding as they are both attorneys.Anyway, I told my son we would give him the same amount of money that we gave my daughter and he could use it any way that he wished toward the wedding, honeymoon, or savings for a larger house someday.  Perhaps we should add an inflation adjustment to that?  I try to be fair, but in all honesty my daughter and her husband make lots of money while my son and his future wife do not and I tend to be more sympathetic to that.Hubby and I are comfortable in our retirement and we can be reasonably generous, so with great thankfulness we appreciate our situation.  But I also know that money can be a poisonous thing whether you have it or not."},
{"title": "Falling in Love Again", "date": "Friday, June 15, 2012", "text": "Two days of intense and painful swollen neck glands and a knife sharp pain on one side of my throat when I swallow has been the way Thursday and Friday have gone for me.  Heavy doses of pain killing PM sleep drugs to get me through the two nights.  I am home alone as hubby has headed to the city for a meeting and a doctor's checkup and a toddler's graduation.  Impossible to figure out how I caught this as my exposure to small children was not intimate at the seedling booth that I worked last week and I used the bacteria wipes at the grocery store as I always do...although I did sit with hubby in a doctor's waiting room, but never touched the magazines!I am missing the toddler's (little gal) graduation from preschool with regret but was feeling so sick the regret is small.On the third day I ate a sweet peach for lunch and then took a long afternoon nap.  When I woke at 4:00 PM it seemed the fever had finally lessened and my throat pain was no longer impossible to endure. I could actually swallow without thinking I had a knife plunged through one of my Eustachian tubes.I pulled myself out of bed at long last.  Thinking my weekend visit with the kids coming here may get off to a great start after all. Then just as I stepped out of the shower and dried my hair and put on fresh new clothes my best medicine cure arrived on dancing feet.  My 6 7-year-old grandson who came back with my husband ran into the house to greet me and see how I was doing.  He has lost both of the two front top teeth and both his bottom teeth and this toothless silly smile and lispy dialogue fills me with indescribable joy.We had a 20 minute conversation about the loss of his teeth over the last few weeks,  the economics of the loss of teeth (such as daddy dropping one of the four teeth down the sink and they calling plumber to retrieve the dropped tooth).  I certainly went wrong in not teaching my children how to remove the elbow joint beneath the sink!  Then the next tooth was lost on the playground at school.  Several green bills later the fourth tooth is left with the tooth fairy and grandson has 12 dollars in his bank!!  Then our happy conversation drifts on to Harry Potter and how at 6 he has already read a shortened version of the first book and has brought the DVD with him so that he can finish seeing the visual of the story.  I ask if it is not too scary for him, and he insists he just gets scared at certain parts like where the troll is, but he knows it is just a movie.Then with the twists and turns of magical conversations with young folk we talk about how he used to love Thomas the Train and how that time has passed so rapidly that he has forgotten the names of many of the trains which results in a brief search on the Internet down memory lane.Then as I lay back on my sick bed, not really feeling sick anymore, he heads off to the kitchen where grandpa is making a grilled cheese sandwich with carrot sticks and freshly picked raspberries for dessert and the chore of picking more raspberries after dinner.Remember when you fell in love and you could not do anything without working that person's name into the conversation, or working it into doodle or a daydream?  Well, it does happen again in old age.  I am so absolutely, positively lucky that this young boy has a happy and rich life and that he loves sharing it with me!  I do not deserve this, but I will not give it back!"},
{"title": "Thursday Thoughts  #37 Everything I Need to Know I Learned in My Garden---Thursday 13 Thoughts  # 36", "date": "Thursday, June 14, 2012", "text": "I learned to accept differing points of view but to learn for myself by testing.  One man's weed is another man's treasured landscape plant.  I have purchased beautiful landscape plants from nurseries only to discover that they spread or re-seed like wildfire and then leave my yard to invade the rest of the woods.  On the other hand I have learned that one man's treasured landscape plant sometimes becomes a Prima Donna in my yard requiring too much attention.I have learned to think outside the flower bed and to compromise.  Do I want butterflies or parsley?  If I plant a lot of parsley there will be some left over and then I can have both.  (Now if I can only teach that ground hog how to compromise!)I have re-learned each day that change is inevitable and we all must adapt.  Some plants die, some plants are eaten to the ground and some plants get too large.  Perennial gardens are replete with changes.  Every season requires digging, moving and replacing.Target your enemies so that there is minimal collateral damage.   Picking off a few or spraying very specifically for the many insects such as Japanese Beetles while  carefully avoiding all other insects means less harm to those birds that  are also eating the insects in my garden and less harm to those insects that are beneficial to my garden.I have learned patience.  Plants take a long time to bring forth their reproductive beauty and instantaneous results are only for those who buy annuals in large flats.Keep your place, you are not a miracle worker.  While the intermittently large plant in the foreground adds interest, planting most tall plants in the background allows everyone to show off as is the same with people.  Also, as a gardener, you need to step back once in a while and let s**t happen without beating yourself up over it.  (The voles had a vacation in my dianthus bed this spring and the rabbits have eaten 90% of my zinnias I nurtured so carefully from seed.)Gardening is common ground.  Gardeners are wonderful people and can garden side by side even when on opposite sides of the political spectrum.  Disagreements almost always lead to compromise or changes in activity.Gardening is the only reality show that I like and watch each year.  It can cost money but if you are smart and buy from local garden club plant sales and get freebies from friends, you are more likely to get better and tested plants more cheaply.I have learned that fear paralyzes intelligent action.  Anger has to be provoked and many dangers are not as they seem or as you have been told.  Bumble bees and honey bees and all pollinators are so busy eating that they do not have time to sting unless you step on them or sit on them.  I can reach in and cut all the flowers I want as the bees dance around my arms.  This lesson has broader applications in life.Deciding where to start and how to start your projects are the most important preparations you can make.  Foundation is everything.  You have to know where the sun hits your yard and when and for how long.  You have to know the soil as if it was the back of your hand.  You have to amend this soil because it is the first and last meal for your plants and no soil is perfect.Opinions on style and design don't really matter.  Mother nature can pull together pink and orange and it looks perfect.  Mother nature can pull together large and small, smooth and prickly, and it always seems to fit.Sharing is the richness in life.  If you are lucky to have something to share, be sure and do so.  Pay back is the smile on their face and the bond you have made.  Share your garden knowledge with your grandchildren, share your produce with your neighbors or the local food pantry, share your plants with new gardeners, share your time with Mother Nature.And the most important lesson I have learned is to enjoy myself.  If I feel it is hard work, then I am doing something wrong.  Work should be a little refreshing, shouldn't it?  Maybe I just need a smaller garden.  Yes, mistakes happen. The best thing about gardening is that there is always a do-over next year."},

{"title": "An Obligatory Life Style?...Only if You Cook!", "date": "Tuesday, June 05, 2012", "text": "As I have written about in the past, my close neighbors own a very expensive sail boat which does not get taken out very often.  This summer they are getting ready for a month's sail around the Chesapeake Bay.  Since they are novice sailors this is a good start and I am glad to see they are using this expensive toy more often.  Boats are like fashion models in that they require a certain amount of attention, money and an unreasonable amount of maintenance.We have another friend that lives 15 miles away on the water.  We had not been to visit their home in the time that we have known them but I kind of had an idea that it would be one of those places where various sheds are full of various project supplies, gardens and landscape beds are like fraying patchwork quilts popping up every where and the house would be spacious, welcoming, and needing lots of work.  I was not wrong, except for the rescue cat operation that I later learned about!  Since I am allergic to cats, I sent hubby on the work errand to this house.When hubby returned I asked if they lived on the water.  He said yes and that they also had a boat at dock.  He went on to say that the motor boat was idle and had not been used in years.  It seems that the first time the owner took out the boat he had some problem that had to be fixed.  The second time he had his grandchildren for a boating day in this new boat and did not realize he had to switch on some water pump to keep the inboard engine cool and the motor eventually overheated and they had to be towed back home.  That boat has not left the dock since that event.  This is a more interesting anecdote when you learn that this man teaches classes on boating safety and the rules of the road for boaters!  He has admitted that he actually does not like boating...just helping teach others how to be safe on the water.I often wonder how we get ourselves into these expensive hobbies which we do not really want.  It happens so often to boaters.  People retire to the water in Florida and immediately buy a boat because everyone else has a boat.  They have never been boating but dive in head first (to mix an image) and end up with a headache that taunts them every morning.  Living on the water and enjoying the view does not mean one has to boat or sail.  Living on a golf course does not mean one has to enjoy golf.  Maybe you just like a perfectly \"manigroomed\" back yard view.  Living on the side of a mountain with a snowy view does not mean you have to ski just because all of your neighbors ski.  Surely you will find other things you enjoy with them such as apres ski warm drinks.  Living in the lively city doesn't mean you have to eat out all the time...maybe you just want coffee and like people watching.  Living in the country does not mean you have to farm!I think we try to fit our personal round pegs into those lovely square holes that we find without taking time to test the hole.  We think we need to be exactly like everyone around us.  But we don't.  EXCEPT, I will never understand people who have huge gourmet kitchens with every perfect appliance and tool and yet they rarely cook!"},

{"title": "Pushing Air", "date": "Tuesday, May 29, 2012", "text": "The hot weather arrived a few days ago.  We will still have days of moderate or temperate weather, but the hot and humid days will return again and again until they arrive to stay.  Every year I hold off turning on the air-conditioner until June 1 if I can.  I live in the middle south and our summers are always hot and humid for at least two months.  With global climate change, it will be for three months (or more) in the years to come.I closed my windows to create my climate cave shutting out all the sounds from outdoors.  I lose the bird and animal sounds and the sound of the wind pushing through the fat green leaves, but I do not mind closing out the teenage girl's loud radio that sits on her dock across the river every weekend.  I do not mind missing the sound of the lawn mowers and speed boats and barking dogs.   I do not mind muffling the loud museum concert that is being held just two miles away in the outdoor garden that I help weed!  I live in the woods where there should be little sound, but the water is a perfect surface for carrying the abundance of man-made noise on weekends.Once the AC is on, we become spoiled.  We go outside to work or shop or visit early in the day until the sweat drips from our brows and nose and then we quickly retreat to the cool space of this house and rarely go out again.  We tend to hide and find indoor things to do in the middle of the day.  We get better about combining errands.I find that I must also remember to bring sweaters to restaurants and movie theaters and museums because they crank up the AC much higher than I do.  I am always amazed at the way stores in the beautiful climate of Hawaii find it necessary to create rooms like refrigerators for shopping.When I flipped the switch this year I was even more aware of how big a decision this was.  Even with zoned cooling, I am burning fossil fuels to heat rooms with high ceilings that I rarely use.  I am pushing artificially cooled air down hallways and into upstairs bedrooms.  What a luxury to burn this fossil fuel while people all over the world deal with the climate into which they were born, without AC!  Here in the mid-south people used to quit housework early and sit on porches under fans and pant until the sun set and they could move once again.  What a luxury to be able to afford this expense...for now.  I cannot help but think we as a society in North America are at the peak of of our life style.  I cannot help but think generations to follow will have many compromises to make in how they live their lives that would surprise us if we were here 40 years from now."},

{"title": "Procrastination", "date": "Tuesday, May 22, 2012", "text": "This is such a repetitive theme with my blog that I should start a separate blog devoted totally to how creative or stubborn I can become in putting things off.  (Yes, I know I ended that sentence with a preposition.)  Many of these tasks are so easy, I just do not understand why I set them aside until they create sour thoughts when I look at my lists and they continue to sit at the top of a long list with nary a line through them.  Yes, I am a list maker, but that does not mean I regularly accomplish all on my list.  Some of the items I put on the list because I am a masochist, surely.Cleaning the house items get ticked off cleanly and rapidly.  Bill paying, gardening chores, shopping items are all routinely completed.  BUT, answering invitations (those rare items) to weddings, graduations, and dinners get put off until the very last minute whether I am saying yes or no.  What is up with that?  Why do I find these so hard to complete?Returning phone calls get postponed over returning emails and FB comments every time.AND, of course, anything to do with exercise can be postponed until hell freezes over if my lack of guilt allows.  I have gone through periods of regular exercise activities...free weights, elliptical walking, aerobics tapes (Just the fact that I use the word tapes gives you a clue to how long ago I did that!) and yoga.  I felt so good after doing these each and every time.  But this period is easily interrupted by a trip, house guests, and most recently my ankle injury.  I still do lots of woods walking, but that is the exercise of last resort.  That is the exercise that people brag about...and it really is not exercise.  Admit it.  Do you work up a sweat?  Do you have sore muscles that need to be stretched at the end?  See, it is not exercise.  It is what we do...just like eating.I still have a stiff ankle now and again and I readily use this as an excuse, a weak excuse, to avoid exercise.  I was going to start an exercise routine May 1.  I promised myself.  But then one day it rained and the next day the sun was shining.  OMG it is May 22 already!  Yesterday I ran after two rabbits that were in my flower bed and was shocked to find how strange and stiff running felt!I absolutely must get off this pillow of fat on which I sit...after my second cup of coffee."},
{"title": "Tail End of the City", "date": "Sunday, May 20, 2012", "text": "This famous city was surprisingly clean and non-odoriferous.  At least not lots of bad odors.  Cleaning up car emissions over the years has improved the air in cities everywhere.  There was some noise due to car honking but around Central Park the most obvious noise was bird song!  Birds sing louder in cities and urban areas because they are competing with all the ambient noise.  The sidewalks and street gutters were also clean for such a large and busy city.   I felt very safe almost anywhere I went and we even walked all the way back after our evening dinner without incident.  We passed the Today Show studio and noticed it was directly across the street from a nice bakery.  We made a note to head that way in the morning for breakfast as it would be Sunday and the studio should not be open and therefore not much competition for breakfast.But as they (whomever they are) say...the best laid plans are easily thwarted.  We got up bright and early and headed out only to discover that all the streets within two blocks of that bakery were blocked off.  When we asked if we could head to the bakery a young woman in jeans that were so tight they must stop circulation, barely looked up from her I-phone and said she was sorry but they had just flipped a car.  \"They\" we later learned was the movie crew who were filming  The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, starring Ben Stiller.  My daughter sighed and then said...well he is not exactly eye candy, and thus we walked on trying on her phone to find another bakery, and we did.  We were in New York, after all.  Below is one of the movie trucks although I am sure they have some special fancy name for them like grip wagon.After breakfast we headed out to see the Frick Gallery which had been suggested by blogger guy, Stephen, The Chubby Chatterbox.  This was a perfect suggestion on Stephen's part as it was within walking distance, and I had never heard of it, and it ended up being a gorgeous collection of artwork by the masters.  We were surprised to see the beginning of a line 30 minutes before the museum opened and once inside we learned this was a donation Sunday.  Pay what you want!  I treated my daughter and I and paid the full price because I can afford it and it is a good cause.The museum is a mansion on Central Park once owned by Henry Clay Frick (1849–1919).   I could not take pictures inside, but you can read all about it here.  At the end of this tour we headed out for lunch and found a street-side deli and had sandwiches and were most incorruptible by avoiding all the delicious bakery items in the case by the door. The rest of the afternoon was devoted to street walking and shopping.  Daughter wanted to supplement her work wardrobe and I actually found a very few things that fit me.  Everyone is size 0 to 4 in those shops!  Once I tried on the Large size I actually found something that fit!  Those skinny Europeans do not play fair.We then enjoyed the architecture of the city before catching our train back home.  While there was no time for a show or play, there is always time for another trip in the future."},
{"title": "City Life Part II", "date": "Thursday, May 17, 2012", "text": "My trip to the city was paid for by my daughter.  For those who wondered where I stayed, it was at the Marriott in Mid-town and my daughter used her many points to pay for the overnight bill. My daughter figures that we walked an average of 20 blocks each day...but I think it must have been more.  My ankle did not give me pain although my daughter showed due concern.  My issue was just the old joints and muscles that reminded me I must slow down.  Actually, if I kept walking I was fine.  Once we sat for an extensive time to rest on a Central Park bench both on the Saturday and the Sunday, moving again was a real challenge.  Those of you who are my age realize how your joints fill with lactic acid when you have moved extensively and then refuse to move smoothly after extensive rest until you have forced the walk for another 10 minutes through the stiffness and pain and finally you return to the normal walking mode.We paid for taxies as the day progressed and the deadines to be somewhere else were closing in on us, and these came to an average of about $8.00 each time.The very first visit we made was to the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art because I have been to N.Y. City only twice and never to this museum.  Most of my relatives are not into museums and I have given in to their interests on prior trips.  But Mother's Day was mine!  We saw only a tiny part of this HUGE museum.  We saw the Egyptian special exhibit which was not nearly as romantic or exotic or dusty as when I wandered the museum in Cairo many years ago.   But it was very informative.Then we visited the Dutch gallery, saw some Vermeer, and of course, Rembrandt.  Then a short walk to see the Degas collection.  With over two million works housed here there were so many artists we missed, but we had the audio and those paintings that we actually studied were rich in audio description.  For lunch we ate at the museum 'wine bar\" and had just a salad and wine. The waiting area was filled with shadows and light and created a feeling of magic as if stepping back in time.We waited in the lunch line next to an elderly woman who was alone and nicely dressed.  We got to talking and she explained that she lived near the museum and came often.  When I perused the entire collection in the brochure I realized she could come every day for years and years and never really catch up.  She must have had lots of money because living off of Central Park is not for the middle class and for a brief time I was envious.After lunch, my daughter wanted to peruse the flea market at Hell's Kitchen and this was certainly a dramatic change from the atmosphere at the Met.  It was like going from the Palace to the market place in a medieval city.  She likes to look at antique costume jewelry.  There was lots in the way of junky treasures sitting on folding tables under plastic tents, and even those old pieces that were most intersting could be priced over a hundred dollars unless you were a good bargainer.  We looked at clothing, purses, hats, kitchen ware, lamps, 'antique' books, and junk without definition.  I thought about those men and women who sat each day selling this stuff and wondered if, indeed, it supplemented their disability or social security income.  I also thought about the many prior owners of all of this stuff.  Had they passed on and their relatives sold this stuff or did they sell it because they needed the money?  Or was this stuff found in dumpsters along the streets of New York?  We did not buy anything.This flea market was in sharp contrast to the antique store on 5th Avenue that we had walked through.  Every piece in the antique store was thousands of dollars even though it was at a marked down price because of the store's closing.  I looked at the jewelry and mused (out loud) about what had occurred to force the owners to sell their diamonds and emeralds and rubies and works of art.  The nephew (mentioned in the prior post) chuckled and told me not to be concerned.  Most of these people were trading up for larger pieces of jewelry he said.  I keep forgetting about the 1%.  I am so out of orbit with these folks!We ate that evening at A Voce – the Columbia location, a new Italian restaurant that had a write up in our hotel's brochure as one of the top ten new restaurants in the area.  We were impressed because there are hundreds of high end restaurants in the area to write about.  Alas, I was disappointed in the food.  Al dente was too chewy and nothing was exceptional in my estimation, other than an exceptional 'by the glass' wine list.  Neither of us finished our expensive meals, but I did not complain as this was my treat from daughter.Sunday's activities in the next post...so you can skip this blog for a while if following someone's boring travel is not to your tastes."},
{"title": "Decompression", "date": "Monday, May 14, 2012", "text": "I find it more noticeable the changes in feelings that I have when returning home from a very different place than I am used to.  I no longer adjust with slippery ease.  New York City (and the mid-town Manhattan area where I stayed) is a totally different planet than that in my woods where I live.  The rigid buildings standing high and imposing block all but a few hours of sunshine.  When you think about all the people and all the activities taking place just above your head it is very imposing.  Cars and taxis are moving to \"important\" places constantly.  I also saw my share of stretch limos and a Rolls Royce or two...probably paid for in some strategic way by my tax payments!  I think the magic of this place is the compression of all of humanity in one place...rich, poor, lucky, unlucky, smart, not-so-smart, old and young.Some streets are so full of tourists (everyone else is in in their offices working hard paying for the high rent on the closet where they live) that you can barely pass.  We all seem to adjust as we cross streets, avoid hot coffee and limp cigarettes.  I saw Park Avenue matrons in spring suits walking tiny whippet dogs.  I saw a transvestite or two.  Various gay guys dressed so carefully casual.  Lots of families with strollers.  Mothers and sons and daughters carrying bouquets and lost in the love of their mom on Mother's Day.  The young man below was delivering Mother's Day bouquets to women who lived overlooking Central Park!I saw many people from other countries speaking in languages I did not recognize and wearing clothing styles that were clearly European.  I saw a few women in Burkas and a few nuns in traditional dress.  I also viewed several wealthy Asians enjoying their money spending vacation.  Many typical New Yorkers of every ethnicity working the streets, the cabs, the hotel lobbies, the storefronts with resigned looks on their faces accepting another day, and a few college age couples enjoying spring.  People watching is the best past time in New York.  Every human phenom on the planet is there.  I did not see any celebrities but I am sure some ran past me in sweaty exercise gear.  My daughter and I sat for a few hours on a Central Park bench resting my weary feet and I was fascinated!  As we people-watched we visited with a new grandfather who was touring with his daughter and her new born grandchild from Boston...the conversation was interspersed with that musical accent that Bostonian' s have. I soon learned that you cannot walk more than two blocks before you encounter either building, sidewalk, or street construction.  This city is used to pieces!  But I did find that all the locals whether waiting on me or standing in line waiting with me were extremely polite and helpful.  I did not get the finger once, although I did have to be aggressive with a taxi that wanted to drive where I was walking once!! \"Hey, I am walking here!\"We shopped an antique store that was closing due to retirement of the owner.  I talked to his nephew (my age) who explained his uncle was 88 and retiring to his horse ranch in Ocala, Florida next door to John Travolta.  It appears they share an airplane runway!  I hope he lives a long time.A few places including one on the famous 5th Avenue were empty and looking for tenants. I cannot even begin to think how expensive the rental on this retail space would be...but as the ad tells you...YOU KNOW YOU WANT IT.  And in New York, if you have to ask...you cannot afford it.  More next post."},

{"title": "Standards", "date": "Tuesday, May 08, 2012", "text": "As you begin to read this, please realize this is not a 'political' post.  Many of my American readers will remember Governor Romney's comment where he said he \"liked to fire people.\"  Of course, the Democrats ran with that statement and used it ad nauseum to show how distant he was from the common man.  Those with common sense realize that Mr. Romney did not mean he liked to fire people...he does not have the Donald Trump personality which gets off on making people smaller.  Mr. Romney meant he had no resistance in firing people he hired who did not meet the standards he expected when he hired them. This might be a clue why he and I are different in fair and honest ways.  Recently we hired a small landscape company run by a 'good old boy' to tackle our lawn every other week.  Hubby likes to mow for the exercise, but sometimes it gets away from him if he has to travel or we get busy, so I talked him into hiring this young man and his crew.  They did a good job last year and their weed-eating saved me lots of time and it looked great!This year we signed a new contract with them.  I read it carefully and since they had listed an agreement to mow into November I crossed that out and said only through October.  They showed up the second week of April and did a very nice job.  They are quick and the three of them race through our yard in an hour.  The next time they were supposed to be here they did not show.  The days passed and the lawn got high and the weeds went to seed heads!  I am so clearly a liberal because I thought perhaps they did not really want our contract and they had better money makers on their list.  (Romney would have called and fired them then and there.)  Hubby finally called and he got some whiney excuse from the young man that they had not seen the grass growing much in their area and so did not head to our yard.Well, when they did show up 6 days LATE, the young man admitted that he had taken on a large mulching contract in the early spring and had fallen way behind!  He and hubby talked about how to run an effective business and how to make sure you communicate with your customers.  The young man apologized and admitted he had been completely at fault and said that he did not want to lose us as a customer.  He had looked so different, he had changed his eating habits and lost 60 pounds, which made us even more supportive of his efforts.We are dyed in the wool liberals, because we are giving them another chance.  They are due in two days...we will see."},

My vision:The waters are like a mirror and it is end of a warm and sunny day.  Everything is now being bathed with golden and peachy light.  I see a friend returning in a kayak at the mouth of the river waving and I wave back.  I see another friend tacking his sailboat one last time into his dock.  I hear my grandchildren laughing and running down the hill to join me at the dock in watching the sunset with their parents talking quietly behind.  Birds are still singing but beginning to sing more calmly as they tuck in.  Hubby joins me and brings an iced tea for him and a glass of white wine for me.  We watch the shorebirds begin their flight away to safer areas for the night.  (I also have a nice little mutt that sits at my feet adoringly which is not true in real life.)"},

{"title": "Vanity", "date": "Monday, April 30, 2012", "text": "There are more days lately when I ponder at the strange hands that have attached themselves to my arms.  The skin has thinned around the bones arteries and tendons, and while they do not look claw-like, they are no longer smooth and plump.  They are spotted with liver spots...what an ugly term!  The spots clearly appear on the top half of my hand that would be most exposed to the sun over the decades I have lived on this earth.  They appeared gently a few years ago and now they have settled in and darkened to a nice dotted tan.I remember once shopping with my mother-in-law before her dementia took her personality away.  She was looking for a Porcelana cream that was purported to remove age spots.  I, without any sensitivity, thought it was a foolish project, but politely did not say that out loud and helped find the magic potion.  She was in her 80's.  I was thinking that of course she would have liver spots and she should just accept that!  Why would anyone have any vanity left when they reached their 80's?Now, in my mid-sixties I realize that a little vanity is healthy and an example of how we hope to live longer and to be admired a little longer.  That is only human nature and not a foolish project trying to look younger and healthier.  I accept the fact that only major surgery would achieve any erasing of the years in my case.  A jar of cream isn't going to do anything much but empty my pocket book, but creams for softer skin, gentle coloring for gray hair, careful purchase of bright and stylish clothes that flatter (hide) the gravity prone figure are all acceptable moves.  Even teeth whitening makes one look healthier if it can be afforded.  I realize that who I am in my heart is the most important trait I have.  I also have learned in old age that most of society will not even notice I am in the room unless I speak out boldly to demand attention.  But a little gilding of the aging lily is not such a bad thing, as long as it does not become a blind obsession attached to unrealistic expectations.."},

I do not have to second guess what I will write and how it may affect those of an opposite political persuasion, different spiritual path, or those who are related to me and are just sadly ignorant.Therefore, on this blog I can admit that I am somewhat a ghost of myself.  I was taking photos on the deck with my point and shoot trying to determine what settings would help bring depth to the over the top pink on my geranium blossoms when I noticed that  I had forgotten to zoom and had instead taken a picture of myself!  So for those of you curious as to kind of -  sort of - what I look like, this photo above is for you.Photography and \"photoshopy\" has been taking up a great deal of my time.  Other than bill paying, I spend more time at the computer trying to sort through and delete hundreds of photos that would have been considered good by me when I started taking pictures more seriously about 5 years ago.  Now I have enough experience to see how bad I am and how much I depend on post processing.  Purists will turn up their noses at me, but I have over 6 decades on this planet and no longer care what others think!Above is an un-retouched photo of my pink columbine.  Taken with a telephoto to give it that bokeh effect.  It has spots in the back ground not yet removed and a distracting leaf in the lower right.Above is the same photo with a different texture in the background and with the contrast and hue enhanced.  Both have been reduced in pixel size so they do not fully capture the changes.  What do you think anyway?"},

Smart phone?  Is this like Adult movies?  Reality television?  Fat free?  Free lunch?  Microsoft Works?  Wireless Cable?The phone may be smart, but the user also has to be smarter.  The problem is that my husband has had this phone for about 5 days and it is a nightmare.  It took him the entire day to figure out how to answer the phone and make calls.  It has taken 5 days and he finds the icon with the videos that show him how to use the phone, except the videos go too fast for him to understand them!  I have avoided the phone entirely in self-defense, but picked it up off the table today and asked what the various portholes were on the back.  He said he didn't know and then he picked it up and looked at them closely and said one was the camera lens, the other was the camera flash and the long one on top was the earphone and the little hole on the bottom was the microphone.  I held it to my head to test the length of the microphone and earpiece for my head.  He then inhaled sharply and said,  \"Ah, maybe one of my problems with my calls is that I have been holding the phone screen side to my face when making calls!  I have been having trouble hearing and they have been having trouble hearing me.\"  OMG!!!!Yesterday his 'business' partner who has been lobbying for him to get a smart phone for over a year suggested that he download an APP that allows business conferences among individuals and groups.  This project kept him busy most of the afternoon.  Seems he had downloaded it dozens of times, but couldn't find it.  The download folder is a fairly new concept to him.This is a man who is very smart.  He has several graduate degrees in difficult subjects, has been a fast enough thinker to actually have saved two lives, and has been able to keep track of major concepts when running large meetings.  But he is also the guy who back in the late 1980's asked a colleague how a 'virus' could live in a computer?  He asked if it had found a way to live off the plastic.  He is also a person who finds details chaotic and a bother. I will stick to my old fashioned Razor phone which was all the rage almost a decade ago!  I can rest assured that it is not smarter than me."},
{"title": "Those Good Old Guys", "date": "Friday, April 20, 2012", "text": "Many arguments regarding changes and laws proposed this past few years in Congress have repeatedly been held against the yardstick of the Constitution and measured against what some think our legislators think the founding fathers wanted.  People such as Sarah Palin frequently draw upon the ideas and ideals of our founding fathers (on her part usually inaccurately) for argumentative support for their arguments.  I personally think Bush was far more cavalier with our constitution than Obama could ever be.The latest drama has been the Supreme Court case on the mandate for universal health care.  It was argued so poorly by the White House representatives that I do fear for its survival. Our current President was not the first to propose universal health care.  Before him, key Republicans in Congress endorsed it in 1993, the Heritage Foundation promoted it in 1990 and in 1973, Richard Nixon even considered it.But most recently I have been surprised to learn that such mandates are even older.  It might surprise Americans to learn that our forefathers mandated citizens to purchase weapons for each family.  They also mandated that certain citizens must purchase health insurance!For more information on our forefathers vision you can read here or here."},
{"title": "Never Too Old to Learn Something New", "date": "Wednesday, April 18, 2012", "text": "I have once again conned my husband into following me down the path on a new project.  We are both taking a class on birding given at the local community college.  There are only 5 evening classes and the teacher is a milk-toast (and I say this in the nicest of descriptions) of a little man who actually reminds me of my brother (a former teacher).  Our teacher has experience banding birds and studying birds, but his background must be in something else currently.   Only four students arrived the first evening and one of those students was his wife, so I am letting you know that there are only three students, really, with hubby and I making up two-thirds of the bulk of the discussion.  Small town college stuff! The class has, therefore, become an informal meet-up allowing all of us to share our anecdotes to enhance the discussion as it moves along.  We also discovered that the teacher works just up the road from us on a nearby private preserve of several dozen acres.  We now have access to a new nearby area for exploration, within walking distance.I am a perpetual student and love taking classes if they are more than just philosophical improve your life or spiritual growth stuff.   It has to be something more practical like science, history, literature or art.  I always did love school and my intellectual curiosity has been my passion since I was a child. I loved school.  My husband is most generous to come along on this because he has a PhD in zoology and probably could teach the class himself with a little planning. And yet after the first class and a quick field trip we both have learned to listen better when bird watching and have learned the songs of the little flycatcher and the ovenbird among others.  AND most importantly while practicing what we learned, we have discovered that these two songsters exist in our yard, which we did not know.If you have ever wandered to my other blog, you will know that it contains a number of entries on birds.  I try to study them before I post so that I can add a little knowledge about the species.  So now I can add more fact and less theory?I encourage others to take classes of all stripes as they age.  Even if it is something you know a lot about, the world is changing, we are learning so much more and I guarantee you will learn something new."},

{"title": "In Sync", "date": "Sunday, April 08, 2012", "text": "I am was staying in the hoitty toitty Palm Beach area of Florida.  The mansions are multi-million dollar monstrosities, the shopping is fantastic if you have the reserves, and just outside the luxurious resort areas are some very striking neighborhoods of poverty and crime. Yesterday afternoon, within a few blocks of the infinity edge swimming pool at one of the hotels, stood an inebriated woman dressed for her night work outside a nightclub, if you get my drift.The place where I am staying is a place where people (usually from Chicago or New York) wear rather elaborate jaw-dropping jewelry to the swimming pool.  Their children are stocky verging on fat and have rather intense attitudes about who is in charge of their lives...they or their parents.  Then the parents open their mouths and you wonder where they got their education as well and you forgive the children.  (Sorry for my prejudices.)  Still the place is really uncrowded for an Easter week and my grandchildren can find plenty of room for fun either at the beach or one of the two pools or the playground.  As I sit on the balcony of the condo where we are staying, I have my little grandson who will turn one in a few days in my lap with his heavy head resting against my breasts.  He is fighting stomach flu and lying lethargically with the side of his face tucked into my arm as he watches the waves greet the shore.  We are sitting outside because every time he sees one of his parents he demands they take him away from this old lady, but once they are out of sight, he is my little surrendered lover.  The only sound is that of  the soothing waves and some distant music from the swimming pools fifteen stories below us.  I am enjoying the way he has given himself over totally to my arms in spite of being in that stage where mommy and daddy are the preferred mode of transportation and rest.An ocean breeze floats wisps of his baby hair up and down near my cheek.  I sing a little lullaby and even though I am off-key he looks up at me with such adoration that I keep on singing.  He has that honest innocence of love in his eyes that your dog has when he sees you each day.  The kind of love you probably do not fully deserve, but are more than willing to take.There is a three-quarter moon hanging in the mid-morning sky and the gang of 12 pelicans is making their routine morning rounds up and down catching the rising air drifts over the beach.  We both watch them wishing we could fly like kites up high.I have caught his stomach flu and not been able to enjoy any of the expensive and inexpensive meals we have eaten out.  I have been on a liquid diet for 4 days with no appetite for anything including my favorite wine, but I really do not care when he is in my arms and we are avoiding the beach packing chaos that is taking place back inside the condo.  For this brief precious time in his life and mine, we are in sync and I am totally happy."},

{"title": "Difficulties in Aging---Not What You are Thinking", "date": "Wednesday, March 28, 2012", "text": "Ronnie at Time Goes By and Rain at Rainy Day Thoughts both wrote about aging and all its discomforts and our honesty with that.  So I had to add my two cents.Remember when people carried you everywhere and wouldn't put you down so that you could explore freedom on your own...no?  Well at my age I can explore all I want and society provides artificial joints, walkers, mobile wheel chairs, pain killers and nice level boardwalks so that I can continue to do this exploration and I can do it on my own. Difficulties in aging as a toddler:  I remember when I was a toddler the first time I hit my head on the doorknob, and I realized that getting taller had its disadvantages. The next time I had to wear pants that were too tight and a dress that cut me under the armpits because I had outgrown them overnight.  Now I am only slightly smaller than I was a few years ago and I have stopped growing and I like my height just fine, thank you. I no longer have to worry about doorknobs or clothes.  If I outgrow my clothes, it is my own damn fault.I remember when getting dressed was something that required intense study.  The right length skirt, the perfect blouse, those awful bad hair days.  Those were my teen years.  Today getting dressed is primarily getting clean and finding something clean and comfortable to wear.  I sometimes care that I don't look like a bag lady, but I don't dwell on it, because I do not care all that much what others think about how I look.I remember the strain of new job interviews, the pain of writing proposals, the agony of public speaking, the careful dance of arguments with colleagues and the constipation of biting my tongue during my adult years when dealing with a crazy person in the office.  I no longer worry about any of that stuff.  I will not argue with you if I think I cannot win you over to my way of thinking, but I also do not hide my beliefs nor fear them.  I will also listen to your side because I also do not think my beliefs are carved in stone.I remember the agony of watching my children grow and leave me to pursue adventures of their own.  The sad dullness of an empty house and my being fired as a parent.  That was a real difficult age.  I have out grown that agony and in these elder years I find I can accept the fact that I must allow my children to make their own mistakes and live their own lives, because that is what I wished from my parents.  I also welcome all the free time I now have.I remember during my 50's the concern and a little dread about aging and the difficulty of looking into those elder years ahead and becoming an old person who would have little to do with their time.  Now that I have arrived here, I find it is just like being a younger person.  It has its challenges and rewards and it is what you make of it.  Some of the challenges can be overcome and others must be accepted with grace and compromise, like that teenage figure you were given.  And the rewards at this time in my life are are a morning sunrise and and an evening sunset and all the time in the world to enjoy them.So difficulties in aging are just a part of life at any age and if we did not have them, I am thinking we would not enjoy life nearly as much.I saw an interview with the poet, Christian Wiman, who was diagnosed with a serious cancer in his 30's and I was amazed and pleased by the grace that he shows day to day.  So difficulties must be handled at every age.  Quit your whining."},
{"title": "The Mystery of Mist", "date": "Sunday, March 25, 2012", "text": "Once we have checked out how the garden is doing and put to permanent sleep the weeds that have been awakened by spring we sometimes get the urge to take a drive and see how the rest of the land is doing.We went for just such a drive the other day (the day I took those peach blossom photos in the orchard that I posted on my other blog) and as we headed across this large peninsula to the side that greets the large bay we noticed the fog had banked inland and was holding its own even though the morning was waning.  Since it was just before lunch we headed to a little town down the road. A heavy fog rolls in off the bay on many of these spring days as the night air is just cold enough to capture the water and hold it, and if there is no wind, the mist just floats around hiding the corners of life.  This white cloud gets a short way inland and then the heat of the land and/or the heat of the sun seems to make it melt before our eyes.This little town we reached was once an escape for city folk who were tired of summer heat and wanted a respite by the shore.  There is a small beach here and several nearby marshes that are just perfect for a change from city life.  It is still a tourist town, but the ability to travel greater distances to much larger beaches has pulled most of the tourists further away from this area, and I think that has helped this little community retain its charm. The horizon line of the bay was hidden by deep fog and yet the warmth and quiet of the morning brought people out.  Various water birds were enjoying new algal growth or building nests. There were two naked toddlers playing at the edge of the water under the peaceful eyes of parents.  Three ladies sat in beach chairs and chatted quietly while one knitted.   And, of course, there were lots of dog walkers.We took a walk along the newly constructed boardwalk beneath the spring blossoms of various trees and enjoyed the magical mist along with several others who had taken the morning off.  As with most small towns that have not yet been drowned in tourism people were ever so friendly and smiling.  We greeted them and patted their dogs on the head, commented on the strange weather, and talked about the good old days, even though we had shared different good old days.  It was lovely with temperatures in the 70s.  We had lunch at a small table just outside one of the local restaurants that was close to the local Post Office, which of course, provided us the perfect \"Andy from Mayberry\" experience...just thought I would share."},

The call of the brotherhood is stronger than anything else.  This is what war does to these brave young men.Years ago I saw the movie The Hurt Locker which is a war movie created and directed by a woman.  It was a compelling movie to watch because it has a very different and more nuanced approach to the characters in the movie and the reality of war.  I remember a scene without dialogue where the protagonist who is on leave stands in a well-stocked store aisle looking for something on his wife's grocery list.  He just stands there as if looking at thousands of brands of the same product and as if he cannot possibly make such a complicated decision.  His brain just shuts down.  He finds himself in a surreal position.  He is OK with diffusing bombs but deciding on laundry soap is too crazy and too frivolous a waste of his time. He loves his family but grows more attached to a young Iraqi boy in the village where he is stationed.Clearly this Roger Bale's brain just shut down over something else on his 4th tour to this area after being wounded twice.  War is hell and I continue to wonder about all those young men that will return in the coming year who have had their senses honed for battle and we ask them to return to a 'normal' life."},

I did have a little transistor radio (the size of a deck of cards) that I got from somewhere and I would listen to it at night when I did my homework.  The very first performers that caught my imagination were the Everly Brothers.  They would become a little too country for me as I changed toward more \"sophisticated\" tastes.   But at the age of 12 and 13 I could listen to them forever and just fly on that harmony...and I think it was years before I even knew what they looked like. Their harmony was stupendous to someone who was from a non-musical family.  I listened to the Beach Boys and while I liked Elvis, I was not crazy about him.  When the teenage generation got to have their own TV shows such as American Band Stand and Ed Sullivan, I was introduced to Paul Anka, and those great musical icons, The Beatles.  Holding the core of the pure liberal that I was destined to become I eventually moved on to loving folk singers and those with a message like Simon and Garfunkel,  Joan Baez and the Mamas and Poppas.   If you stroll down your musical memory lane, who was the first group or singer that captured you as a teenager or pre-teen?Boy does THIS ONE bring back memories.  Yes, it is a little hokey and unsophisticated by today's tastes.  But that harmony is an endless reward."},

{"title": "My Little Corner", "date": "Sunday, March 11, 2012", "text": "When I built this expensive house (while I am not part of the 1% I did save substantial money by living overseas for several years) I knew that I would probably want space for a few indoor plants.  I included a corner at the end of my kitchen that had a strip of tile next to the wooden floor for protection.  The windows in that corner do not have the glaze on them that filters full sunlight and protects objects from fading.  These windows while double glazed are just plain windows.  They face the Southwest side so that my plants get plenty of winter sun.  In a few weeks when the dangers of very cold nights are gone most of these plants will head outside.  The amaryllis will be done blooming and will be tucked away in a place below the deck but near my patio where they will remain unnoticed until I bring them in for a dormant period in mid-October.  They are removed from their pots, the soil shaken away and the bulbs put in black garbage bags and kept in the coldest part of my basement until January where I start the process all over again.  This year because of my ankle injury I was going to abandon them totally, but hubby generously planted them out and while I would have selected other pots, he did a good job as I have beauteous blooms this time of year.  (I still have the other tropical bulbs in the basement waiting for freedom!)The tiny tree in the middle on the top shelf is my calamondin lime tree.  I replaced it last year as the one I had purchased a few years ago was stressed in some way and the roots never grew.  The other large tree on the right is my kaffir lime tree.  One of the most interesting plants.  I use both the limes and the leaves in Asian cooking.  It does need full sun through the winter and is somewhat temperamental, but you can see it is going to overtake the space.  In the late spring it goes out on the deck.  I protect it with cloth for a few days so it can adjust to the more intense light, but it eventually adapts and enjoys the summer months.The jasmine in the white pot was a sale purchase for about $4.00 and looked really sad until I revived it.  I don't think the little white blooms are fragrant enough unless you really get close, so it may be a sale item for the Master Gardeners plants sale this spring.The ugly grasses are lemon grass which my husband insisted on wintering over.  I find that cooking with lemon grass is a real challenge as ones that grow in this climate are tough and not as flavorful as they are in the tropics.  These two will go outside into the garden next month and they will take off like gang busters, but I am still lobbying for their demise in the fall.The lime green pot contains a geranium.  They are easy to purchase new in the spring, but I always save at least one for the winter months and pinch it heavily to keep it from being too spindly.Hidden in the back on the bottom shelf are my succulents.  They survive very well if ignored.  They will go outside soon.  Then this corner might return to an area for a summer buffet table.  (You know, like on Downton Abbey...a side board where hot breakfast waits for guests...yes, I am joking here.)"},

I did get out one warm afternoon to prune my roses which were beginning to leaf out.  Of course, my foot has made me be cautious and as immobile as possible in the house and I have been amenable to that excuse.  I have heard too many stories of people falling and breaking something else when wearing the boot!  AND I really want it to heal, but there is nothing on TV (rarely is there ever) and I have almost finished reading \"A Thousand Acres\" and my own novel is stuck on Chapter 6 already.The person that I am trying to interview for the Master Gardener program has not returned my 4 phone calls...guess that is a wash and I will not try to take it personally.  One of my neighbors called to see how I was and my hubby's hostess in Florida and I had a nice chat, but my voice has not been used for much else these last 10 days.The days are so gray that photography is only an ambition.  Even the sunsets are silver at night. I have had so much time to bird watch that I can tell the difference between the various tufted titmice that visit the deck feeders and almost have reached the stage of giving them names.  One has lost his tuft.  He looks so effete and lonely and I wonder where he misplaced it.I bought the movie \"The Way\" on cable and it is a nice ride (walk) through Spain/France with Martin Sheen.  His sons are very talented...even the one with issues.  I have watched two different versions of  \"The Phantom of the Opera\" on TV and listened to every Keb Mo album that I own all this afternoon.But too much of a good thing is really too much of a good thing.  (Why do I think I have written that before?)"},

It was originally set out by Frigyes Karinthy and popularized by a play written by John Guare. \"   More on this statistical premise can be found here.Grannieannie posted that her Goddaughter was once again attending the Oscar ceremony and that she would be watching TV to see her.  This got me thinking about the 6 degrees theory. I live in the woods.  Just outside my woods about a mile away is a small shopping center that has the  name of my town because it has the Post Office.  Just 4 miles from there is a little seaside tourist town...very little.  Across the river is another town supported by a large military base, but consisting mostly of strip malls and chain restaurants.  None of this area suggests a sophisticated community.Two days ago while getting my hair cut in a walk-in shop my young white hairdresser was talking about the death of Whitney Houston.  She said that she had cried for the entire day.  While I was a little concerned about her stability she went on to explain that she was a high school friend of Toni Braxton and still emailed her on a regular basis.  She said that Toni had her issues with fame and fortune and that my hairdresser was concerned about her sometimes.  When I went home and did some research, I found that Braxton had indeed lived in a small town not too far from here.Last month I ate dinner at a friend's house and while we were enjoying his grilled oysters he asked us if we had seen the movie with Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock titled Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.  I explained that since it was about 9/11 I still could not see movies on this quite yet (if ever).  He then went on to explain that the young boy with the major roll in the movie was the son of a close friend of his in California and had literally fallen into the role, and therefore, they felt some obligation to see it.This next is not a true 6 degrees because I did not know someone who knew someone...but a few decades ago I spent an hour with Morgan Freeman watching a street show in Bermuda.  We did not talk to each other but did smile and enjoy the music together and did stand \"incredibly close.\"  I recognized him from the Public Television show Electric Company...and although he had started acting he was not nearly as famous as he is today.Here is a true 6 degrees and only two degrees.  My daughter and her husband did have a leisure dinner with Rob Lowe and his assistant about a year ago.Do you have a 6 degree's anecdote from the entertainment industry that you would like to share?"},

The room was filled with young music, beautiful young girls eating dinner and being waited on by handsome male waiters, some of whom most certainly should have been gay, they were so perfect in appearance.  The food was excellent!But as we left Charlotte that Sunday and since it is an 8 hour drive for us, we had to have lunch mid-way somewhere.  We stopped at some chain restaurant whose name I do not remember.  I had been eating heavy all weekend and chain restaurants are not known for their healthy food.  Therefore on one of the sides to my fish dish I ordered veggies and dip rather than fried rice, french fries, etc.  The waitress a short and stocky black women looked at me and smiled.  \"You don't want that.  Are you sure?\"I asked her, \"Why not, were the veggies old or something?\"She replied, \"No, but it is just raw vegetables with ranch dip.  You REALLY want that?\"\"Yes,\" I replied.\"Are you sure?\"  she repeated.  Then she made a face and said, \"OK.\" as she wrote down my order.I do not mind wait staff telling me about problems with certain dishes based on their opinions, but critiquing my taste in food is something else."},

Some of us have the time and interest to create meme challenges, award icons and links to those posts we read that impress us.  That keeps the soup stirred so it doesn't burn and also helps us meet each other.I am off on a trip to Charlotte, North Carolina for an early Valentine's getaway and will complete the drawing and announcement on the prior post when I return.  I only got a dozen blogger's interested which may say more about my photography than it does about interest in my blog!  Oh well, I am not going to dwell too long on either painful thought.  Play nice while I am away."},

Notice the solid construction, the sleek lines and the fancy accessories and stitching.  Needless to say I only bought one and actually Medicare paid for it...after waiting for 15 minutes for my doctor to call the powers that be and get permission.  Last year my insurance would have covered it without incident, but now that Medicare must be my primary insurance I must be more suppliant.This is the air pump that makes the boot customizable.  Now, since I actually own this piece of crap stunning hardware/software, I am thinking of going to the store for glitter paint and flower stickers to customize it even more.  I have to wear it for (at least) the next six weeks.  I am soooo excited.  Imagine all the small talk conversation starters I now have!  Imagine how many times I get to tell the same story over and over and over!  And even better, wait until my children see this and begin the lecture of \"I told you so!\"  I am not telling them.  Although my ever so honest husband will delight in sharing the news.Okay...enough complaining.  At least I have avoided any surgery and/or the worse-case-cast."},

{"title": "It  Is Complicated", "date": "Tuesday, January 24, 2012", "text": "While cleaning out my closet after the painting fiasco I came across my soapbox.  It was a little dusty, so I cleaned it off and now that it looks so shiny and sharp I must stand on it for a bit.  Go get something hearty to drink as I would like you to be polite and listen through to the end... I am waiting... Go on, I won't fall off this thing.  I do have a lot to say.  (If you do not live in the U.S. you can go finish your laundry now and come back another day.)Liberals are happy that we have a president who is cool and intellectual and who will not start a war if he can negotiate or spy his way out of a situation.  Conservatives want a president who has their back 24/7 and is not afraid to say so.  They like the fact that Rick Perry carries a loaded gun when he jogs.  You can never be too ready to kill something.  It would be so easy if we could always tell the good guys from the bad guys and if all we needed was a Sheriff.The problem is that this is not the issue that will get us out of our mess today.  There is not a president that we would elect from either party or even an independent who would not go to war and protect us if necessary.  The defense department is ready to defend us at any cost and reminds the leader of the free world of that everyday.  Of course, I believe that starting some of these wars at any cost could lead to the destruction of the planet since a lot of hot heads are waiting for an excuse to defend their country against the \"Imperialist America\" and they now have the means to do so.  War is never a solution only a regret.  It is complicated.But what about our internal enemies?  The real battle is that between the haves and have nots.  And I wish it was just the simple picture that the 1% versus the 99% argument seems to try to make.  It is not.  Jobs cannot grow without substantial compromise to the environment,  to workers health, and to reduction in regulations.  There are just as many CEO's (percentage wise) who care not one bit about their workers safety, job security and health, and who cheat each day as there are workers who put out the minimum at work, game the system, steal from the job and scream discrimination when they are fired. There are those in the 99% who will only take the job they were educated for and there are those who are so lazy they live off their relatives and what welfare they get ( I am related to someone who does this.)  Mitt Romney, whom Newt Gingrich  Perry called a \"vulture capitalist,\" was doing the job he was paid for and doing it very well and it appears legally.  He worked for the stock-holders and he made them money.  It was not his job to create jobs.  It was his job to reduce costs, labor being a big one.  And we could argue all night about how patriotic it is to game the system and keep your money off-shore to avoid paying your full taxes.  But he played by the capitalist rules.  It is complicated.All the rest of us who are in the majority in both classes have to decide if we will trade a little more polluted air and water for warmer or cooler homes, cheaper food, cheaper clothing and products and the ability to keep one more job in the families of the 99%.  This decision is very hard, because those of us who make it will probably not see or be affected by the increased pollution.  It will most directly impact those we do not know, and our unborn.  We have to decide if we will pay more (in taxes or direct costs...it makes no difference) so that everyone can get health care in the wealthiest country in the world.  Or we could lobby our Congressperson to pass a law that says hospitals do not have to take in accident victims or dying people if they have no health insurance.  I wonder if those who took the Hippocratic oath would turn the dying away if it wasn't against the law?  I wonder if we could sleep at night with people lying hopelessly at the doorsteps of hospitals as happens in many third world countries currently?  Or we could compromise our freedoms and require everyone who can afford it, to buy health insurance, so at least we do not have to pay for them!  It is complicated.I believe that anyone who is financially secure should not take social security, but I am only financially secure as long as Wall Street does not allow their greed to bring the stock market to it knees once again.  This can only happen with strict regulation of financial markets by government bureaucrats.   I will be dependent on Social Security if these regulations are not held, but I am among the 99% when it comes to having a voice in lobbying Congress about the banking and investment industry.  My voice is tiny until we have financial election reform and EVERYONE gets an equal voice.  If you think anyone, including the Koch Brothers or Greenpeace, lobbies just for your interests, boy are you so very wrong.  I also believe that the age should be raised on Social Security to keep it solvent as our life length has changed since it was created, but I did not perform heavy lifting, work at furnaces, or perform other hard physical labor into my late 60's and I have no injuries from that.  So this also is complicated.  I do not think Social Security should be abolished.  It works.  It has kept society secure.With a nod to that crazy old anti-Semitic running for office, I believe that foreign aide should be reviewed, but as public television reported recently, 94% of money put out by USAID comes directly back to American companies and contractors. Thus, it seems we also game this system, and reducing foreign aide could reduce jobs in this country.  Much of our foreign aide is hidden through Defense spending and dare we review that?  There is a reason that the Washington, DC area and surrounding suburbs are more recession proof and it is not because they house government workers.  They house lobbyists and those contractors they work for who get paid in Federal dollars.  And, of course, we cannot forget the call for smaller government.  County? State? Federal?  I was a bureaucrat for many years and through much more than a decade we created smaller government by attrition.  It is not the best way to reduce labor, but as people left or retired no one took their place, and if the job was important, it just went on the back of someone else who did it half as well, overburdened as they were by the prior year's attrition.  This is why no one answers your phone call, or if they do, they seem inattentive.  When we finally got down to a skeleton crew and it began to impact service we were allowed to hire contractors.  Mine was not the rich Defense Department, and therefore, our contractors were somewhat like slaves.  The money went to the lowest bidder which meant the contractors made less money, got far fewer benefits, were laid off at will and we slowly developed a culture of them and us.  Not the best atmosphere for service to the taxpayer.  There is a better way to reduce government.  The Department of Commerce, the one of the three(?) that Perry wants to abolish, claims that its job is to improve the economy and help create jobs.  Ironic that we would cut that department, is it not?  Actually, this is one of the few areas that I agreed with Perry.  Commerce has grown into a mess and could certainly be reviewed and re-organized under other departments, although I am betting that Perry and I would probably disagree substantially on the details.  And Perry is not really a detail man anyway!I believe that the majority of us, rich and poor and in the shrinking middle, do want pretty much the same thing and we care about our brothers and sisters when we see them as the human beings they are; so we better tread very carefully in this finger pointing and name calling.   Neither skin color, religious affiliation, nor the size of the house you live in tells us about your honesty, willingness to work hard, or moral character.  Only how you have lived your life and how you now live it everyday tells us that.  (And if you claim that your God thinks you are special and tells you things clearly and directly, like who or if you should run for office, you are a very scary person to me.)(P.S.  Yes, I know that Perry is no longer running for office.  But with all the 'colorful' GOP candidates this year, I could not exclude him from this one post.)"},
{"title": "Watching Paint Dry", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2012", "text": "My recent weekend consisted of bringing home paint chips from the hardware store, putting them against the wall of my master bedroom and agaisnt the oriental rug on the floor, deciding on a hue, purchasing a gallon of the best quality paint they had and painting the bedroom.  (Cannot get in to see the ankle Doc for another week...so ankle be damned...and it was.)My house is five years old.  It has settled somewhat on the bedroom side.  There is a slight chance it would settle further down into the ravine...but I am optimistic that won't happen while I live here.  But settling does create hair-line cracks around window frames and doors, and last year, my husband, who became frustrated with my putting off the painting project, proceeded to patch the cracks with Spackle.  Then he went to the basement to get the then 4-year-old paint that we had used when the bedroom was initially painted and covered all those nice white patches he had created.  The paint had changed, of course.  It looked like he had painted over with a color that resembled old poo instead of soft mushroom.   We lived with that ugliness for a year and finally this past week went through the process I described above.We guessed that painting the bedroom would take about 4 hours.  Ha!  The bedroom has 6 windows, three doors, AND most significantly a tray ceiling.  The painting took almost seven hours and I am not counting the day before when we moved furniture, covered what we could not move, rallied the various painting tools that we had left from our prior life of painting various rooms in homes, removed electrical and phone plates, and taped every single piece of wood framing with that blue stuff.  That prep wore us out and we retreated to the living room for dinner and movie.The next morning fresh and energetic we began what is referred to in painting circles as 'cutting in.'  It was a cloudy day making it very hard to tell what we painted and what we didn't since the old hue and the new hue were pretty close in color.  I am also old, and do not see as well as I used to.  But the most significant issue with this project is that this new paint would dry to touch within a minute making it so much harder so see where I painted and where I had left off in the gray shadows from the window.  The only clue was that I had purchased a slightly shinier finish of paint this time and if one stood at an angle to the wall, one could see the difference.  Thus we painted, and then re-painted, and ate dinner and then went back in and touched up a few more places as the lamp light revealed a few more areas of incomplete coverage.Finally we felt we had finished, cleared the room, washed the brushes, put everything away and fell exhausted and with stiff joints into bed.  The next morning as I sat in bed greeting the new day (you KNOW what I am going to write here) I saw two more small areas at the base of the side wall that needed touch up!  Fast drying paint is not all it is cracked up to be."},
{"title": "So WHAT Is It, Really?", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2012", "text": "A photo of a nearby shoreline tweaked with filters and tone and lighting manipulation.Yes, in answer to some questions, the photo in the prior post was my lovely granddaughter.  I captured her in the middle of a hide and seek game where she was hiding under a ladder in a playground and her innocent childhood personality was revealed like shining silver in such a photo.  I tweaked it somewhat...making it more of a \"work of art\" than a snapshot and putting more light on her face. Friko, one of my favorite bloggers and a real artist in her own right with her writing, commented on Downton Abbey, which both she and I like to watch.  She felt it was not really art because it did not make you think.  I am so glad she stimulated some discussion with this comment because her comment \"made me think!\"  She felt that the TV series lulled the viewer into a false sense of security.  I disagree because the change that war brings and the events that happen in this next season take away the security of constancy for all of the characters.  I also think that writing about this time in England with rose colored glasses instead of raw reality glasses is more enjoyable for viewers and those poor souls who think this is an accurate representation of the time may also think Picasso's horses reflect a reality.I then went on a hunt to find definitions for art, because there are almost as many definitions and quotes as there are works of art and this will fill up the rest of this post nicely!  And if you are good and read to the end...that is where I put the funny one.Without art, the crudeness of reality would make the world unbearable.  ~George Bernard Shaw Art is not, as the metaphysicians say, the manifestationof some mysterious idea of beauty or God; it is not, as the aestheticalphysiologists say, a game in which man lets off his excess ofstored-up energy; it is not the expression of man's emotions byexternal signs; it is not the production of pleasing objects;and, above all, it is not pleasure; but it is a means of unionamong men, joining them together in the same feelings, andindispensablefor the life and progress toward well-being of individuals andof humanity.  Leo Tolstoy. Art is the product or process of deliberately arranging items (often with symbolic significance) in a way that influences and affects one or more of the senses, emotions, and intellect. It encompasses a diverse range of human activities, creations, and modes of expression, including music, literature, film, photography, sculpture, and paintings. The meaning of art is explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics, whereas disciplines such as anthropology, sociology and psychology analyze its relationship with humans and generations.  WikipediaPainting is just another way of keeping a diary.  ~Pablo Picasso Science is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon eternal truths.  Art is out of the reach of morals, for her eyes are fixed upon things beautiful and immortal and ever-changing.  To morals belong the lower and less intellectual spheres.  ~Oscar Wilde, The Critic as Artist, 1891The aim of every artist is to arrest motion, which is life, by artificial means and hold it fixed so that a hundred years later, when a stranger looks at it, it moves again since it is life.  ~William Faulkner  (I particularly like this definition.)We all know that Art is not truth.  Art is a lie that makes us realize truth, at least the truth that is given us to understand.  The artist must know the manner whereby to convince others of the truthfulness of his lies.  ~Pablo PicassoAnd, of course, from my favorite cynic...I so glad she does not live next door as I would almost immediately quit blogging and taking photos:   Very few people possess true artistic ability.  It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort.  If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass.  ~Fran Lebowitz"},
{"title": "Art Is a Three Letter Word", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2012", "text": "Photography, painting, music, and writing all fall under the domain of creative art, and therefore, are covered by the term \"artistic license.\"  According to Wikipedia (not exactly recognized as the final or most accurate word on such discussions) artistic license is:Entirely at the artist's discretionIntended to be tolerated by the viewer (cf. \"willing suspension of disbelief)Useful for filling in gaps, whether they be factual, compositional, historical or other gapsUsed consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally or in tandemI have been thinking of this as I take more photographs and tweak them away from accuracy in what I actually saw and as I continue to struggle at writing my tome about an archeologist in Australia.  (I have made it to Chapter 4, but since I am just now writing a chapter outline...who know what number this chapter is?) This question also came to my mind when I read a scathing review in one of the national news sources about how pathetic the currently popular British television series Downton Abbey was as a fictional series.  The reviewer felt it was not historically accurate enough to portray the time period and the dangers of such a class system.  I view it as a wonderful soap opera and do not need all the realism of that time to enjoy the series.  Yes, there was more disease, dying, poverty and cruelty during that era,  but I just want a good story with interesting and stable characters.  Let the writers take their artistic license.After all, art is in the eyes and ears of the beholder.  The result being that I am amazed at what passes for art these days and how people compete to spend money on it.  But as was discussed in a New York Times article, the satisfaction of being the highest bidder gives more credence to the artwork than the actual enjoyment of the artwork. Is Damien Hurst really an artist?Or is this collaborative project actually a form of art at this museum ? What about Isaac Layman and his photography?Or  this, the worlds most expensive photograph?All of the above brings me to the big sigh about those artists who were never recognized by any marketing machine and are lost in time.  Street artists whose art appears and disappears daily, women artists who worked as nannies and died in poverty with their photographic art destroyed, soldiers whose writing was lost in the dust of battle.  Does it have to have an appreciative eye or ear to be art?  I do not believe that it does.  It just has to have the passion and soul of the artist."},
{"title": "Good News but Mostly Bad", "date": "Friday, January 13, 2012", "text": "Well, I have gotten the results of my X-ray and MRI.  My ankle was healing as I was taking long walks, but there were days when it felt stiff or a sudden movement would create deep pain.  I wanted to have the option to get back into yoga, aerobics and other exercise.  I am not a lean mean exercise machine, but I go through phases of loving or needing it before I become a slug at intervals.  This interval has been WAY to long.The results are that there is a small piece of bone that has broken from some part of my ankle, one of my ligaments is torn and I have some bone edema (swelling...maybe due to another tiny microscopic fracture.)  After hearing the report (via the phone and read in total technical terms by my idiot doctor with little sympathy in his voice).  He seemed relieved to have to make a referral.  I have been referred to a podiatrist who will look at the X-ray and MRI results and tell me what has to be done.  I currently have no idea what he will say and I am sure that it will take more than a week to get an answer.I do know that my GP said to hold off on any exercise until I talk to the podiatrist.  Egaw!It amazes me how in this time of my life I am thinking impatiently of all the time I will lose if they have to operate or do something invasive.  I do not fear the pain, but I hate the thought of mobility loss during what time I have in this life.  I hate thinking of having to wait for a healing process as I sit in a chair or on a bed.  Clearly I have no patience for this and that is why I tried to avoid the situation in the beginning by avoiding the doctor.  Please don't lecture me.  I know that I am stupid and stubborn, but for many people (like some of our GOP candidates) these are good traits.Well, got that off my chest.  I feel guilty in saying this to anyone close to me, and my blog readers are a great sump for stuff like this. Please note that I get around very easily and can do most things I have done in the past before the injury.  This could be much worse, and I am fully aware that I have so much to be thankful for."},

{"title": "The Fly--not at all in a Holiday Mode", "date": "Friday, December 23, 2011", "text": "Just like that aberration in the same-named movie, the fly started annoying with a soft buzz on her right side.  She had just settled down to read before bed.  Cushions had been propped carefully, the comforter tucked across her legs and lap and the book in the perfect halo of the lamp.  The room was cozy and quiet...except for that damned fly.  He was closer now.  She heard the buzz just behind and above her head.  How on earth could one have a fly in the bedroom in the middle of December?  Was this some Superfly that had hung out in the garage in semi-dormant sleep these past weeks just waiting for the door to be held open for the perfect moment so that he could enter this castle of warmth?  This was more than annoying and oddly a little scary.  She felt somewhat powerless.She turned her head and saw it was a small common house fly as it darted beneath the brass lamp cover and sat so close to the bulb he would certainly fry.  She batted lightly at the lamp with her book and he flew out and away to another part of the room.  She could still hear the annoying buzz and soon it got closer once again, ever annoying and even more scary this time.  Was it going to fly in her hair, her ear, down her pajama top and buzz her to death?She swung crazily behind her head with the open book and she could hear it once again dancing above her head toward the ceiling.  Maybe it was a little angrier,or was that just her imagination?Sighing in frustration she knew that turning off her light and turning on the hall light and sitting in the dark would cause him to leave the room in pursuit of a new artificial sun and she could close the door behind him after turning off the hall light.  But her husband would be coming to bed shortly and opening the door and starting this whole war all over again.  She threw off the covers and headed for the laundry room to retrieve that high technology tool, a fly swatter.When she returned there he sat on the wall as if it was summer sunbathing, just above the glow of the lamp.  She gave him her best shot, which was not good enough, since he darted once again under the brass cover of the lamp.  She prodded somewhat carelessly with the edge of the swatter beside the bulb and then was rewarded with a thwup as something small hit either the back of the mattress, or the pillow, or the floor.  She looked everywhere carefully.  She listened for many minutes for the awakening buzz.  Nothing revealed a fly.  Finally in resignation she carefully crawled back into her bed and renewed her nighttime rituals.  The evening passed without further incident.In the morning she had forgotten the intruder as she headed to the kitchen for her wake-up coffee.When she crossed the kitchen floor she noticed a small dot on the warm wood which upon closer inspection was the fly bathing in the light of the kitchen on his back feet up in the air with no modesty at all.  She didn't know whether to be relieved that he met his death or mystified at how and why he died here."},

{"title": "A Self-imposed Exercise", "date": "Tuesday, December 06, 2011", "text": "Amelia had finally made the break.  She was at long last able to set her course for freedom and independence, far from the confines of her parochial small town at the foothills of the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  This new job was in a remote corner of Australia.  She had scored a job with a mining company whose retrieval of opals had brought it too close to a possible human migration site.  She was going to be one of their required archeologists.  It paid very well, but her real pull was that it was far away from her family in Denver and the work she had been doing there.  It was far away from anything and anyone familiar.  It was a fresh start.  She would be on her own at last.  She needed the independence and the freedom like she needed fresh air and water to keep her spirit from dying of suffocation.At least, that is what she thought.  As is so often true when we are young, what we want is what we want only until we get it day after day.  The dusty little wooden house that she rented near the town was barren and empty of personality.  She was far from any neighbor, and her late afternoons were filled with too much quiet.  She would take long walks with the strange mangy dog, who somehow captured the name \"Mangy\", and who had adopted her.  They would wander around the dry fields and down the dusty roads after an early dinner.  And as the days and weeks became months of this pattern, she began to second guess her decision to erase her former life.  For the first time in her life she began to feel a need for company.She had recently noticed that the seasons were changing and the dry weather was moving on.  The rare passing truck did not stir up its usual tornado of dust as it roared by.  The air on that particular afternoon seemed cleaner due to last night's rain and many of the blossoms of the bumble tree on the hill she was passing had opened spilling their perfume down the field to caress her face.  She looked up and decided to sit in its shade.  Mangy ran on ahead as if anticipating her decision.  As she found a clear place to rest, she noticed a different smell, fragrant like roses.  She had not smelled roses in months and recognized the sweetness immediately.  She turned to her right and just on the other side of the hill in the flat grasses was a small cottage with an arbor covered in pink and white roses.  They were covering the roof tangling carelessly and almost blocked the shadowed doorway.  Behind the house the yard was in the deep shade of several large apple trees.There were also small beds of other flowers, most still in bud at either side of the front of the small tidy blue house.  What was this place...so out of place in this arid land?  Who spent the time watering and watering to keep this garden alive?  It seemed as if no one was home.  There was no car and no sound.  Mangy had gotten bored resting at her feet and turned to head down the hill toward the house having seen some rodent movement in the shrubs, perhaps.  She sighed as she knew she would have to follow him to keep him from destroying the flower beds in his quest for fun.He was a smart dog and did not bark but approached his prey quietly like a cat.  He stopped first with his nose at the base of an exotic Sturt pea plant.  It had several of the well recognized and dramatic red blossoms with dark black centers.  Amelia was never unsurprised by the exotic and striking plant life that she encountered on this harsh continent.She was just about to call Mangy back to her side when a figure appeared beneath the arbor deep in the shadows with only scuffed brown boots showing in the light of the sun.  As the figure moved more into the daylight she saw it was a man in his late 40's or early 50's with a graying beard and sun wrinkled eyes.  He stood in a plain tan shirt and worn denim jeans with his hands in his pockets.  She couldn't help being startled, embarrassed, and somewhat threatened by his sudden presence.  But the flood of emotions did not stop her from quickly and too harshly calling back Mangy.Mangy paused and then returned to her side as he glanced at the silent man.\"I..I'm so sorry.  My dog and I were attracted to your lovely garden.\"The man paused and looked somewhere over her head before saying, \"It is not my garden.\"  His eyes returned to her face with what seemed hesitation.  He remained silent.\"Well, it is lovely.  Not a common sight out here.\"He brought his lips together as if to speak and then just seemed to sigh silently as he studied her.\"Well, we enjoyed the view.  Bye.\"  Amelia clapped her thigh to indicate to Mangy that they were moving on.  They climbed the hill and she only turned back when she had reached the shade of the Bumble tree and the sun was no longer in her eyes.  The quiet man was not standing in the arch of the roses anymore.  He had silently disappeared back into the little blue house.She kept the strange meeting in her thoughts all the way home."},

{"title": "Retro", "date": "Tuesday, November 15, 2011", "text": "I have been watching a retro TV show called Route 66 while resting my ankle in the afternoons. Route 66 was a famous highway in American history that ran from Chicago, Illinois through Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and ended at Los Angelos, California...a total of 2,448 miles (3,940 km).  This was the artery for those escaping the dust bowl recession in the 1930's, although the TV series was from 1960 to 1964...my high school years!  This highway has been removed and replaced by the Interstate Highway system, but parts of it still exist and are designated as scenic byways.  It still holds its romance for many road warriors.  (If you have read any of my blog posts about my youth you know that I had wanderlust big time.)I was a fan of the black and white TV series not only for the wanderlust it satisfied and the edginess of the stories, but also because there were two young male leads.  One dark, handsome, and rebellious (Buzz), and one well-educated, rational, and boy-next-door (Tod).  I had a crush on both males in the series and had fun fantasizing how the romance would pan out with each one.  My decision recently to re-watch a few episodes revealed how well written this series actually was.  The dialogue might seem somewhat derivative today, but then it was written more like a play with emphasis on characters and with the words that were being said more important than any car chases or stimulating violence or naked skin that drives TV series today.  The themes dealt with the difficult social issues that were at the forefront of the 60's decade.  Still, CBS producers (most likely male) were concerned about the heaviness of the show and wanted to see more \"broads, bosoms, and fun\".  The older generation was more widely and fairly represented than today, although the series was darker than the perfect suburban family shows of the 1950's.  A bit of information that I learned about the series was that Robert Redford had been considered for one of the parts.  The crew moved to a different location every week and Newsweek called it \"the largest weekly mobile operation in TV history.\"  Perhaps, this series was the precedent to \"On the Road\" and \"Easy Rider.\"My son had mentioned watching something from his youth and commenting on how times have changed!  Just wait, I thought.  I watch stuff from decades ago and am fascinated by the even greater cultural changes today.  Since there are no cell phones characters must run or race everywhere to deliver those important messages. Sex and violence are presumed and not shown in glorious HD.  Both the leads were always well-groomed unless emerging from some day spent in blue-collar toil.  And blue collar work seems to be romanticized.  Buzz's darker side is subtly represented...today they would have him getting drunk or taking drugs.  The rich are rich but not disgustingly so and the poor are poor but shown sometimes through overtly pink romantic glasses. Apologies to those who were looking for a more interesting post.  When I reached the well and brought up the bucket, this was all that sat in the sludge of the bottom.  So, let me know, did you have a favorite TV show in your youth?"},
{"title": "Vanity...is it all?", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2011", "text": "\"In conventional parlance, vanity is the excessive belief in one's own abilities or attractiveness to others,\" according to that virtual authority Wikipedia.  I have always had  a tug of war with vanity.  I would never leave the house without a good outfit, groomed hair and make-up.  But if I was hiking and camping I could care less what I looked like.  In contrast, at the end of a sweaty day of hiking hubby cannot take me to a restaurant of any stature.  I refuse to look that bad when eating dinner.  I had at least 25 pairs of shoes when I was working full time.  Now I tend to purchase only sandals, tennis shoes, hiking shoes for this new life style but I have a dozen pairs of these in various styles and colors. Today, the problem is that I can only wear two pairs of tennis shoes comfortably since my injury.  Fortunately I have not been anywhere special in months and do not need fancy shoes.  I rarely attend the holiday fund raisers that are around the corner. My mother wore tennis shoes to my daughter's wedding beneath her long dress.  I honestly thought she was just being difficult, but now I realize I was the one who was being difficult.  Her feet had not been in fancy shoes for years and she was not going to be in pain all evening just for us.  She was never a vain woman.  I remember giving her a magazine haircut when I was 13 or 14 and being so proud of how she looked.  She just seemed amused.Today I tend to begin to limp and walk slower if I have been on my feet for hours.  We take a flat long walk down a wooded trail and I find my vanity forces me to try to hide the limp and to try and walk more steadily, in spite of any pain in doing that, if I see other hikers!  I get irritated that hikers pass us on the trial when I remember I was the trail blazer in past.  If we stop to chat I find it necessary to explain my ankle injury so they know I don't walk like this without reason.  This must be vanity.  Recently, I had one of the clerks in the department store offer me a wheelchair from the front of the store and it took all my resolve not to deck him!  I try to hurry when people hold the door to the Post Office open for me, embarrassed that I cannot walk faster. How do people with permanent handicaps show such dignity as they hike through life?"},
{"title": "You Need More Greens", "date": "Wednesday, November 09, 2011", "text": "Many years ago when my son was a teenager just a year away from college, we had reached that stage that some families reach where you are terrified that your child cannot make it on his own, and yet, you are so sick of dealing with him that you want him out of the house.  Yes, some families do not have to undertake crises management with their children, and you are blessed.  You can believe it is because you were such a great parent, but in reality, luck of the gene pool has something to do with this.  (Your gene pool...not your child's.)  He did end up being forced to go to a therapist for a handful of times, which resulted in a diagnosis of depression.  Glad my health insurance covered this waste of time.  When he found out the insurance would run out and we would be paying out of pocket for the sessions he refused to go.  He insisted he was smarter than the therapist, and I actually think he was!  I tried to get him to test several therapists to find one he liked, but he has the same stubborn dynamic of his dad.  He wanted to deal with his life on his own, a sometimes dangerous decision.Anyway, he did survive college (majoring in that super useful undergraduate degree, Psychology, oddly enough) and went on with additional training to become a successful sound engineer.  He recently won an award as sound mixer for the year from his company.  He still has issues with mild mood swings, but can deal with it without relying on drugs or alcohol.  We are blessed for that.I remember his freshman year when dropping him off that I noticed a lovely woods near the campus.  I told him that was the place to work out issues.  Lone walks, intensive runs, whatever he could squeeze in to help with the stress of college.  He actually agreed with me.To this day, we both realize that the great outdoors is the place to go when life seems so heavy you are down on your knees and knuckles facing the dirt with the hot sun at your back.In the November issues of Newsweek magazine, Dr. Andrew Weil (one of those new age hippie philosophers), emphasized the importance of getting away from our artificially created environment whenever we can.  The noise of city life, the smells, the continual stimulation is ruining us.  The stimulus of technology which brings us instant entertainment, instant stimulation, superficial connections with people, and overwhelming information is not something our brains and senses were designed to assimilate in such constant and large quantities.  Most of us now have sedentary indoor jobs which are also unhealthy.  Our natural sleep cycles and other circadian rhythms are not followed.  \"Human beings evolved to thrive in natural environments and in bonded social groups.\"  Depression has become so common that children today have been diagnosed with 'nature-deficit disorder.'Sitting in a field or on a cliff is not as exciting as shooting down a helicopter with your remote control and not as compelling as checking Facebook on your phone every 15 minutes.  But I feel safe in insisting it will keep you alive so much longer and that you will actually enjoy your life so much more.Now, turn off the PC and go talk a walk."},

He also notes that he himself took exactly 10 years to meet the 10,000-Hour Rule, during his brief tenure at The American Spectator and his more recent job at The Washington Post.\"I do not think it will take me 20 hours of walking for 10 years to be an expert at walking, because clearly I never had the talent to begin with!  My point is that everything worthwhile seems to take a lot of time and therefore we all better learn patience."},

{"title": "Luck", "date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2011", "text": "It has been eleven days since my careless accident.  The swelling is almost gone!  The pain, while at times unbearable if I twist a certain way,  is mostly minimal as I limp around the house.  I feel lucky that this was not as bad as it could have been at my age!My cabin fever reached a peak yesterday and I asked hubby to take me for a ride in the country side.  Our goal was to reach the mountains which are about 2 hours away, but along the way we encountered a detour.  It seems a bridge had washed out in the last storm and the road had to be closed for repairs.  This was a major state road. I live in an area of meandering coastlines and rivers and marshes.  Some of you know this means there is rarely a straight line between two points.  This a bridge being gone means we had to detour an hour north to find another crossing.  Sometime during the long detour we decided to fore-go the mountain trip and just explore the nearby countryside and visit a few state parks in the lovely fall..We pulled over to the side of the country road that passed beside neat Amish farms and brought out our road map to see what might be close (the Truthsayer -GPS- was in the other car).  While holding our heads bent close over the map we heard a loud tap at the window on the driver's side of the car.  We looked up and saw a women in her fifties with frizzy hair, casual clothes, and a very tired look on her face.Hubby rolled down the window.\"Can you give us a ride up the road.\" she asked in a gravelly voice caused by many years of smoking.We both looked at the 'us' and her companion was a twenty something girl dressed in a red striped shirt and too large flowing plaid pants.  She could have been wearing pajamas or a costume.  Not the type of clothes most 20-somethings would be caught dead in.  Both looked pleading and the older woman was panting as if she had already walked a long way.  We hesitated only shortly and complied.I could smell the cigarette smoke as they entered the back seat.  The trip several miles up the road was to reach a friend's house since the woman's car was no longer working.  The woman just oozed stress and was a very sad candidate for living as she explained how her luck had run out this month.  A sister had just died of cancer, her father had just passed away and the house she inherited from him was being managed legally by another sister who had borrowed money against it and had a gambling problem.  This morning the final bad luck was a car that wouldn't start.  (Yes, I have encountered story teller shysters before, but these people did not ask for money and were able to look me straight in the eye.)We dropped them off at a small rural house with several cars scattered around the open field.  While we felt sorry for their situation, both hubby and I felt more sorry for the young girl who followed her mother up the dirt road to the door.  Already in her short life she was trapped in poverty.  She would probably marry the first economic light that entered her life and if her luck ran out she would be just like her mother in a decade or so following the same mistakes. These are some of the people that President Obama says live paycheck to paycheck.  They are not smart nor industrious nor understanding that they make some of their own bad luck.  But in earlier times, before this recession, I wonder if their life might not have been so harsh as they got by week to week."},

{"title": "Cherry-Picken' Pain!", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2011", "text": "My mother, when she was a few years younger than I am now, was home alone most of the time since my father continued to work waiting for full social security.  He usually worked about 60 miles away from the farm.  One autumn my mother was in the process of picking cherries from our three cherry trees out back by the chicken shed.  She got a bee in her bonnet that using the ladder was not getting her high enough.  (What she was doing on a ladder on uneven ground all by herself at her age makes me shake my head?!)  Anyway her attempt to climb higher in the tree to reach the last of that red ripe fruit resulted in her taking a nasty fall.  She broke the heel of her foot upon landing, and nothing else thank goodness, and had to drag herself about 80 feet across the mowed field, over a dry irrigation ditch and over the gravel driveway into the house and eventually to the phone!  I remember her telling me this story, but I was not as impressed as I should have been at the time.  (What a little twit I was.)  I also remember her complaining at how her other remaining children, all living close but elsewhere with full-time jobs, didn't help her much.  I am sure they did as much as they could with their busy lives.  My mother also loved playing the martyr.This incident came back to me while I was lying in bed this morning greeting a new day. Yesterday, my husband and I using a much too small dolly were attempting to move one of those huge old fashioned television sets from the garage to the attic storage in the closet of the guest bedroom.  This old TV belongs to my son who had left it at our house along with a small collection of other furniture since he was moving into his girlfriend's tiny house a few weeks ago. Husband was above pulling the dolly and I was below holding the TV against it.  We had just reached the top step of the stairs which has a larger lip when the television flipped off the dolly platform knocking me down a few steps and then landing on my foot and lower leg mashing them against the steps as I fell back.  I held my ground fearing I might fall all the way down the stairs as this appliance rolled over me.  I managed, although in the early waves of pain. to drag my foot out from under the TV and to put the back of my shoulder against the set and scoot slowly down the stairs allowing the TV to follow against my shoulder.Hubby could not help because he was at the top behind the dolly and it happened too fast for him to attempt anything.  I reached the bottom step and move away while the television slid to the floor taking a piece of the skin off my forearm as it did so.I managed to limp to the nearby couch before the shock set in.  Eventually I felt waves of nausea and waves of pain and found myself involuntarily hyperventilating, until my body finally adjusted to what had happened.  After several hours of ice-on and ice-off and two Aleve, I had decided that I had not broken anything because the pain was bearable.  I was also very lucky in that I spend time, after lifting leg weights two or three times a week, stretching all of my joints including my ankles to keep me as flexible as possible.  That has given me some good resilience and bone mass.  We have talked to our doctor friend and all agree an x-ray is not necessary as my pain is easing and I can put some light weight on the foot.Yes, we were idiots trying to get that 80 pound monstrosity up the stairs. I had told my son to just leave it in the garage since I hadn't decided where to store it, another mistake!   My husband had his adrenaline kick in and actually lifted the set and carried it upstairs by himself shortly after!  Probably another mistake but I was too busy trying to bear waves of pain to protest.Since it was going to continue to be my lucky day, within 30 minutes the TV news stations were warning of tornadoes and major storms moving into our area and showing a lovely home missing its roof just about 200 miles to the south of us.  No way I was moving to the basement!  Luckily the storm missed us.This morning my left ankle is now twice the size of my right ankle, but the religious application of ice every 20 minutes today, should continue to help keep the swelling at bay.  I am told that the swelling caused by fluids causes the majority of the pain.  The ankle does not appear black and blue which means little blood loss inside, another plus.Lots of time to write a long post on this laptop but no way to search for an appropriate accompanying photo as they are on the other PC.  Of course, today the sun is brilliant and the angles are perfect for some photography.  Wouldn't you know it?  Then again, I could take a photo of my ankle....Nah!"},

Keys to Happiness.  A sense of loving one's self and not giving up...ever...except on those battles that will not win the war,   What war?  The one that fights for you to live your life and not some other person's.(I searched 'advice' on my blog and came up with 100 entries.  I am the most obnoxious and ego-inflated person I know!)"},

It is a long drive this evening up to my daughter's house past many black or yellow blinking traffic lights, dark houses, and darker stores."},

{"title": "Dining Out Loud", "date": "Monday, July 18, 2011", "text": "I may have written about this a long time ago, but I am thinking not.  When my daughter was an only child (for about 2.5 years) we did a bit of around the world (well, half-way around the world) traveling.  Actually I flew alone across the Pacific Ocean and into the mid-west when she was only 8 months old and not yet born...are you following that?  The stewardesses blanched and almost did not let me on the flight.  Today, a future mother would probably need a doctor's statement for a flight of 15 hours not including the 2-hour layover in Hawaii.Later, we were flying the other direction and she was 20 months old at that time.  Cuter than a bug's ear and quite the chatterbox at such an early age...clearly our little genius.  We landed in Guam around 8:30 in the evening and were starving.  The only restaurants open at that hour near our hotel were the few fancier ones and the only people eating at that hour were adults.  We were tremendously jet-lagged but not too tired to wolf down anything on the menu.  My daughter was so glad to be out of a plane seat that getting her into a high hair at the table required some persuasion until she smelled food and became amenable.  We tried to be as quiet and unobtrusive as possible because it looked like everyone was on their important evening away from the kids for a Saturday date night.  I think that was the quietest restaurant I ever ate in...although it could have just been my self-consciousness making me think we were the loudest party there.Once our meal was finished and we were waiting for our bill, my daughter discovered that her spoon when banged on her plate made the most lovely clang.  Like a silver bullet each clang shot across the restaurant into the quiet conversations of the well dressed diners.  I grabbed the spoon from her hand and turned to put it out of her reach.  She immediately got her father's fork and continued with the tempi movement of her symphony.  Hubby raised his hand higher and with no grace indicated we needed the check as he removed the second utensil from her chubby fingers.  Not to be prevented from showing her amazing musical talents, she began the rhythm portion of her performance by clanging together the metal salt and pepper shakers with glee.  I could not believe that she had only two hands and two arms...but they moved with the lighting speed of a frogs tongue in meeting their goal.  I could not bring my eyes to meet the adults at the other tables,  some chuckling quietly and others groaning, and lifted her out of the high chair and through the door to the peace of the lobby while hubby waited for our bill. It wasn't her fault nor was it the diner's fault for the clash in atmospheric expectations.  Had we had a better choice in time and place, we would not have brought her there.  I am sure when the customers made their reservations, they did not clarify that they did not want to be seated near any musical genius toddlers.This whole experience came to my mind when I recently heard in the news about a restaurant in Pittsburgh that is no longer allowing children under six to eat there due to complaints from customers about the behavior of some of the children.  This is an upscale golf resort restaurant.  I thought about this ruling and while there were many that think children should be allowed to eat wherever and whenever and that this was discriminating, I really felt that a restaurant has the right to establish the type of mood and food they want to create.  I certainly do not want to sit next to a chaotic family if I was going out to eat in a nice restaurant for a special evening out.  That might be the kind of thing I would have every reason of expecting at the local diner or fast-food place.  ( I am guessing if that rule was in place on our memorable night, the restaurant would have taken pity on us and provided at least take-out.)Your turn for input, agree or disagree?"},

So we ignore them as best we can.  Today I will list some of my favorites.THINGS THAT ANNOY ME  (Listed in the order in which they burble to my consciousness...nothing 'pops' into my head anymore):Salad Kits.  These can be found in the produce section and they are plastic bags filled with chopped greens, and perhaps, a plastic bag of dressing as well.  I do admit that if you do not know how to chop lettuce you should stay away from knives.  But a SALAD \"KIT\"?  Puhleeze...just shred the lettuce with your hands and buy a bottle of dressing.Any 'Housewives of'  Television Show.  No further comment, except if you enjoy these you need to go to more of your family reunions for entertainment.Comments from My Children on How I Spend My Time.  Yes, I do spend inordinate hours taking and processing photographs.  Why does no one comment on how much time a chef spends perfecting his skill, a weekend boat builder in spending years on his hobby, your husband and his sports related stuff?Cleaning the kitchen sink and finding 5 minutes later it is covered in tea leaves.  Enough said.Lowfat Yogurt.  This stuff tastes like something weird and certainly NOT yogurt.  Ice cream and yogurt have to have fat in them or they are not worth eating.Plastic Wine Stoppers.  Real cork has been proven to be the more environmentally friendly way to go and metal screw on tops have been proven to be a better way to seal wines for aging.  I HATE plastic wine stoppers and you cannot tell you have one until you remove the aluminum wrapper and spend an hour trying to pull out the stopper!Provocative clothes for any girl under 14.  You can complain about childhood promiscuity and the danger of pedophiles...but if your kid wears a bikini or tiny skirt I am ignoring you.  If your 14-year-old wears white skin-tight slacks I am going to hit you up the side of the head.People who assume you have an open book in front of you on your lap because you are bored and want to talk to them.Congress.Picky Eaters.  Wasted time trying to plan a meal or choose a restaurant that makes them happy.People who read over my shoulder.  I apologize, but it is a quirk I cannot contain.  Hubby knows better!Mosquitoes after the rain. Late Acceptances.  After inviting my son and his girlfriend down for the 4th two weeks earlier and not hearing from him we gave up and decided to head to the city for fireworks.  He calls at 1:00 that very afternoon and asks if he can come down with his gal!

(The lawn in the photo looks much nicer than it is...mostly mowed weeds.) I had already started a few flower beds and it was early fall and I was attempting to clean out some of the areas around the larger plants.  I could tell he was interested in my work and so I attempted a conversation in simple English.  Oscar spoke Spanish but was able to give me some advice on some of my plants as he assisted with the lawn.  Perhaps there was an ulterior motive to his attention, because later that month when we wanted to move some larger plants my husband gave him a call and asked if he worked outside the landscape company.  Fortunately, he said he could work on the next Sunday.Later we started that large paving project which disrupted that blue bird nesting I had written about.  Oscar and his brother and other workers spent over a week in our front yard tearing up the concrete sidewalk, aligning the driveway, installing pavers and putting down a composite to hold them.  They had to re-work some drainage and adjust a retaining wall.  The supervisor, who was not Spanish but an overweight good ole' boy, rarely moved his butt from the tiny earth moving bulldozer as he provided advice to the three laborers through arm waving and calling out.Oscar was smart, followed instructions exactly, even gave some good advice and we ended up with a lovely driveway. Over the years Oscar has been an irregular Sunday visitor to our home whenever we needed help with a project that hubby could not do alone but which was too small a project for the landscape firm.  He moved enormous plants, reset brick edgers, moved tons of earth, set up a small patio beneath my arbor and helped repair our deer fence.  He is always gracious and his English has gotten better.  Oscar has a generous smile and is a handsome man; I have watched him go gray.  He has two daughters the age of our President's that he has to leave back in Mexico with their mother for months at a time while he works in the United States.  He works at the whim of the landscape company.  Today he told us that they are laying him off for three weeks because of the slow down in demand.  He cannot afford to live here without a paycheck so is returning to his family during that time.  I cannot help but think how expensive this must be.  Expensive in monetary ways as well as expensive in personal ways.  His daughters have grown up and he has been far away most of the time.  He has had to live in a foreign land to earn money so that they can go to school, have clothes and a home.  I wonder how much they miss him.  I wonder if they will realize the sacrifices that were made when they have families of their own.  This lifestyle is somewhat like the lifestyle that military families must face.  Long days, perhaps even dangerous days, far away from their precious families.  Except our military does get benefits in terms of retirement and health care.  Oscar only gets an irregular paycheck.  I am sure (?) that the company would hire local laborers if they could find people who were willing to work under such arbitrary conditions and at such a low pay level.I get a deep seated guilt (such is the disease of the liberal heart) when he is here.  We pay him slightly more than the landscape company and he is happy for the work, but I cannot help but feel uncomfortable in my safer lifestyle.  I feel like I am in one of those Hollywood movies and I do not fit the part, or if I am in denial...I do not like how well I fit the part.  I am blessed to celebrate the 4th in this country when I see the struggles other countries face trying to determine their path to a form of democracy that fits their culture and economy and with citizens that willingly come to our country for any job because they are aware of our unique freedoms and opportunity."},
{"title": "Helping Hands", "date": "Friday, July 01, 2011", "text": "I was thinking about the responses to my last post. If you are a handyman, it is hard to sit back and watch others do the work when you cannot.  First, you have standards that are probably higher, second, you get pleasure out of seeing your accomplishments, third, you also like the puzzle and challenge, and fourth, you have a meaningful role in society. Sitting and watching sort of takes the air out of your tires.  When this opportunity is taken away, it can be hard to age gracefully and let others take over.  I think it is much like the woman who was the great cook in the family having to turn over the job to others on holidays because she can no longer do it all.  No one can bake or roast as well as her, but we have to gracefully let others find their space.  While most of us like our independence and refuse to be waited on we should perhaps read Tuesdays with Morrie and try to emulate his generosity of spirit.Another comment to the post was a question about helping in general.  The man I wrote about had had a very serious heart operation about two years ago and was bedridden for a while.  I brought over food and offered to food shop or stay at home so wife could get out of the house.  So, yes, these are neighborly contributions, and these are very important.  Perhaps, because almost anyone can do them, they do not seem as significant to me.  A silliness on my part, perhaps.I just tend to be more impressed by the person who fixes my computer, my car or my toaster.  The one who looks at the corner of my deck and figures out the leak issue and then fixes it.  The one who can do that boring and frustrating stuff.(Oh wait!  A really cool thing I once did when we lived overseas was upholster two seats for a homemade airplane for a handyman friend whose wife was an excellent seamstress but back in the U.S. for a month.  That was back when I could actually sew pretty well.  I was nervous doing it, but happy for a job reasonably well done.  The sewing machine and I now do not always speak the same language. )"},
{"title": "Repaired", "date": "Wednesday, June 29, 2011", "text": "Middle class folks such as those of my household do not often ask for help on big projects from our neighbors.   In an agrarian society, barn building is a community event and fixing the old tractor can be done with the help of a neighbor or two.  As we earn more money, we become more isolated and less likely to ask for help.  Big projects we contract out and smaller projects fall by the wayside.  For example, I live in a rather fancy neighborhood where many of my neighbors hire landscape firms to take care of their large lawn and most have housekeepers.  My hubby is certainly not the handy type, and for now, I do my own housekeeping.Yesterday I went to toast an English muffin in my upper middle class Krups toaster oven and when I removed the muffin, it was only slightly warm.  Hmmm?  I pushed the toaster button once again and after a time when the rods did not turn red, I realized something was wrong with this expensive 3-year-old appliance.  I checked the outlet, the fuse, and the plug.  The toaster itself was sealed like Tutankhamen's tomb and would require a dedicated electrician to disassemble for further investigation. By mid-morning I had convinced myself we had to purchase a new toaster and headed out to the nearest store for this appliance.  We purchased a model that was half the price and a less well known brand.  Once I got the box home and placed it on the counter a belated epiphany hit me.  I turned to my husband and told him that whatever was wrong with this old toaster/oven...it was something minor.  I just knew.  Maybe there was a fuse inside that had burned out?  I looked at the back with its dozen screws and then remembered that we had a neighbor who owned a rental farm and did all the appliance repair for his tenants.  He seemed to enjoy the challenge.  He was a very nice dude and so we decided to ask.Well, it took him an hour, mostly spent taking it apart and putting it together.   He had guessed the problem even before removing the back and bottom as he had the same toaster/oven.  He said that the connector for the wires was usually flimsy and burned through over time.  He did not have a connector but had some electrical crimps which he used and now I have a perfectly good toaster and am planning a thank you dinner with neighbors sometime soon.  He lives in a very nice house but that does not seem to have made him brain or energy dead even though he is well into his 70's.I often wish I had a talent that someone could use.  I have sent some of my photo files to friends for wall deco, and have advised about plants, but I really wish I could do something more concrete in terms of being a plus in society...maybe some day.  My dad was an excellent handyman and my two brothers who live far away shine in that area as well.  I raise a wine glass to all those handymen who save the lives of us useless folks every day!"},
{"title": "Eeahhh!", "date": "Saturday, June 25, 2011", "text": "In my last post I mentioned that I had been doing some volunteer work for a local environmental group.  This involved hiking a mile through the woods (at three different places) and then taking a sample of the water from the river at the end of each of the three hikes.  Two of these locations required some down hill and up hill hiking and really got the heart beating and the sweat poring.  The last selection site was just off a highway and required hiking through debris that had either been thrown by cars or washed up by a nearby flood area.  That was the place I showed in the previous post.  Looks idyllic, doesn't it.  I neglected to show the sand bags, bottles and other stuff.Hubby and I started this project at 1:30 P.M. and did not head back to the \"lab\" (really an extra room on the back of the museum/house) until 5:00 P.M.  We had to filter the samples for both chlorophyll and suspended solids which meant filtering six times...two for each sample.  Then some of the sample also went into a refractometer for a salinity check...the river was freshwater.  Finally three samples from each site were poured into little vials and labeled and frozen along with the filters placed carefully in foil.  I am just telling you all this to impress you with my technical skills.I think we must have used a double filter for the first sample because we waited almost 20 minutes for it to filter through.  We reduced our sample from 300 ML to 150 ML and  the next sets took only 5 or 6 minutes to filter completely.  We also had to label the vials and the filters and create a data sheet as well as complete another log.  We were not done until 8:00 and we rushed through our cleanup of the area and headed to the nearby I-HOP for a quick dinner.  It was in the middle of dinner I remembered that I had forgotten to complete two blanks on the 'custody sheet' and so back we drove, retrieved the key from under the log as it got darker, tried to do this so that a nearby family having a picnic did not see we were getting a key, and made our way back into the little back room.I am clearly not cut out for all the details of environmental work. On top of all of this I have been tormented by chigger bites which I probably got when sitting on a log near the river's edge while writing in water temp numbers.  I have not had to endure these pests for years and had forgotten how miserable they can make you.  They are a mite, red in color, but too small to be seen by most human eyes, and when they bite you with special mouth parts they liquefy the skin after creating a feed tube called a stylostome of the skin cells.  Don't you just love this info?  This tube they create is the thing that causes the unbearable itching because they fall off when you first scratch and then die.  But the tube stays in for days.  You must NOT scratch because the more you scratch the more it itches!  It can take 10 days for this stylostome to reabsorb.  It is nice to know that their mouths are not very strong, and so, they prefer the tender skin of women and children.  I am now on day 6....ONLY FOUR MORE TO GO!   Eeeeaahh!"},

I own way too much stuff and dusting is not my favorite thing to do.  While I find old stuff interesting and find a discussion of its creation or history interesting, it is only as an idle diversion.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have gone into an antique store and in most of those cases I was looking for garden ornaments rather than items to dust. On a recent trip with my daughter we explored a large antique mall.  She was looking at antique jewelry and has a new interest in antique watches.  While I had fun looking at the items from my youth, antique lady that I am, it wasn't until I saw this vase below that I got motivated.  Most of my vases are generic from flower shops or previous interesting food containers and barely useful in holding flowers. I saw this green glass charmer in a glass case and immediately bought it.  It is only about 5 inches high and perfect for flowers with broken stems.  I then spent the rest of the time looking at other vases throughout the store and found one more.  This is a tall art deco and I noticed after I purchased it that it was not truly vertical!I have decided my new mission when I am bored wandering in an antique shop is to look for vases to replace my generic clear glass collection.

{"title": "Motivation", "date": "Monday, June 13, 2011", "text": "Sometimes too much of a good thing is too much of a good thing.  All of the days in my life are now Saturdays with only an errand or two on the agenda and the rest of the day to play.  No one thinks about being in such a situation some day when they are working a 50-hour workweek.  Let me give you a glimpse of the future so that you will not wander around with that deer in the headlights expression when you get here...you WILL someday.  What can happen is that, first, you lose total track of time.  You head off to your Thursday haircut and are surprised that everyone looks a little too directly at you when you walk in the door.  Then you find out that today is actually Wednesday and you hairdresser doesn't come in until Thursday...tomorrow!   Congrats, you just gained one whole day to your week of playtime.I gain days and lose days with abandon.  They melt like snowflakes on the desert floor and I sigh with guilt when I lay my head against the pillow each evening realizing that one more jeweled snowflake has melted away and will never be seen again.  This also leads one to become a stranger to that feeling called motivation.  One does what one wants to do, NOT what one should do or needs to do or must do or even has to do. I wander around my yard with either a camera or a garden trowel in hand until the angle of the sun reminds me that I should be thinking about dinner or calling a family member or getting the details together for that trip that is coming up.  It is like I was released from some time travel machine in a fantasy land and then the machine starts blinking reminding me I am back on the clock.I used to work with lazy people like me.  I hated how they got the same pay check as I when all they did was show up to work and then wander from one office conversation to the next until the afternoon sun told them they had to do a few things at their desk before they headed home.  Retirement will not seem strange to them.I, on the other hand, was full of motivation.  This motivation got me nowhere, but it certainly was overflowing in my spirit and probably irritated the hell out of other people around me at my work and certainly made my family roll their eyes on the weekends.  I could cram more items on a Saturday to-do list than anyone I knew, and just like the energizer bunny, get the majority of them done before the sun set.  I once painted an entire new 3,000 square foot house - primer, trim and stain - on just a few weekends.Now my motivation is hiding somewhere.  I have a bedroom that has had spackle spots and faded paint for several years, I have floors with carpets that need cleaning, I have a fall car trip to plan, and I really, really, really should clean out a closet or two since I can no longer tightly close the doors!  But it looks like we just might get a nice sunset this evening down at the dock...so I will follow hubby who is checking on the crabs and then a couple of hours later my hunger will eventually make me walk back up and start dinner.  (THAT's where my motivation is, in my stomach.  Who knew?)(And of course I went to here  to read Moannie's version of aging after finishing writing this!  We are both so cheerful these days!)"},

I live in a culture of excess with lots of glittery lights and magnificent smells, and addictive sounds and therefore, trying to find the Center with the coals warm glow and to remain balanced as I am made stronger by fire is a daily challenge.  It is like yoga and meditation...a most peaceful and rewarding place that allows you to forget about all the corners of your world, past and present, but it takes lots of work to get there and to remain there and most of all to just let go of the idea that you must be on a path to somewhere else.  The only place I must be is right here and right now."},

There is even a strange device that one uses to remove mucus from the noses of little ones who have not mastered the art of blowing.  The mother puts it against the child's nostrils and then puts a little plastic tube in her mouth and proceeds to suck on the tube.  The text assures us that the mucus goes into a tissue and not the mother's mouth.  It still looks very unsettling in the photo (above) of mother and child using it.  The real clincher is that the publisher claims it has been used by European parents for years.  (They probably write in the European version that it has been used by North American parents for years.)How did our baby \"animals\" survive without this stuff?  What new wonders will be available to my grandchildren when they begin to raise their little ones?  All of these do not belay the real dangers of global climate change, air pollution, water pollution, crime, drugs and daily stress that our little ones have to battle."},

It often involes pheromones, love songs and aerobatic flights. This type of behavior has been noted in the cream-lined hawk moth from Asia, and is currently being studied in the North American species. However, many different hawk moths, such as the ocellate hawk moth, also found in Asia, do not have these behaviors. Rather, they tend to have broader wings and fly more clumsily. They have no tongues, do not feed as adults, and show little courtship behaviour.

I know because I see the $300 binoculars left out overnight in the rain on the deck table (they survived nicely).   I know because he is not hungry at dinner but is hungry at midnight and I hear him rustling up some cereal in the kitchen and then watching CNN.  I know because he is jealous(!) I hired a yard service for the next month.  I know because his favorite teapot is now always on the counter. I know because we spent 30 minutes yesterday afternoon looking for his cell phone (a familiar routine)...in the garden...in the cars...in the garage...in every room in the house.  After calling it and listening carefully we heard a kitten-sized ring in our closet where he had left it in some pants that he had worn and then shoved in a drawer!Yes, he is home and my life is now busier."},

In my neighborhood several folks leave on porch lights which I can see blazing the woods as I crawl into bed each evening.  These lights would not discourage robbers as there are many dark corner windows for them to explore.  I suggest we turn off all our outside lights at night to reduce light pollution which is a huge tragedy on this planet.5.  The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed rules to reduce mercury emissions from coal plants by 91%.  According to some politicians this would be too expensive for coal plants to implement.   I think it would be too expensive for baby lungs NOT to implement.       6.  Pollution for the copper mine chosen to produce metal for the medals awarded at the 2012 London Olympics is responsible for up to 200 premature deaths each year.  Sort of takes the edge off of the reason for the Olympics.7.  In 2006 Brazil and Peru agreed to construct five dams throughout Peru, selling most of the power to energy hungry Brazil which has reduced its poverty rate to 15.3%.  Most of these dams will be built in the heart of the last rain forests in the world creating cities and new highways and jobs into the heart of the green.8.  Kit foxes living in cities in California have a diet richer in corn products than their more rural cousins...probably due to corn syrup...i.e. junk food from trash.9. Earth Week is almost over...how about using cloth for wrapping your Easter Gifts?  Turning off all lights at night?  Not using so many paper towels or turning off the continual rinse water when washing dishes?10.  I did not know about this group!11.  If you have children you might do one or two of these this week.12.  The good side of rising gas prices is that we will be forced to pay for a fossil fuel at its real value.  Of course, those on fixed incomes and those who are poor will learn this lesson in an unfair way.13.  When you go shopping today, look for things you need and not things you want, and please remember that there is no more away to throw it!Actually Pauline hit the nail on the head with my prior post.  It was more the way my time was being jerked around by a broken car, broken appointments and no one to commiserate with!  I like being alone, but know it is not good to lead the life of a hermit in this day and age and force myself to get out the door and go somewhere.  I just wish other people and things would respect my time!"},

Let us say that after numerous phone calls, from a phone number ID of Pittsburgh, PA which you did not recognize, you decide to finally answer the phone.  Let us say that the call is from the marketing headquarters of your bank and they really, really, really, really love your patronage and want to survey you as one of their favored customers.   (No, neither of your accounts is in the 6 figures.)  They want to know what it is that you like about their bank, and what it is that you don't like, and what you would recommend for better service to you, their valued customer.  I suggested higher interest rates which brought a chuckle on the other end.Now answer me this question:Why after this 8 ( golly it seemed like 20) minute phone call which you had to break off yourself with a false excuse, do you now know that the bank interviewer is 38, has a girlfriend, they are Redskins fans, they both love to garden, he will use your term 'therapeutic' in relation to gardening if you don't mind(?), they never buy tomatoes from the store...although the farmer's market can sometimes provide a decent tomato, the interviewer's mother is 70, both he and his mother lost a chunk of money in the market crash (through investments with Leighman Brothers), after which he fired his investment counselor, and as a final tidbit of info, he is now concerned because his mother is on a fixed income? Why is he telling me this?!!  I am not a Chatty Kathy, so I did not pull this out of him.  As a matter of fact, I barely got a word in edgewise except for answering a rare question or two.  As I stood impatiently talking to this man and staring out my front window, I almost thought it was a joke and that I was part of some 'you got punked' show expecting Brad Pitt to show up at my door cell phone in hand and big grin on his face.  Fat chance.After several commiserating comments on my part which I was able to make while the interviewer took a breath, I then insisted I HAD to go.  He responds with, \"Well, I still have several more questions to ask you.  Perhaps I can call you back later or in a few days?\"  (Not in your wildest wet dreams, kiddo.)  With a smile in your voice you recommend he do that and then hang up the phone and make a promise to yourself not to answer any more phone calls with the ID Pittsburgh, PA.  (I now wonder if he was trying to get personal information out of me and this wasn't a bank call after all?  He did find out that I like to garden and I am not a Redskins fan.)Sigh."},

Fear when used with a lack of control and based only on emotion can be a disaster.  When fear becomes panic and we stop relying on the gray cells, then we are in for punishment.  I think the stories coming out of Japan show tremendous courage but also lots of rational thought.  Bold actions facing the fear were taken by individuals that saved many lives even though just running away would have resulted in the person insuring the safety of his/her own life alone.Two months ago when I was staying at a friends home in central Florida, I had lots of time on my hands.  They live on several acres in lovely tropical woods and on a large freshwater spring.  I could take early morning or late evening or even mid-day walks and totally disappear from the site of the house for long periods of time.  The weather was comfortable, and except for the few rains, I was having fun with my camera capturing all the exotic stuff.Florida is filled with beauty and this is mixed in with exotic alligators, poisonous snakes, and an odd plant danger or two.   I had the privilege of seeing a wild bobcat saunter across the front lawn one morning.  My walks were usually by myself, and being conscious of this, I was careful although not fearful.  During one morning I came across this snake skin beside the path.  This was a REALLY long snake, and so I became somewhat concerned.  There had been a 10-foot (non-indigenous) python seen crawling across the nearby road two winters ago on this property...but it was also found frozen to death in a nearby drainage pipe two days later.  AND what I had heard about pythons was that they NOT did sneak up on you and attack you as you were walking.  They look for much smaller prey.Unless animals see us as dinner or cannot see a way out, I think in 99% of the other cases they try to avoid us.  I decided that a snake skin is not a snake and moved in slowly for a closer look. Who knows what scratched ankles, broken limbs or painfully stubbed toes (not to mention damaged camera) I might have incurred had I followed my first instinct to run screaming down the path back to the house?  Fear is a guidance counselor...not a drill Sargent.  If you are having trouble understanding this post...click on the photo above.(As a post script for all who are afraid of mother nature, afraid of there not being enough (of whatever) to go around, afraid of the news, afraid of people who look, act and think differently than you...you are in for a very long scary ride.  I am so sorry.)"},

But these are all in contrast to his telling and showing me he loves me (on occasion),  helping me with my projects, going with me on my errands, watching some film noir with me (which he hates), letting me have control of the remote, putting up with my blogging (which to him is like reading cartoons), loving our children totally, and living peacefully with my anal retentive sense of organization.  The above is also balanced with his love of the outdoors, his efforts to be active and healthy and to encourage me to do the same, and his intelligent sense of humor.But a blogger posted this link which oddly brought tears to my eyes, because the woman in the video is my husband.  That is how he feels about the world.  He feels responsible.  His philosophy is that every big change begins with that first step and there is no need for recognition.  He does this when he is all alone in the woods and no one is watching!"},

Joining means to me that you will go to the meetings, setup for the events, volunteer to do the boring stuff that the other members tend to avoid.  You will be active and not just lend your name or a few dollars to the cause, club, institution.  As a result of this Puritanical attitude, I tend to avoid joining the majority of things that come my way.My Master Gardener program requires 40 hours of volunteer/leadership work the first year.  You are committed to the cause of sharing the gardening experience whether you like it or not.  You can count the monthly meetings and the time spent driving to and from places.  Since January I have put in about 10 hours.  This week I am committed to several errands and an event which will add another 4 or 5 hours of my time.  Of course, as spring commences, gardeners are needed everywhere.  I was talking to a fellow MSTG (Master Gardener) and she said when she first started her project, there were few places to volunteer time in our rural area.  Over the past few years, many more opportunities have developed.  I am guessing this is due to baby boomers nearing retirement and looking for things to do and thus creating community gardens for areas.  I must say that our business meetings are certainly energetic and the last one had about 30 attendees!While I was thinking of this process of joining I recently noticed new joiners (followers) to my blog(s).  I do not know how they found their way here in most cases.  I do not know if they even read my blog, because many do not comment on posts or comment only once.  I keep thinking that sometimes bloggers like to collect followers like friends on FB.  No communication is involved.  It is just a collecting thing.I have two lists I follow in blogging.  Sometimes I \"follow\" the blog on their page and then that blog shows up on the Blogger Dashboard page if they have made a recent post.  The other way is the old-fashioned way of creating a link to the blog in the html code of the my blogs design which then shows up in my sidebar of my blog page when they post.  This I still tend to do more often than the former.  I keep forgetting the other list.  Many on this second list have drifted off into the digital black hole of neglect.  They started writing with the best of intentions and then blogging lost its appeal or they were using it as a tool to sell something and not really blog, or life and living got in the way.My concern  has become that this following of blogs is just like joining.  My lists are getting long and I feel an obligation to read the majority of the posts of blogs I follow.  (Although I am not talking about your blog, of course, I head there first every time!)  I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings although I do not always feel a need to comment on the post, and as cute as that kitten is, I really have no time to read about it.These blogger lists are somewhat like my speedwell plant that I posted about on my other blog.  It is lovely, interesting, and in the beginning a most compelling plant.  But then it spreads and becomes a maintenance issue and must be tended, and the fun starts to fade a little and obligation rears its hard head.Do any other bloggers face this concern?  How do you deal with it?  I bet most of you are women...is this all just silliness on my part?"},

The are numerous columns and comments about e-reading versus physical copies of books.  I am still a sort of fence sitter.  I have found pros and cons...and thus I will list them.Pro Kindle (or perhaps other e-readers):Easy to transport.Easy to hold.Easy to read as font sizes can be enlarged immediately.Easy to bookmark a page, highlight a passage, look up a word in the e-dictionary.    (Although I have not figured out how to easily find the specific highlighted passage weeks later.  I have a photographic memory and could find it in the physical book by remembering how far in and where on the page.)Easy to buy a new book from ANYWHERE and download it in seconds.I can get the latest title without waiting for it to show up in the library or bookstore.I can peruse several chapters before buying.E-books are cheaper.It can hold something like 10,000 titles.Has free stuff and word games---the more you buy the more free stuff.Con Kindle:Photos are not in color.Some graphs and photos are not in electronic format at all.It is not as easy to peruse a book although one can search for details.I would miss the shelves of books in my house that start many a conversation with guests.I cannot loan wonderful books.It is a good format for reading...but art books, no!Keyboard is too small for my old hands.I no longer dare read in the bathtub.I am on a guilt trip thinking I may be undermining publishers and libraries.There is little serendipity with the e-book, you really read linearly.I still like the book format so very much (just like Captain Kirk.)The debate is now open for comments."},

{"title": "Gnarley Marley", "date": "Tuesday, March 08, 2011", "text": "(Let us hope this is the last of those travel posts that Tabor has become so dependant on.  No original thoughts rattling around in her brain...certainly!  What a real bore she would be if she didn't travel.)Bob Marley is an icon and hero to most of Jamaica.  They revere him as many revered Elvis Presley in the U.S. but his story is much more compelling.  His music is timeless, at least to me.  When I listen to it I feel young and there.  He wrote and sang protest music about the condition of mankind.We toured his home and studio.  Much of it bare rooms except for the bedroom and kitchen.  There are marvelous posters, news articles, and award albums on the walls and Marley music constantly playing in the background.  (We were not allowed to take photos.)  What is fun is the way the tour guide hums and dances to the music as she brings us through the rooms and tells his story.  It seems everyone in Jamaica can carry a tune...two of our tour guides sang to us that week.   I barely understand the Rastafari religion, but it is certainly quirky and deep, vegan diet and ganga weed combined and the belief that Haile Sellassie, who traced his roots to Solomon and Sheba, was seen as the black holy king to lead the negro race. Less quirky and more common was that Marley was born to an 18-year-old black girl (Cedella Booker) and fathered by Captain Norval Marley, a 50-year-old quartermaster attached to the British West Indian Regiment and a plantation owner.  Marley's parents were married, and thus, the Captain was forced to provide some financial support, but provided little else in the role of fatherhood for this young man before he died, Marley was 10 at that time.  Even without a father Marley grew up to be one of the most significant peace makers across racial lines in Jamaica with his music, traveling a marvelous journey from a poor home in Trenchtown outside Kingston to the homes of global leaders.  Bob Marley and the Wailing Wailers had their first big hit in 1963.  Bob Marley married and had three children.  He had at least eleven children total in his life when including those with other women.His growing international popularity also brought him into the arena of politics and to the front of the ongoing ghetto wars in Jamaica.  He and band members were shot while rehearsing in his home in 1976 in a hail of gunfire from the yard outside, perhaps because of a free concert he was planning to give to attempt some peace among his people.  They have covered most of the walls in this tragic room with board but left one bullet hole to view.  It is shockingly large and deep. He bravely played the controversial free concert the next night with a bullet still inside him and forced the two opposing political leaders to hold hands before the crowd (see the photo of the opportunists below).  This violent attack later caused him to go into a retreat in London, and he did not return to his beloved homeland until April of 1978.Bob Marley was also a fitness nut in that he ran almost every day and loved to play soccer.  An infection from a toe injury turned cancerous in his early 30's and he was told he would have to have the toe amputated.  He refused and within a few years he died of brain cancer at the age of 36.  This is just a thumbprint of the exotic life he led (excluding working as a lab assistant for Dupont) and if you search the Internet you can hear Buffalo Soldier, One Love, I Shot the Sheriff, and you will find so much more.\"The compilation album Legend (1984), released three years after his death, is reggae's best-selling album, going ten times Platinum (Diamond) in the U.S.,\"  Wikipedia."},

The plantation owner's home (he no longer lives there) was beautifully kept.  I bought three eight ounce bags of Jamaican Blue.   It made it through customs in the U.S. easily. Jamaican Blue is considered one of the most expensive coffees in the world.  (Forbes lists several coffees at $50 US a pound and I paid $30 US a pound for my Jamaican Blue...but this was AT the plantation.  It was $6 US more at the hotel.)  Most of this coffee is now in my freezer.  This plantation below is owned by a Japanese man, although run by a Jamaican and worked on by Jamaicans.  As a note, most of the Jamaican Blue coffee goes directly to Japan and I could not find this estate in any of my research on coffee reviews.  I did taste it at the estate and while it is not a robust coffee, it was nicely full-flavored and a little sweet.  Certainly better than anything I can get at Starbucks or other.  The guide told us that it is not the caffeine that gives one a boost after a cup but the other chemicals and/or sugar in the coffee...news to me.  I got my boost from the mountain views.Green coffee beans."},

While we could have rented a car, they drive on the 'wrong' side of the road and they also drive like crazy people sometimes.  Our J*** shuttle from the airport had a police radar active and it went off several times during that dark night as we took our speedy 2.5 hour trip to our hotel.  They told us most of the road accidents occur with tourists who drive on the 'wrong' side of the road or drive too 'slow.'  I think this means less then 15 miles over the speed limit.  We did not see any accidents while there, so perhaps the danger level is far lower than it seemed during our longer van trips.We did walk up Dunns River Falls which is a tradition I told myself I would go through.  Hubby had done this 40 years ago (with some dingy blonde in a tiny bikini when there was like one other couple) with absolutely no hand bars, decks, people with cameras, signs, chains of people holding hands, refreshment stands, people trying to sell you photos, etc.  Thus, my experience this time was far different than his original adventure.  It is a climb of about 3 football fields up and the only danger is the rapids which are so rough you cannot see where you place your feet.  My only injury was a skinned shin when hubby decided to help me make a rather large step up by pushing on my butt!  The other discomfort (other than masses of people) was the gravel that kept collecting in the river shoes.Sorry, no photos.  Too wet for cameras and the only photos they took I did not purchase and I am way too vane to print anyway.We also took a newer tourist ride...on the bamboo raft down the Martha Brae River in Jamaica.  It is a gentle and very safe little adventure.  I was hoping to see exotic wildlife, but only saw exotic craft/refreshment booths.  The guides were wonderfully friendly and also knew their history and most of their botany.No, that is not hubby and I on that raft in photo #3 but a charming young couple from Britain that went on the tour with us!  (And if you want photos of the birds and buds you have to check out my other blog.)"},

Jamaica.  Think about that word.  Close your eyes.  What do you see in your mind's eye?  If you have been there you will have a very different image than someone who has not and who must depend on news headlines or tourism ads.  I learned that Jamaica is far more developed in terms of tourism than I expected.  LOTS and LOTS of sterile all-inclusive hotels that have modern high-end shopping areas within walking distance near major beaches.  There are also the smaller and perhaps more tired hotels that retain island charm and a little far from any town or village.  I stayed somewhere in between.  I will tell you of my prejudice that I held before getting there.  I expected the people to be somewhat sullen and angry about their poverty.  After all, they came from slaves that had been treated extremely cruelly.  They fought hard for their independence.  I expected them to put up with me and my money but not interested in me as a person.  BUT I was very, very wrong.  The people of Jamaica are brilliant like sunshine.  They are polite and soft like a fragrant temperate breeze.  Many are well educated and anticipate your questions.  They are very patient and while some approach you only to start a conversation and then ask for money, most understand if you do not want to buy that wood carving or dress.  Most accept \"No thank you\" with generous grace.So Part I is all about the people:These young school boys on tour were more interested in us than the historic fort...just look at those mischievous smiles.The girls are more somber, but Jamaica culture does still view women as sex objectsand thus they approach the different with care.  I watched a soap opera or two on TVand hope women have stronger leaders sooner rather than later.Lots of folk art, but nothing I needed to take home.  Hereis a wood carver working on a Bob Marley bust.Every tropical area my husband tries to find that perfect drinkingcoconut that has bubbles.  They are hard to find!This young man worked on the coffee plantation (owned by a Japanese)that we visited.  I just LOVED his hair.This young pregnant gal worked outside our hotelwalking the beach andwaiting every day to braid someone's hair.  Not mybest look, so I passed.This fellow was taking a break at Spanish town.  Notice he has hispants leg rolled up for bike riding.He does this every day and yet that smile is so fresh and beautiful.These school girls are taking provocative poses ( like teenagers everywhere)and I wondered if this was going to end up on a Facebook page soon.We took a bamboo raft trip down the river and this guidewas on the raft behind us.For some this is a Caribbean vacation...NOT ME even if the rum is free!

Lauderdale to visit my husband's parents' graves which we haven't been to in a decade.  These pilgrimages are necessary at times and something I never thought I would do when I was younger and far less nostalgic.Then we are off to Jamaica, a last minute decision without forethought, an island I have always wanted to visit ever since I saw an Arthur Godfrey (he was an ancient TV personality) show filmed there.  I was about 12 at that time and the beauty of this island has always stayed in my mind.  We will see if the memory lives up to my expectations, because I am aware of the poverty, crime, and other problems of the island.  We are experienced travelers and rarely disappointed when we head out.   It will be difficult in my mind to once again be a very rich person in another land realizing my life is so covered in cotton batting.  This place will require us to be a little less adventuresome and more of a tourist, but the spirit of the Jamaican people has to count for something!  There should be plenty of opportunity for photos...and more boring posts when I return if we do not find ourselves too isolated at the resort and with 'canned' trips.So until then, unless I can post something while in Florida,  I will be both physically and virtually away AND I will not have to watch the Super Bowl!"},
{"title": "Blogging is Not for the Weak of Heart", "date": "Sunday, January 30, 2011", "text": "I never realized that blogging would impact me this way.  I have lost another blogger.  Oh, he never  rarely commented on my blog and I wasn't even on his blog list of blogs that he followed.  Actually, he posted only rarely as well.  He and his wife were the only hippies that I really knew, although vicariously.  Being as I never met them, and he blogged less and less, I guess I can't really say I knew him, can I?  So why do I feel as if I did?  Why do I feel as if we once met somewhere and were just keeping in touch via the Internet?His independence of spirit and willingness to live his beliefs and his interesting photographs were the things that drew me to reading his blog.  After retirement from being a Postman, he lived in the mountains of Southern California in a tiny house.  He and his wife, a lovely bird-like creature, once a model, sold their car and made do with bicycles to get to the local train station on infrequent shopping and visiting trips.  They belonged to food cooperatives, grew much of their own food, and for the most part lived off the land.  He valued independence from society as most hippies do and was hard on those who did not treat nature with respect.  He was wary of any big brother interference in his life and raised his children by the strict standards he set for himself.He and his wife had recently moved down to the plains for a brief period to help his mother with her house.  Then, after that, he blogged less.  And then, on January 22, he disappeared from this earth.Being the self-reliant guy he was, he left no indication he was having health problems and I do not know how Peggy, his wife, is coping and whether she will be able to stay in the home she loved so much.  They were a loving couple clearly happy in this end of life living so close to the earth.  I would never have known what happened to him had not his son, in pain, posted a brief epitaph.  If you want to know more about him and his life style go here.This blogging is not for the weak of heart nor the loner without a family shoulder to rest on.  It will grab you and shake you to your core and cause you to question your values and ideas and take a long hard look at your life.  When I began blogging it was all about putting into the ether sphere questions and feelings and events of my life...but then the great out there began to impact me back.  Who knew?"},

Any other person who called me 2 hours ahead to let me know he was coming to spend the night with a guest would get a piece of my mind or at the very least a lie about our sudden plans...except for my son whom I see not often enough.  Instead, he got a piece of my pot roast.I need to drink more water...really!  (Wine and tea and coffee are not enough.)You don't always get what you ask for or want and more often than not you get something you did not ask for.  I asked for bubble bath for the holidays, and since I found none in my stocking, I ended buying it on sale after Christmas.  I did not ask for a Kindle and did get that. It is hard to find meaningful volunteer work in a rural area if you do not belong to a church.I am a good and patient teacher, except when trying to teach my husband Windows stuff and I think this has more to do with Windows than either him or me (or is that he or I ?).My daughter had dinner with Rob Lowe recently and while they were prepared to talk entertainment industry, to my relief he really wanted to talk politics.  No air head there.Thread was recently found that was 30,000 years old made by humans using plant fibers (wild flax) in different colors on pottery.  It seems mankind has always wanted to make and decorate cloth.Flamingos use a makeup they secrete from a gland near their tail to keep their color bright during the breeding season when the colorful shrimp they eat are not available.  (How long before H. Couture starts selling lipstick made with essence of flamingo butt for thousands of dollars?)One of the most moving exhibits I have ever seen is the Pulitzer Prize Photos Gallery displayed at the Newseum in Washington, DC.  It brought me to tears several times and reinforced my love of the power of photography.A 47 F degree gray day with gusty wind is much colder than a 27 F degree sunny day with no wind. I fear the world will go to 'hell in a hand basket' if my children's generation continue to value \"reality\" television over reality.  I stumbled across The Bachelor while waiting for another movie to start and actually got nauseous watching the last ten minutes. Why in the hell we spent time burning bras....?And finally, the best thing I learned this year, is that no matter how many new years come around each is a valuable opportunity to do it better this time.(One thing I wondered about most recently and have not learned is why is bicycle not pronounced like motocycle in the English language?)"},
{"title": "The Power of Rhetoric", "date": "Monday, January 10, 2011", "text": "I wrote a long and complaining post a few weeks ago.  I was smart to sit on it.  I had scheduled it for posting on the 20th of this month and just now I marked it as a draft and will probably not post it, and once I get over myself, will actually delete it.  It was one of those \"the world is going to hell in a hand basket\" posts.  Since we all know that is true...why belabor the point?  People have enough crud in their minds and probably read blogs for enlightenment or humor...although both of these are in limited amounts on my blog.  The recent Arizona shooting of a large number of people including a Congressman(woman) and a Federal judge brought me to my knees...and most of you know by now that I am not a religious person but certainly spiritual and willing to call on any good powers that be.  But the tragedy also caused me to remove that scheduled post.This shooting while involving public servants had very little to do with politics, and I think most of the media are missing that point, although by the time I write this, they may be getting more accurate in their questions.  This shooting was no more Republican than President Ronald Reagan's shooting was Democratic.  Drawing a line from this incident to violent rhetoric is also fuzzy and difficult. The most frightening aspect, to me, was Secretary Gates recent announcement of plans to cut military health care at the same time the talking news heads were discussing the lack of aggressive mental health support for this shooter.  Gates is probably just shaking the bushes as no one will allow this.  He knows that.  He doesn't talk about tighter controls over contracts and lost money in Iraq, unfortunately!  But if anyone needs easy mental health support, it will be our returning troops.Well enough.  I need to find something more inspiring to post.This is my Chihuly inspired photo of the leaves of fall.  Dave Chihuly, for those who live on the edge of the wilderness, is a famous glass artist.  Born in 1941 his Hungarian, Slavic, Czech, Norwegian, Swedish ancestry may have contributed to his varied and zig-zagged path to glass blowing fame.  He exhibits all over the world and has many permanent and temporary exhibits in museums and hotels and restaurants.  I first saw his work in Las Vegas many years ago.  I recently saw a documentary about him and that inspired my work with the photo of fall leaves above.  I think the fragility of his work lends even more interest as well as controversy to what he does.  The work is mostly beautiful without making a statement as many other art media do.Below is a photo that I took of pink grasses in the early morning sun at the National Arboretum last fall.  Continuing with the flowing glass theme after some photo-shopping they almost look like glowing or broken glass... no?  My work with digital photos is also just about as fragile as I tend to just experiment without any plan and don't save my steps and therefore, cannot recreate it on a similar photo.  Anyway, I kind of like these, or are people not supposed to say that about their creations?"},

I use PhotoShop Elements 8 which allows me to index photos by adding subject tags, people tags and even GEO/place tags.  I spent several hours going through bird photos tagging them by species and when I was all done, I checked my email and when I came back the entire December folder and most of the Bird folder were missing their files! Nothing was in my recycle bin and I couldn't find them using Windows Explorer.  Therefore, they were not just disconnected from the photo catalog in PSE8...they were gone!  I have tried to find the solution on the web but mostly Adobe just tells people they must have done something wrong because the software does not delete files by itself...! I have been reasonably good about backing up photos either on CDs or another hard drive I have...but I only do that once a month, so missed that opportunity by a few days as I was still reviewing and weeding files.  I will get over this.  It is not someone's wedding or birthday photos...just my crap...my precious crap!"},

I started my interest while in college watching various college football games and then male friends spurred (?...in oh so many ways?) my interest in professional football.  I knew the players and the team rankings.  I think it was after my children were all potty-trained that I realized I had outgrown this sport.  The talking heads talked way too much, the replays from every angle possible went on too long and the drugs and money were too mind boggling for me to look at these guys as athletes anymore. I began to see that a 10 second play took more than three minutes to review/discuss/repeat.  (This was not the fall of the Berlin Wall, after all.)  Football is now the absolutely SLOWEST game on the planet in a culture that encourages video games with numerous explosions and demolition derbies.  In America there are homes where games can be on back to back for 9 hours on a weekend day!  When get-togethers were just the blood relatives I would busy myself with cleaning up dishes after Thanksgiving or watching something else somewhere else while the gang watched their games.Today if there is a game (and puleeze when isn't there a game?) I retreat to read in the bedroom or hubby heads to our TV downstairs while I watch something I had previously recorded.  If the game becomes a bore, he re-joins me in a short time.  A few weekends ago I had planned a nice dinner for my daughter, who with two little ones and a pending child, rarely gets a break.  I selected several CD's for nice casual dining atmosphere and had them playing.  When they all arrived I was outside on the deck handling a small emergency for my husband involving a deer, a gun and the neighbors.  I was greeted on the deck by daughter and kids but after 10 minutes wondered where S.I.L. was.  I went back inside to find he had turned off the music and turned on the football game.  He was standing watching it even before he had greeted his host or hostess!  I let him know in no uncertain terms that I at least expected a hug and greeting BEFORE football took his total attention!  This real issue, which a mother-in-law will bravely admit, is that I do not get a chance to visit with my daughter as I would like because she is the one babysitting while her husband is watching the game.  There are some men that can do two things at one time...but I do not know many of them.My son's 'new' girlfriend recently turned 33.  She had planned a birthday party at her house with the theme on threes.  She set up her Ipod for her favorite music.  She had cooked various meals with three ingredients or three in the name but was dismayed to find when she emerged with snacks from her kitchen the guys had turned off her Ipod speakers and turned on the TV for their Alma Mater game!  Their argument was that it was THEIR college and they really wanted to see this.  Her argument was that it was HER birthday and she wanted conversation and music!  She, being the hostess and knowing her mind, won.Does anyone else find football addiction as rude and intrusive as I do?  Shouldn't the hostess be the one to determine if she wants a pseudo tail-gate party or an actual get-together where you play games or talk with friends and family or break-up into sports and mind groups?  If someone says lets get together and eat before the game...that is different.  But does every weekend get-together have to be a game day?  Am I being hopelessly narrow-minded or very naive or heading down a path of no return?"},

A 'princess' has joined my entourage since I wrote this...so I am back to 58...no back to 57!  Did I lose another one?I am currently using '50.7%' of my Picasa photo storage for Blogger.  As a person who took almost 900 photos just last month and deleted only 400, the fear of the eventual need to upgrade storage in my blog photos stalks my every post.I am trying to wean myself from checking Blogger a half dozen times a day (or more!) when I am home alone.  I need to enrich my life, I guess.  I am so addicted to your comments and to the fact that you read what I say and I even do not mind criticism (polite suggestions on viewing things a little differently) although most bloggers are too polite.  Maybe I could be Fran Lebowitz and not care what people think.I also am dismayed by the bloggers that I link to that have quit posting...I just can't seem to find the courage to remove those links from my list.  I also feel the same way about FB.  People befriend me and then NEVER post anything!  I wish I had the courage to defriend them as they have become stalkers in my mind...but they KNOW me, so it is not as easy to do as it might be in my blogging network.I actually am trying to consciously keep my blogger reader demographics broad.  I know that I have much in common with those my age and with my interests, but for the same reason I will never live in a retirement community, I am trying to proactively add younger readers and readers with different views to my lists.If you think you have been blogging a long time, the first blog (daily online journal) was published electronically in 1994 by a young man named Justin Hall and the link to that blog is still ongoing and here. In 2004, \"blog\" was the word of the year...I didn't know they had a word-of-the-year.  I am so stupid sometimes.The precursor in naming a blogger or online journalist was escribitionist.  Maybe that should be a word of the year.  (Colleen, see if you can work that into your next Scrabble game.)I look at blogging as chapters of a diary of someone's life and Facebook as the footnotes (which are sometimes more like anecdotes or my   daily boring life activity notes).Is it true that a new blog is created every second around the world?  How many die every second?Perhaps the most important change blogging has made is allowing social activism from the smallest 'end of the tail' and not just from the large and 'popular' opinions.  Information is powerful, especially when we find others thinking like us.The most important change for me is learning that you do not have to meet someone face to face to get to know them and sometimes there is a little magic that happens in blogland and we become very good friends.  I can remember how shy and intimidated I was about blogging when I first started."},

{"title": "The Ship of Life", "date": "Wednesday, December 01, 2010", "text": "(My prior post was about shipwrecks...so I will continue the theme.)Life is something that has its own energy and schedule and pace even though we think we can control this ship of state fate.  We are here only as passengers on this ride, and while we try to steer the ship as best as possible, we are not aware of hidden shoals or unpredictable zephyrs that will delay our progress or throw us way way off course.The stylish lady in the photo above was my mother-in-law.  The gentle beauty on her face reveals what a good and generous person she was.  She grew up in a small town in Michigan.  Her parents ran a sometimes successful photography shop with her father giving his work away and her mother holding customers strictly to paying their bills.  This dance between the two of them provided a reasonable income for the family and respect in the community.  She also had a younger brother.  As a teenager she probably had the best start in life that anyone could ask for.  Her life was like a Mickey Rooney movie.But her ship was destined to go through a number of perfect storms. After high school she used her lovely singing voice and sang for several large mid-west orchestras before she went on the vaudeville road.  While in vaudeville she met and married another singer whose love of alcohol destroyed the marriage.  This was a terrible embarrassment during that time as divorce was something discussed only in whispers.  Then another hidden shoal, a goiter, brought her singing career to an abrupt halt.  She returned home broken but unbowed to help her father in his shop.  Her second husband (my husband's father) fell in love with her photograph when dropping off some film and pursued her until she married him.He had been married before and had three children.  His first marriage broke up violently and his drinking probably contributed to that.  My mother-in-law was not going to give up on another marriage and stuck by his violent outbursts and his frequent job changes and many moves, and in her late thirties gave birth to my husband.  My husband was the golden child doted on by both parents and probably very much the reason the marriage held together.  She also became a binge drinker when life got too stressful and after her son moved to college which contributed to bringing fog to the years as she aged. During this time her only brother, who had married and had a daughter, was badly beaten in a robbery in California and his brain was so damaged that he never returned to full mental capacity leaving his family to struggle through poverty.  There were rumors that he had been visiting a prostitute at the time.  It broke my M.I.L.'s heart.A decade later after her mother's death (the stronger soldier in the parental unit) my mother-in-law had to put her father in a rest home in Virginia because her husband could not bear to see him aging and would not let him live with them.  She was very close to her father and this must have been almost unbearable for her to drop him off among strangers so far from what both of them knew as home.Years past and I met her as the single daughter-in-law.  I knew my own mind and my independence was probably a little strange to her.  Within weeks after the birth of my first child I watched her go through some serious heart surgery and then a few years later watched her manage the 24-hour care of her husband who had emphysema from his years of smoking.  She survived in spite of our fear that she would pass first.  After she was widowed she came to live near us, and then eventually moved in with us, as her dementia set in.  I am of the opinion that dementia can bring blissful routine when yesterday's tragedies are pretty much forgotten.The last years of her life as she stayed with us, she was sure she was visiting with her brother and his wife and going home as soon as she felt better.  We went along with the painful charade because she was a very special person and it was easier that way.  Perhaps her life would have been much different if just one of those storms went off-track.  But, then again, perhaps not."},
{"title": "A Little Bay", "date": "Saturday, November 27, 2010", "text": "There were 20 tons of bolt metal per ship.I live in the mid-Atlantic and am surrounded by interesting history.  There is a ghostly and mystical place nearby that I had always wanted to visit, but did not have the opportunity until recently when the access had been created.  This was another one of those special canoe trips.  There is something about a canoe that lets you slide right up and hear the ghost's sigh and smell the ancient air and sneak behind the bright day to snatch the history.  Besides you really cannot get deeply into this shallow and maze-ridden area by anything other than a canoe or kayak.This place is a little embayment just off the Potomac River called Mallows Bay.  The day was almost cold and certainly eerily gray and misty with lots of exotic shadows.  Perfect for a ghostly paddle into and over some history.  The cries of a few water birds and the crash of leaves from the rare startled deer in the forest on the shore were about all we heard...except...well let me not get ahead of myself.  First, here is a little history, greatly shortened for there is a whole book on this area.We have to go back to 1917 and WWI.  President Woodrow Wilson put out a call for building many more ships (ten times more) as we entered this war since we were going to move quickly and supply an American Army in Europe to defeat the Germans.  Because metal ship building was too slow and expensive, an engineer suggested the building of 1000 cheaper wooden cargo steamships to send across the Atlantic and past the many German submarines.  (I wondered if it even crossed the engineer's mind about the greater danger to those sailors making the crossing on these more fragile ships.)  Eighty-seven shipyards across the United States from the east to the west coasts got contracts to build this armada.  Bureaucratic delays and ineptitude and Germany's eventual surrender came as over 100 ships were completed with few to none crossing the Atlantic.  But an additional 200 ships continued to be built as the war wound down, and even as there were charges of poor assembly, leaky design and over contract budgets, the construction continued...sound familiar?Eventually the fleet was mothballed along the James River at a large expense to the American taxpayer and finally offered for sale 'as is.'  A Virginia marine salvage company bought many for salvage of the metal, but accidental fires and sinking of vessels at their shipyard compromised nearby navigation and threatened the important shad fishery in the area.  The company was forced to move to the more remote area known as Mallows Bay and a massive facility was built to rapidly move this salvage operation along.  In one day a large number that had been towed to the area were torched in the shallow waters to reduce them immediately for metal salvage.  I cannot imagine the water pollution that resulted and the skies filling with acrid smoke.The area soon became a graveyard for the remaining ships buried there because the stock market crash of the 1920's brought the price of scrap metal to a new low halting salvage operations.  Other entrepreneurial development near the salvage operation included bootleggers and floating brothels.  They were less accessible to the long arm (paddle) of the law due to the abandoned shipwrecks making navigation dangerous in the waters.  Of the 285 steamships built, approximately 152 ended up in this bay and today the remaining 80 or so lie at rest in all states of deterioration.  The area became important once again when the advent of WWII renewed the value of scrap metal, but this value was only temporary.  The area was soon abandoned and now efforts are being made to keep it as an historic sight and as nature has grown to reclaim the area, an environmentally rich artificial reef has formed.  There has been some wheeling and dealing of a shady nature in recent decades due to the valuable real estate.  Only time will tell how protected the area will remain.While quietly and carefully going between the sunken hulls and avoiding the dangerously protruding metal spikes that could poke a hole in our aluminum canoe, we did hear, without warning and with breath-taking suddenness, a single large explosion that boomed across the glassy waters' surface and broke the quiet air.  We held our breath waiting.  It must have been from the military testing base nearby, because, after a while, no helicopters or boats raced down the river toward the sound.  Just a ghostly and frightening reminder of wars, I guess.These photos were taken at high tide and I hope to return in the summer at a low tide for even more interesting shots."},

{"title": "The Truth, the Whole Truth", "date": "Sunday, November 14, 2010", "text": "I sometimes take hundreds of photographs on a day trip.  I used to be conservative and clearly egotistical thinking that I should be selective and only try to take the 'best' shots.  I also felt going through 300 photos when I got home would be a headache.  It isn't really...just deleting 99% is the tedious part.  I find that among those 300 there is usually one or two worthy of a post or adding to my collection.  I realized that just posting these 2 or 3 was not a fair or realistic story of my photographic trips.  So below is a more accurate photographic journey that I took in the canoe just a few weeks ago.  (The 3% will be posted on my other blog in the future.)It was a beautiful if somewhat nippy fall morning.  We drove up to the landing at a small river that flows into a small bay that is a protected area for wildlife.  The foggy mist was just lifting from the water and made for a nice but not great early morning shot.  I had to carefully stand in some squishy wet grass that was just beginning to thaw from the early frost and to lean out across the water.  It was hard to see where the land ended and the deeper part of the river bank began.  I only got a few toes wet and cold which is the sacrifice one makes for a photo.The air was crisp and the sky was a perfect November blue.  Some of the trees were still clinging to their colored leaves and the water was like glass.  I had my camera, my paddle, my paddle-mate, my warm gloves, my travel mug of hot coffee and a package of donuts.  Perfect for this little Queen, I thought. I was able to manage a paddle stroke and a sip of coffee while resting my bismarck on the bow of the canoe.  I had the rhythm going.  Of course it helps that your mate does 90% of the paddling while you eat and drink.  As we got to the wider part of the river we could hear the geese that were sheltering in this preserve.  The sound of gunfire was intermittent in the distance which must have been making them leery.We heard the geese chattering long before we rounded the grassy point and actually saw them tucked against the marsh. I immediately recognized the photo op and quickly set down my coffee cup which promptly spilled on my foot warming my previously chilled toes...but I got the first shot before the geese were bolting.  I watched them gently swimming away from us and grumbling to each other as I dabbed at my now warm foot with my wool neck scarf and uprighted my travel mug.  I lowered the camera and removed my gloves and took a bite of the frosting sticky donut and noticed the geese didn't fly.  I licked my chocolate frosted fingers as I pondered the hesitation of the geese. Suddenly without warning and just to the back of my left shoulder a large flock of ducks broke the silence screaming in panic.  I rarely can get photos of our wild ducks, the above photo being a prime example.  They are very leery and so my heart jumped at seeing so many and so close as they raced across the bow of the canoe quacking and flapping.  I grabbed my camera covering the hand grip with frosting and snapped this blurry tilted photo above.  Then while trying to manually focus for a better shot I got more frosting on the lens!I grabbed the damp wool scarf at my feet and brushed it across the lens quickly and leaning back in the canoe snapping this shot above my head as the ducks banked left toward another marsh.  Please notice the framing, the focus and the artistic use of lint which is not something I have seen on many photos.  (You should click on the photo for the complete experience.)Oh, yeah, I also got this sharp photo of a hawk...feel free to identify!"},
{"title": "Wars", "date": "Thursday, November 11, 2010", "text": "(As a pre-script today is our Veterans Day.) It is not hyperbole to write that World War Two changed the world.  It was fought on 6 of the 7 continents and in all of the major oceans.  British historian John Keegan wrote \"It killed 50 million human beings, left hundred of millions wounded in mind and body...\"  In early November we had a cold spell but were entertaining family so ended up walking on the windy National Mall.  My son's new girlfriend volunteers one weekend a month at the World War II Memorial, and thus, we got a special private tour.  It is a vast and impressive memorial, the newest on the Mall.  In spite of this, my mind and heart collide when viewing any impressive symbol of the death of so many good people. I have just finished reading The Book Thief  about a young girl growing up in Germany during this time and the visit to this memorial was most searing that day as the images of what had happened in Germany were still in my mind.  I am also reading a true story about another war, The Reluctant Spy:  My Secret Life in the CIA's War on Terror by John Kiriakou where he confirms that evidence was beginnning to be manipulated by the administration in their commitment to go to war with Iraq back in 2002.  This administrative focus adversely impacted the CIA's resource commitment to finding bin Laden and ultimately led to CIA Director George Tenet's resignation.  Kiraiakou's job was to provide the intelligence reports that he found were so heavily redacted and even changed by Chaney and his staff.  This may well be the longest war. The World War II Memorial Act was introduced by Democrat Marcy Kaptur back in 1987.  It became a bipartisan effort in 1993 and finally was approved by both houses of Congress and signed into law on May 25 of 1993. Four hundred designs for this memorial were submitted.  In 1997 an Austrian-American's  (Friedrich St. Florian) design was chosen...which is karma...isn't it?   Actual completion of all of the details of the design by various entities did not happen until 2003.Former President Bill Clinton appointed a 12-member advisory board and they raised 197 million dollars from citizens including 16 million from the federal government.Design and construction was fraught with controversy including the location.  People were concerned that the sweeping views between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Memorial would be blocked.  Thus they dug down below the horizon so that the sweeping view remains.  The round pool in the photos was actually the Rainbow Pool  which was already there.  The memorial was opened to the public on April 29, 2004.The memorial is divided into the Pacific and Atlantic theaters of WWII on each side of the pool. The monument consists of  hundreds of symbols in the bronze sculptures and in the bronze reliefs and in the inscriptions.  The placement of state names and U.S. territories was carefully chosen.  Materials for construction were also selected from various areas of the United States.  A concerted effort was made to recognize those women who assisted in the war at home.  I learned that the 24 bronze bas relief panels depicting the war years, at home and overseas, are made from actual historic photos.  The 4048 gold stars along the far wall (Freedom Wall) each represent 100 Americans who died in the war.  An interesting fact that I learned and couldn't find on the web is that the two victory columns have wind monitors that change the height of the volume of water pumped into the fountain so that on windy days visitors standing nearby won't get wet!  For the next few years when visiting the memorial you will be able to see veterans of this war.  Most arrive in wheelchairs or with canes and walkers.  There is a program of some kind that helps finance their visit including allowing the payment of an assistant.   Most just come with their families.  It is moving to see them come and look out over the monument in silence or while talking and reminiscing with others that fought this war with them.  Our guide did say that she occasionally gets a question from a visiting foreigner on why the Memorial is U.S. centric since it was a 'world' war.  She tries to be diplomatic in her answers.  Expectations on being the leader of a free world are surprising sometimes."},

We finally got to the very crowded metro platform, and after waiting 25 minutes, a train arrived that was so full of people it couldn't open its doors.  We then realized that more time even hours would pass before we could get on a train.Standing nearby we got to talking to a couple our age that had flown in from Monterey California two days earlier.  He had a business meeting, but they had decided before they left California to stay for the rally. She was an American citizen born in France and he was an American citizen born in in India.  She was as round as he was thin, but both were full of energy.  All four of us decided we had to walk to the rally.  Good thing they were regular bikers and we were regular hikers because it was at least 6-7 miles before we could catch a cab to take us the last 2-3 miles closer to the mall.Once at the mall we had to wiggle and squeeze between many bodies to sneak closer to the front just to see the screens and be able to hear the speakers.  I stood mostly in a group of young people perhaps 18-25 years in age, but in front of me was a young couple with a baby (!) and directly behind us stood a retired couple.  My feet did go numb after standing for 3 hours...but that passed once I started walking again after the rally was over.We waited almost two hours after the rally (getting some chocolate and cabernet savignon at Co Co. Sala's) before deciding to try to catch a metro home.  The crowds were still large but manageable.  On the metro we met and assisted two young college kids from Boston with directions.  They had to ride the metro out our way as they had a gift certificate for free meals at a restaurant on our metro stop.This was NOT a political rally (no political speeches--no politicians) but a few signs carried by rally attenders made fun of the conservative Fox News Channel which had been caught reporting news using inaccurate videos or by focusing repeatedly on inaccurate re-statements said by their pundits.As a famous liberal columnist said :  \"The rally was a simple reminder that certain things bring out the best in people, and certain things bring out the worst. It's not that the people who attended the rally or watched it enthusiastically on television were nicer or better than those who didn't. It's that the rally tapped into the humanity we all share, but that is rarely called forth, shown, or celebrated by our media or our political leaders. As promised, the rally was non-partisan -- making the mainstream media's unwillingness to allow their reporters to attend all the more ludicrous. Not surprisingly, many in the media seem to have totally missed the point of the day, even though Stewart clearly laid it out in his brilliant closing speech. Better to miss the point, and dismiss the event, than deal with the witty but powerful indictment the Daily Show host delivered.\" Having never attended a rally, I am glad that I went to this one.  I still think that the reasonable people of this world will emerge as leaders and statesmen and that those of the angry rhetoric will be seen for the immature and uncreative approaches they are using in these trying times.  I must say that I am gloomed by the fact that among those re-elected to high office recently was a Senator that believes that carrying AK-47 weapons is 'normal' and a right at a political rally, believes that repealing the Civil Rights act is not dangerous but a good thing for American business, and that stomping on the head of a small women by a grown man as another grown man stands by yelling is \"unfortunate\" but not necessarily something he has control over among his supporters, they are just so passionate and ardent about their beliefs.   He will soon be a very powerful person in our government in that he will be able to stop legislation single-handed via filibuster. (Apologies for the screwy fonts...Blogger has me on the ground with its foot at my neck.)"},
{"title": "I Was Sane for a Day", "date": "Wednesday, November 03, 2010", "text": "First let me preface this by stating that I am 63 years young and (to my knowledge) have never attended a rally.  I guess I have always felt that no one cares about my cheer.  Well, I happen to love the intelligent and funny humor of both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert...so I did attend the Rally for sanity and/or Fear on the Washington DC Mall on October 30th. (For those few readers of mine who live in other countries these two men are very popular comedians on cable TV's Comedy Channel and have been making fun of the inaccuracies and exaggeration of news and politics on both sides of the aisle for several years.  They end up hitting the truth on the head with their commentary.  They lean liberal but are pretty careful not to affiliate with any candidate or party and consider everyone fair game.)Officially from Jon Stewart the purpose of this rally: \"This was not a rally to ridicule people of faith. Or people of activism or to look down our noses at the heartland, or passionate argument or to suggest that times are not difficult and that we have nothing to fear. They are and we do. But we live now in hard times, not end times. And we can have animus and not be enemies.\" There were celebrities and funny skits and singing, but the goal was to remind people that discussions of our disagreements begin with dialog...not shouting at each other or calling each other names.  Even violence was recently brought to light again when a supporter of the newly elected Senator Paul Rand brought a women to the ground at a rally and several men began punching her and one even put his foot on her neck!  Senator Rand refused to acknowledge the violence.\"According to the best estimate, using aerial photos from Jon Stewart's \"Rally to Restore Sanity,\" approximately 215,000 people attended the event.   The estimate was made by AirPhotosLive.com.  That company is considered the most reputable as they publish the methodology behind their estimate, and also release the aerial photos they used to come up with their numbers.  Others simply tend to use the non-scientific method of \"I think\" in coming up with their estimates.  This company was commissioned by CBS News to come up with the estimate, and also has been hired by the Pentagon to do crowd size estimates.\"  The Metro said they had sold over 300,000 tickets by 2:00PM and we could not get on and had to WALK 7 miles from our start point because the metro was packed by  11:00 AM. MANY of us walked. Later the D.C. metro posted this table after the event.  Over 825,000 rode that day...and many walked or drove!Of course, some people will say that Washington, DC is liberal and that is why the numbers are so high, but this doesn't negate the rallies that took place in other cities across the nation nor the fact that the people I met and talked to....about 20 of them were 50/50 in terms of living in-district or even nearby.BUT having written all of this above, the theme of this rally seemed to agree with this statement by social scientist Robert Putnam in USA today article:  Our research for American Grace makes very clear that whereas religion and politics in the public arena are highly polarized, in our private lives Americans are much more tolerant and comfortable across religious lines.Now more even than in the past, many of our most intimate relations, including our marriages and our \"go-to\" friends whom we count on in a crisis, cross religious lines, including the line between \"religion\" and \"no religion.\"But the angry public debate gives everyone on all sides of the issues the impression that we are in a no-holds-barred struggle of good versus evil. We are a lot less divided than we think we are, and that mis-perception is itself a big part of the problem. Here are a few photos of the event and in my next post I will write about the people I met.We had to walk from Ballston on the far left (no pun intended) to the far right of the map on the mall.  Shared a cab when we reached Georgetown. I am so in shape! (Click on photos if you want.)There is the Washington Monument...only a few more miles to go, swim?This was as close we could get.  Crowd was about 60% under thirty and 30% over up tous oldies but goodies.  Mostly white but enough diversity to make me happy.  Mostly liberalbut also some conservatives...all moderates.Tony Bennett (on the jumbotron in the lower right) sang God Bless America at the end.  I never thought I would have the opportunity to  hear him liveand all our sacrifices were well worth it.Here is the end of the rally about two blocks from the mall.  Plenty of taxis around but not a taxi available for miles!  It was a reallove fest as absolutely no one ended up shouting or in anger or drunkor on pot that I could see."},

I can only eat leftovers once that week and either they get frozen, or the next time around have to be incorporated into something very different on the taste spectrum, or they get thrown out.  This theme is true with restaurants.   It is unusual that I will go back to the same restaurant without going to other restaurants in between. I do not like to watch the same movie more than once.  (With the exception of Cars, Toy Story, or Tinkerbell because I love holding hands and watching movies!)  There are a few that I will re-see with lots of time in between but that is rare.  (Oddly enough I will watch re-runs of Star Trek or Public Television British mysteries until the cows come home, and we have no cows.)I will go on a wine tour but that can only happen once or twice a year...then I am done with the whole wine thing for many months.  I am not excited about going back to any annual festival even if I have enjoyed myself the first year I attended.I will only go to the art museum when they change the exhibit, even if the attendance is free.I regularly juggle my music on my CD system.  Light Latin, movie themes, retro music, cool jazz and then on to independent international stuff or favorite singers for a while.When I worked I had a rather large wardrobe because I would not wear the same outfit unless three weeks had passed.I do get bored if I see people I know too often.  Fortunately my current hermit existence resolves that problem for both them and me.I do feel that variety is the spice of life.  Thus my husband frequently says to me,  \"How did you stay with me so long?\"That is a good question.  He is very predictable after 40 years of marriage.  Our lives are becoming even more routine as we mesh our rhythms together in this retirement.  I think I have fit in this relationship because he is high energy and I am more laid back.  When I need an energy boost I go with him.  When I want to read and drink a glass of wine or take photos in the yard, I send him on his way to his project with my good wishes.  He will compromise, and naturally, I will get what I want.There are those that hate change in routine, love the coziness of the predictable and want every day just like yesterday if yesterday was good.  There are those who could fill every day with the repetition of their hobby or passion.What about you?  Where do you fall on the spectrum?"},

 From where?  Pastries from the cellar?  Fresh pastries from the former wine storage room?  More likely there was a former coal mine below.)I saw a few sad rolls, two muffins and a cinnamon bun in the old fashioned case.  I asked for the cinnamon bun and coffee.  She handed me a white mug and pointed to the coffee pots on the side near the door.  I poured a cup of something, not really caring what as I wanted to just sit down and disappear.  I tried to pour from the cream jug and it appeared to be empty.  I tried the milk jug.  \"Sorry but it looks like both of these are empty.\" \"Hon, you will have to wait, I am the only one here until noon.\"   The only other four customers were drinking coffee and also waiting...  She was really busy.Hubby ordered the fried egg sandwich but made the mistake of asking for tea.   \"That is going to take some time, outa hot water right now.\"  We both looked at each other in concern and I retreated to the far table for two against the wall.  Hubby then asked if she had Earl Gray (!)  She looked at him and replied: \"If you want me to look in the back you will have to wait. \" He suggested he would drink whatever tea she had available and then joined me at the table. Finally one of the old-timers (yeah, they were the same age as me and hubby...so what?!) got tired of staring at us and returned my tentative smile and asked where we were from.  We told our little tale of coming to the badlands to take photos and maybe see the dinosaur museum.The waitress behind the counter turned away from frying the egg and asked me if I wanted my bun heated, and I assume she meant the one I ordered for breakfast.  Knowing it was probably made last Friday and dry as toast, I said yes.The old guy at the table turned to the waitress and asked her if the museum was open on Monday.  He wondered aloud if they were now on the winter schedule.  She looked up at him and I think she was thinking...either about what he said or whether she was going to throw the spatula at him.  He turned to the women sitting next to him and asked the same question.  She responded with a similar expression on her face.As we waited the other one of the two women, dressed in a flower print dress and sweater that reminded me of what my grandmothers wore, stood up, and lifting a cell phone out of her purse, asked in a voice loud enough to be heard in the 'wine cellar' if she could get a bus ticket for mid-morning. (Was everyone in this town hard of hearing?)  The contact on the phone must have said 'yes', because she hung up and hugged the other women and said good-bye to the two men and headed out the door.  As she reached the door one of the men said something to her.  She turned and waddled back to the table and then around to where we sat and pulled a wheeled basket with a grocery sack inside from behind my chair and then headed back out the door as her companions stoically watched.The waitress brought me my warmed cinnamon bun and I actually apologized (fully intimidated by her at this time) and said I could have come up to the counter and gotten it myself.As the egg sandwich cooked and the water boiled the man at the table began to relate various places we should see while visiting their little town including their very interesting coal mine and its' museum and the homestead antique museum.  While these were probably very nice, we really just wanted to see the dinosaur bones.I looked up as the waitress behind the counter picked up the phone and in her normal (loud) voice asked 'Betty' at the other end of the phone line if the dinosaur museum was open on Monday.  She listened and then hung up and turned to us and said 'Betty' would call back.  As luck would have it, during our gourmet breakfast we learned when Betty called back that the museum was indeed on winter hours and not open on Mondays.  But, by this time, we were beginning to get the 'rhythm' of this New York style of hospitality in a small town in the Badlands of Canada."},

Racing along the highway I was in agony missing this sunrise which I snapped addictively from the rental car as cold morning air blew in my face and large semi-trucks raced ahead.       We were heading to a town called Drumheller.  The name alone reflects the harshness of a town in a valley surrounded by flat topped dry hills.  It is an old coal mining town.  139 mines were registered between 1911 and 1979 and there is a coal mining museum that tells the hard story.  We did not stop to visit the museum and the last mining site although it has been designated a national historic site in Canada.People here are solid and probably conservative.  The Passion Play which is held every year is currently a claim to fame and draws people for hundreds of miles.Drumheller is also known as Dinosaur valley because some important fossils have been found and the town has a claim to having the \"largest dinosaur statue\" in the world...which hadn't been on my bucket list to see, but now is (was).  There is a stunning modern paleontology museum which was closed on Mondays to us and so we missed that interpretation of this exceptional area.  If you are curious please go here for some fun.Just north of here is another town called Hanna where the group Nickelback originated  (I will leave you to do your detective work to figure out where the name came from...you couch potatoes already know.)  There is something so totally talented and in abundance in the music gene pool of Canadians.  I like this group (Nickelback) , but not necessarily their evolutionary change in music as they move out of the valley.Anyway, we did meet a few interesting town 'folks' of that solid small-town ilk which I will include in the next post."},

Now that I am a 'gray beard' I usually meet the odd ducks and adventurers, like us.We passed this fellow at right in the photo above at the bottom of the highway.  He was trying to hitch a ride up the mountain on a cool Canada morning.  His funny bear hat drew my attention as well as his smile.  Hubby was not that comfortable about stopping for him and drove on by.  As the fates would have it we met him at the bottom of the Larch Valley hike just a little while later.  The park service had been seeing grizzlies in the area and had a sign at the bottom of this rather strenuous hike telling people that they had to hike in groups of four.  (I think since this was one of the most popular hikes in the area at this time of year that any grizzly would attack only because the crowds going up and down were driving him nuts!) The young man asked if he could walk up with us.  Hubby commented that made us only three, but I argued that this tall young man counted easily as two if we encountered a grizzly.  Since there was no ranger in sight nor any sign indicating a fine, we started off as three.To protect his privacy I will call him Sandy.  The first thing I learned from Sandy is that he taught CPR in Australia.  He went on to say that the CPR exercise really did not work, but the electronic defibrillator would be the tool that will save someone's life and then add CPR after that!  He told me if I ever had to use one to not worry about lack of training as these AEDs are well designed for success.  Of course both my husband and I were panting and had to stop every 10 minutes on this steep trail to catch our breath...so this was a little more than idle chatter for us.  He was such a sweetie, waiting for us so patiently each time we paused to take in the views.The more we climbed, the more I learned about Sandy.  He recently was working as a bartender and left his job to travel around the world until the money ran out.  He was almost certain he could get his job back upon his return.  Then I later learned he actually was just a few hours short of a Ph.D. in biotech and had given that goal up because he realized he did not want to write grants for the rest of his life.  He also was not a rule freak and clearly the pharmaceutical industry was full of rules for its researchers.  Sandy was young and free and currently enjoying the life of a vagabond.  He had parents and siblings back in Australia that he spoke of fondly.  We talked about politics and science and nature on the way down the hill.Since his camera battery had died I took a number of pictures of him in the larches (I will post something about this interesting conifer on my other blog).  I offered to tag him on FB and he gave me his name.  When I got home and brought up his profile, he had written on it that he liked men.  When I saw this it made me feel very odd and embarrased because I had asked him if he had a girlfriend waiting for him at the end of this sojourn.  We always see the world through our eyes and I can imagine how many times some little old lady sees this cute charmer and wants to fix him up with a young lady and asks if he has a wife or girlfriend.  So tedious, I am sure.Sandy was on his way to do volunteer work in South America for some organization when we parted at the end of the day.  I would love to run into him again some day and see how his adventure unfolded.  (I'll bet you thought this post was going to be about a grizzly...;-))"},

We did not stay in Banff, and although Banff is a stunning mountain tourist town, I am glad we rested our worn hiking boots in this smaller and gentler place just outside the Banff National Park.  It was busy at this time of year and stays busy until early November when tourism drops off just before beginning again in the busy crazy ski season.  Even though mornings were cold in this valley, the weather got very pleasant within hours once the sun burned through the clouds.  Some days were foggy and rainy (snowy), but most of our days were sunny. The first afternoon we took an exploratory hike around the town park. The trail follows the river and seems to go for several miles up into the valley.  Canadians are really scary healthy!  They jog in outfits that are out of some movie and with lean lanky dogs beside them. Picture a six foot Barbie in a skin tight black and red ski outfit springing gazelle-like up a narrow hiking path with two black Dobermans running at each side and then look away so you can catch your breath.  Look at the lovely view above that one gets when resting on the bench in this park.  The bench is empty because I do not think Canadians rest.        We saw a large number of tourists from Asia throughout the area.  Above is a man from Japan practicing his fly fishing.  We did see a few trout in the river although he had no success during the time we watched.        On our way down the river trail and after passing a number of very fancy vacation homes just up the hill behind us we saw this evidence of bear.  We never saw a bear on any of our hikes, but the rangers did post signs on various trails about grizzly activity and asking hikers to hike in groups of four only.  Common sense and keeping food to yourself and making noise is usually a safe bet.  (If Barbie is not afraid, then neither am I.)"},
{"title": "Calgary...Calga RAH!", "date": "Tuesday, October 05, 2010", "text": "Calgary is referred to as Cow Town by some and having engorged the delicious beef that can be purchased in dozens of restaurants, this is no misnomer.  I did not know what to expect upon arrival at Calgary because I had never met anyone from there or talked to anyone who had traveled there.  We really were heading out to Banff at the first part of our trip, but we did spend a couple of days exploring the city on our return.It is a very easy city to explore,  easy to walk in and not so large that you get lost.  The theater district is not dynamic like New York City but we saw a play called Panelopiad which was professionally produced,  a play based on the story of ever faithful and ever patient Penelope waiting while Odysseus was out fighting wars for Helen of Troy.  It had an all female cast that portrayed the roles of men with convincing sexiness and all had excellent singing voices that I always encounter in Canada.The food is wonderful in the city restaurants and VERY expensive if you eat in the nicer restaurants.  We ate at one place near the theaters which we thought was 'sort of' high end.  When we arrived (early because we were still on East Coast time) we noticed a young family at a large round table toward the modern kitchen bar.  There was a young baby in a bright red high chair and food was on the floor everywhere...just like at MacDonald's.    When we quietly asked, the waitress explained why three small children were eating just across from us with their mom and dad at this fancy restaurant.  The family it appears was renting a house owned by the restaurant owner in the nicer suburbs outside of Calgary.  The owner had it listed for 4.5 mil and had not sold it.  So these folks were renting it at $20,000 Canadian a month..!  They were celebrating a birthday for the youngest who had just turned one, which was, therefore, no big deal at such a high end restaurant.  And in spite of the fact that the two older little girls had beautifully highlighted hair and were dressed like Hannah Montana, all children behaved exceptionally well and the father who looked like an ex-hockey player was totally devoted to his third daughter throughout the night.  (As an aside, hubby and I spent the most we have ever spent at a restaurant eating here and I ordered only one glass of the cheapest wine with the meal, but the food was very good.  Although $18 for a salad of organic tomatoes with buffalo mozzarella topped with a rare French chile powder and sitting on prosciutto and basil was a ridiculous price and not nearly as good as something out of my garden and from my grocery.)Weather was in the high 70's most of the time we were in Calgary, so walking around the city was an easy adventure.  The photos below were taken from the Tower downtown that had been built when the Olympics were held there back in the 1980's.  The third photo shows how ugly suburban sprawl is alive and well in Canadian cities.  In the last photo you can see the Canadian Rockies in the distance which was our primary eventual destination.  Most of those outdoor photos of dramatic scenery in the Rockies will be posted on my other blog."},

When in unfamiliar territory, people-watching becomes an opportunity in character development and a dedicated pastime for me.  I have a few stories from my recent exploration of Western Canada, but first one last anecdote from my August trip to Baltimore, which happened on a terribly hot, hellish weekend.  We spent as much time as we could being outside walking the city, but by mid-afternoon we sought the shelter of an air-conditioned store and ended up spending money on iced drinks regardless of our carefully pre-agreed upon budget.We had drifted down to the historic Fell's Point.  The Internet states that Fell's point has \"The unique to the unusual...the conservative to the wild.\" Fell's Point was named after a Quaker in the 1760s which might be the reason for its extreme nature.  It certainly is an interesting part of Baltimore. I became familiar with Fell's point many years ago when visiting an indoor aquaculture facility.  My visit was to a project showing that you could grow fish in the heart of the city.   This particular weekend the air was oppressive and we decided that the hole-in-the-wall coffee shop we were passing was the best place to collapse for a while.  (No Starbucks for us!)This shop was very small and L-shaped...a long narrow L with tables along one wall and the checkout counter and pastries and teas and coffees on the other wall.  At the base of the L were two more tables and chairs, a couch, a small corner with children's toys, and a shelf of used books and magazines.  There was a man drinking an iced drink at a table near the door where we entered.  On the sofa at the far end of the hall past most of the tables were three men passing around a guitar and playing music. One of them was very good and played and sang a familiar country tune and we listened as we let our sweat dry.There was a nice looking dark haired man about 35 behind the counter and he was talking to a 20-something gal with a brown pony tale leaning at the edge of the counter when we walked in.  They both broke off their conversation and the young woman asked what we wanted.  We both ordered an iced chai, and my husband being the gregarious soul started up a conversation about the heat.  The man agreed how unbearable the summer had been while he fixed the tea and the gal took our money.  When I mentioned we were tourists  and wondered about the water taxis, the gal, who was quite talkative and charming, took my arm and directed me to a small brochure rack behind the door.  She was clearly knowledgeable about Baltimore as she passed various brochures my way.While we waited for our drinks she indicated that the heat was really hard for her as she lived in a third-story apartment...with no air-conditioning!  I felt so sorry for her and my mind drifted to how working in a coffee shop must pay very little.  She said she spent most of her time trying to keep cool with a fan.We took a nearby table and perused the water-taxi schedule and the various stops while we sipped our tea.  My back was to the door, but I could see that hubby was intrigued watching the girl and guy.  The door opened a few times more and other customers completed orders.  The guy with the guitar walked by on his way out and apologized to us for singing so loud.  We loved his music, so were surprised at this.Then the store got quiet.  The gal was outside on the sidewalk talking to someone.  I could not hear the conversation between the man who had been sitting at the table drinking when we entered and the guy behind the counter.  But hubby was intently watching them and interpreted this for me later.The man at the table:  \"Who is she?\"The clerk:  \"Hell if I know.  Maybe she is doing her laundry across the street.\"The man:  \"  You don't know her?  She is in here every weekend.\"The clerk:  \"I know...don't have a clue!\"The gal came back into the store and rearranged some of the things on the counter, collected plates from a table and moved them to the counter, and then headed to the bathroom chattering with the man behind the counter most of the time.My husband and I just smiled and shook our heads.  Pehaps this was her way of being able to stay cool on a Sunday and avoid the lack of AC in her apartment.  She was smart and brave and opportunistic.  (My next post will be about Canada...I promise.)"},

{"title": "The Luncheon", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2010", "text": "I attended a 'thank you' luncheon for my volunteering the other day.  There were about 30 people there...staff and volunteers from all the county libraries.  Yes, our county is quite rural with only 30 in attendance from 4 libraries.I was not eager to go because I would only know the head of the library where I volunteered. I rarely crossed paths with the other volunteers in my library because it is so small that only one volunteer can be working at a time.  Everyone else at the luncheon would be a stranger.  But I told myself to grow up and go up.I arrived at the restaurant about 5 minutes early and at the same time as a librarian-looking lady.    I smiled at her across the parking lot assuming we were going to the same place.  I entered the restaurant which was quiet and only a few tables busy and waited for a waitress or hostess.  The lady from the parking lot stood behind me and then pushed me aside gently and said,  \"We are supposed to go straight on back.\"  She huffled on ahead to a noisy room at the far end of the restaurant with not so much as a smile or look-back . Wow, such friendliness.  I put my tail between my legs and followed her to the party room.  There were several long tables with a few scattered ladies sitting and talking and others standing in small groups.  I looked around to see if there was a table or greeting area or name tag place.  Nope.  I didn't know anyone.  I stood blankly for a minute and another lady, at least she was smiling, told me to take a seat and the waitress would come take my drink order.I crossed to the table at the far end of the room with about 4 people sitting and found a chair.  When I looked around I was happy to see the Director of the library where I volunteered seated just down from me.  The 2 women across from her were talking intently about some town festival and I sat there waiting for a pause in the conversation, or at least eye recognition from the lady I will call Trudy.  No such luck.  I sat with the stupidest smile plastered on my face pretending I was understanding whatever they were laughing about for at least 5 minutes.Finally I caught Trudy's eye and she smiled and then introduced me to the others.  At just about this time the din of conversation in the room got quite loud.  Several more people arrived.  Librarians are a noisy group when away from the shushing of the library!!  I worked hard to hear what people were saying and to actively put in my two cents, trying to be as sociable as I could without screaming or saying what again and again.By the time the food arrived the noise became lower as people stuffed their faces.  Only one brave man (a black man) was at a table.  The rest of the people knew each other but seemed to be in little clicks from each library.One of my reasons for volunteering was to get to know people in the community a little better and since these people came from county wide, it probably wasn't the best venue for this goal.I ate my lunch, and made as much small talk (which I hate, hate, hate) as I could to make nice.  At least I talked.  The other volunteer across from me only said about three sentences the whole luncheon. There were the traditional little speeches.  We got our little certificates and a mag-lite gift and our photos taken for the newsletter.After about two and a half hours of this fun-filled time, I got back in the car and went home.  Still looking for some fulfillment.  Also, surprised at how being a hostess at an event such as this is a lost skill.(Heading out for a lengthy trip to the to other side of the continent.  May not have Internet access.  Will be thinking of you and making mind posts that I am sure I will forget when I return!)"},

{"title": "I Lost It Somewhere Along the Way", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2010", "text": "While I like to think I am an upbeat and optimistic person, most people would probably describe me as a little too straight-forward, sometimes condescending and often too honest with everyone including myself.  But honesty is the best policy if you want to know where you are standing in the chaos.  Thus, I have to be open about something I lost...and may never find again.I do not think we are dishonest with ourselves purposely.  I think it is rarely a bad habit.  I think we are dishonest with ourselves because we see ourselves through the huge thick fog of the life we have lived.  The cacophony of memories distracts and clouds any sharp view we could hope to have of who we really are at any one time.  We end up swatting at flies and eventually just shrug off any hope for the clarity we were looking for.In our early thirties we catch a refection of ourselves and for a second think we see an aunt or uncle or parent.  Gosh do we really look that old and that adult?  When did that happen?  Well, of course, now we are adults.  That had to be.Then in our 40's we are no longer the center of attention in the room.  Our jokes are old school or our attention span is too short because of our heavy schedule.  It seems all the fun action is happening elsewhere at the other table.By my 50's I didn't really care so much about myself because I was focused on kids that were moving out into the world.  I was focused on saving money for the long years ahead.  I was focused on ailing parents and my responsibilities to them.  I was focused on expensive changes in lifestyles due to loved ones' college or health issues.  I was focused on trying to get a promotion to cover those expenses.Then as I entered the 60's came the big change.   I was retired, had lots of free time, was financially secure.  I could once again focus on myself.  But I looked through my transparent self to see a nagging smoke cloud hanging just off my shoulder that I had been ignoring for quite some time.  When I admitted it was there I also had to admit that it was some depression, some sadness.  But I could not identify why?  My life now was pretty much OK.  Sure I missed loved ones that had passed on, I missed the closeness of various family members...but...what was this?Some would tell me it is impending death.  It is the fear of the end of life.  No.  That is not it.  I realized the other day that it was a death.  The death of that vital and energetic woman who was an active mother, wife, career person.  That women who was responsible for changes being made.  That women that spoke out with solutions at meetings.  That women who remembered everything and forgot nothing.  I guess I am sad because she is gone.  She has left behind a faded replicate.  I am still here but with nothing truly important to do anymore.  Introspection is a lovely walk, ...but when you get back home it is also nice to have something important to take care of.  Art and hobbies are gentle distractions, but it would be nice to once again accomplish something that helps others change their lives.  I miss that.  I mourn for that."},

Now I'm supposed to winterize it? I hope it's too late. Grass lawns have to be the stupidest thing we've come up with outside of thong swimsuits! We constantly battle dandelions, Queen Anne's lace, thistle, violets, chicory and clover that thrive naturally, so we can grow grass that must be nursed through an annual four step chemical dependency. Imagine the conversation The Creator might have with St. Francis about this:\"Frank you know all about gardens and nature. What in the world is going on down there? What happened to the dandelions, violets, thistle and stuff I started eons ago? I had a perfect, no maintenance garden plan. Those plants grow in any type of soil, withstand drought and multiply with abandon. The nectar from the long-lasting blossoms attracted butterflies, honey bees and flocks of songbirds. I expected to see a vast garden of colors by now. But all I see are these green rectangles.\"\"It's the tribes that settled there, Lord. The Suburbanites. They started calling your flowers 'weeds' and went to great extent to kill them and replace them with grass.\"\"Grass? But it's so boring. It's not colorful. It doesn't attract butterflies, birds and bees, only grubs and sod worms. It's temperamental with temperatures. Do these suburbanites really want all that grass growing there?\"\"Apparently so, Lord. They go to great pains to grow it and keep it green. They begin each spring by fertilizing grass and poisoning any other plant that crops up in the lawn.\"\"The spring rains and cool weather probably make grass grow really fast. That must make the Suburbanites happy.\"\"Apparently not, Lord. As soon as it grows a little, they cut it _ sometimes twice a week.\"\"They cut it? Do they then bale it like hay?\"\"Not exactly, Lord. Most of them rake it up and put it in bags.\"\"They bag it? Why? Is it a cash crop? Do they sell it?\"\"No, sir. Just the opposite. They pay to throw it away.\"\"Now let me get this straight. They fertilize grass so it will grow. And when it does grow, they cut it off and pay to throw it away?\"\"Yes, sir.\"\"These Suburbanites must be relieved in the summer when we cut back on the rain and turn up the heat. That surely slows the growth and saves them a lot of work.\"\"You aren't going believe this Lord. When the grass stops growing so fast, they drag out hoses and pay more money to water it so they can continue to mow it and pay to get rid of it.\"\"What nonsense! At least they kept some of the trees. That was a sheer stroke of genius, if I do say so myself. The trees grow leaves in the spring to provide beauty and shade in the summer. In the autumn they fall to the ground and form a natural blanket to keep moisture in the soil and protect the trees and bushes. Plus, as they rot, the leaves form compost to enhance the soil. It's a natural circle of life.\"\"You better sit down, Lord. The Suburbanites have drawn a new circle. As soon as the leaves fall, they rake them into great piles and have them hauled away.\"\"No! What do they do to protect the shrub and tree roots in the winter and keep the soil moist and loose?\"\"After throwing away your leaves, they go out and buy something they call mulch. They haul it home and spread it around in place of the leaves.\"\"And where do they get this mulch?\"\"They cut down trees and grind them up.\"\"Enough! I don't want to think about this anymore. Saint Catherine, you're in charge of the arts. What movie have you scheduled for us tonight?\"\"Dumb and Dumber, Lord.

{"title": "Baltimore, Life in the City", "date": "Thursday, August 12, 2010", "text": "In mid-August my husband and I reached the 40-year mark.  It is a big deal that two people can live together that long without losing themselves in each other, or killing each other, or pretending to live together while not really.   So we take our accolades with salted chocolate and admit luck has a significant part to play in the duration of any marriage and the breakdown of a marriage does not necessarily reflect any more immaturity than we all harbor.  We didn't want to spend a lot of money flying somewhere as Hubby had a trip coming up, so we drove north to Baltimore for the weekend.Baltimore is a changing city.  I used to drive up there for meetings when I was working and had to make sure I got parking passes for the John Hopkins campus before heading out, because if you parked anywhere outside the campus area, it was really creepy and probably dangerous.  Like New York, you can make one wrong turn and feel very unsafe.But I will have to admit that the last decade has been kind to Baltimore.  The harbor area has been re-vitalized with lots of high-end restaurants, fun museums, and tourist activities.  There are also inexpensive activities for families to enjoy.  We stayed in one of those expensive waterfront hotels and got nice morning and evening views across the harbor.The bright light in the center below is the stadium where the Orioles game was being played.  This city has drama and intrigue and both \"The Wire\" and \"Homicide: Life in the City\" were filmed here reflecting the grittier side of this town.   I think Baltimore is a 'little' like New Orleans or Venice in that there are some very artistic and passionate citizens that keep the city interesting in spite of the crime and poverty that lies just beneath the surface.  The building below is where \"Homicide\" was filmed.While there was much lovely restored and new architecture along the greatly improved waterfront, one did not have to walk too far before you could see the painful transitions that are still ongoing.We ate at my one of my favorite high-end restaurant chains, Roy's. While those Roy's in Hawaii are the best, they do try to keep that Asian fusion thing going across the continent.  Italian wine, spicy edamame appetizers, a crisp Asian spinach salad, tiger shrimp on jalapeno risotto and roasted veggies followed by a wonderful creme brulee.  It may sound too eclectic, but actually it was very good, and the restaurant was only a block's walk from the hotel, so the high 90 degree temperature did not ruin the weekend.  (This was also the same weekend when I saw the art film I Am Love and one of reasons we are still married is that hubby sat through the whole thing and actually stayed awake enough to help forward the after-conversation!)"},
{"title": "Compliments, That Fragile Gift", "date": "Tuesday, August 10, 2010", "text": "I was thinking of compliments the other day.  Perhaps as a result of my submitting my blog to that site for review.  Why do we we want them?  How do we get them?  How we treasure them!  Can we trust them?  I am not a good person for compliments...getting them, that is.  I do not receive them gracefully and I rarely believe them in full.  I am a reasonable cynic, although, I, of course, think that is being a realist.  Perhaps because my mother was very sparse in handing out compliments to her children.  She was an expert on the criticism sharing I remember.  I also think I am not a generous person with compliments.  If I give one, it usually has a pretty solid kernel of truth in it, or I will not give a compliment just to make someone feel better.  Unless, of course, they need one for survival at that time in their life.My FB friends are most generous when commenting on my photos.  I love that they love the photographs that I post.  But it IS like having loving friends comment.  Your friends always praise your work because they like you and want to be nice and want you to succeed or they are friends of your children and have been raised to be polite and do not really care enough about you to criticize you.  Your FB friends are complimentary because only the jokes can be derogatory.  Perhaps, they do not want to be de-friended if they were too honest!  An FB friend said my photos reminded him of Ansel Adams.  That compliment only made me smile, because I knew it wasn't true.  It wasn't even close.  But, it was a friendly, well-meant exaggeration.  Bloggers are most gracious in posting about my photos and my writing.  Their comments truly warm my soul, especially when I know many of them are far better with the camera or the computer keyboard than I could ever hope to be.  Some of them even make a living at it, the writing or photography---not giving compliments.  Therefore, while I get a big smile when I read these compliments, I also feel deep in my soul that they would never qualify their remarks with a dose of harsh honesty or even gentle criticism.  So, of course, they are only left with agreeing or praising me or perhaps reading my blog in stony white silence...\"if you can't say anything nice...\"But, real compliments are the best when they come un-expected.  Sometimes they are wordless and just the expression on someone's face,  such as the time my 16-year-old son failed to shift gears successfully on the Bronco going up the inclined driveway, and I took the driver's seat and did it quite easily.  I wish I had had a camera, because I had never seen that look in his eyes before.  Admiration from a child (especially a teenager) is golden.I overheard my daughter talking to one of her friends when they were deciding how to get pictures at the swim fun day.  She suggested asking me because she said 'my mom is a semi-professional at it.'  Gold, pure gold.When my husband goes back for seconds at some experimental dish I have tried, I think that is a lovely compliment.  He usually says something about how good it is...but he says that often when I cook.  When he gets seconds I know he really likes it.Yesterday, the oven repair men (young) said that I was a really nice lady when talking to me about working out the warranty issues with the company.  I somehow felt they really meant it because they had nothing to gain from me and it made me feel good about working at my negotiating skills over my life.I wonder how other bloggers feel about comments, compliments and criticisms.  Do you need to be prepared or can anyone bring it on if it is honest and helpful?"},
{"title": "Movie Review---I Am Love", "date": "Sunday, August 08, 2010", "text": "You can skip this post if you haven't seen the movie or have no desire to read movie reviews, but I felt compelled to write this post after seeing the movie in the title above...which really isn't a review as you will soon see.     I was reading Millie's blog where she mentioned she went to see I Am Love and that she liked it.  It is a foreign art-house film, so you may not have heard about it.  I was on a trip to Baltimore to celebrate the big 40 anniversary and told hubby I wanted to see this film --- all Italian with subtitles, so it is not everyone's cup of cappuccino.  It is a love story that ends in tragedy.  I liked it, but much of symbolism was too obvious or too complex for me, because I left the theater with lots of questions.  The cinematography is a feast for the eyes,  and the acting subtle and sparse of dialog.  But I had so many questions.Why is the 'chef' introduced so briefly at the first and we are not shown a single real clue about the magnetism he has?What were they racing--- cars, horses---it is, after all, the middle of winter in Milan?  Why don't they develop this mutual interest more fully so that we can understand the friendship that grows between the two men.  Why did they portray this friendship almost as a gay love when it wasn't?Why is the chef so shy...just like she said her husband was shy?  Is that what attracts her to him?Why didn't they draw a bigger clue to Russian cooking?  Was she homesick, for Russia, really?Why is everyone else drawn with such subtlety and the daughter is so overly cliche!How many boobies and bees and beetles does it take to make a love scene before it becomes overdone and boring?What was in the note that the son wrote to his mother?  Was he thinking of committing suicide?Why was the housekeeper's devastation scene so long?  What was the meaning of seeing a child like her waking the mother?  Did the mother grow up with her and bring her from Russia?Why was the housekeeper packing when no one leaves with those suitcases?And finally, why was the pregnant daughter-in-law so ignored in all this?  Was that some male chauvinism Italian cultural thing or did it have deeper meaning?I guess I liked the movie, well-crafted, but it seemed to be filled with symbolism that I could not quite grasp and as you can tell, left me with many questions.  One movie review said that there isn't any motivation for anyone in the film.  I tend to agree.  It is all very subtle.  If you see the movie I will be thrilled to hear your comments."},

{"title": "Adapting", "date": "Monday, August 02, 2010", "text": "When you are old and Wisdom is the only best friend whom you can trot out eagerly to show others the closeness of your friendship, he usually brings Adaptation along for the ride.  Life will be hell if Adaptation does not hang close.  Adaptation insures that you will not be crabby, tired, or out of touch on the rest of the long journey ahead.  It is the best second friend you will ever have.I once attended a conference on algology.  (Look that up in your Funk and Wagnells or if you bring along Adaptation you can Google it.  And yes, I saw that yawn.)  Anyway, I am not an expert in this area, but found one of the lectures most fascinating.  It was a discussion how oceanic cellular algae adapts to predators and diseases.  When something starts munching or invading, the algal plant later adds toxins or bitterness to the new growth to discourage more grazing.  Trees and other plants also use this adapting technique.  Howler monkeys in Belize can graze the new leaves in the tree tops in the spring for food, but later in the season the leaves are toxic and will make them ill.  I have been thinking of this in my flower gardening.  If a plant is being eaten I remove the pest, but if I cannot find the pest I wait and see if it is going to continue to graze.  Many times I notice it usually only hits the tender new growth for a short time, and I am guessing that is because the plant becomes bitter or hard to eat.  This doesn't work for Japanese beetles or other non-indigenous bugs, and I have made the decision that it is because it takes some lengthy evolutionary time for the plant to adapt to the new threat and produce something the bug doesn't like.   So my great grandchild may find the Japanese beetle not as irritating as I do.You can be a stubborn warrior as you get attacked with age and all of its physical and mental difficulties and changes.  But, if you want to enjoy the rest of the ride, you must compromise and find new ways to adapt to the handicaps.  I like being around people who accept what cannot be changed, keep a sense of humor about it all, but also find some new way (or several adaptations) around the problem and then go forward and get on with the rest of their life."},

{"title": "Mind Games", "date": "Thursday, July 22, 2010", "text": "Over the recent 4th of July Holiday weekend both my husband and I were sick.  It was strange because my illness was a raspy sore throat and then a chest cough that only occurred at night.  His illness was a sore throat but also several raging fevers, aches and pains, tender skin, scratchy eyes and general weakness and malaise.  Between playing with our grandchildren the week before and hitting a late night bar crowd for our son's band that same weekend we could have caught this bug anywhere, if we indeed shared the same bug.What was so unusual was that he was really sick and I was just annoyingly so until days after he got well and then my cough got worse.  Ninety-nine percent of the time he is the one mildly ill and I drag myself from bed to couch for several days complaining and putting life on hold.  I realized about a decade ago how I draw on his leadership and strength.  Being the mother and Chief cook and bottle washer (bill payer, house cleaner, appointment clerk, etc.) for years, I always thought I was the headstrong and stalwart person while herding our goslings, as perhaps I was.  But our years together and aging senses have caused us to lean more equally on each other through all of life's later challenges.His appetite was good so I was not too worried.  But at our ages I could not help but think about what it would be like if this illness was serious.  If we were entering the time in our lives when I would be caring for him day in and out as he started on that journey where his body needed more and more rest until he left me, left all of us.  I could not help thinking of that day when I might be left to walk this trail alone.   It was a black and scary thought, but it did not freeze me in my tracks, because I knew it was possible and I knew others shared this journey.I am luckier than many people because I think I can get my mind around this darkness, even though it is painful.  I have lost both my parents and a younger sister and  I am practical in knowing we all go this way at some time in our lives and I do resign myself to the inevitability of those things we cannot change with the force of our emotions or the demands of our 'needs.'  We face one day at a time and enjoy its jewel like quality for the brief glow it provides.  Life is such a temporary gift that breaks so easily.  While we may wish to curl up in a fetal ball, the sun will continue to rise, flowers will bloom, songs will be written and sung, couples will make love, and children will laugh and play without us.  This is a good thing.  But I do admit, that at my age, death becomes much more than a theoretical mind game or philosophical thought.  Being stoic is not always enough to ease the anxiousness that only visits in the middle of the night.(I should probably clarify that I wrote this a while back...)"},

{"title": "Battle Strategy  Follow-up---War With the Cardinal", "date": "Sunday, July 18, 2010", "text": "I got the most comments ever on my Battle with the Cardinal post and thus feel obligated to write a follow-up.Since the rubber snake worked to dissuade the cardinal on the bedroom window last year, I move it to the dining room bay window ledge.  Then I g0t the plastic life-size owl that had broken away from its pole down on the dock and put him on the deck next to the lower part of the deck window, Mr. Cardinal's second favorite spot.  ( I just have to remember to cover the bottom hole in the hollow plastic owl with duct tape to avoid the wasps using it as a nesting cave!  I searched the internet for photos of owl eyes and printed out two in extra large size that look intimidating, at least to me.  One photo I tape to the inside of the dining room window and the other I tape to the inside of the kitchen window.  Several days passed and still no cardinal has re-appeared.  I am not totally convinced I have won the war...just this phase which will last who knows how long? I should explain that prior to this battle strategy implementation my husband and I took advantage of a cool day or two and washed the windows!  Dear me, we have put the fate of all in the hands of the Cardinal as the windows are now sparkling clean and can reflect his image perfectly.     Then we went away on a short trip and I returned to find Mr. Crazy Cardinal back pecking at the windows about the kitchen sink.  Clearly the glaring owl eyes do not work there.  Next stop is to find some kind of spinning device or flag to see if that keeps him wary."},

{"title": "War With the Cardinal, Himself", "date": "Saturday, July 10, 2010", "text": "It seems to be a moist gray morning that has come too soon.  I am awake and do not know why, but push off the light quilt and head into my dark kitchen to make coffee.  Soon the water is hot and the smell of liquid amber fills my nostrils.  I take my cup and sit on the front porch trying to shake away the fog from my mind as the rising sun begins to silhouette the tree tops.  I am wondering why I woke up so suddenly out of a restorative sleep as I sip my caffeine and enjoy the pink and blue sky in early dawn.  In a short time my reverie is interrupted.Crows are in the right side ravine making a brass band's worth of noise in the high poplar trees.  I cannot see them, but their cawing is most annoying and unusually angry.  They are probably ganging up on an owl or hawk that has landed in the woods.  The band of crows will give him no peace until he leaves this area completely.  These home boys own the block and do not give way to anyone without regard for claws and sharp bills.  The crows' weapons are confusion and backstabbing.I finish my coffee and head back inside.  As I reach across the coffee table to get my paperback, the morning sleep disturbance mystery is solved.  First I hear a tap, followed by tap, tap, followed by tap, tap, tap.  There, at the dining room window, is that newly grown male cardinal.  He is small but has all his adult red coloring.  He bangs at the dining room window flying up to the top until my appearance startles him and he rounds the house away from me and continues banging at the kitchen window above the sink.  He has been doing this tapping at the window for several weeks, and I have been trying to ignore him.  Except now he starts his communication before dawn!And now there is a new twist as I see the mess on the window he has left.I watch closely and see him hanging at the base of the window and notice that his mouth is full of some green juicy caterpillar thing.  It is so disgusting I can barely watch on my coffee stomach as it oozes insect life from his bill.  My husband mentioned he had seen a similar meal in the bird's bill yesterday  So, is this cardinal now spreading this mess across my window attempting to feed his reflection?  Is he gay and thinking this is his mate to which he offers a gift of fresh breakfast?  Is he a childless father driven by an instinct to feed that he cannot understand or control?  Or is he a pacifist and thinking this male antagonist (reflection) can be won over by an offer to break bread (bug) rather than fight?  Is he in love with me and wants to bring me gifts so that I will fill the bird's water bowl on time?  My guess is that he is just crazy!  We have that crazy cardinal gene pool thing going in our woods which you can read about here and here.He is driving me crazy; well, crazier as well!  My windows are now covered in streaks of bug guts.  I had planned on cleaning them a few weeks past and I now pat myself on the back for my wise procrastination in the heat of summer.  Sun-baked bug protein is just what any of my few dinner guests want to see while eating a meal and observing our sunsets through the windows.OK.  Clearly the day has started with a thrown gauntlet.  I rinse my coffee cup and begin planning a battle strategy."},

Perhaps when you are shell-shocked for years having the blood of another tragedy at your feet, in your face, or, better yet, in the neighbor's yard, you can shake your head in sorrow but move on numbly to the rest of the day without too much angst.  Your perception has narrowed and you are in survival mode.There are many studies of the numbing that violent games produce in the game player.  There are studies of the personality shells that young children create when living in a crime ridden neighborhood or when trying to survive in an abusive family.  Our soldiers return home only to fight a battle with themselves.For those of us who do not live where bombs are lobbed into our life on a daily basis, we get addicted to that thrill ride in the entertainment industry forgetting that life is not real in that way.  We want a bigger explosion or more bodies on the ground.  We want larger monsters and bigger weapons.  It is not enough to kill the evil villain the first time.  He keeps surviving and coming back at us again and again.   Get involved with enough shock and awe that doesn't touch you and it becomes an addictive stimulant.I wonder if our dear Earth also becomes numb in this way.  Or are her earth quakes and weather changes the spanking we deserve?  We keep attacking her with our blundering endless ignorance.Just to \"put in perspective \" this oil tragedy,  we have used the earth as an oil toilet in far greater ways, according to the June 14 issue of Newsweek.  The Deepwater Horizon oil well has thus far released 39.1 million gallons with a an outside amount of 94.2 million.  (Needless to say no one can really measure this mess.)  BUT in:  1978 the Amoco Cadiz which ran aground released 68 million gallons; 1979 the Atlantic Empress tanker collision spilled 88.3 million gallons; also in 1979 the IXTOC blowout took 10 months to cap and released 140 million gallons; 1983 the Nowruz which hit an oil platform spewed 80 million gallons; 1988 the Osyssey broke in half and released 48 million gallons (but far offshore in another neighborhood); 1989 Exxon Valdez released 10.9 million gallons--the largest in U.S. waters until nowAnd finally in 1991, the Gulf War Iraqi forces released 252-336 million gallons when they retreated from Kuwait.See, this is a never ending story.  Aren't you excited?"},

There they sat in the fruit bin in their abundance of lemonness waiting for iced tea or fresh fish, or perhaps a guacamole.  Hubby became worried that we would forget them or ignore them and he was suddenly motivated.  He would make a lemon cream pie!I realized that he has NEVER made a lemon cream pie and his baking skills while reasonably adept are not expert.  As he read the various recipes he realized he needed a double boiler.  This is a cooking tool he has never used.  He asked if we had one.I have not used a double boiler in a long time and when we made the final move to this house I am afraid I got rid of any Rube Goldberg pots that would have worked as double boilers. Now that we are retired we frequently strike when the iron is hot (to use a totally unrelated idiomatic expression).  So, we went in search of a double boiler.  We shopped at all our local venues...K-mart, Target, Wal-Mart, and Sears...none had double boilers.  No surprise as very few people even cook anymore much less cook slow food where you actually have to stand at the stove stirring for more than 5 minutes.The next day we drove up north to the larger shopping areas looking for that over-priced but super inventoried store called Williams Sonoma.  With a name like that you almost feel as if you have to bring out the white gloves and tea hat before you peruse the shelves.  I walked in, and to avoid any dangerous perusing, went straight to a young clerk and told her I wanted the most inexpensive double boiler they had in stock.She looked at me with wide-eyes.  \"We just got them in!\"Who knew?  I had just told my husband that no one used double boilers anymore.  No one cooked slow.  She took me to the shelves that had the pot that you see in the above photo.While it had a French brand on the label claiming that had been around for about 100 years, a more careful reading of the box revealed that it was made in China.  What isn't these days?  It was not a double pot but a single pot with an outside envelope into which you put water.  What fun!  I think.  It was much cheaper than anything hubby had found online so we took the plunge.By the time we got back from our long drive in the late afternoon we were too tired to use it.  The next day we cooked fish and made some lemonade.  It is weeks later and we STILL have not used it!  Geesh!  Eventually I will have to see if it works."},

Our first day at the beach late last March was really not so bad...just pretty windy but not enough to blow sand in your face.  We tucked behind a sand dune and when I got up to go exploring I saw this 'person' on the other side of our dune in the shelter of another little sandy hill.  It was NOT that cold.  I cannot fathom what on earth he was thinking if this was the necessary costume and attitude for him to spend a day at the beach.  He should have stayed back at the condo or hotel or saved money and stayed at his home up North...or PERHAPS he was here hiding from all of his family that were holding up back at the condo avoiding the wind.  Hmmmm.  Maybe I feel sorry for him.  (This isn't you, hiding from you know who, is it?)(Remember our troops this Memorial Day weekend if you live in the great U.S.A.)"},

{"title": "How to Run a Volunteer Program", "date": "Wednesday, May 26, 2010", "text": "Volunteers are like full blown roses.  They arrive with energy and expectations (perhaps inaccurate), but expectations none the less, that their time donated to you is valuable.  They are somewhat overwhelming in their eagerness to help.  They may only last a short time in this full bloom of volunteering if they get bored or realize they are only doing something tedious.  Here are just a few basic rules that will keep your relationship with your volunteers running smoothly.1) Have a consistent and clear schedule but be flexible because you are getting free help.  Pretend that you think their time is valuable even if they are old retired farts.2) Provide a tour of the facility and make sure you introduce and re-introduce staff over time.  Us older folks cannot remember a name to save our life.3) It might be a good idea to assign the volunteer to a specific staff person (and a back-up) so that they know who to go to when they get there each time.  It is not courteous to have them stand around grinning at people until they catch someone's eye.4) Be cheerful and start a small conversation each time they arrive so that they feel welcome.  Don't act distracted even though you are busy, just two to three minutes of cheerful exchange should suffice.  Whatever you do, do not give them the deer in the headlights look when they show up and then look around for someone else to help.5) Always have something for them to work on.  Try to fit the activity to their expertise and interests if at all possible.  Do not waste their time by going around to other staff asking if they have anything to give the volunteer to do.6)  And the absolutely most important tip is if you do not need volunteers be honest about that.  Take their name and phone number and tell them you may call them in the future.  Do not feel guilty in turning them away.  Women are particularly bad about this!The advantages of volunteering in a library is you get to see all the new stuff first, you get to peruse the collection when you read shelves and it is amazing what libraries have today.  You had forgotten, perhaps, that videos, CDs, DVDs, books, magazines, etc. are all for the checking and free!  You have access to dozens of libraries via the interlibrary loan system, so chances are you will be able to get anything you want if you are patient. Needless to say, my decision to help out at the local library which I began to do this winter is not working out as well as I had hoped.  I encountered some of the issues I mentioned above.  I also overlooked the fact that most of my work would involve moving books and re-shelving books and reading shelves for misplaced or lost books and other media.  I told myself that this re-enforced my Dewey and alphabetical skills and strengthened my biceps and laterals.  I tried to remember some yoga stretches and moves when I got up off the floor after reading the lowest shelves with my trifocals tilted for an extended time .  I was somewhat limited in this yoga moves partnering as I did not want to scare the customers.  I also found it necessary to stifle my groans as I tried to get up with books in hand.  Most days I pretend that they really are happy to see me and a few of them are.  But I if I do not like this as much as I hoped I guess I will be looking for a new volunteer activity in the future.As a post script when a volunteer leaves you might want to ask them a few questions such as: 1) Will they be volunteering elsewhere? 2) What did they like about this volunteer experience?  3)What didn't they like?"},

I head out to the grocery for kid-friendly snacks, make sure linens are changed, put out new towels and refill the soap dispenser.  I do a quick dusting even though no one will notice and make sure the sidewalk is free of grass clippings.  I check the weather to make a soft list of activities in case of rain.  I get out the toddler dishes and sippy cups.  Of course, I charge my camera battery.My husband, on the other hand, tends to go with the flow.  His most recent approach was to decide after the toddlers had arrived for the weekend to sleep in a tent in the back yard with grandson.  He was pretty excited about this adventure.  Our two man tent has not been used for maybe a decade (it smells) and the directions have long since been lost along with our foggy memories of how we used to set it up.  No surprise, but help from the five-year-old was not as useful as he had hoped.  After a couple of hours and some stifled bad words, this was as far as he got before he admitted defeat.  I think I am happier facing less disappointment and spending more pre-time as the one who over-plans."},

That is an expensive decision and certainly not necessary.  I was/am so shocked I decided to go along with it.  As I frequently say these days, I am going to die someday, so why not?  I do not fear or welcome death;  I just know that I am now on that downhill side and any decisions I make are not that important when they help employ others in this recession.Anyway, I sit here at my desk with clouds of powdered cement drifting across the outside front yard and coating every green leaf and colored flower petal as workmen begin to saw into chunks the current cement sidewalk before starting on the driveway paving.  Oh yes, this will be major.  The house shakes as they lift huge chunks of cement with a bulldozer and dump it in their truck.  The workers (you know, the ones with the green cards that everyone wants to ask for to make sure they are legal ...the ones who are essential to our lifestyle...the ones that actually helped, in a small way, keep retail businesses open during the recession... and one of whom has only two pairs of work shoes but will not wear the other pair for weeks because a bird nested in them on his back porch) are covered in cement dust as they use cement saws to cut chunks of 4 inch thick concrete into manageable sizes.  The white guy sits in the front loader and moves the cement to the truck.They had to carefully move quite a few established plants from either side of the walkway.  I am hoping they survive.  Mrs. Bluebird left early and I have not seen her return, and I am VERY concerned that we have driven her off her nest.  The distant chickadee in the far birdhouse is still hanging in there in spite of the noise and dust.  We had forgotten the issues of spring when we scheduled this project.  We also should have been prepared for the washing machine gasket problem (in prior post) and the compressor going out on my little wine cooler in the kitchen.  (Did she say she has a wine cooler in the kitchen?   Really?)Anyway, neither of these are going to be repaired anytime soon."},

Lest my readers get the wrong idea about my gardening success...here is a dose of reality.   The long and hard winter has changed how the wild dogwoods bloomed this spring at the edge of my woods.  Perhaps the harsh temperatures froze the buds or perhaps the birds or squirrels or raccoons had eaten the new growth during the winter as I have only a 'handful' of blossoms per tree as can be seen below.My rhododendron, above, purchased on sale at a hefty price last fall has suffered tremendously from the heavy winter snows.  It is just a shadow of itself and I fear it will not survive the summer!  I was told when I took in a branch that it was getting too much water...but I think it is something more. I expect perhaps one blossom and am afraid to move it to a better area as this is the best spot I have!The side of my foundation landscape at the front door entry has holes in the nandina hedge where snow pack bent the branches to the ground and broke much of the tall growth.  The hedge is now thin and spindly.  Nandina plants are hardy so I hope some shape will return.  I have staked it as it quite naturally leans out toward the morning sun.   My large rosemary had to be cut back and the damage has certainly ruined its shape. It will be moved this week to the new herb bed which has better drainage but less afternoon sun :-(.  The shock has caused some of the stalks to bloom already.The most dangerous damage was done to my expensive cut leaf maple which is now three years old and holding its own beneath the front bay window.  It may look lovely here but lets pull back the leaves to see what we saw on our return from that last heavy snowfall in February.Yes, in our desperation that cold winter day we used duct tape to save the branch.  The branch had been torn away and was hanging by the thinest of cadmium on the opposite side.  Since the tree was dormant at the time, I pushed the two parts of the branch together and taped them hoping scar tissue would form in the spring and save the branch.  Hubby added the string support tied to the stronger part of the tree above to ease the strain on the broken branch.  This branch was full in the front and important to the full shape of the plant.  All appears well for now and we will see if this repair will hold down through the summer and winter to come!"},

This wild plant has balls of beauty that cover the bushes standing at attention up to 12 feet high along the shoreline at my dock during the month of April.Above is the familiar hybridized strawberry flower promising jam and syrup and topping in the months to come.  It is small and covering the grounds at the back of the garden, but a no less lovely  bloomer than all the others.Above is a newer ornamental version of the strawberry.  We are waiting to see if the flavor and/or size of the strawberry has been compromised in order to make the flowers stand out, as this is a new addition to the garden this year.This beauty is, of course, from our new blueberry plant(s) which have been tucked back by the wood pile just inside the deer fence.  YUM.Above are the flowers of a wild persimmon tree that grows against our dock just at the edge of the inter-tidal land.  It is only 8 feet tall and maybe too young for any fruit as we have not seen any set as long as we have lived here.  I have seen raccoons and squirrels performing acrobatic feats to get at the persimmons in our higher trees at the edge of the forest.These are buds from my kaffir lime tree which has been moved outside now that the weather is more gentle.  The tree is still small but I have gotten about 6-10 fruit in the past. And finally among our cast of supporting performers is Barberry (Berberis) growing at the side of my house doing its duty as a landscape plant.  But in the spring its lovely yellow bells ring out in contrast to the wine foliage above.  (Click on photos for better views.)"},

The historic area was surrounded by children from private schools on spring holiday.  I was there recently for a two-day garden seminar.  Something we elitists do when spring arrives and we have planted all that we dare to before the last frost date.There is nothing more entertaining for a husband than following sensible women with sensible haircuts in sensible shoes around sensible historic gardens all afternoon.  There was some variety in attendance as some of the women attending were those charming 'Southern Bells' who wear lovely hats, Town and Country clothes and nice jewelry.  They knew and were willing to share their knowledge of the scientific names of most of the plants with a maple syrup accent as their fragile husbands in nice suits stood quietly by... my, my!  Even more exotic, the weather was perfect!The historic district is romantically and accurately preserved with lots of Colonial architecture, some winding lanes, staff in Colonial dress doing Colonial era activities and or staffing the many cutesy little shops.  We bought two of the Early American jar birdhouses for our fence posts.  Did I mention that being there in the spring is wonderful?Unfortunately, our favorite (and expensive) restaurant, The Trellis, was closed for renovation.  This is the restaurant that produced the famous Death by Chocolate dessert that has been mimicked by every high-end restaurant on the East Coast the last few years.  Fortunately we found plenty of other good places to eat.On the last day, I found a true treasure.  There is a very small used bookstore called Mermaid Books located beneath a wine/deli restaurant on a side street off the Market Square.  Before this trip I did not know of its existence.  We had a long lunch hour to fill and were perusing the shelves for some good historic references on plants and gardening, stimulated by the recent lecture we had heard, when I came across this!The bookstore owner actually hesitated in selling it to me.  He hemmed and hawed and then felt he must have another copy in the back, because he had planned on scanning it for the wonderful woodcut illustrations inside.  I told him to let me buy it and he could mail it to me when he was done scanning it.  He finally relented and let me purchase it then and there.  Now I will see if the memory of enjoying reading this book when I was much younger still holds true.  Have any of you ever read this book of fantasy? It is a male's version of a romance.  It is not copyrighted in the U.S. and is downloadable at the following URL, if your are interested.http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/942Or you can search the title and find it online in several places."},

His honesty, strength, humor, and leadership while only 13 helped bring an understanding of this terrible disease to most of America who were fearful and prejudiced.  His calm practical approach to dealing with this fate was truly inspirational.There is another hero, from blogdom, that I want to mention.  She has been a blog pal for a few years, and I cannot remember what made me visit her blog for the very first time, but I kept coming back because she was a real life hero to me.  She wrote poetry, prose, and told things about herself that most of us would want to keep secret.  But she told them with such magical humor her readers could laugh out loud.  She made me comfortable.  Her name is Tammy Brierly.This Sunday she is going to free dive out of a plane!  Brave for a 48 year old woman you may think.  But this is not why she is my hero.  She is doing this in spite of brittle bones, an inability to walk by herself and a continual battle  with other side effects of ALS---Lou Gehrig's disease.  There is no cure, but since her diagnosis years ago she has done more, and been more spirited and accepting of life than 100% of the people I know.  I have never met her personally, but she has become my inspiration!  She is making this jump to bring awareness to this incurable disease.  She spends most of her time now on Facebook so I did not link to her blog page because it is an easier venue for her.  I am so thankful for heroes like these.  They certainly make me want to be a better person."},
{"title": "I Got It All Figured Out...For Me At Least", "date": "Tuesday, April 06, 2010", "text": "I think I have figured out the basic difference in conservative and liberal mindsets at the far reaches of civilization.  Most of us are sane and reasonable people with little deep seated insecurities that we try not to let rule our brain.  Most of us are willing to try compromises.  But we do have deeply ingrained fears.Conservatives fear that liberals will get that 'coddle the world' thing going so strong that liberals would be willing to have us all living on a commune with vague morality and therefore stifle progress of all types.  There would be no incentive as all money earned from development of new businesses and new ideas would be distributed evenly to the masses regardless of effort.  We would drown in the laziness of the free ride as liberals insist on saving everyone and refuse to defend themselves with weapons.Liberals fear that conservatives will get that 'don't trust anyone different' thing going so strongly that conservatives will put us all be under some vague conservative standard that measures our patriotism and loyalty within narrow definitions, and therefore, all liberals will have freedom of speech or privacy or other personal freedoms slowly taken away.  If we don't fit the perfect standard we would be watched closely on every decision that we make.  Rebellious intellectuals would be sent to the country for an improved work ethic as happened in China.Yeah, probably an oversimplification...but it makes sense to me.I really think that we both have the country's best interests at heart and if the shouting stopped, we could walk down a middle road.  With compromise, yes, with back-stepping and correcting, yes, but also with progress."},
{"title": "The Other Woman", "date": "Friday, April 02, 2010", "text": "Marriage is a tough path to follow, and anyone who tells you otherwise does not have standards.  Marriage is not for the faint of heart or the weak of mind.  Marriage is for those of us who do not mind being warriors on a daily basis.  I will explain further.As you read this post I am (hopefully) sitting on a sunny Florida beach with my grandchildren.  Yes, I am obviously richer than Croesus being able to take off to Florida several times a year.  In reality this expensive lifestyle is causing us to spend rather then save our recent tax refund.  We are driving down with our S.I. L. while our daughter and two kids fly in a day later.  Our car will be crammed to the top with more beach toys, food, luggage, and clothes than anyone needs for a week.  We will be prepared for all types of weather, all types of fun including some fishing and canoe gear if hubby can find room, and leave just enough empty seats for 3 adults and the one adult and 2 children that we will be picking up at the airport before we have a chance to unload.  God forbid we should get bored!But, as I write this post for later publishing I have some trepidation about this trip.  Not because we are covering 1,000 miles in a day an a half with limited food and bathroom breaks.  Not because I am with my fairly liberal-minded husband and my fairly conservative-minded son-in-law in a confined space for hours on end while we want to listen to NPR and he wants to listen to Sports Radio.  (S.I.L. will have to stew in some agony because we do not have satellite radio.)  And, finally, I am not concerned about my snoring as I probably sleep a good part of the trip away. No my concerns are about the 'other woman.'  She had joined us on our last trip to Florida and I do not think it is an exaggeration that her presence created such discord that I wanted to take her and hit my husband!  I did not mention her presence in my prior blog posts because I was trying to pretend she hadn't been a part of the trip. Conversations in the car would start like this: Me:  OK, I think we are ready.Car engine starts and we head out of the yard.Her:  Turn right and drive straight for 44 miles.Hubby:  (Grunt)  (Mumble) Two women telling me what to do.Things would go along pleasantly for a while until we reached an area where she and my husband would begin arguing about who knew the best route.Her: Stay right and turn right in .5 miles.Hubby:  What?  The better route is taking Exit 42!  (Which he would then proceed to do.)Her:  Recalculating.  Turn right ahead.....turn right ahead........recalculating.....take the next right exit.After the third time this happened and hubby ignored her, we got lost.  I asked my husband if he would just follow her directions completely for once.  (Asked is probably too gentle a description as I think they heard me three cars over.)He is 'Florida boy' and refused to admit that this sophisticated technical bitch might just know about a few new routes that he didn't.  One time I just turned her off and said, \"OK, you are one your own!!  You figure out how to get to the condo!!\" It did not take too long after this that he admitted he could use some help in this new part of Florida and she proceeded to take us to a traffic-free freeway which he had not known about and we got back to our condo in a very short time.  After this I began calling her Truthsayer  just to irritate my husband.  Me:  Shall we have Truthsayer find us a good restaurant?Me:  Shall we see if Truthsayer can route us to the canoe launch site?I will admit that sometimes she is a bit dyslexic when it comes to taking an address and figuring out which city I want without giving me an opportunity to punch in the city---or STATE!  She also can be a bit dense if you want to change the route mid-route, but I won't tell my husband that.  After all, we women have to stick together."},
{"title": "Pat---Characters #1", "date": "Monday, March 29, 2010", "text": "Our country neighborhood recently got a new restaurant...an Olive Garden.  Now if you live in the city you are thinking...yeah, big deal?  But out here where every restaurant is fast food or fried something, this chain ups the bar on interesting food.  The place is huge and had been opened about three weeks already.  Last week we decided to stop by and eat (on a Friday night) and when we got there the parking lot was filled.  The lobby was full of patiently waiting people and the host told us there was an 80 to 95 minute wait!  We did not want to spend that much time waiting for our dinner and went somewhere else.OK.  So on a Wednesday two weeks later, and over a month after it had been opened in this very rural area, we decided to try again.  This time there was only a 30 to 40 minute wait!  Geesh.  Someone has a gold mine here!  We went to the bar and actually ended up ordering dinner there.  I don't usually like eating at a bar but the atmosphere was cozy, the bar staff were wonderful and very charming and the food was delish and arrived much sooner than it would have otherwise.While sipping my wine and waiting for our salad there was a young person sitting at the end stool next to me.  I turned and smiled at him/her.  Perhaps you are wondering what I am getting at here.  If you ever saw Saturday Night Live and saw Julia Sweeney's terrific rendition of the character 'Pat' you will understand what I am talking about.  Pat was a sexually vague character and each skit was a set-up where someone tried to figure out if he/she was a man or a woman.  Sweeney is perhaps one of the most underrated comedians and played this character memorably.Well, this person looked like a 19 (could have even passed for 16) year-old.  He/She, whom I will now call Pat was drinking a coke and waiting for his/her takeout.  Pat was so much nicer looking (handsome, pretty) than TV Pat.  Dressed in a T-shirt and slacks and wearing a baseball cap with a man's haircut that covered orange-died curls in the front, made it impossible for me to resist making small talk.  I learned that 'Pat' was 29!  I commented that while he/she probably did not like looking so young, they would welcome this in later years.  'Pat's' voice did not provide a clue as to the sex.  'Pat' was very nice and I found out that he/she did technical/mechanical work on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Navy!  Pat loved this work and had been shipped all over the world at times because of his/her exceptional skills.Pat had served in the military in Iraq and liked it there but now worked for a contractor and was able to die 'their' hair orange just to drive the old command officer nuts.  I also learned that 'Pat' had an estranged relationship with his/her father who had left when he/she was only four and hated that the father now knew where he/she was living because of a regular security check that the contractor has to run every time there was a promotion.  (I obviously have a trusting face as we had an intimate conversation on all this while Pat waited for take-out and I waited for breadsticks.)Pat made a very good salary because of his/her skills and told me that he/she owned a town home and 4 vehicles but was unhappy to be living so far from the maddening crowd of the city.  Pat was a really interesting person with a great sense of humor and made me confident that our defense pilots were in good hands and I thanked Pat for his/her service to this great country.And, of course, just in case, I did not ask and Pat did not tell about... whatever."},

{"title": "I Should Be Relieved", "date": "Monday, March 22, 2010", "text": "I should be happy and relieved today since millions of Americans will soon be able to get the same or similar health care to mine.  Americans today who get a tragic chronic illness can feel more hopeful about getting the care they need.But I am depressed.  I saw too much ignorance and ugliness in the debate leading up to this bill.  I saw a video of a small man in a wheel chair with Parkinson's carrying a sign in support of the bill and being surrounded and yelled at by 6-10 white men who told him to go out and get a job!  They threw money at him as if he was some beggar rather than a citizen with a right to an opinion and a right to give that opinion.  He was very brave sitting their with these ugly souls towering over him.I drove out of the city on Saturday and was delayed by a long cadre of police motorcycles and cars going into the city and learned later that it was because of anti-health care bill protesters angrily surrounding several black Congressmen calling them racial names and spitting on them.  They also shouted homophobic epithets to Rep. Barney Frank the next day.  Who are these dangerous people?Some Tea Party protesters carried signs saying that if the bill passed they would incite violence.  My sister who is an attorney said last year that her Republican legal colleagues have actually purchased guns to be prepared...for what I do not know.  Where are their critical thinking skills?This was not a bill about sending our men and women to war.  This was not a bill about rescinding the constitution.  This was a bill about caring for our citizens who through no fault of their own need a hand.  These are not welfare junkies but people who have lost jobs or lost fights with the death panels of the insurance agencies.  We need to stand by them.  This is about the numerous hospitals that are closing their doors because they can not continue to provide health care for those who have no insurance and still balance their books. Conservative Congressmen were far from conservative in their rhetoric.  There were far from statesmanlike in their incitement of the part of the  crowd that was protesting the bill.  The difference between a democracy and other forms of government is that you have the right make your argument peacefully and without threat of violence.OK, I am done.  I do not like writing like this  because this is not what my blog is about and because I cannot change the minds of others.  But I am glad I got it off MY chest."},
{"title": "The Virtual World", "date": "Saturday, March 20, 2010", "text": "I wrote this post a week or so before I started reading Danah Boyd's PhD dissertation titled Taken Out of Context:  American Teen Society in Networked Publics.  (I am not really as geeky as this sounds but a friend of my son's linked to this on FB...AND I have not made it through all the the 390 pages and perhaps may never make it to the middle even as I am also in the middle of a Hemingway book and a book of poetry, but some of the  ideas discussed seems to go with this post...so I do add some of it here.)I have become established on Facebook (FB) in spite of my initial resistance and the fact that the person who originally asked me to join, and whom I befriended, almost immediately left this virtual space and disappeared because of issues with their family!   I am still struggling to understand why those who have hundreds of friends rarely post, and I, of course, have so few friends and post fairly often, and that has become a bit of an embarrassment.  This insecurity is all mine, because no one really cares how many 'friends' I have or clearly how often I post, and sadly, no one really cares what I have to say when I do post!  I disagree with the following conclusion:  \"people are no longer shaped just by their dwellings but by their networks (Mitchell 1995: 49).\"   Young people perhaps, but not those of us who are old hermits.  We don't care.  I hope I am not being shaped by my 'virtual' networks.  My real networks exist because of who I am...I don't think I am being shaped greatly by them.(Yet this is perhaps why I find blogging more enjoyable, because of the greater interaction and shaping of thought.)The interesting aspect of this virtual community (FB) that I have joined is I have found old, old friends that I knew decades ago and had lost contact with over time.  Sometimes these friendships are renewed with energy but most times we no longer have that much in common and this technology doesn't really make it easy to tell our tales and share our commonalities.  It is not exactly like meeting up at the local bar or coffee shop where alcohol or caffeine stimulate reduction in inhibitions and eye contact opens the conversation...something I would do more often if the few friends I have lived anywhere near me!  The exchanges that take place on FB are pretty much superficial.  We congratulate each other on posted accomplishments or send condolences when life is not perking along too well or the younger members post embarrassing pictures from last night's party.  Members also post the results of various virtual games that they play or their daily horoscope or other time-sinks that I have absolute no interest in.Everything seems to take place in 160 characters or less.  It is a Gen-X world and not at all reflective of  the Jane Austin school of correspondence.  I would call it the IM update school of self-indulgence.  It gives everyone a chance to be a brief stand-out comedian or to rally support for a cause.  One wonders what innocuous post will come back to haunt the poster in decades to come?  Those love affairs that are so pookie cute and then long since dissolved?  Remarks on recent job changes that seemed so innocent at the time?  I am at a stage in my life where anything I say would be miraculous if it actually made an impact on the rest of my life.  But these profiles for the younger generation do continually evolve as its users evolve..

It is not an outcome of the technology alone or its potential.)I do post photos and it seems that the historic scanning has put me in touch with friends of my children as they remember the 'good old days.'  Their lives are so busy that they rarely look back and I think that my photos help them put some perspective on their journey(s) forward.  They see themselves in that ancient innocent and enthusiastic period of their lives before responsibilities cluttered their peace.  At least, I like to think that may be true.But,  as I have often heard and firmly believe, do not put anything on the Internet that you would not want to read the following day on the front pages of a major newspaper.What do you think of the FB and are you on?"},

{"title": "The Eye of the Camera", "date": "Sunday, March 14, 2010", "text": "(Brief interruption of my tedious Florida travel log...you can leave and go to the bathroom.)I like to think that my love of photography is my new hobby due to having more time now that I am retired.  I also like to think that the digital technology has made this another reason I take pictures so generously and spend so much time looking for new things to take pictures of.But, in truth, I have taken pictures my whole life.  I saved my allowance for my first camera when I was about 11.  It was a Kodak Brownie box camera.  It was just exactly that, a small black plastic box with a tiny lens to preview your shot.  I could barely afford the film and had to send it out for development to some address I discovered on the back of one of my well perused comic books each time I saved enough money.  I had the camera for about a year, when one hot summer day I forgot and left it in the back window of our Chevrolet and it warped in the heat.  My mother was totally unsympathetic and hoped I had learned a lesson.  (I always suspected she saw it there and left it to prove a point although with her odd punishment theories, who knew.)  I was devastated.There were later cameras to follow that I purchased as a teenager.  After I married my husband, I was free to use his expensive Nikon with the underwater housing, a camera that became my best pal when I was learning to SCUBA dive in the South Pacific and beginning to discover the beauty beneath the surface of the ocean. While we traveled overseas to many countries there were only two times when I was very uncomfortable taking pictures as a tourist and realized how much contrast there was in freedom in American.  One time I was traveling in Taiwan.  I was approached by a policeman who made it quite clear that I would not be allowed to continue to take pictures on one of the outlying islands close to Mainland China that we visited.  I was also told to keep my camera in my lap during the short plane ride to the island. (I think I remember that I cheated a little.)  While living in  Egypt for a short time one summer, I was approached by a police officer in Cairo and told I could not take photos down a certain street.  I was also approached later that week in Port Said, Egypt, and told I could not take photos after approaching a bridge area that was leading to the Suez Canal.  These Egyptian uniformed and weapon-carrying men were stern and serious and I did not question their authority, both because I could still see the damage to buildings from a recent war, and I did not want to lose my camera or film.A few weeks ago I received the following link in an email newsletter on photography.  If you take pictures I suggest you watch it carefully because it says a lot about how fragile our freedoms can be.  It also reminds us that we need to know our countries laws and rights and to be aware of how silly irrational fears can make us lose important freedoms in an instant.  Freedoms that when taken away do NOT make us any safer.Of course one should always ask permission before taking someone's photo, because sometimes they can be very shy and intimidated."},

So what we really accomplished was donating funds so that it could grow to be more interesting in years to come.The children's garden was fun and mostly complete and a good place to bring grandchildren some day...maybe.  Maybe I will meet Beverly or Onewoman with their lovely grandchildren running through this garden on a Florida afternoon.  It seems to be designed to fit all ages and includes a tree house, climbing nets, a water place and a large sand play area.We also stopped at the Edison/Ford summer homes-museum and spent an afternoon walking around.  It is full of industrial inventions and shows the history of much of the industrialization in our country, so we could have spent all day except hubby had to stop and talk to Mrs. Edison.  She was quite an imposing woman, but then she would have to be, to be married to Thomas, wouldn't she?.

When he is on a mission it is impossible to keep up!  Just to let you know he was wearing tight black jeans and black cowboy boots, of all things.Shortly after that we headed to the water and were sitting on a lovely bench swing beneath a shelter on the Savannah waterfront.  Butler had just completed putting up this wire barrier in the ceiling above to keep out the hundreds of pigeons and then gave us a stern look as he pointed at the sign behind the screen which he must have installed earlier.  You may need to click on the photo.  Scheduled swinging?  What happened to the leisurely South?  They should never let Butler run amok in the land of romance.  I neglected to take a picture, but beneath his winter London fog coat he appeared to be in a tuxedo?  Historically Savannah was the land of cotton and this area had been lined with warehouses for shipping out the bales.  There was very little time then for swinging, I am sure.We ignored Butler's stern frown and headed back into town looking for some hot tea and nutrition past the houses that sometimes look like cake frosting.  Savannah, definitely one of my favorite cities, affords too many opportunities for photos.  Lots of fun architecture and too much wonderful history to put in this blog post.  The last photo is Savannah's famous Rainbow Row which has houses painted the colors of the Caribbean.Before we leave Savannah there will be time for a little nightlife in my next post."},

Later research revealed that years ago there were three bells that rang on all fire alarms until 1927, and then only on second and third alarms. These bells also alerted the city to hurricanes, severe temperature changes, and notable national events, such as Barry reaching his monumental goal. There are certain clues that let you know you are entering the authentic south and one of these was what awaited us when we checked into our hotel.  We had checked into a small hotel near town and found a lunch sack of goodies from the manager.  They included hard candies, a small bag of taco chips and this can of Yoohoo chocolate drink.  Only in the South can you get such healthy gifts!  Note that the can says it contains 7 vitamins and minerals in order to justify its existence!  There was only ONE can, so we had to share.  I have not drunk this in years and probably/hopefully never will again!In the next post we actually run into Butler and Bagman in Savannah, of all places!"},
{"title": "Life Story # 30 --- Surviving With the \"Others\"", "date": "Friday, February 26, 2010", "text": "Just before I start my North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida travel reminiscing posts, I am feeling the need to post a little bit about my life with the 'Others' while living on an island group in the South Pacific that the \"Survivors'\" cast actually visited one season.   I have been scanning slides, of course.  I am not in the photo below, but I took the picture.I have remained in touch with two of the people in this photo but the lady in the hot pink dress has since passed on.  She was a red-hot momma and full of interesting stories, and the only one that I knew there that swam in the ocean nude, which I pretended did not shock me at all at the time.  She had two teenage or twenty-something boys from whom she was estranged as they led drug-delaying lives in Southern California.  Her husband was sharp as a tack and was a former pirate and smuggler of rare animals into the U.S. before actually taking an honest job on this island running the tuna cannery.  He reminded me of John Wayne or Hemingway with his larger than life personality and body size.   I was a twenty-something farm girl and it didn't take much to keep me fascinated during those years.   The baby in this photo is my daughter. This apartment building, as you will remember if you read prior posts on my blog, is where I lived.  They were called the 'Pink Apartments ' by the expats and they only had running water and electricity every other or every third or every fourth day.  It all depended on whether the drunk who ran the generator remember to add fuel or whether the other local islander remembered to turn on the water that day, as water was rationed.  The fact that we all remained friends was a miracle, but it does explain the need to use alcohol and sex to soften the tension.  The stenciled numbers above the door makes it look like some military base or certainly the location of the 'Others.'  (Maybe that little boy in the foreground is a current producer of \"Survivor\" or \"Lost\" and this is where his vision for one of the television series first took form.)  Actually living there was more like \"Desperate Housewives\" than \"Survivor.\"  The affairs and flirting and babies...I would spill all, but some of it is really X-rated, such as the American nymphomaniac nurse that eventually got kicked off the island.  I guess that I actually got sophisticated fairly rapidly having friends all over the spectrum including the missionaries who were there and didn't really get along with each other and the priest who was an alcoholic but a gentle old soul.I have probably forgotten the best stories.  Should have kept a diary."},
{"title": "Bummed", "date": "Thursday, February 25, 2010", "text": "Returned from my cool spring days visiting in Florida.  Weather was in the high 40's to high 50's and only hit the 60's on one day.  Thus the only beach pictures I have were taken through the window of a bar as we watched the setting sun on Shrove Tuesday at the touristy Ft. Myers Beach area.  We are not the celebratory type, so we sneaked away to an odd little room off the bar and sat at a wobbly little table to quietly watch the sunset and left the old and young folks with the feathered hats and beads to the other end of the room.  The strong wind across the beach created little feathers of rainbow dust, which was fun to watch.  A few hardy souls in coats and hats walked the shore.  These photos are for Colleen who loves the beach as much as I and who would have put on her jacket and posed for me!As to the title of this post, why am I bummed?  Well, it is not the weather because the odd cold spring in Florida is still better than winter here.  It is not the snow and downed trees that awaited my return because they had been somewhat cleared and we were actually able to drive right up to the house on our return.  It is not the bill that will come from the young men who removed (partially) the trees.  (It is not those politicos whose statements followed us on the radio where they were using the snowstorms to denigrate Al Gore and climate change...although, I do find it depressing that such ignorance about science exists in Congressmen and that whatever school system they went through did not educate them on the differences between weather and climate and how climate change is going to produce dramatic weather changes.  If it was all in jest, then I can hardly wait to see their second act when entire cities and villages drift into the sea.)The actual reason I am so bummed is because my Canon Digital SLR, purchased in early 2007, died yesterday.  I have no idea what happened but it will not turn on.  Changed batteries, cleaned terminals, etc. and no luck.  I called a repair place about 70 miles up the road and they said it would cost a minimum of $255 AND would take 4-6 weeks as they send it away!  I don't know if I am more depressed about the cost or the loss of a camera for so long especally as spring gets here.  (I bit the bullet and sent the camera directly to Canon at the minimum cost of $215.)I have a bunch of travel photos to work on, so that will keep me busy while I think or perhaps EXERCISE---now that would be novel!My point and shoot which was my back up camera no longer focuses when the zoom is on as the focus mechanism is broken when I bumped the extended lens two weeks ago, so that is limited help.  When it rains it pours...but at least the rain is melting the snow."},

The hedge in the mid-distance is a lovely cedar that fell across the driveway with a big snowy sigh.  There was another even larger cherry tree across the driveway closer to the house!  It was like our hiking trips to get back home.  (Post Script:  Just got off the phone from talking with our tree removal guy who cannot get into the driveway with his big truck because it is still too snowy and wet...he did say that the other BIG pine tree at the front of the driveway also added its opinion to this snowy winter...that makes 4 trees down so far!)If we do have this much snow when I get back,  I am getting out my magnifying glass and putting a stop to all this nonsense.  Let's hope I don't start a forest fire!"},

Days in Palau, Micronesia.  I vaguely remember one of the activities during the two day celebration involved a rooster fight, because I came across the photos!This next photo was taken at a meeting in Tonga.  (I did the math and my daughter was conceived at this meeting.)  No, none of the above is hubby."},

If I tweak this photo just a little I can make the day sunny and filled with promise.  It looks like the weather may not be so bad after all once I candy-coat the image.  Maybe the storm is waning?But what if I decide to be truly honest and let you see the full photo and let you decide for yourself about the sky that day?  What if I trust you enough to handle the full story...all the information?  It would make a big difference, wouldn't it?(If you are an educator of children and teach critical thinking skills, please feel free to use this post.)"},

I was planning to give you a call about releasing it back down your way but…. it took off on me when I was taking something into the cage.

He has longstanding loyal and honest friends which attests to his character.He spends too much of his free time either playing golf, watching football or playing fantasy football on the computer...but all people have their vices and his does not involve alcohol or other women.I did get a clue about some of our basic differences when he tried to shut off the skylight in the bathroom until my daughter explained what a skylight was!I got another clue about our differences when he told my daughter that he felt we were somewhat prejudiced because we valued higher education so much.  (He doesn't read anything unless it is on a computer screen or in Entertainment Magazine.)I got another clue when my daughter explained his surprise that she had such strong ethical rules and honesty standards (stronger than his) even though she did not attend church on a regular basis. (This was after he hit a car while attempting to park several spaces ahead and slightly damaging the other car's side mirror.)I got a clue when we learned he was an ardent Republican and totally had no passion for environmental issues.  He also thought our prior president was pretty smart.One more clue was provided recently when he told my daughter he thought we were a little strange for taking in an injured wild bird and then spending the time to drive 3o miles to a rescue shelter. But the final clarity of how deeply we were different came when he noticed the number of cookbooks on the shelf in my kitchen and asked why more than just one or two would ever be needed.  My life will always be spicier and more interesting and perhaps I can add just a little spice to his life.I do think that differences in people are what help the world go round and help test our values and beliefs.  We just have to realize we cannot change people and we can only change ourselves.  (It has taken me almost my full life to learn how to live this!)These two young people do make a well-matched couple as was in evidence when they were visiting their friends over the New Year's weekend.  They were staying up late playing cards, when the mistress of the house where they were staying saw a tiny gray mouse dart under her refrigerator and proceeded to scream in panic as she jumped on the couch.  My S.I.L. followed in like manner and with the same panic stood on a nearby chair.  My daughter and the man of the house got a broom and bucket in an unsuccessful attempt to corner the little free-loader.  There is a pattern and balance to life that works out in the end."},

It was a long day and we did not reach the rescue house until way after dark.  We struggled to find our way through the nest of houses and cul de sacs in the city suburbs.  The lovely GPS our children had bought us for Christmas was no real help!  It seemed this subdivision, while not new, was off the data map and in some bird twilight zone.Zorro seemed to be fine in the back seat although initially he was a little nervously active and I worried about him damaging more wing feathers.As we eventually pulled into the driveway of the rescue house I saw a large furry cat sitting on a cat stand in the window.  But (fortunately) the cat quickly disappeared when I rang the doorbell, and a little lap dog greeted us with high energy, and thankfully no yapping.Lynn, the rescue lady, takes in all kinds of birds and ends up keeping the hawks and raptors that cannot be returned to the wild as her personal mission. She has an inspiring video on her web site where she recently released a bald eagle that had been rehabilitated.  She took Zorro and ran her fingers carefully and expertly along the wings and seemed to feel that nothing was broken.  She did explain that it was not unusual for a bird to sprain a wing while flying because of these high wind gusts.Her laundry room was filled with a gray parrot, and two other smaller parrots that I did not recognize, that had been abandoned by incompetent owners.  While they were noisy it was not the deafening noise you normally hear in a pet store filled with parrots.Her garage held a number of wild birds for rehabilitation including a seriously damaged Cooper's hawk that had been hit by a police car.  She kept it in a very small cage so that he would not further injure himself.  She had prepared a little cage for Zorro but I did not take photos in order to avoid disturbing all the feathered friends nearby.We talked birds for a little while, but we had to head to our daughter`s house in the city.  It was hard to say good-bye because we had gotten attached to Zorro and hubby had actually started negotiating with me to keep the bird before we turned him (or her) over to rescue.  We felt better to know that Zorro was in good and experienced hands.  Lynn sent an email several days later that indicated Zorro was doing fine and eating well, although still not flying but she said that she had high hopes he would repair soon.  This is a good enough ending for us for now, it will have to be."},

I let him sleep in and didn't bring him out into the living room until 8:00 although I was very concerned about how he had survived the night.  I had prepared a breakfast of chopped dates, and chopped green grapes and found some raspberry newton cookies and actually proceeded to scoop out the raspberry filling in small portions to add to this sugar fix.   I added a few chopped walnuts for fat and salt.  I am quite the gourmet bird chef when given a chance and if I had the opportunity I might expand his diet so that is would be more balanced!He had kept the fresh water that I gave him last night poop free, so I left it alone and then slid in the plastic lid of chopped fruit.  We had also given him some dried grass heads to nestle in during the night and to this I added the fragrant cedar branches that had been picked the night before so that he might feel more at home.He looked very alert and was hopping around the cage and onto the grass sprigs.  I brought him out from the laundry room and placed him near the window that frames the bird feeders in the distance and he started immediately grooming himself.  Such vanity this species has!I decided that he looked healthy enough to be set free, so I placed him in the garage to get used to the colder temperatures.   An hour later I saw a cedar waxwing high on the oak tree in my back yard and hurried into the garage to see if I could do some match-making.I placed the cage on the deck table outside where we keep the heated water for wild birds.  I slid open the bird cage door and stepped back.  He looked out carefully through the opening and in a few seconds hopped to the edge of the open door.  A minute after that he hopped onto to the table.  He hurried to the table's edge and I could almost read his mind.  He wanted so much to take off to the wonderful trees on all sides.  He could not believe he was free!  He hopped to the other edge of the table and glanced up again and then waited.   After five minutes of this we realized that something was really wrong with his wing(s).  He made no attempt to even jump to the deck railing although he was clearly thinking about it. Hubby scooped him up in his hands and he carefully placed him back in the cage.  I called the rescue number I had found on the Internet.  After talking to the woman at the other end she told me that she keeps her rescued birds in her garage, so Zorro is going back to that climate and after hubby's dental appointment this afternoon, he is heading to this convalescent home for birds.I will post more tomorrow."},

How did he do that you may ask?  If you saw the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding you may remember the scene where the young woman gets nervous and proceeds to walk away from her computer with her headset connected and still on her head.  Hubby did not pull the laptop off the desk during his quick retreat, but it seemed that he destroyed the plug-in port and needed to get a USB replacement.  (He is the most expensive computer user I know!) Anyway, I digress...terribly.We went to the big box store where we could save hundreds of dollars by spending hundreds of dollars and managed in a short time to fill the shopping cart with big boxes of stuff.  Paper towels, pasta, chocolate, coffee...you know...the essentials of life.The winter winds continued their bitter stomping through our neck of the woods and they shoved us across the parking lot like tough bullies.  Loading the car took careful speed as our fingers froze and frozen wind whipped down our necks and pulled bags from our grip.It was on our drive home as we turned into our wooded neighborhood that we saw this wounded, or what appeared to be wounded, cedar waxwing.  He was hopping ever so slowly across the road.  He would hop once or twice and then seemed to catch his breath thinking about whether he had energy to hop again.  As we approached he stopped hopping and just sat there in the middle of the road maybe hoping his suffering would finally come to an end under the wheels of our car.  Hubby looked at me and I looked at him.  Finally I said that we needed to see if we could help. (My loyal readers will remember another encounter we had with an unexpected woods visitor here or the time we failed to help a lovely owl with an owwie which I posted on my other blog here.  I am a BIG softie for animals.)\"You get him.\" hubby said with decisive speed as he rubbed his hands between his legs and sat back against his seat stoically indicating he was definitely going to remain in the warmth of the car.I opened the door and moved slowly to the front of the car expecting this fragile gift of life to fly into the sky leaving me cold and startled.  But the small bird  continued to just sit there and then surprised me by hopping across the road and with some effort toward my feet!  He stopped and actually looked up at me!  Honest!I bent down to lift him and was very surprised that he did not struggle in anyway.  He just snuggled into the warmth of my leather gloved hands like he had come home to mama.  I returned to the car and realized that I had no hands to open the door.  Hubby had to lean across the seat and open the door.  I am thankful to have exercised recently and maintained my sense of strength and balance as stepping up into a large SUV while holding your hands out in front of you in a prayer and getting into those high seats requires considerable strength and balance.Cedar waxwings up close are the most divinely colored birds.  They are gray and brown and yellow and even a little peach and look as though they were wrapped in the softest velvet.  They wear a dark velvet mask across their sparkling black eyes, intriguing Zorros of the bird world.  (They also are very messy if you read my post on my other blog a while back.)This little waxwing peaked his eye through the space between my thumb and forefinger, but made no effort to push his tiny head through the opening.  He just watched my face as we headed home and made no sound.We have a fragile bamboo bird cage that has never held a bird.  It was purchased in Indonesia or Panama...I cannot remember from which roadside stand so long ago.  It was lovelier with the natural bamboo, but I was in my cottage phase of life and painted it white and hung it covered in silk flowers in my sun room decades ago.  The cage now sits in the basement with dusty abandon.  Hubby got this cage into the garage and we released the bird inside.  I took him into the house and filled a small bowl with water.  Since we have well water, I did not have to worry about the chlorine.  Zorro proceeded to poop three times (they are from the Bombycilla family) and then jumped feet first into the small water bowl and drank heartily.I sighed as these were good signs.  I could study him now and saw that one of his wings looked slightly askew and showed the blood red wax tip on one of his secondaries that is the reason they got their name.I knew that they don't eat bird seed but placed a little on the floor of the cage, just in case.  I also put in several small pieces of fresh date and dried cranberry.  Hubby went outside to find juniper berries, without success, and by the time he returned it was dark and I had place the bird on the floor of the laundry room and put a beach towel over the cage so that he would not die of stress or fear.  It is late in the evening and I have not heard a peep out of him.   If he lives, I will call the rescue office tomorrow."},

The back door to the deck which had not been opened in days was stuck and stiff to open.  I pulled hard and it released suddenly blowing open with the rush of bitter icy wind followed by tulip tree seeds that scattered across the carpet.The wind whipped at my scarf and coat as I held on tight to my camera to keep it warm for just a while.  The naked branches of trees above my head danced as if in some crazy drug induced trance.  Everything was being pummeled by this arctic rush hour expressway.I saw the scene in the photo above when I reached the river's edge.  Waves had frozen in custard layers as they grazed the shore during the night.  The tide was heading out but against the push of the wind onto the shore creating waves of ice.  Nothing was moving along the edge of the river.  Everything was still and frozen or hibernating somewhere.A gust of wind pushed hard against my back and almost dumped me unceremoniously into the cold wet river.  I planted my feet firmly and leaned into the wind, but found it hard to keep my balance as the gusts were not predictable and I was out on the edge of the open water and not in the small shelter of the woods.I took a few photos and then made my way back to the house.  Its warmth was certainly welcome when I opened the back door.This cold is below the normal and seems to be going on forever.  Thankfully we have not had to contend with snow drifts or ice sheets...just endless blowing wind that was cold enough to freeze a witches...!  Spring, do not be afraid, your turn is coming."},

Zip up the tree bag...unless you notice that small red bird ornament on that bottom branch that was forgotten.  Darn!  Take the ornament downstairs and put it in the bottom ornament bin after lifting off the top bin of stuff... or just stuff it into any old bin that is easy to reach.Drag the tree bag downstairs to the basement trying carefully not to kill each other or damage the furniture or scratch the walls or stub your toes or tear the tree bag or swear out loud.Once everything is packed away be prepared to find that forgotten silver star hanging in the guest bathroom and that home-made wreath from the church still hanging on the kitchen window!  Pour yourself some leftover eggnog with a stiff shot of bourbon and put your feet up, you have survived another season."},
{"title": "Bringing Dharma", "date": "Wednesday, January 06, 2010", "text": "(This is a brief movie review and if you hate those you probably do not want to read this post.)     Spent a holiday afternoon watching the much touted (or maligned depending on which critic you read) movie,  Avatar---in 3-D.  Writer/Director James Cameron spared no expense and with such lovely and terrifying special effects, the movie should gender a return on these expenses.  His previous work with deep water life can be seen in all the mimicking botany on the planet including the mesmerizing phosphorescence of plant life in each evening scene.  He borrows Jurassic park sounds and uses similar animals to flesh out the wild animal part of the planet and ideas from Star Trek also seem to be there.  There is nothing really new about this story.  The indigenous peoples of the planet are all spiritual and intelligent, even if sometimes immature.  They 'connect' with all the living things on their planet and have strong family and ancestral ties.  There is an earthling/indigenous being (interracial) love story, of course.  The earthlings are 99% evil businessmen or military killers providing the action of death and destruction by man and machine.  The industrial military complex has but one mission, to retrieve important minerals without regard for indigenous life.  Such lopsidedness gives the movie an unrealistic liberal skew.  I would have liked to see more respect for our military by adding more good guys.  In spite of this heavy handedness, it is a good ride to be seen on the big screen, especially if you are a sci-fi fan as I am.  That part of the story is pretty cool.(The title of this blog was taken from the Hindu gift of Avatars and this blog was written the day after Christmas.) I also saw Nine because I am a sucker for musicals.  It was not nearly as good as Chicago. It lacked the energy and the theme was a bit old hat. Daniel Day Lewis does a great job of becoming the old Italian artist in spite of his size.  Sophia Loren is sadly stiff in her old age, but I wish she had been given a longer part to warm that face up a little.  The best show numbers are done by the two youngest in the cast, of course."},

The house is very quiet since hubby sleeps in until 7:30 or 8:00.  The house is also still dark because it is winter.  I make my coffee and open blogs as the sun slowly climbs up into the cold sky. In winter I hear the geese flapping and honking their way out of my side of the river into their bigger world of abandoned corn fields or sometimes escaping the hunters when I hear the pop of guns on the other side of the field. Today, I saw them high above the fog over my house looking as if they were ghosts of geese heading out to some mystical retreat.  I hear the crows distant cawing ordering the rest of the birds around.Yet, it is still relatively quiet here in my little corner of the world. I am surprised that I still need a little corner of time in retirement that I treasure. Time to be alone with my waking thoughts and time to write and create with my photography. Time to think about what lies ahead in my non-activity filled day.  Time to hear my breath.  Time to wait for the fog to lift."},

(Those of you in another climate can put this in the back of the closet as it will keep until your  gray or winter days arrive.)Wrapped in paper covered in laughing Santas is this medium sized box, and I ask that you hold on tight.  This is because inside is a big red bowl full of rolling laughs.  Do not eat them all at once or your belly will shake too much.  Also, be sure to share them around the room as laughter is always better when enjoyed with others.Next, wrapped in paper with golden glittering stars, I give you the gift of a child's smile.  What?  You say there are no children in your life.  Then you must open your eyes and watch closely because somewhere near you a child IS smiling or needs to smile.  Then again you can enjoy this gift sooner if you go out and help a child smile. At the bottom of the trunk, wrapped in white paper with silver icicles in a very small box, is the jeweled gift of eternal/internal peace.  Sometimes peace is so light that you cannot hold it; sometimes peace is so blinding that you cannot see it.  Therefore, you may think this tiny box is empty.  But it is not.  Lift the lid and close your eyes and breath in deeply and very gently.  There it is.  It has entered your soul.  It is gently filling all the nooks and crannies of your mind and heart with a soft warmth.  It is, perhaps, my best gift as one size fits all.Oh, I almost forgot.  This last gift is for my bloggers that are fighting the bigger challenges in life these days.  Down in the bottom corner of this dusty trunk is a platinum pill box and inside are little nanobots that come with tiny platinum hammers.  Their job is to smash replicating cells inside bodies of those fighting difficult diseases.  They are like the energizer bunny in that they never quit so you need only take a few every once in a while when you think you can no longer find energy to fight the good fight.Now as we sit surrounded by piles of bows and wrapping paper, I wish all the happiest of holidays.Hmmm...excuse me...I think I smell cinnamon..."},

Is he out running another background check on a virus?)  PS...Through training I think my PC is beginning to get the hang of my plug-ins at long last!The default on this new version of Windows does not change how your mouse looks (remember the hourglass) when it is thinking.  That means that sometimes you think 7 is done thinking and you move your mouse elsewhere...but nothing happens because it is still thinking!Windows 7 does not like anything 'old' and there are not enough Windows 7 users for software companies to make something 'new'.  Use your old software at your own risk and good luck finding compatible new versions on the Internet.Windows 7 gives you lots of 'helpful' little pop-up windows asking you questions when you are trying to move or upload something as it accesses various software \"assistants\" and it sometimes makes me a little dyslexic as to which one to choose.  Sometimes the windows hide behind each other and you don't even know it has been hanging until you close all the windows.A fancy new feature of Windows 7 that would only appeal to the designers or 14-year-0lds is that you can 'shake' the window in which you are working and it will automatically expand to the full screen.  This unfortunately also happens if you cannot see the mouse pointer and you are moving the mouse rapidly back and forth to see where the pointer is located and the screen jumps to full view.  Very annoying if you have several windows up at once.The last thing I noticed on this PC, although not a function of Windows 7, was that the flash drive port is a little tight.  My husbands X-rated response...\"Well, of course.  It's a virgin port.  It should be a little tight.\"  You can see how much tech help I get from him!"},

{"title": "UGH!!", "date": "Tuesday, December 08, 2009", "text": "I am struggling with all the changes that happen when one goes with a new computer.  Some things went easily such as ONE of the printer installs and getting the online to work.  The other printer my old workhorse a HP deskjet 932C has a Windows 7 driver some where out there.  I am dwnloading about 32 windows updates, maybe I'll get lucky.  I did get lucky with the dual monitor setup.  Didn't want to give up my old monitor and now have TWO monitors...one for blogging and one for photos.Others such as installing all my old 'licensed' software packages are not going so well.  Most have been stalled perhaps by this 64 bit Windows 7 system?  I have been told that many old software packages just will not work with 64 bit.I have the choice of buying all new software or calling in a professional to fix all this.  Neither are going to be very cheap!I will return, once I can get this stupid pre-installed cable from the back of my brand new monitor and install the HD cable I bought.  It appears that I need to get a pair of pliers.  Beware of PC workers carrying pliers or screwdrivers.Other things I have noticed that are cramping my style is that new features do not easily let you change your home page to that old familiar one and this keyboard...they keep moving the delete key!!!  AND I HAD FORGOTTEN HOW NASTY these companies are forcing one to use Yahoo or AOL as the home page on install!On ward and upward.Retirement to a country life is deemed romantic by some and is usually a less expensive life style.  But it has some distinct disadvantages.  One of these is finding a reasonable selection of health care workers.  While we retained our connection with specialists an hour away such as my husbands prostate cancer doctor, we did change all of the others.  Our primary care physician is scattered, sort of nerdy, and reminds me of my uncle who was a 'momma's boy'.  He has correctly diagnosed a few illnesses we have had since moving here. We are continuing to use him, but really hope to find someone we connect with more.Our optometrist is young and cute and female.  Hubby has fallen in love with her. He claims he likes her because she looks him in the eye (!).  She uses all the latest technology, and her office is nearby so we will keep her. The dentist was selected on a whim while driving by his office in a delightful building on a side road.  He is charming and his whole staff is pleasant and very good at what they do.  The only problem is that he is off network for our insurance.  This means our insurance will require us to pay 40% - 60% of all expenses.  Hubby does not want to give this dentist up and start the search for a new one.  In-network dentists are quite a drive from where we live.  Hubby also strongly feels that the health of ones teeth are more important to general good health as we age.  He is right of course.We asked what insurance this dentist carried and we looked at getting that as a rider.  But it would cost about $900 a year for the two of us. At that rate, after three or four years it might be cheaper just to pay for dental care out of pocket!  I am looking at a filling replacement  and a small bite correction in the near future.  I have until the 15th to change my health insurance in any way.Yuck!"},

{"title": "Between the Lines", "date": "Tuesday, December 01, 2009", "text": "Here I was, once again, on my way rushing to the dock.  Why I am always rushing is any-one's guess but I know that some day I will be too arthritic to rush anywhere and I will have to settle for a joggle.  Anyway, I was hurrying to help blow out the lines...the hose line that is used at the boat.  Hubby was in the house with an air compressor at the correct (we hoped) plumbing juncture in the basement.  The incorrect junture might blow the expensive 'ornaments' on the inside sinks.  My job was to turn on the hose water at the dock, watch it drain into the river and then let him know when it was empty so that he could turn off the water line from the house.  As I carried cell phone in hand I skipped ever so dangerously over the slippery leaves that had since covered the path on the hill down to the dock trail (for the 4th time I might add--the leaves covering not me skipping),   As I maintained a tighter grip on the phone I saw with surprise that I was just getting ready to put my foot down on the back of our resident black snake!  There he lay in the path slightly covered by brown leaves and not moving his curving black line.  He was in slow mo due to the colder weather.  My frantic approach did not encourage him to move away and yet I knew he was alive.  I hesitated stepping over and, instead, scuffled some leaves toward him hoping it might encourage him to go on his way.  No such luck.  I finally got the courage to move around the back of him while straddling the tree roots on the side of the path.  I did this pretty rapidly, because, while I am an outdoor gal, I am always leery of snakes, even safe ones like our black resident.He was still in the same place 15 minutes later when I returned after successfully emptying the hose line but his curving black line was more squiggly which is something they do when nervous.   This time he had formed a U as if wondering if he should return to whence he came, since this path which had not been used much recently due to colder weather seemed to be enduring some crazy rush hour human traffic.  I, once again, only on the other side of the trail away from his head, stepped on some fallen logs and made my way carefully around giving him plenty of room.That afternoon I finished vacuuming and dusting the upstairs bedrooms to be ready for Thanksgiving company.  Then, as a reward, I went up to my upstairs nook to blog and read some blogs.  I was alone in the house because hubby was greasing the boat lift; boats are an endless source of fun and expensive time consuming maintenance.  The house was quiet except for the clicking of my fingers on the keyboard.  Behind me I heard a light tapping/slicing noise.  I stopped typing and 'opened' my ears and turned my head from side to side.  No noise.  I continued typing and the tut tut noise started again.  It was coming from behind my head.  I turned and the photo below is what I saw.It was the line of my vacuum proceeding in snakelike fashion to move on down the stairway where the weighted head of the cleaner was pulling it with gravity.  The tapping was the ridges of the hose catching and then releasing against the corner of the file cabinet as it uncurled.  This silver snake like movement was just a little unnerving after my morning experience."},

{"title": "Life Story # 29 --  The Dinner Party 2009", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2009", "text": "It began with the request by hubby to invite a couple to dinner.  Tabor was not exactly excited about this burp in her weekly plans.  Thanksgiving was just around the corner and there were bedrooms to clean, meals to plan, food to buy and porches and decks to clean as well as decorations to get out and large platters to pull from the back of cupboards.  Now he wants me to cook a meal for some other company before all this?  For people I don't even know?  But Tabor realized that this dinner was important because they were like strangers in a strange land and needed to break bread with someone.The man had just been hired to work at the nearby small community college and was still trying to find his way.  He was working with people from a different culture and people who perhaps did not have the passion for accomplishment that he did.  They were people who hesitated to make change because it probably meant failure but most certainly meant more work.  He was American but actually an Eastern Indian by culture and who for the past six years worked in the Marshall Islands.  He was tall, thin, and handsome and had not lost his country's accent.   His parents still lived in India although his father had worked in France for a while.  This dinner guest, in spite of or due to his sophisticated upbringing, was still seen as an outsider by the local community.  His wife, shorter and pretty, was Laotian but had lived in America since she was eight.  She had stayed and worked in Boston during this time and was raising their two twin boys with the help of her parents.  She had worked her way up in a company providing support to database software and hardware for the big stock brokers and finance companies.  She had held on to this job when the company was laying off others.  The couple had sacrificed big time by being apart for months at a time over many years, knowing that in his field of science jobs were hard to come by.  Now he had been rewarded with a job stateside where he was much closer to his wife and sons.  He was so happy to be back in America but somewhat unhappy in this stagnant job.  He was smart and energetic.  They were strangers in this rural conservative community and we could be the connection they needed to maintain their sanity.(Tabor asked hubby about dietary restrictions, having at least some idea of international eating issues.  Since there were none, she proceeded to put together a salmon with a Thai curry sauce with chopped kaffir lime from her tree.  To this was added a tumeric rice dish, stir fried swiss chard in bacon fat with chopped bacon and to cool the tongue a cucumber salad with mint/basil/sour cream dressing.  For dessert, just to really make the meal over the top crazy, she made brownies served with vanilla ice cream.  Fortunately, everyone had cast iron stomachs and she got compliments.)The dreaded entertainment event went very well.  The couple were completely charming and well educated.  Once they realized that we saw that the world was composed of a whole group of people with common interests and common goals and that we did not view the world as privileged citizens from the top of Mount U.S. we had wonderful conversations in our attempt to solve the world's problems.  We shared stories of travels and travel interruptions and travel surprises.  Relieved that there were no talks of sports, potty training, holiday shopping, it was like the old dinner parties.A discussion of the movie, Slumdog Millionaire, brought to light the concept that maybe this slum was actually kept in place by the government of India because it produced many cheap products and provided cheap but intellectual labor.  It was like a company town kept in place by government bureaucracy according to our guest.  The young man mentioned working with a technician from India who helped set up the cell phone network in the Marshall Islands.  When our dinner guest had returned to India with this man on a trip he found that his home was in the slum.  A one and half story shed built of tin where 8 people slept.  Tabor's guest was from a higher level in India and even he was surprised at this contrast in the man's skills and where he lived.   Tabor's guest was not like some of the haughty Brahmin's she had met on her travels and she realized she must watch her prejudices.  His life in the U.S. had made him very democratic.By the end of the evening Tabor wanted more time to explore Laos and its customs with the wife.  She had forgotten to ask for pictures of the twins.  She knew that the young man would be moving on to other jobs when the opportunity came, but maybe she would have the chance to entertain this young couple again in the future.  They were a nice reminder of what Thanksgiving was all about."},
{"title": "That Digital Sugar High", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2009", "text": "I listened to a program on MSNBC  (I think) that was discussing how hard it is for people to stop checking their Bl**kberries or logging into FB or Blogger on their computers at least a dozen times a day. They were addicted to any new items from friends or from news feeds. The network interviewed a psychiatrist and she said that our brains were hardwired for the novel. We automatically were intrigued by a new view, a new vision or new news. Therefore this new social networking was like a chemical addiction for the brain. She actually said is was like sugar for our brain.  My husband, who does not own a hand-held personal communication device like a Bl**kberry, said that on his travels many of the people he met with had these little electronic devices in hand and were checking routinely.  (It is almost as if they were waiting for a tweet that the world is indeed coming to an end.)I find this so true. We want that quick interesting new hit. But we don't really have time or energy to follow the deeper links and really understand that new/new. We read about some climate disaster, or a celebrity breakup, or political icon's last interview or that next emerging plague, but we don't research beyond the initial report. We don't apply critical thinking. What was the extent of the disaster? How are people coping days later? Where did Palin get the facts to make that scary statement? What really is the definition of a plague that they are using and what are the chances this new germ will affect me personally?  Why do I read anything about Paris Hilton anyway?  I have written before my concern about our schools no longer teaching critical thinking skills.  Analysis of what we feed our brain, instead of just feeding our brain is key.We don't have time for deep thought anymore.  We are unexcited unless there is blood or spittle.  We are even bored at trying to think deeply about an issue, finding it hard to really study other sides and see other angles.   It is always on to the next exciting news or photo or embarrassing event.  We are always on to the next roadside accident which makes it all so simple.  Everything is black and white or start and stop and never gray and there is an endless supply of this novel two bit stuff.That is one of the reasons I have my other blog. It forces me to sloooow dooown. It forces me to study what is happening in the very small area of my world where I live on a day to day basis. It creates a habit for me to see how I fit within that quiet realm before I try to react in the larger scheme of things. Then when I am breathing at a normal rhythm, if I see something of interest, I know that I need to ask questions about it and not just skim it and then repeat the nonsense to someone else as if I really know what I am talking about. (Maybe I need to research this report?)"},

We arrive at a pause in the day, not large enough to really cause a ruckus, nor interesting enough to cause a little pain, but still annoyingly dancing there in front of your face and being a distraction from the lovely sunset as you lose your place in blogdom.  You feel guilty because they did comment on your post yesterday and so you tediously read through the post and hope to find some grain or idea to help you comment and to return the favor.This writing is an addiction with us. We love the words and we love the pictures we can paint with them. No, we cannot paint like Van Gogh or tell a story like Vermeer with light and shadow, but we are compelled to take the white screen canvas and sprinkle letters here and there hoping they form words and hoping eventually the words form sentences and perhaps, miracle of miracles, a complete thought! Keeping that train of thought on the track is another task frequently beyond our enthusiastic and spastic skill. Getting to the point of a story or valuable lesson is certainly a challenge for our energetic scribbling. You may wonder...DO we have a POINT as we scribble through the list of the mundane activities of our day?But, you, my blog readers, are ever so forgiving, because you faithfully return. You let me splash a noun here and smear a verb there and even overuse the exclamation point. You let me clutter the canvas with superlatives.  You wonder if I have ever heard of \"spell check.\"  You wonder why I put every other phrase in quotes and you wish the parenthesis keys on my keyboard would break.  You let me split infinitives (whatever they are) and end sentences with prepositions all in an effort to capture something that was recently remembered from my past or to describe something routine that happened that day and to try to make it significant......because you know that sometimes I get lucky and actually post something interesting and a little thought provoking.   And then we can both smile at the end of the day.  I need you in this dance of design.(The photo is something I was motivated to do because one of my bloggers is working on textures with her photos and I remembered I had this taken this rose photo in my garden this past summer.  I have reduced the size substantially, but it still holds the texture effect, I think.  You will have to click on the photo to really get the furry texture.)"},

{"title": "Odd Neighbors", "date": "Tuesday, November 17, 2009", "text": "Every neighborhood has someone strange living in it. That odd person that you pretend to be nice to, but you often wonder about them. They are just a little odd.  Some idiosyncratic behavior of theirs makes you keep your distance. Perhaps they wander around in loud colored shorts or perhaps they peek at you through the drapes or perhaps they spend too much time washing that fancy car or perhaps they sit on the porch and pick their nose for what seems an endless amount of time.  I am sure that sometimes my neighbor has second thoughts about asking me out to lunch as she did the other day. Her husband was out running a tractor, grading the roads to the farm they lease out, and she knew I had been alone for several weeks. So she offered a lunch date followed by a healthy walk around the island.The reason I think she must have second thoughts about my stability is that she can now see me in my yard as the trees have become sparse of leaf cover. She can see Tabor walking up and down her driveway or standing out on her deck at all hours of the day with camera in hand. She sees me stop and then bend over peering into my camera with my butt out in the air like some freak flag flying and taking a picture of the driveway, or photographing the seat of my deck chair or even taking a picture of what at times looks like my feet!I am sure she thinks I am a very strange bird. But I keep finding beautiful things as I walk around the yard that I need to photograph.  I keep trying to stop time! Do you blame me?"},

I did this because for some reason blogger lets spam and scam through for commenting on older posts. I get comment posts weeks later and of course I don't get back fast enough to read those posts to delete. So now they sit on my dashboard hidden until I decide to delete. I have been getting quite a few lately.I also have been feeling guilty for not commenting on some blogs. I read the entry but can't really think of anything interesting to say when everyone ahead of me has said the same thing. So I just keep my keyboard shut.My husband's trip took him across the many, many, many islands in the Indonesian chain as well as some bordering countries. Indonesia is both Muslim and Christian but Bali is mostly a hybridized Hindu. He noticed that the island and/or villages where the majority of citizens were either Muslim or Christian remained relatively peaceful and the areas where the division was 50/50 or 40/60 were full of rancor and anger as each group fought for control of the local political system. Why does God make people so angry? I know, I know...just had to write thatWhile staying at my daughter's house last week a young father came by with his son to play with my grandson. As we got to talking I learned that his wife worked for the FDA and was in the office where they worked on drug approvals for humans. He said she had been there for 10 years. I asked how she liked her job and he said that during the past administration their budget had been cut substantially and they had also felt pressured to get drug approvals moving faster and she had been very miserable. Now she is happy as they have been given a decent budget and are being allowed to do their job as professional scientists without any outside interference.I took hundreds of photos of fall scenery over the last month and recently found that my camera settings had been on a lower resolution than I usually have. I guess it was from fiddling around with settings that I don't really understand as I experimented with photos. When I was younger I could immediately figure out a camera setting and easily focus on the subject. Now with age I forget to make changes and focus...well even depending on autofocus doesn't always work! I do not like getting old, but I do love having the time to play with the camera.Hubby brought back a number of gifts from the islands...most from him but some from friends of his.

They had tag-teamed me and while the deafening roar of children screaming, laughing, crying, shouting was still ringing in my ears, I removed faded jeans and sweatshirt to put on the softer pajamas as I heard the roaring and banging of the weather.  The wind has been pummeling this end of the bay for over 24 hours.  The rain bangs intermittently on my kitchen skylight and I can see the glisten of water in every area hit by outside lights.I had arrived in the dark and hurried out of my car in the pelting rain to open the gate.  There were no trees down in my driveway, but I am too far from the dock to see how high the water is and it is too dark to see if the wind has brought down trees elsewhere in the yard.  I snuggled down beneath the covers so thankful that I have shelter from the storm and can worry about damage until tomorrow.The continuing tempest of nature woke me at 4:00 this morning and I am sitting here waiting for the sun to push a little gray light through the tropical storm clouds.  I am curious to see the sudden transformation of naked trees and also to see if there is damage.  This lovely summer without any storm made me complacent and I am surprised by this violent aftermath of late summer that pushed her way up here in our late fall.

{"title": "Danger, Will Robinson!", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2009", "text": "When I was a little girl we only shopped at two department stores. My father called them Monkey Wards and Sears and Roarbucks and of course, we laughed at his joke.During the first week of November I had to head up to the city to do some babysitting as both parents had to do some business travel...in opposite directions, of course. During the two days that I was there and after dropping children off at their respective schools, I decided to take advantage of being near the large malls and get started on my holiday shopping. I tend to forget that traffic problems begin this early.Well, I would like to caution others that may have this same plan. First, do not shop at Sears. It has not changed. There is no help, only one register with long lines (even in the middle of the week), and staff that speak limited English and always seem to be learning how to use the register for the first time. After spending many minutes waiting in line to pay for my purchase I was then rewarded for my patience by having the alarm go off as I left the store with a loud voice blaring that the security tag MUST be removed. I walked all the way back across the store to the ONLY open register and was told that the security tag was \"probably\" inside the box and to just ignore the alarm. I cannot tell you how hard it was to 'steal 'myself to leave the store a second time while a very loud robotic voice demanded that I return to the store!The second shopping warning is to let you know that sales people in both the chain stores and the kiosks in the mall have been given strict instructions to part you from your money using any sales pitch they can find. Clearly this recession has convinced them that they will be closing shop if this holiday season does not turn a substantial profit. The recession is hovering darkly over the retail industry. These staff are the managers who hope to be working there in January as temporary staff have not yet been hired. If you ask for assistance they will answer your question or direct you to the correct area, but then will proceed to convince you to buy at least three of the item due to the huge discounts and sales. If you explain you really only want one, they will then direct you to their other sales specials, their newest products, etc. etc. and it will take some very polite determination to get out of the store with your wallet and sense of humor intact. I actually had to pull my hand away from a young Israeli man who insisted his product would make my hand 20 years younger!(The blog title is for those who can remember 1960's science fiction TV.)"},
{"title": "Just Teasing", "date": "Sunday, November 08, 2009", "text": "Today was the oddest day. It started out in the 50s (F) and then climbed to the 60's. A batch of orange robins had flown in the night before and blended perfectly with all the orange brown leaves that I had not raked or blown away. We do not have robins here during the summer months, so I knew they were on their way to Florida. I got started on the yard at mid-morning and was enjoying watching roils of leaves tumble into the woods revealing the spring green grass beneath. I cleared the patio and the deck and stored that nutrition in the compost bin. Then I began to clip away those perennials that had gone brown.When I went to put away the rake and leaf blower I was met by a couple of sulphur butterflies and one bright orange and brown butterfly enjoying the last of the lavender flowers. I hadn't seen butterflies for more than a week, so it was a surprise to watch these dancing across my herb bed. Later after I had picked some green tomatoes and arugula and several of the hot peppers and the last of the roses for my table, I noticed a number of small flying insects filling the air like little fluff machines. One landed in my hair and I discovered that it was a lady bug. They were everywhere looking for food. One even made it into the house that afternoon.I was just beginning to wonder what had happened to fall when the sun started to set and the most lovely haze hung on the golden horizon making me think that I was back in Asia where the cooking fires created a smokey haze at the end of the day. It smelled dusty and musty and reminded me of the dry season in Indonesia. It was so much like summer and such a tease that I made my way down to the dock barefoot. Anyday that I do not have to wear shoes is a GOOD day. I was almost ready to believe that winter was not hiding somewhere up North. The last roses of summer. They are like gentle and fragile old ladies with lace collars and fancy fans that smell gently of soap and sweet bath powder.  They are high maintenance because they know they are beautiful and popular.  Their heads hand low from fall rains. They are lovely even as they fade. I miss that they must hurry off, but their cruise ship is waiting. Late in November, while I will sit by the fire trying to warm my toes, they will be having tea and ginger cookies along the warm equatorial waters somewhere. They promise that they will send their favorite nieces and they will arrive in sweet pale dresses in the spring and if I show them love, they will stay for a long visit in the rose garden next summer. The little gal has what is called rose bloom balling due to the cooler weather followed by days of rains. It still looks lovely even though it will never open. I have to move many of my roses this spring as they are in one of the side beds that gets way too little sun. Living in a forest is deceptive. Roses are greedy for sun and I am lucky that I have not gotten any serious fungal outbreaks this year. Come spring I will begin the spraying as these are the only plants where I use pesticide and fungicide for prevention."},
{"title": "In the Mail Thursday Thoughts #25", "date": "Friday, November 06, 2009", "text": "About eight months ago I started to receive in the mail a billing notice from a collections agency regarding $113 that they say I still owe from the time I rented an apartment in 2005 through the summer of 2007. About two months after I checked out of that place I sent them that amount as they had raised the rent that month and I forgot to include the increase in my last month's payment. I do not have access to that bank account as it was closed and so do not know the exact number of the check sent. I have called the leasing office and the accounts receivable office and left at least 6 messages with no return to my calls. I even drove up there several months ago and met with the accounts manager who said my account appeared paid in full but they were re-doing the books and that they would get back to me. This \"unpaid debt\" now sits on my credit reports as an unresolved issue and no one returns my calls.At my local post office there are several large blue recycle bins in the lobby. These are used by 80% of patrons to immediately dump without reading all those ads from various stores. The rest of the patrons are too stupid or too lazy and just leave their mail detritus on the window sill or the floor. These paper products for landfills is what is keeping the Post Office afloat. I would even accept this junk by email if they agreed to stop printing it on paper.I subscribe to a newsletter \"Consumer Reports: On Health.\" I have found it interesting for the most part, except the October issue had this brief paragraph: \"Hugging Laundry. Dirty sheets, towels, and clothes can harbor bacteria and other germs, so use a basket---not your arms---to gather and transport laundry. And wash your hands after loading it into the machine.\" ??? While this might be good advice for those who are hired to do other's laundry, I think we are getting a little too germicidal in our lives...how in the heck do I get the laundry into the basket and out of the basket...rubber gloves? Does this mean I shouldn't hug those who wore the clothes?I must be richer than I know on my fixed income. I also got a card in the same mail telling me I was pre-qualified to receive the exclusive Visa Black Card. (It appears that silver, gold and platinum have peaked in swankness.) If I get the Visa Black Card I am assured the highest caliber of personal service and concierge services. This card is limited to 1% of U.S. residents (how exclusive is that?), and they say it is guaranteed to get me noticed! No duh, so does a really bad hair day. Since it has an annual fee of $495 ($195 for each additional user) and an APR of 13.24% I guess I will pass. Swankness has its price and its level of stupidity.Unfortunately, what I rarely get in the mail is letters.( This post was written before the tragedy at Ft. Hood yesterday.  More troops suffering from being exposed to trauma and tragedy will be coming home and resolving their issues by using either violence or suicide.  War is a nasty disease.)"},

It is a tattered parachute. Hubby got it from some surplus store about a century ago and, while spotted with various paints and stains from our housekeeping life,  it still holds strong and true to carry our leaves. This photo is some of the oak wood we had split to use to warm ourselves this winter. I think this tree grew about a century ago before it was removed to build this house. Most of the wood that we split now is from deadfall and the disease scars are revealed in the heartwood. Seeing such lovely grainwood as above is rare and you can see the war it declared with the chainsaw."},

The spin of the earth is slowing down by about one second every ten years as well.  So much for the old phrase, \"Stop the world, I want to get off.\" Perhaps someday it will stop and you will fall off. There are times when I get overwhelmed by the fact that everything is evolving slowly but dramatically over time. The history that I know is very different from the history that my grandchildren will know. The picture that I paint is coded with time. I now realize that I have actually lived through history.I hate the passage of time when I think how I am away from my son and my youngest brother, both very different in age and activities but similar in some ways. I know that you must love someone with open arms so that they can fly free. You must let them go but leave your arms open so that you can catch them if they fall. Both my youngest brother and my son need to be free. They fill their days with the busyness of living. I will always be here with my arms open, but the earth is spinning so fast that I can barely see them at times and I know they are not looking for me. They are staring at another planet.Today I feel much smaller than that grain of sand because after I disappear, it will still be here."},

Will I be able to find my way out by next week? So much work!Tonight, as I watched the sun go down from my living room, I prepared a lovely mushroom ravioli with homemade tomato/basil /green pepper sauce with the last of the vegetables harvested from the garden. I am home alone, so forcing myself to actually prepare a healthy and fresh meal was not easy. (I could have had microwaved popcorn.) I washed these healthy antioxidants down with a nice Sangiovese that I had purchased at my recent visit to the Biltmore estate. I am alone and so adjusting to enjoying good food by myself is taking some effort. I removed the small bag of frozen peach pie filling made months ago and after thawing added to a pie crust and sliced a fresh apple on top, added more cinnamon and sprinkled some granola cereal on top of it all. It turned out delicious with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Here is the back yard that I need to either rake or blow. It was clean just days ago, so I am being somewhat lazy and putting this off. It is a contest with the trees. They still have lots of leaves. They throw them down in the wind like yellow flakes of gold, as if they were gentlemen throwing down their yellow gloves as if in a challenge to duel. But then, when I look up, the trees still have more wealth to share. I will never win this duel. The sex-crazed squirrels spend all their time chattering and laughing at my confusion."},

My son and I did get lost and he had a GPS on his phone...he is just a bad navigator telling you about a turn as you miss it!  We also discovered that there are TWO places in the area with very similar names and we had headed to the wrong one.  We still made it to the Keb Mo show on time.  Food was awful as it always is at that theatre but it is intimate seating and so you feel close to the stage.  On the way back to drop him off I did goof and turned onto a one-way street, but since the traffic was thin at 11:00 P.M.,  we survived that screw-up as well.  AND as you can surmise from this post, I did make it back out of the city, but the drive was somewhat tense as pouring rain and glaring headlights meant I had to really concentrate the whole hour and a half on the way home.  It was worth it to head bob with Keb Mo and to sit with my son."},
{"title": "Slow Down,", "date": "Tuesday, October 27, 2009", "text": "It is silliness, really. He wasn't her first choice. Well, actually, he was her first choice, but she knew he wouldn't get back to her with an answer until 24 hours before. If he decided he couldn't come, that would leave her too little time to fill his shoes. No, he ended up being her third choice. Her husband was the first. Hubby had several months notice, but blew her off for a free trip to exotic Bali and elsewhere just weeks before the date. She gave him a piece of her mind and was thankful that he had to leave before she could empty her entire brain.Her second choice was her daughter. The loyal and faithful fallback. She had been the one to go with her to hear Chris Botti last spring when hubby once again had a conflict. The date tonight was set until yesterday when daughter called to explain she had an unavoidable business trip to either Georgia or Florida...didn't know until the judge cleared their access to the buildings. Anyway, she couldn't go, but she had found a fallback. Tabor asked if it was someone tall, handsome, and single! Of course, daughter smiled into the phone.As you have probably guessed the fallback was her first choice. The son that she knew would enjoy the venue more than the other two. He seemed excited on FB to be going, but sometimes he was so unreliable.Now she was standing in her closet with a pile of clothes on the floor. Everything made her look like a bag lady. Honest! She felt like a 16-year-old on a first date. She finally pulled out her reliable gray cords with the diamonds on the butt...that would fit with this crowd. She pulled on a cowl neck gray mohair and some silver beads. Monochromatic with her gray hair. Perfect, she grimaced. She would not fit, but she knew that no one would even see her in the crowded theater. But she didn't want to look to Mom-like with her son. More make-up...heavy on the eyes. It was a dark and informal place and she guessed the crowd might be a little noisier than she was used to. But she did so love this artist's music so very much. So, since she was driving, something she hated and hated even more so in the rain, she spent several hours googling maps to both the meeting place in the city and the venue from the meeting place. Misgivings about getting lost be damned, she was determined to have a good time. The other kink was that after dropping her son off, she had to find her way back home. Since daughter was gone the S.I.L. had invited his parents down for the evening to help with swim lessons, etc. So at 11:00 P.M. in the rain she will be heading the long way back out of the city, hoping that she will not end up in some desolate area after getting lost.If I post no more blogs, you will know what happened...or perhaps you will just be left to wonder."},

Fortunately the angles of the sun against the leaves of the trees and the visit of an osprey have helped pass the time. Today I blew the leaves off the deck and patio and the small back lawn. I startled a little gray frog that had set up his winter housekeeping at the corner of one of the steps under the leaves.I then planted my 20 alliums, maroon and white, into a nice curve beside the chaste plant. I look forward to their blooming this summer.I also got motivated and vacuumed the floors, cleaned all bathrooms, and dusted and polished furniture. When bored, Tabor fills her time with tasks that make her fill less guilty.Then I sat down and poured myself a glass of Biltmore chardonney while I pondered how to industriously fill the rest of the day. Oh, nuts, I conceded. and just grabbed my camera and walked barefoot across the pointy gravel to the dock and began to do what I love the most, snap pictures.

{"title": "Bridging the Gap", "date": "Wednesday, October 21, 2009", "text": "One of my bloggers, Maggie, was right! Here above is one of the Hudson River view paintings.Perhaps you have been watching the intriguing and important television series on MSNBC by Ken Burns, \"The National Parks: America's Best Idea.\" If not, you are missing a compelling series on how difficult it was to set aside these unique natural areas (58 parks) in our country for generations to come so that they could see untouched natural beauty. The series talks about the wealthy and not-so-wealthy visionaries and outliers that made this dream come true. If you think that our natural resources are important to use and exploit for the economic security of our country, this series will drive you nuts. If, on the other hand, you feel at one with nature and do not live in fear that you might have to live in a cave some day, this series will reignite that lust to see all of our great country. On my recent trip through Southern Virginia, my husband and I decided once again to see the Natural Bridge area which is a PRIVATELY owned natural wonder. This is a solid rock bridge carved by nature that is 20 stories high. It is well worth seeing, but getting there takes some fortitude. Because it is privately owned, the first stop is the massive parking lot with it's ugly signs and other non-natural attractions. Behind these signs is the view of the massive hotel where people stay so that they can leave their room and walk across the street to see this wonder. The grand entry (photo below) where you must go to purchase a ticket includes a huge souvenir shopping area that has nothing to do with the natural wonders of this great country but is willing to sell you a lot of crap that will end up in the land fills of your back yard. Note the convenient ATM in the left side of the photo below. Finally you can walk or take a shuttle bus down into the valley to finally see the natural bridge. It sits along a lovely rushing river. If you can ignore the bench seating for the evening light show about the creation of the earth, avoid the view of the huge speakers that now sit on top of the bridge nestled against the shrubbery, and also ignore the wedding taking place on the far left, you might imagine what this wonder would have looked like when first seen by America's early pioneers. It is worth visiting, even though you will feel a little fleeced by the time you leave. Baaaaa!"},
{"title": "A Place to Rest Your Head at the End of the Day", "date": "Monday, October 19, 2009", "text": "Travel requires some planning prior to departure on where one can stay. Well, some people pack a bag and pull into anywhere along the road. I have had a few experiences where a soccer tournament or a convention have forced me to stay 30 miles outside the city, so I always make reservations and have a plan. On my most recent trip I stayed at a Budget Inn that cost about $65 for the night. The room was very small, only two thin towels, a comfortable bed, no coffee pot or hair dryer, but clean. If I wanted to eat something I had to get in my car and drive a small distance as the restaurant across the parking lot did not smell all that good, really.The second place that I stayed was a Fairfield Inn. This is the low end of the Marriott chain of rental residences and cost us just under $100 for the night. We got a hair dryer, good coffee, a large room with a sitting area, and a free communal breakfast area with make-your-own waffles or heat-your-own pastries and cereal, fresh fruits, and yogurt. Distance to nearby tourist areas was short. We are Marriott members so we also got points and discounts.Our final place to stay for three nights was a B&B (Bed and Breakfast) out near the mountains of North Carolina. This was a lovely old home that had 10 bedrooms on three levels and has been an operating B&B for over 15 years. The rooms had interesting themes and the one I reserved was called 'Light and Shadows' and was the photography room with antique cameras and a magazine or two on photography. The quilt and decor was very nice. It had a small sitting area and a lovely claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom that was a challenge for me (who is in pretty good physical shape) to enter and exit. The bathroom had super thick towels, fragrant shampoos and soaps and a hair dryer. There was even a small private deck outside our bedroom with two small chairs to sit and look over the beautifully landscaped gardens. B& B's provide full breakfast and this one would even cook a dinner if you requested. The breakfasts were delicious and filling if not outstanding. There were two sitting rooms in the common area, one with a free computer access and lots of books to read. Artificial fireplaces were everywhere adding to a very cozy atmosphere. A small area was set up for coffee, tea or cappuccino at any time of the day or night. There were fresh homemade cookies waiting for us at the end of every hiking and touring day. There was no television, thank goodness. The cost was $130 per night.Bed and Breakfast establishments are usually more expensive than staying at more predictable chains. Some of my friends stay at higher end hotels that cost between $200 and $300 a night and think that is a reasonable price to pay for what they expect. To some extent you get what you pay for in this world of travel. Location is probably the most important feature if you plan on seeing anything in the area.B&Bs are not everyone's cup of cappuccino. They usually attract garrulous Garys and chatty Cathys; people who want to talk at breakfast before you head out and who want to hear about your day and tell you about theirs before you head up to bed. The Innkeepers themselves are great for communicating important information about the area and they love to hear about your experiences, because they live there and run an Inn and don't get out much anymore! Therefore, if you are a private and quiet person you may want to clarify this before you make reservations at a B&B so that the innkeeper can put you in the most remote bedroom and keep a smaller table available for you and your buddy at breakfast. OR you may wish to check into the nearby hotel.The fun part of B&Bs is the people you meet. I ate breakfast with a young couple that live only two miles from my brother's house in Colorado! I ate another breakfast with a minister and his wife on their anniversary vacation and a couple from San Francisco who had not ever traveled much, so we could be the experts. I chatted with a widow whose husband had planned the trip months ago and then had a massive heart attack on Father's Day while fishing. She and her sister took the trip anyway as it helped her deal with her grief.Of course, the real serendipity experience was learning our waitress at the local Italian restaurant downtown came from Sulawesi, Indonesia where my husband was heading in just a few days! He got to practice his Bahasa which he has not used in decades.Travel is great for the historic places and natural scenery, but also fruitful for all the people that you meet.(The photo is the Biltmore Estate...and I did NOT stay there.)"},
{"title": "Autumnal Reverie", "date": "Friday, October 16, 2009", "text": "I am back in my quiet and familiar home but still feeling a bit disoriented.  Both of these recent trips, the one to Colorado and the one to North Carolina, sort of came about like a haphazard fall of dominoes being back to back.  They were planned but somehow took place like rushing river falls...both of which I saw on each of my journeys.  My visit with my family was sweetly sad as we gathered together one afternoon to distribute the ashes of both of my parents and part of the ashes of my sweet younger sister who passed away a number of years ago.  There was both laughter and tears and not much formal ceremony.  We are not a formally religious family and calmly accepting of the way our lives have gone.  The ashes now rest on the side of a mountain with a view of the fall valley, facing a regal mountain in an area that we all love, and in the evening the ceremony was blessed over a couple of bottles of Malbec.I feel the closeness of the impermanence of time which hangs like a damp cloth about my shoulders when I return from unfamiliar territory.  This bittersweet feeling is stronger because my husband left today for Indonesia and will be gone for many weeks.  It is a small project from which he will make no money, but a project that he believes will help their government move into networking ecological projects.  I love him enough to let him fly far away when he needs that.  We put our heads together before he left to see what house errands could be completed before his departure.I now move alone through the rooms unpacking and making piles of laundry and sorting piles of unread mail, which will help fill the coming days.  The weather is sublimely misty and cold and seems in sync with my feelings.House plants in pots, just a few this year, have been moved inside and back to their space by the breakfast corner windows and if the weather clears I will load some of the split wood into the wheelbarrow and move it to a rack by the porch.  Then I will pull out the zinnias and other vines that need to be cleared.  While I was gone I received a box of 50 new narcissus bulbs and a few allium bulbs that need to find homes in the yard and that will take another afternoon.For the cool evenings that are to come I will fill by sorting and working with my many photos of the fall colors in the Blue Ridge and Great Smokies that filled me with joy as I took them.  I also will smile as I review the photos of the animals, large and small, that let us visit their neck of the woods.  I also have a grandchildren sitting job next week and that will make the week seem much less lonely and briefly crazy full.My life is rich and made richer by the thoughtful comments on my blog while I was away."},

{"title": "Authentic Ski Town---Not", "date": "Friday, October 09, 2009", "text": "The historic town of Breckinridge? I found it has changed so much. I remember it as a small town where I could get a decent bowl of chile or a plate of hot enchiladas after a cold day of skiing. Back during my youth the few restaurants that were open were small and crowded with skiers in bulky jackets and ice crusted hats. Muddy snow covered the floors and the places were always noisy with energetic talk of great runs at the end of the day. People hurried through their meals as many of us had the long trip down the mountain and back home in the evening. Only a few stayed at the ski lodge.The town has now morphed into a cutsey Yuppieville of boutiques and high-end souvenir shops complete with one of the best French bakeries in the state. The owners are very much French and the American waitress told me she had learned all the bad words of the language from the couple when they argued with each other during the day. Passionate couple I guess. The crepes are wonderful and the beignets are like sugar and air as they melt in your mouth. Forget the diets all ye who enter here. There are plenty of uncrowded restaurants in mid-September offering a wide variety of food.We ate lunch on this patio at a Thai restaurant that was not run by Thai but served reasonably authentic food. I could have been eating anywhere including my city with the choices. The only genuine experience left was the dramatic view of the mountains on either side of the town. There were HUGE parking lots just outside of town where they shuttled people to the lift or into town. It must be a nightmare here during the ski season. (For all the hiking fun that I had on this trip you have to check out my other blog.) Interestingly, everyone walking around this place looks young, healthy and like they have a trust fund!"},
{"title": "Five Words That Changed My Life", "date": "Thursday, October 08, 2009", "text": "I somehow knew that Kenju would be most interesting in sending me my five words for the blog meme that she recently completed.  I do not complete memes in most cases, but my posting creativity has been dwindling and I thought this meme might be a motivator.  \"For this meme, you write about five words as they apply to your life.\"  I could be nice and put the definitions...but I think most readers can look them up in the online dictionaries.  I must admit that I found this meme more uncomfortable than I thought as I progressed and the title of this blog is a lie!brave:  I have learned bravery by allowing/making myself to live in other cultures in other countries with people who do not speak my language.  To be removed from all that you know and to have your ideas and beliefs challenged on a daily basis and to be forced to really think about communication as a means of solving problems, is a brave way of living.  To survive this challenge and allow yourself to change is also brave and I think I have successfully traveled through that fire.epitaph:  This word is the scariest for me, but not because I fear dying.  I just think that there is not much I have done that is memorable in this life.  I have tried to live a good and honest life but that in itself is not worthy of a memorable epitaph.  To me an important epitaph means you have changed the lives of others for the better in a significant way.  I hope I still am granted a few more decades to work this out!imagination: Having an imagination that is active and fertile is important in any life.  I imagined that I would travel, I imagined that I would raise a beautiful (if not perfect) family and I imagined that I would be reasonably happy.  When you believe in what you imagine you work out the issues and you change your approach and adjust your goals so that this can all come true.  I think I have not allowed my imagination to run away with me, but I have allowed it to soar so that I can always have a long-term vision of the goals ahead.  Imagination is a very important tool in life.salute:   The image that this word brought instantly to my mind was when some of the Republicans made fun of how Clinton saluted his marine staff, clearly showing he was not part of the military.  When I see this word I remember when I allowed the conservatives to take my patriotism away from me.  I allowed myself to question how I was showing my real feelings for our soldiers and I regret that.  Now I know that I have always supported our troops and that all of our brave troops are both conservative and liberal in their philosophies.  Being true to my beliefs does not make me unpatriotic any more than wearing a flag on my lapel makes me a patriot.tempest:     Over the years I have learned that I hate tempests and now I always avoid them.   Tempests created by crazy relatives with bad habits or self-centered and insecure co-workers are the worst! Ninety-nine percent tempests are false and artificially created to distract and dismay.  The only real tempests are those that have to do with the weather.  My philosophy these days is to listen to and to share my time with those who can remain calm in the eye of the storm.  The storm will pass and you will notice that things will be much the same if the tempest is not real.(Want me to send you five words?)"},
{"title": "Working for the Soul", "date": "Tuesday, October 06, 2009", "text": "I have posted elsewhere (FB and emails) about my days of work recently.  The cool fall weather, the dormancy of ticks, and the necessity of the size of weeds at summers end have motivated us to clear parts of the forest on either side of the long drive to the house.  The wooded view as we drove in was no longer enticing and welcoming, but more like spooky and scary, and while appropriate for the Halloween season, it seems out of place when welcoming guests at other times of the year.We have now cleared the leaning and/or dead trees that rested against each other and formed a sheltered structure for the wild roses that in turn learned to climb to the tops of the lovely and healthy maples, dogwood, and holly trees and shaded them from sun.  I pruned limbs and prickly vines and then piled them beside the road in the clearing.  We had piles of dead wood and piles of scratchy brush all of which was later gathered in our arms and placed in the old wooden trailer we use for hauling large amounts of 'stuff'.  Hubby bravely climbed on top and did the elephant dance to smash it all down so that we could grab more armfuls and put on top once again.Frequently the angry roses would grab our butts and legs refusing to be dumped.  I still have a tiny thorn in my arm that will have to fester its way to the surface.Hubby and I argued about what wood to take to the dump and what to cut into firewood.  We have enough firewood to last through the winter of 2012, so I was inclined to get rid of much of the wood.  (This will ensure that global climate change really will be global warming.)  This photo is just one of the long piles we have waiting for the first cold weather.  The problem is that some of this wood is old and some still too new for burning and in our dedicated rhythm we were not as careful in stacking as we should have been.The wrens and the flickers were not happy that we took away so much dead wood, but eventually forgave us when they saw how may broken tree stumps we left behind for them to poke through.  They will have a rich larder of wood insects through the coming snows.  We also left enough small bush areas for the mice and other small animals to find shelter.The free crepe myrtle that was planted at the end of my flower bed two years ago got moved with the help of Pedro.  He works for a landscape company and knows exactly how to dig and move small trees.  The shape of the crepe was not long and lean but more like an umbrella-shaped weeping willow, and therefore, taking up too much flower bed space.  We (actually Pedro and hubby did the work) also joined the two flower beds and I now have a good sunny place to transplant my scattered roses this fall.  (More work!)This is the crepe myrtle shape I had hoped for!My new rose bed.After these past three days, the old joints ache with fatigue and overuse and my arms are scratched as if I had wrestled with a mountain cat, but soaking in my jacuzzi in the late afternoon before starting dinner was a reward enjoyed so much more because of my hard work.  I am thankful that I do not hate hard work.  I am thankful that the goal is its own reward for me.  Besides, now I don't have to do any exercises this week!"},

As an adult I re-read the diary and was even more impressed by the beauty of her writing and the terrible tragedy that she could not live to realize her full potential.I found this on the Internet:    \"Ha'aretz, the Israeli newspaper, is showing remarkable footage today. The Frank House, in Amsterdam, has realeased this short 20-second video snippet from the life of Anne Frank. The video was shot approximately a year before Frank and her family went into hiding. \"The context of this video is compelling and this has certainly made me pensive for the rest of this day."},
{"title": "Happy Harvest", "date": "Saturday, October 03, 2009", "text": "I spent the better part of today 'cleaning' the forest.  This meant cutting back nasty wild roses, removing dead limbs from trees, and trying to drag stubborn vines from around trees.  I even cut one poison ivy vine that was about 2 inches across and covered with those tell-tale spidery roots that cling to the tree trunk.Hubby spent time cutting the large pieces of wood into manageable size for our small wood-burning fireplace.  We now have enough cut wood (some even split) for at least three winters.  That is good, because much of this needs drying and aging time.  I loaded each log into the wheelbarrow and pushed to the wood pile where I spent careful time stacking.  The process is something like building a rock wall in that wood pieces must be selected according to shape and size before placing on the pyramid of wood.  Once it is all stacked it makes an interesting wall.This afternoon I am harvesting the last of the garden.  We do not have too many more days of growing weather with the cool nights.  I have made enough pesto, roasted tomato sauce, and frozen enough beans to make me feel very full of food already.Our fridge is now full of salsa and pickled hot peppers to warm us in the coming cold nights.My project this evening is shredding the 30 or so carrots that, while not very pretty, do have a reasonably sweet flavor and will make delicious carrot cake.  (I have admitted defeat on the large box of spaghetti squash which is stored in our basement and will accept that the mice may get to much of it before us.)Tomorrow I am going to try \"Butternut Squash au Gratin\" from a recipe sent by my daughter.  Add enough butter and cheese to any squash and it becomes quite delicious if no longer healthy.I think this is going to defeat the small weight loss from my Colorado mountain hiking."},
{"title": "Too Much Information or Not Enough?", "date": "Friday, October 02, 2009", "text": "Most bloggers do not write about their family.  It is personal stuff and you have to be very honest and out front with your life once you begin.  I am anonymous just so that I can write about people who, I hope, will also remain anonymous while I try to sort out their lives.You will realize from this post that my family, while loving and generous of spirit, are terrible communicators.  They tend to avoid the painful reality of life.  It might be because they know that we cannot do anything about the painful decisions of others or it might be that sharing doesn't really ease their concerns, or perhaps they are embarrassed by the \"perfect\" lives that they think all the rest of us have.  All of these people I have learned about below, are not blood relatives...not that that makes any difference.I learned on this past family trip the following news.  Some of it was explained only after embarrassing comments on my part because I did not know what the H*** was going on!.My step-niece (who has no health insurance and no husband) thought she was pregnant, thought she miscarried three months later, then gave birth to a baby in her mother's house, all alone one afternoon early this summer.  She had been raised on a horse farm and actually explained to me all the precautions she took, including adjusting for the fact that the water heater pilot light had broken that morning, in order to deliver this baby all by herself!  The child was born safely for the mother (28 years old).  After a helicopter flight to the hospital when the child had trouble breathing they discovered that the child has an incomplete brain and is missing part of the back lobes.  This appears to be a genetic disorder that will mean my step-niece should not have any other children.  There are those who know only too well all the terrible issues with this situation.  All I know is that currently the child is off of oxygen and is eating and growing and is very precious.  This mother's life has changed forever.  The father of this child has four children in a current marriage and an illegitimate child from another relationship. TMI.My step-niece's brother, a marine just back from Iraq, was goofing around with other marines this past spring and appears to have ruptured a disk and now requires spinal fusion.  Thus his life is now also changed forever, probably ending his hope to enter the police force when he is released from service.My other step-nephew from another family came with his 7-year-old daughter to a family BBQ and it wasn't until later in the evening that someone bothered to mention he has been divorced for over a year.  That was when I stopped asking him if his wife was working late!All of the rest of the gang seems to be living reasonably normal lives with normal challenges."},

It still is/was a fairly functioning computer. So guess I will use it a while longer.I thought about switching to Apple but all my software is PC...what an expense.On a totally un-related note is anyone as disappointed as I am that they chose Julia Roberts for the \"Eat,Pray,Love\" movie?  I know, I know...you don't really care. But I see this person as an empty headed intellectual...not an empty headed flirt.  I was thinking 0f Charlize Theron, Annette Benning, even Reese Witherspoon although she is a little young.

Love them all and probably would be too generous in blogging about their complicated lives had not my PC been in the shop all this time, and thus, putting the yellow light on my blogging allowing me to mellow out and put a more subtle pink light on all the issues.  My life is not a soap opera, but it appears that their lives are.It also appears that I have both a \"mal generic A\" virus and a Trojan \"agent gen-x\" on my PC and for the low, low price of only $89.99 they will remove it for me! Wow. They have adopted the repair model use by car dealers. We analyze for a small fee and then call you and tell you how much it will cost to repair it. Only this scenario involves NO moving parts. It is more painful this way.  I got this message on Saturday (today) and so may not get my computer back until Tuesday since she (the all-knowing magician) does not get in until Monday at 2:00PM.   I am totally addicted to my PC and so will have to cough up the dough to get the PC functioning again.  Since it is almost 8 years old, I fully expected them to say that I needed a new one.  So there is a brighter side to this scenario.If they could tell me how I got this illness on my PC, I would be more understanding.  I have so much firewall and virus protection, that I honestly thought I was inoculated until the blue screen of death.

I am sure that one has heard those whispered conversations heard in the late evening when you are sitting by the fire or curled up in your favorite chair with a good book and sitting all alone.  You look up and wonder if that was a laugh you just heard or was it just the blinds moving in the breeze.  You hear a footfall in the empty hallway and you freeze with the bookmark in hand and turn your head ever so slightly to the left.  It is just the bones of this old house creaking, you tell yourself and return to the poem.  Someones' laughter and someones' tears are hidden deep within the shadows of the corners of those rooms.    Important lives passed this way.  Sometimes they feel safe and come forward, but you don't know this, or you deny it.  On a lazy sunny afternoon as your eyes close and you begin to drift off to sleep, they gather together and dance around the floor with the moving sunbeams that drift across your favorite carpet.My house is new.  No ghosts have set up residence just yet.  Thus when I hear creaking and groaning, I know that it is the spirit of the house settling into these woods planning for the many years to come and making room for the ghosts.  My hubby and I will be the first spirits to linger in the shadows some winter evening.   Will we be too shy to laugh and will we still have the same arguments?   Will the click of my camera shutter startle some late night reader?  Will we be willing to make room for other spirits?  Will the sound of my grandchildren's footfalls skip down the hallway and interrupted by the sound of their giggle before they hide?  Will we dance with the moonbeams in the late evening as the new owner falls asleep before the fireplace?  I hope so."},

I've learned so much from this little soul this past summer that I often wonder if I have been sleepwalking through most of my life. Maybe I learned this stuff a long time ago and just forgot it as I grew up to battle adulthood?Sometimes on a hot summer day at the pool you need to stop skipping  and sliding and swimming and splashing your grandpa and just think about how the day is going thus far.  You need to stop and think about all that you are enjoying so that you can remember it or focus on your next attack.You need to Captain your Ship of Life if you want to end up in the best place for you.  Don't be afraid to take the wheel, even if it seems bigger than you and you have to stand on your toes to see where you are going.  Remember that those you love are still behind you to support your decisions and to help you on your journey.Set your boundaries really wide.  Your sand castles need moats that cover all the room that you can find on whatever beach you choose.  This photo is 1/3 of the final sand castle that was created.  It eventually included a mountain with trees and a volcano spewing lava red rocks collected from the beach.  No project is too small for a creative soul.It takes a lot of patience to wait for a fire to die down so that you can roast marshmallows and it is OK to wiggle and squirm when you are trying to be patient about something important.  You don't have to look like a saint!When you finally reach to top of the mountain (airplane, whatevah) remember all the loved ones and friends that helped you get there and be sure to help them all you can by sending your best as well as giving them a hand.And, finally, throw out your arms in total abandon and don't forget to ENJOY the ride.  It certainly  goes by really, really, really fast.(As I explained in an earlier post this is pre-written...my computer is in the shop and actually I am packing tomorrow for the trip.)"},
{"title": "My Husband's Non-Wicked Step Sisters", "date": "Sunday, September 06, 2009", "text": "I reunited with them both again a few months ago when we attended my husband's S.I.L.'s funeral.  They had aged...probably they seemed much older to me because they were a decade and some years older than I already.They are like opposite sides of the same coin of womanhood.  I have met them on and off in years past but was so wrapped up in my own family and my travels that I did not really see them.  One of the wonders of aging is you get clarity of mind vision.  Actual vision becomes blurry, but that is to ones' advantage because then you can see the reality of life much better.They were daughters from my husband's father's first marriage. It was a marriage of wealth and unfaithfulness and ended badly.  So badly that no one mentioned the name of the first wife in my F.I.L's presence.  Mary was the youngest daughter from this union and the dark haired one with the hour glass figure.   When she reached her teenage years she was compared to Elizabeth Taylor and from photos I have seen she did resemble her.  Sally, her older sister, was the thin and blonder version.  She had freckles and looked like the farm girl next door.  She was also the thinner thinker.  Sally loved to laugh and her laughter was contagious.   Mary went on to marry a man of the 1950's era.  Who knows what drove him and also what devils haunted him.  This was an era of cocktails and arguments.   Devout Catholics they had five children between them.  Four girls and a boy.  Mary's husband left her in the lurch with all five shortly after that and actually settled on an island in the Caribbean where his drinking was the norm rather than something which caused heated arguments.  Mary's children never saw him except for the son who became an adult and sought him out as male children need to do when fathers are an enigma.  Mary was blessed with a good brain and devotion to her children.  She worked very ,very hard  making all those standard sacrifices, and in time, worked her way up to managing an important office in the State government.  Her children each became successful in their own way and were loyal to her.  When I saw her at the funeral she was overweight and arthritis was compromising her ability to stand for any length of time.  But I saw that spark of intelligence in her eyes that had helped her survive the burden life had given her.  I saw that energy in her dark eyes that had been the heat that burned her whole life like an excellent warm brandy.  For some reason she made a connection with me.I had seen Sally more often in my trips to my husband's side of the family.  She had married, divorced, re-married the same man and then buried him when he died of throat cancer.  He had been a heavy smoker, as many were during that era.  Their marriage was more like the Taylor-Burton love.  It was loyal but painful.  She was like bubbles in champagne and actually became lovelier as she aged.  She wasn't smart and sometimes couldn't follow an intense conversation.  She dated often in her elder years and I think it was because she was such a fragile butterfly that elder men could not resist her.  She married a third time to a shyster who gave the impression he was an architect.  I had met him and he was quite smart and handsome.  She figured out her mistake within the year and this was followed by an expensive divorce.As she reached her early 80's she met a retired airline pilot.  They fell in love and she married once again.  I met him and both my husband and I liked him but noticed his aging memory lapses.  He seemed to be in his late 80's.  Both he and Sally continue to travel all over the world including a honeymoon in China where they sent photographs of themselves in elaborate Chinese costume. They recently flew to England to participate in the dedication of an airline museum.  Sally is just as ditsy as ever, but now people think it is due to old age.Both stories are the kind that could make a movie.  Their lives are like yours and mine in some ways, but to me so much more interesting than mine."},

{"title": "Two-Days in the Boonies", "date": "Friday, August 28, 2009", "text": "The heat and humidity along the Bay had worn us thin.  It seemed that just walking out to the shed would result in a necessary change of clothes when one returned.  We decided to celebrate our 39th anniversary in the mountains instead since the days that followed were going to be busy with relatives and houseguests.  We were able to book a room at the lodge for $69.  Do we know how to celebrate or what?  The problem was that the above view was the weather that greeted us when we drove to the mountain ridge for our first afternoon hike (we really sort of saunter).  The clouds in the distance grumbled and growled finally bringing a small downpour our way as we hurried back to the car where we sat for a long while watching raindrops pelt the dusty windshield.  (The danger on these high meadows is the ligntning...not so much the rain.)We decided to drive down the mountain and found a place below the clouds that was just misting moisture and not threatening a full-fledged shower, and found this old road that was a perfect hiking trail.  No slipping or sliding along muddy rocky trails.  (This was the area where I photographed the red salamander which I will post about later on my other blog.)We also traveled another nice trail that followed the Blackwater River just outside of Davis, West Virginia.  They have a spillway dam and camping areas and several new trails.  The goldenrod was in full bloom reminding us that all of those great autumn colors were soon to be revealed as fall was hovering nearby.Some trails are marked and others just become intriguing green paths that make you wish you had all the time in the world to wander them and see what new vistas will reward you.This trail might have been an ATV trail until the ATV's were banned.  (Thank God or the powers that be, says Tabor under her breath.)  The recent rains made it a challenge to follow. When deciding where to place ones' foot there was either sloppy wet mud or boggy Muskeg on either side.  I knew that my new waterproof hiking boots were worth the money when my feet stayed dry and hubby ended up with very wet socks.The trail formed a loop just as we came to a beaver pond in the sunken marsh at the foot of a large meadow we had been edging.  Most of one side of the marsh was wreathed in brown cattails as warnings about the wetness of the soil.  We saw two brown hawks in the distance and even though we were very careful and quiet we scared a few pin-tail ducks at the far edge of the pond.  We wandered down to the Muskeg edge and saw the remains of a very small deer that had perhaps been a wolf's or fox's dinner.   I can visualize the predator enjoying a nice dinner as he looked over the quiet pond.We moved on up to the side of the hill and set out our lunch with the million dollar view of the pond in the distance on one side and the meadow on the other.  We shared cheese, salami and crackers.  Cut into juicy fresh Asian pears and peeled some Clementine oranges and then topped the meal off with cookies and dried fruit and nuts.  Best restaurant we have eaten in all year!  Although there were deer flies about, none bothered us while we recuperated our energy on the fern bed in the shade of the trees.We encountered even more new trails for another visit on our drive out.  They seem to be reaching for creative trail names!  There are hundreds of hiking trails in the area.  I think we will never be able to trek them all."},

{"title": "Stingers and Zingers", "date": "Saturday, August 22, 2009", "text": "These are the sea nettles of hot summer that like soft and gentle bubbles come floating in on the tides to all parts of the river from the Chesapeake Bay.  They look so innocuous and carefree, but a brush against the little white tentacles will induce a fiery sting to tender skin.  They come in tiny and large sizes; the one above being about 3 inches and they can reproduce when only 2.5 inches wide.  They can grow as big as your open hand.  They pump just below the surface of the water in search of food.  This one was trapped in a tidal pond that was only a few inches deep.  If the water is compromised (not healthy) the jelly fish are greater in numbers for some reason.  The population is determined by both temperature and salinity but some scientists say the increase may be due to more nutrients being dumped from towns and cities running into the Bay to create more floating creatures to sting and eat.  This year we do not have a huge population.   If people are very concerned about these they can check the population movements for our area here.My grandson was lying belly flat on the dock to look at some fish and crabs the other day and came away with a burn from some sea nettle slime that had landed on the deck falling from the crab traps placed there.  He is a drama king but the sting must not have been all that bad, because after a wash with ammonia and a spray of Benadril he was A-OK and on to a new adventure.I have been stung by jelly fish (NOT the Portuguese-Man-Of-War) in the South Pacific and while it really burned, the pain did not last long.   Like many of the stinging/biting creatures of the world, the reputation sometimes exceeds the actuality.P.S. Yes, this belongs on my 'other' blog but I have several posts waiting there already.P.P.S.

{"title": "Ronnie's Challenge", "date": "Thursday, August 20, 2009", "text": "Ronnie has given all us boomers a challenge to post our ideas about the health care reform activities on the 20th of this month.   I could have done some research on segments of one of the 5 proposed bills, the one that is 1,000 pages, which I have not read in full, and write about that, but I won't as I think selective cherry picking on these bills is a waste of time.   I have read numerous articles analyzing the various issues and watched lots of television discussion.  I have watched all the white elderly citizens screaming at their Congressmen in various town hall meetings over this reform on CNN.  I do not see Hispanics, Blacks, or very many young people angry in this debate. (Well, except for the black woman who was escorted out of a meeting after being attacked by another white elderly man at Senator McCaskill's meeting in Missouri for having a poster of Rosa Parks.)   I really don't think specific issues of this health care are the reason for the angry debate.  The bills are not even finalized.  I don't hear people screaming at their Congressional representatives because they do NOT have health care.  I do not hear these angry people proposing alternatives or specifics in their arguments.  I am frustrated that most of these arguments are inaccurate, non-specific, use inflammatory speech and are based on a mind-set that is not open to discussion.  I keep getting the impression that they are very happy with their current health care status and don't really care about those who do not have health care insurance.  \"I've got mine and you lazy bums can figure out how to get yours.\"   I challenge these same gray-haired angry people to refuse the government run Medicare program when they reach 65.Part of this seems to me to be an issue of trust---and perhaps in some cases, race.   It seems that those who trusted the government to listen in on their phone calls and monitor their computer activities without warrant, do not trust the same government to find a way to provide health insurance to their neighbors and fellow citizens who do not have it.  I am guessing that they also completely trust the insurance paid middle-men who are now determining what level of health care they receive under their current private insurance.  They compare the ideas for the reform program to a 'socialist' Russia and seem to ignore the success of the Canadian and European health care systems.  This also is an issue of money.  I have heard it said that it has to do with conservative people not wanting poor people to get something for nothing, fearing that the expense for this service will have to come out of their pockets.  Well, I also feel that I will be paying for it in some way.  My health care costs are going to go up with or without this reform. They will go up with the reform to pay for health care for those who cannot pay or go up to pay for the inefficiencies and huge profits in the industry while many citizens go without, in spite of what this administration says.   My health expenses already are inflated by including emergency room care for those uninsured.  There are no guarantees but I think this reform will slow down the increase in costs for everyone.  There are no guarantees that the private sector will not drop those insured right now...but they are doing that every day already.   I still support the reform as it is the beginning of a long-needed process to improve health care for the richest country in the world and provide a safety net for us all.   I just wish these same citizens against the reform would have been screaming at their Congressmen regarding the huge budget deficits that were incurred several years ago.All that I have to write in this post is colored by the fact that I am not panicked for myself because I am in the catbird seat.  I have the same type of health care that the Congress has (which as an aside is a government contracted program with private industry).   I worked for the government for the correct number of years as did my husband.  We have access to a number of health care plans, we can change plans every January to suit our needs regardless of pre-existing health conditions, and we still get reasonably good coverage.  My husband's prostate surgery, his spinal surgery, the birth of my children, my biopsy...all paid for.  Since my retirement our premiums have increased, but are still affordable.  I remember years ago when a friend on one of the government health care programs needed a lung transplant.  The program he was enrolled in refused to cover the operation.  He would die without it.  That 'death squad' consisted of the health insurance company employee(s).  He had to wait the three months until he could change plans in January, got a different insurance company, and went on to have his transplant, even though he had a pre-existing condition.  The government contract protected him from being excluded because of pre-existing conditions.  Even this government program has its problems but this ability to change plans was his life-saver.I remember the terrible fear I carried daily when my son had reached 21, graduated from college and could no longer be covered on either our insurance or a student health care plan.  His employer provided no coverage.  He did not make enough money to pay for health care and pay for his apartment and pay for food.  We dug deep and paid for his health insurance until he got coverage through employment a few years later. (I have no idea if this insurance would have worked had he needed it!)  What if we couldn't have afforded that?  What if he had been involved in an accident or contracted some serious health condition with no coverage?  Many hard-working employed people and hard-working students live with that fear daily and without health care reform more and more working people will have no health care.To those who do not want government health care reform, I ask how you would feel if you had a life style disease and those Americans who were healthy said you should pay a much higher premium because of your poor eating habits, lack of exercise, dangerous life-style activities or decision to live in a polluted area?  Why should other Americans subsidize your carelessness and poor life-style?  Kind of cruel and frightening isn't it?To me it is a no-brainer that we need to begin to move in the direction of reform, but hard to convince those not using their brains, and instead, using the fear in their gut and the concern for their wallets to think.  Being against something totally is the easy way out.   Having to come up with ideas and suggestions to improve this reform and letting your Congressmen know takes far more work."},

I looked at him with a questioning frown and said \"People??\"  He looked up at me with those warm brown eyes and silly smile and said \"Yes, you and Doc!\"  Doc is what he calls his grandfather and we had just arrived that evening to spend the night.  I like being a surprise even better than being surprised.My granddaughter woke up from her deep night's sleep the first morning after her visit and called out to me, \"Neena!\"  \"Neena!\"  When I opened the door to the room where she had been sleeping she peered at me through the mass of hair hanging in front of her eyes and smiled.  \"I seeping!\" she said.  (I think she meant sleeping, but she also seeps when she sleeps if you know what I mean.)While racing through the Wal-Mart yesterday toward the toy section with my 4-year-old grandson to select the 'promised' toy, we had to go past the women's lingerie section.  There at the end of the aisle was a 'full' display of padded bras in bright colors with ribbons and lace.  Xman could not stop himself (what male can?) and running to the display actually pinched the middle of one bra cup and with a gleam in his eyes smiled up at me and said \"Boobies!\" (Remember, he is 4!)   This precocious 4-year-old has already asked the anatomy questions on the difference between boys and girls to his pre-school teacher and she had to send a 'smiling' note home to the parents to explain that she had referred these anatomy questions to them.   (My daughter is saving the note.)Next weekend my step- nephew who is in his 20's is visiting us with his new girlfriend...whom his parents have not yet met.  Therefore I have strict instructions to keep my eyes open and tell them everything as well as take pictures because they think the pictures on his Facebook page are not good enough!  I must put on my spy cloak, I guess.  At least I have not been requested to deal with anatomy answers or sleeping arrangements!"},

This was both totally exhausting and totally exhilarating at the same time.  Daughter was generous to give her up since Wednesday had been her first day home in some time.My daughter was involved in a bankruptcy take-over in another state last week involving mucho dollars.  She worked from 8:00 A.M. until late into the evening most days with only minutes for lunch and dinner.  Since guards were stationed round the clock they wanted to finish their work as fast as possible.  She was assisting with the computer forensics activities and was surprised to find how 'sloppy' or 'conniving' businesses are in tracking and evaluating their valuables.  Some real valuables were found sitting under the computers!My son was asked to go on national tour with another band last month and had the good sense to turn them down.Overheard during an evening dinner party was a story about an argument between a representative from an insurance company talking to a very high level lawyer for the CIA regarding some argument over a settlement.   Seems the CIA lawyer indicated that they could make this someone's life very miserable if they wanted without regard for the law. I know this 'someone' and he is just a young honest career dude trying to do his job. Didn't hear enough to know if it was under this administration or the one before. This scared me as I thought most of this stuff was over-hyped in movies.Having both grandchildren over the weekend was also a more than full session which included rubber pool swimming, squirt gun fights, big pool swimming, kite flying, crab catching, baby fish catching, caterpillar watching, tomato picking and beaching.My daughter was feeling sick Sunday morning and joked that maybe she was pregnant...I guess my reaction was too startling as she immediately suggested it was probably just eating too many fresh tomatoes and fresh sweet corn.Found and removed the tiniest tick from my husband's back yesterday.  It was the size of an 11 point period!  This has been the very worst year ever!  If one of us does not get Lyme's, it will be a miracle.Continuing to read a rather slow, plodding book that I started last week and am wondering why I don't have the courage to put it down and start on something I might enjoy?  (Actually I finally did put this book into the give-away box after reading to the very middle.)My refrigerator/freezer is stuffed with leftover homemade blackberry/peach cobbler, a homemade clementine cake, a watermelon and some ice cream...too many ways to get fat(ter).Two weekends ago I had house guests on Saturday and Sunday for boating and wine touring and barely got the house cleaned in time and the sheets changed for the next weekend's visitors.This past weekend, as I wrote above, was a two-day / two-night visit from my daughter and her two little ones.  Toys and crumbs are still being found everywhere.This coming Friday I will prepare a dinner for a visiting business friend from Korea, and Sunday I will drive up to the city for my granddaughter's second birthday party and that is the easiest of the busy weekends coming up.I invited someone down to the house for a visit soon and then found that I am booked solid with stuff until the third week in September.  Why don't I  just keep my big mouth shut?In spite of this post, I really am NOT the social butterfly that it seems.  Looking forward to 10 days of alone time when hubby takes off for Hawaii next month."},

The fact that I feel compelled to write that, maybe leaves the statement open to some debate.  I knew full well when I began once again the challenging landscaping/gardening journey that it was going to be a jazz dance...an exhausting jazz dance with my poor choreography.  I had mentioned the Perennial Plant dance that takes place in the fall when you find some plants overtaking an area, or needing more sun, or better drainage or a better contrasting plant or just a better place to florish.  I have about  10  15 plants that I will need to move this fall.  I planted some too close to the house as a temporary space before the deer fence went up.  Some are in deep shade that I did not expect and others have already outgrown their space.The good this year was the lovely purple flox that has bloomed for more than a month, the chaste bush that has already grown the size of a small tree and was in full bloom, the zinnias that have large and colorful blooms, the Celosia which had every single seed germinate until I was sticking plants in pots, in the ground and everywhere.My chaste plant.Celosia attracting lots of pollinators.Good old fashioned zinnias.A nice pink zinnia just begging to be put in a bouquet.Even the green zinnia are attractive.The surprise issue here is that I never realized Celosia grew four feet high!  Sort of overpowers that little red pot doesn't it?The same was true of the zinnias on the east side of the house.  In deep shade a good part of the day, they grew over four feet in the 2 foot high raised bed.  One has to be a basketball player to really appreciate their beauty.This was a little surprise as it was supposed to be a very different coneflower when I bought it!  The photo on the pot looked like a dahlia...a very new and exciting form and PINK!  Since I cannot find the plant I thought I bought on the Internet, maybe it doesn't exist.  Something is eating the leaves of this plant, so it is soon to not exist as well!The surprise above is that the photo was taken the last week of July with temps breaking the 90's and the purple pansies were still blooming in this pot.  It is on the north side of the house in mostly shade.Unfortunately I had to post one ugly...my poor sunflowers.  30 plants all chewed or knocked down and only two blossoms trying to put on a show as they lay flat against the earth.  Of course, there was NOT a lot of sun and there was lots of rabbits, ground hogs, etc."},
{"title": "Interregnum", "date": "Wednesday, August 05, 2009", "text": "A lovely sunset last night on the riverI have been thinking much more lately of my parents.  I try not to miss that they are gone and that I no longer have time to build a closer relationship with them.  Perhaps it is the pictures of my childhood that I have retrieved that is pushing me on this backward journey.  In several photos my mother is younger than I am today...that grabs my mind and heart and makes me a little dizzy.  She looks fresh and happy.  I do not remember her that way.   I know that if she was in front of me right now we would get off on one of those stilted conversations where she makes me feel less than I am.  One of those conversations where she is the grand martyr and I am the self-centered daughter.  I love(d) her, but she could be an energy sump to be with.  I am trying to accept the flow of the river of time.  If I dwell too long I make myself sad and that doesn't accomplish anything.  There is a common idea that if we could go back in time we might better appreciate the moments with the wisdom we have since gained.  Well, I realize that is a fallacy.  I am watching my grandchildren grow and change like cornstalks in the field after a rain.  I am aware of the moments when I am with them and I  appreciate every second, but time still rushes on by and they still are growing and changing faster than I can deeply grasp.  It is not about wisdom gained with experience.  It is about realizing that we cannot slow down time.  We cannot pace our lives as we wish.  Having time to reflect and understand only helps a little.  We still will make mistakes and have regrets no matter how wise we have become.Life is like a river.  It rushes dangerously fast in some places, then goes slowly and peacefully (or dully) in others.  We are just along for the ride and try though we might, we miss much stuff in communication and relationships and understanding how others are truly feeling.  We try to put ourselves in their place, but the river quickly pushes us on to somewhere else and we must process all over again that new color in the water and that new ripple.I guess that there are people who know this truth most of their life.  They do not waste time second guessing a decision or a relationship.  But, I think for most of us, it is a crazy journey and we cannot really see the destination as well as we would like.  It is a far way ahead and it will be whatever it is when we get there.  We hope that we will understand it and recognize its meaning, and find it is something we can accept but hope is all we get at this turn in the river."},

{"title": "Happy Trails to You", "date": "Thursday, July 30, 2009", "text": "On the last day of my recent hiking trip to West Virginia, one of my hiking shoes decided to throw off the rubber sole plate.  My whole fromt foot was just flapping in the breeze and this resulted in us having to visit the nearby drugstore in that famous little mountain town that I wrote about earlier and to purchase that all purpose repair tool known as duct tape.  Hubby wrapped my foot sturdily for our final day of hiking before heading home.  The temporary repair worked very well.  These hiking shoes should have been replaced a number of years ago as the cushioning had long since been pummeled.  I remember the day that I bought them, about 15 years ago,  in an REI store in Denver.We had gone to visit my relatives outside Boulder and we were planning on doing a little hiking in the Rocky Mountains.  My brothers and sister who hiked all the time were amazed that I was planning on hiking in tennis shoes.  It was decided by my relatives and husband that I finally needed a REAL pair of hiking shoes.  You may be surprised at how nervous I was trying on hiking shoes.  I felt like an impostor.  These fancy shoes were for people who climbed mountains and straddled ridges and skirted glaciers.  All I did was follow cleared mountain trails and stumble across meadows.  I felt guilty spending so much money on something I only used a dozen times a year.  REI had a ramp that you were supposed to walk up and down rather fast to see if the shoes were comfortable in the toe area.   I self-consciously pretended I was testing each of the various sizes and finally bought the pair of shoes above.They were the most comfortable shoes I owned, and after the first few hikes I regretted not putting out the money earlier.Upon returning from our West Virginia trip the next weekend we drove up into the city and stopped at the REI store there and purchased a new pair of hiking boots. This time it was just like buying a pair of shoes.  I put on the cushioned hiking socks I had tucked in my purse, put on various pairs of shoes and walked all over the store in them.  I was not self-conscious at all. and actually focused on feel and comfort.  I purchased the \"cute\" little silver blue trimmed shoes above and I am now looking forward to another 15 years of hiking.   I think they do say the legs are the last to go, and I am counting on that."},

Hang in there, this should be really, REALLY interesting...!I so 'fondly' remember putting together this 'comprehensive' manual for our basketball coach which was ultimately for the team that year.  He 'contracted' with our Business Education teacher to have me and my best friend be his personal secretaries.  He corrected every period and we worked for days changing many details!  I can guarantee that he probably had to take remedial English in college and was trying to get even in some weird way.  This would have had questionable shades of sexual discrimination today.  At least they should have admitted that no one on the basketball team knew English and therefore, could not read it (How's that for discrimination?).It appears from this memento that, during High School, I went to the State Convention for the Future Homemakers of America.  This conference did not appear to have made any impression as I cannot remember much of it at all!  I also do not think I am an exceptional homemaker as a result, either.This is our hometown newspaper with an article on the newest members of National Honor Society.  Wow...were we a little dorky, or what?   Here we stand waiting to be served tea by our club faculty sponsor.   She was like a little Ms. Marple.  (Names have been redacted to protect those still serving jail sentences.)While in High School I was in a fashion show.  I DO remember this because I am such a nut for parading around in new clothes.  We got to wear clothes borrowed from the dress stores in the nearby larger town.  As you may recall, I came from a family that watched money closely and I rarely got to wear new clothes.  This was a treat for a poor farm girl.This is the important notice of my college tuition waiver, which had I not received, I may not have gone to college.This is my Freshman Beanie...Yes we actually wore them for one whole day.  What a crock!This is a homemade record of something...what I don't know.  Now I have to find a turntable! Maybe it was something from debate club?When I turned 21 during my senior of year of college, one of the my former High School upper classmen friends, a really nice guy that I had no interest in, invited me to the Playboy club in Denver for drinks to celebrate. (I hope he didn't pay for membership just for me!)  It was an awkward and cool and weird experience.  I was so naive that I didn't question why someone would be serving me drinks in a rabbit costume with overflowing mammary glands. I cannot tell you how absolutely sophisticated I felt, as if I was in some Doris Day movie.  I am sure that I looked like a 14-year-old Doris Day as well!  ( And, no, I didn't do anything non-Doris Day at the end of the evening.)Next on my memory journey is a bunch of letters that I continue to pour over!  Enough about me, now, what about all of you?"},
{"title": "The Junk Trunk Revealed---Part I", "date": "Sunday, July 26, 2009", "text": "It seems that readers of my prior post are somewhat masochistic...so lets take a tour of this old trunk.I opened the heavy trunk lid and one of the hinges broke away as that side of the lid slid to the floor.  Inside everything was dusty from bits of yellowed paper and most of the items in a jumble.  So much for how well my brother (or his wife!) packed the trunk.  This vase above (what used to be a vase) has absolutely no memory for me.  Was it a gift I bought my mother on my travels?  Was it some stupid trinket I bought for myself? This vase had never been used.  So much for the hope for treasure.My life was absolutely so filled with very important events that I had to make a huge and comprehensive scrapbook of all my high school activities followed by another thick tome of all the cool stuff I did in college.  These thick scrapbooks are filled with mostly cocktail napkins, theater tickets, theater programs, old ribbons, newspaper clippings,  my band letter(s) and a very few awards as well...nothing that even my children would find of interest today.  There was also a JFK scrapbook filled with newspaper clippings.My music tastes were somewhat prosaic, but I had no money and so each album was purchased with care.  I also had some Frank Sinatra albums and an entire collection of Shakespeare productions on record (OMG, what a bore was I?), but where those went I surely don't know.  Does anyone remember the singer Claudine Longet  and that terrible murder in Aspen?Above is the dress I wore to my Senior Prom.  I am so surprised at how thin I was.  I was actually elected  \"Queen\" of the prom that year.  Before you get impressed (ha!) my graduating class was under 25 students and only half of those were girls.   I do think this Jacqueline Kennedy style of dress has stood the test of time.  If I was still that thin ( yeah, big dreamer) and still had somewhere formal to go, I think would wear it.Now I am going to sit down and open these scrapbooks...more to follow. That ought to be somewhat interesting."},
{"title": "Treasure Chest", "date": "Saturday, July 25, 2009", "text": "I left my childhood home heading to Hawaii first and then on across the Pacific years later, so many years ago, that many of the memories sadly have faded to misty gray.  It was a farmhouse at the edge of town on the 'other' side of the railroad tracks.  I could walk to school but lived just far enough to catch the school bus which stopped at the turn by my driveway.  The only kid that owned a car was the Doctor's son.  In those days it was not an uncool thing to ride the school bus.  That was the time you had to visit and gossip and I luckily got on the bus at the beginning of the route. My friend from the farm nearby would put on all her make-up on the bus because her father was a very religious conservative.  The population of the town was under 2000 which did not seem at all small to me when I lived there because my experiences were also small and I knew almost everyone in town.My parents have since passed and the farm was sold a few years ago.  I probably will not go back that way again as the few friends I have stayed in touch with have moved far away or to nearby towns.   A very sad thought, something that probably happens to most of us if we are blessed to live past our usefulness.I had moved 99% of my 'things' (invaluable stuff ya' know) from my parents' home except for an old camel-back trunk that I had purchased at the Salvation Army store for $5 when I was about 13.  I always had BIG plans to restore it, restoration which was needed as can be seen from the photo above, but I never did.  (Admittedly it did not have all that white paint on it when I bought it...I think since my brother is in construction he can take credit for that.)  I kept it at the back of my closet in the old farmhouse and put inside school annuals, record albums, letters, prom dresses, scrapbooks, etc.  For years after I returned to the States I kept forgetting to make the arrangements to have it shipped to where I lived.  The trunk was moved to my brother's house when the farm was sold.  Last week it came via UPS wrapped in plain plastic and had been left outside next to the deer fence gate as we had gone shopping for the day.   I had been planning on getting it crated, but I find that it weighed more than 70 pounds with all the junk inside.  I have not asked my brother how much it cost to send, so I will find that out and send him a nice fat check.  We struggled to load the monster into the back of the car and got it as far as the garage floor where it has sat since.  I am finally going to open it up today (although I am fighting a sore throat from germs generously shared by my grandson) and see what treasures are tucked inside.  After grabbing another tissue and pouring a glass of wine, I will begin this good memory trip or maybe it will be just an emotional one or maybe a surprising bore.  After all, we are so much in love with our own history.   My treasures, my junk, who knows..."},

{"title": "Rejuvenation", "date": "Tuesday, July 21, 2009", "text": "Retired and being in a rut can happen quite easily I think.  It was time for us to try something challenging...at least challenging to two old f***s who spent most of their time avoiding anything edgy.  We needed something to do that was out of the safety zone.The directions on the website said that a table had to be reserved ahead of time if one expected to sit during the show(s), otherwise it was 'first come first served.'   Reserving a table cost $10 per person and IF you sat at this table you had to order at least $10 worth of food per person...not counting drinks.  We wanted to sit as close to the dance floor as possible with the best view and so put out the big bucks.  The email said the doors opened at 7:00 PM and we needed to be there by 7:45 so they would not give away our 'reserved' table.  They also said if you left your drink you may find your drink gets taken away...since 18 and 19 year-olds were allowed inside.   So many rules I felt like I was back in college.  I don't think college has any rules these days, does it?  When we got there, the tickets I picked up at the will-call window said the doors did not open until 8:00 PM. Great, now we had an hour to kill.   We went next door and ate some shrimp.Finally 8:00 arrived. My son and a few band members came by to chat.   We sat down and ordered our drinks and food and as the first band rocked out we put in our foam ear plugs that my son had gotten at the bar.   He mentioned something about OSHA requiring them to be available...who knew?  (I still had ringing in my ears when I got home though.)The first band to play was a group of 20 somethings with a cultured nerdy look, glasses and button down shirts and big clunky shoes.  Perhaps the look wasn't cultured as when the band called their fans down to the dance floor...the fans stood like cigar store Indians each with their style statement beer in one hand and facing the players.   Not a toe tap or a head bob among them.  One young lady about 290 pounds and 5 foot 8 inches had her arms around another young lady who couldn't have weighed more than 90 pounds even in wet clothes and who stood just over 4 feet tall.  They seemed to like each other very much, but not enough to sway to the music.   Another couple was a fawn like girl in a short skirt and black top and her cute and small boyfriend who kept his hand lightly on the small of her back with extreme self-consciousness.  Boy did this take me back to that time of awkward sex that must have been a part of my life so long ago.  The rest of the fans looked like computer repair folks.As the band ended, the crowd had started to grow and the tables were filled by the second band.  I looked around the room and guessed that the age level had increased by about two years.  This band was trying very hard.  They had a marketing guru for lead singer as he  got     tried to get the crowd to chant out the name of the theatre/bar as a gesture of thanks.  I will give them credit for trying hard as he really seemed to be enjoying his role and at least their fans did a little head bobbing.Finally my son's band was up to play.  They were the coolest of course.  The fans filled the floor. Only one cover was played and all the rest original ---  lyrics and music mostly written and composed by my son.  I am prejudiced, I know, but he is very talented. The fans were jumping and clapping and enjoying themselves without being intoxicated.  One gal was there in a short little dress and my favorite style statement, cowboy boots.  Her date, oddly, was in a suit and tie, but my daughter explained he had probably come straight from work.   There were the traditional cleavage and bare waist girls and the guys in faded T-shirts.  I knew a few as friends of my son from high school, and others looked familiar.I looked around the room and at one side table sat a small group of parents,  very straight looking with their short gray haircuts and conservative dress.  (No, I was not looking at a mirror on the far wall!)  I knew they must be parents of the members of the band that I didn't know. They looked a little pained as I guess this music was not quite their thing.  It was like a Meet the Parents moment with the expression on their faces of trying hard to 'get this.'We head-bobbed and toe-tapped and I didn't get back to my daughter's house until after midnight.  It was exhausting but also rejuvenating as I hadn't hung with a cool crowd in years.  I am playing that great music from the band's website as I write this.PS: (If you are brave enough to listen go here:   My favs are \"Arsonist\" and \"Everybody Knows\")"},

{"title": "Snowballs in H***", "date": "Thursday, July 16, 2009", "text": "Interesting plant in the photo above, no?  Go ahead, take a guess and identify this common (rare in my garden) flower.  Those rare, fringy, skinny plants are ta-daa...marigolds.  They are marigolds on a diet.  You may have never seen skinny marigolds .When beginning my garden this year, actually re-beginning after the building of the deer fence, I read somewhere that planting marigolds around roses will help to keep insect pests away.  It appears that insects do not like marigolds. Actually I am not a big fan of marigolds myself.  I know, I know.   We are supposed to like all of nature's bounty and marigolds have their place in this world.  I would put them way in the back of the flower garden and in the shade.  Their flower is nice, but they have no fragrance and they have no drama for me, common since my childhood.Anyway, I am all about biological controls and selected the \"snowball\" marigolds to stand as sentries around the delicate rose bushes.   I bought a packet of seeds, planted them in the seed tray and nurtured them way back in early April.  Most of them germinated.  They are like cockroaches in that they are hearty and healthy.  I then planted them carefully and symmetrically in front of and around my roses.  Weeks of work and they were beginning to make a nice little hedge.  They loved the soil and the limited sun and began to grow like weeds.  I had done the germinating and planting in two week periods and the first group was ready to bloom.  Lovely snow white blossoms even though they grow mostly in the shade.  (I somehow did not grasp the true shade of these 30 foot trees on the side of my yard until this summer when I began serious work on flower beds.)The second group of marigolds was planted two weeks later in the sunnier bed.  They took to that bed like weeds, again.  Then one morning I went out and saw what you see above.  What the?  What on earth eats marigolds?  It had ignored my cone flowers, my roses, my statice...not my sunflowers, but everything eats my sunflowers.Thus began the detective work.  Fortunately I am a dyslexic sleeper and sometimes wake up at 2:00 AM, 3:00 AM, 4:00 AM and sometimes I even sleep in and get up at 7:00 AM.  Each morning I saw nothing in the vicinity of my marigolds.  The only active animal was a little rabbit eating the clover in my lawn...the same one I chased around the yard last week.  I would let him sit there and munch away as he did a real job on the clover.  I had sprayed the marigolds with hot pepper oil and cut with vinegar and water but, what will come as no surprise to the avid gardener, one morning I saw bunny enjoying his salad of marigold leaves and his dessert of marigold flowers following the clover appetizer.  He was mowing through the plants like it was his last supper, as maybe it should be, because I think we are moving him to new fields tomorrow."},

There was too much space.  Then she realized that it/they were gone.  The bright orange-red barge and its smaller brother tug boat were not there on the opposite side of the river tied together like prisoners with lifetime sentences against the opposite shore.They had sat idle for years like fat retired whales, never moving and only occasionally groaning wildly in the wind or when the owner started up one of the rusty motors to do something unfathomable for an hour or so, making ugly raucous noises where large metal pipes were clanged or moved to another side of the barge.  Most recently, as the deck to the barge owner's new house was completed, the monstrosities were moved to the nearby dock no longer blocking the owner's wife's view of the river.In Tabor's mind they were like the war flags.  Her side of the river was filled with fancy motor and sailboats and weekend children's rafts and paddle boats.  The other side was filled with working gear, small fishing boats, and lawn BBQs and, of course, the two rusting whales.  Oddly she felt guilty at her happiness in 'winning' the mind war that had resulted in the ugly monsters being removed.  This couldn't have been the owner's livelihood because they were never used.  They had become very expensive pieces of deteriorating junk.  Surely the owner with his dark mustache and beer belly was just as glad as she that they had found a new home.Yesterday, sitting on their new partially completed deck, they had waved as she floated by in her canoe.  She waved back.  Maybe this war was only in her mind."},
{"title": "Born to Be Wild", "date": "Monday, July 13, 2009", "text": "\"Road Trip\"  Just whisper those words and hubby has bags packed and the car out of the garage in seconds.  Since his retirement he is so into filling his days with activity.   I, on the other hand, even though I know I am going to die for sure some day, fill my days with sitting and reading and being perfectly happy.  We are a good match as opposites.  He gets me out of the house and I keep him from spending all our retirement money on gasoline.We had been wanting for years to explore the Cranberry Glades of West Virginia.  This is about a 6 hour drive from where we live.  We reserved a reasonable room in Marlinton (there no longer are cheap rooms in this world) and packed our stuff and headed out on the highway (shades of Steppehwolf).  Marlinton, West Virginia, does not appear to have a web page.  When we reached a Visitors Center near Hot Springs in Virginia, no one there could tell us about the town or how to get there even though we had our heads close over Virginia road maps.  These are people who live in the region!   Finally we found it when we pulled out the WEST Virginia map.  The town is just a wide spot on the road just below a major ski area.  It appears to be barely surviving on the tourist industry.  Our motel still uses metal keys for their doors.  The 5 or so restaurants all have exactly the same menu.  If you order spinach it will come from a can.   If you order gravy it will be thick and white.  Applesauce is served with everything.  The waitresses, country girls, are friendly and actually can \"talk your leg off.\"  Chatty Kathy,  from our motel restaurant, told us her life story over breakfast, which started 20 minutes late because she was late to work.We took a walk down the main street after one evening's dinner at another restaurant and the exotic culture of this town was like a foreign country to me.  There was a fire and brimstone tent meeting at one end of town with a heavy-set black preacher shoutin' and singin' for all to hear.  He had quite a few devoted followers chiming in with 'Yes, Lord.' while they sat on metal folding chairs in the lawn under a large open tent.  At the other end of town, only three blocks away, was a street fair with a reasonably good country band providing mountain music between the vendors selling cotton candy, hotdogs, popcorn and lemonade.  A skinny and angular young man with a mouth full of buck teeth was standing in the middle of the street in front of the band and kept shouting \"Yee Haw\" to the music as he jerked along to the rhythm.  For a minute I thought I was in a Dolly Parton movie.  I am not making this up!We were barely able to book our room in this area as the ski resort a few minutes away was holding lots of activities each weekend during the summer, most certainly to keep the economy moving.   SnowShoe Mountain Ski Resort (their website gives a real flavor of the place) is a mass of diverse architecture covering the top of the Snowshoe Mountain. \"Also known as Forever Wild, Snowshoe is a year-round adventure located in Pocahontas County.\"  The only things 'wild' about this resort are the mountain bikers who keep the trails muddy and the jeep wranglers who up the ante even more with their off road contests.  The architecture is described as 'Swiss village' and I describe it as interesting and little frightening for such a lovely mountain area.  The footprint is huge.   This particular coming weekend was a Jeep Jamboree and a major Chile Cookoff.  We ate at the ski resort one night in search of healthier food and asked the host of the restaurant if he was planning on being busy the coming Saturday. \"We are going to get our butts kicked big time,\" he smiled.   And then he went on to explain that this event was such a big deal even CNN was covering it.  That explained the camera crew that was setting up just out side the restaurant when we entered.  \"Butts kicked big time\"...I don't think I have ever heard a host say those words to me in a nice restaurant.If you want my take on the beauty of this area which we saw on our daily hikes through the meadows, over the waterfalls, and between rocky caverns, along with a sad wildlife story...that, of course, gets posted on 'my other blog.'"},

The reason it touched a chord is that we are all on the same boat...some going first class and some going steerage and some hanging on the edge of the stern for dear life.  And we all get to shift places on this boat, usually without being asked.In answer to some questions about the creation of the post, it did not take me long to write it.   It really did just flow from the heart.   I have traveled a lot and have seen some of this in my travels.  I did research by looking up traditional names starting with T from various countries via the Internet.  I did research by perusing some world headlines to stimulate thought.I have been on travel, a second road trip, this time to the enticing mountains of West Virginia on a hiking adventure which included viewing mountain meadows, rocky crags and waterfalls like that above.   I will reminisce briefly on that trip once I get the photos all processed.  I will also attempt to catch up on reading blogs.  It seems that it is very easy to get far behind as my blog list keeps growing."},

{"title": "Mums on Acid", "date": "Sunday, July 05, 2009", "text": "Am I the only one who wonders about wildlife like this when the 4th of July comes around? The very first explosion sent two geese (this photo above is of ducks) high into the air and away from the river. We watched, for the very first time, from our boat, the small town fireworks. It was preceded by some very nice smaller fireworks shows on the lawns of several mansions at the mouth of the river. The boats were anchored in comfortabe space along the mouth before the entry to the bay and while the water carried the banter of celebratory boaters, the dusk and darkness provided a blanket of privacy.  Since it was just hubby and I we could freely neck as the nightflowers exploded against the black sky. Other things I noticed in the glass half full side was that the weather was a breezy 72 degrees and the normally sweltering sun was hidden behind a high gray sky that threatened rain which never happened. This is the coolest 4th of July I have experienced in a long time. For a while the wakes of the boats prevented me from reading while waiting for the dark, but eventually the surface of the ocean calmed down.The glass half empty side was that the almost full moon was hidden and could not light our way home at the end of the show. The glass half full was that all 99% of the boaters were intelligent and polite and actually followed the Rules of the Road and wending our slow way home watching the red and green bow lights on the motor and sailboats along the 5 miles up river was actually quite nice.I know that it is impossible to take a photo of fireworks when sitting on a rocking boat, but the photos below were fun to process anyway. They look like mums on acid. We almost didn't take this holiday challenge as our neighbors had said the boating was crazy on the 4th, but since we had been alone all day we needed to do something. We were pleasantly surprised and now feel perhaps we can take our grandchildren out on this holiday."},

I am only going because my husband's project requires could use this fellow's input and support. I am going to see his summer cabin and praise its lovely location and praise his wife's marvelous cooking and watch his beautiful children play at the water's edge ( if they are there) and then come home, and hopefully, not throw up. I can rise above this.Tomorrow Saturday is our Independence day in America. It really is an important day and unfortunately we sometimes convert it to BBQ and too much drinking and forget the real reason we have to celebrate. We had invited my son and his friends but my son never responded told my husband he would let us know and so the few other people we invited at the last minute had also made other plans. I hate empty holidays but looking at the glass as half full, this means I do not have to put on fresh sheets in the bedrooms and plan any meals! (My daughter and family are visiting friends for this day.)I spent this morning chasing Mr. Rabbit in circles around the flower garden and then around the vegetable garden....REALLY!! My husband thought this was very funny. He has a very immature sense of humor. I also had to move the little box turtle from my sad sunflowers as he seemed to be lost in the sparse jungle of stems. Why oh why do I think I can fool Mother Nature?(In case you need a break from my ranting: The recipe for parsley dressing is here for one of the salad dressings. The other I made up using balsamic vinegar, sugar, cinnamon, salt, garlic, parsley, red wine and olive oil..maybe some other things, but I sort of was working with the cooking muse and working on using up leftover stuff. All was whipped in the food processor.) The transmission, clutch(?) something went out on my 10-year-0ld Mazda last night and after it was towed from my front yard this morning to the mechanics garage he said it would cost $500 just to go in and look at the problem!. This is after a tree fell on the deer fence last week which will cost $300 to repair. There is a glass half full here...it is cloudy with scum floating on top...but at least the car stalled in the yard instead of in the Virginia mountains where we were a few days ago and at least I have free towing with my insurance. I hope all of you have a Happy 4th...even if you don't live in the beautiful if somewhat crazy U.S.A. I found these hungry caterpillars munching on the parsley in the garden the other day and asked hubby about them. He said he had decided to leave them alone because they make butterflies eventually. What about the parsley, I asked. He said that we had way too much of it anyway.I thought about this for a minute and realized that we had so much parsley because I was never harvesting it and using it. I had been focusing on other stuff from the garden. I have not been a big parsley user in my cooking in the past, and therefore, since we had so much success this year with the lovely green lace, I decided to search the Internet for some parsley recipes. I harvested a bunch of leaves (two different types) and proceeded to wash and dry them allowing spiders and caterpillar poo to float away.An hour later and with the kitchen smelling strongly of garlic and with spilled olive oil across the counter and with green stuff everywhere, I finished two recipes of parsley dressing. One pungent with Parmesan and garlic and one sweet with gentle spices and balsamic vinegar and red wine. Guess we will be eating a bunch of salad this week. All this green has got to be healthy, right?"},

Clearly we all lived lives of abundance, but just needed to make that more concrete by recording it daily. I actually kept an 'abundance journal' for a short while, but like many New Year's resolutions it fell by the wayside years ago. This house is for sale. It is actually a three-house compound on an island in the river near where I live. If you know someone who has a few million to spare, let them know about this abundant opportunity.This sailboat belongs to one of my neighbors. It was brand new when purchased almost a year ago. To my knowledge, it has never been released from the dock and used except to sit on the back deck while at dock and watch the sunset on rare evenings! My husband would love to own a sailboat, but that is an abundance we will never have.For the next few months I do not have to buy cut flowers from anyone else. My yard is providing me with so much abundant beauty."},
{"title": "Balance", "date": "Monday, June 29, 2009", "text": "In dealing with Mother Nature I have learned that it is all about balance. Having been both a wife and mother I think I understand about balance. The most important balance one must have is in expectations and in how one deals with the willingness to fail once in a while. Whether gardening or raising children or solving a marital issue it is pretty much dependant upon the biology of the moment. I have always been partial to hybrid tea roses. These plants are very temperamental and cannot be grown organically unless in a hermetically sealed greenhouse. I, therefore, knowing the challenges, had reasonable expectations in the failure and success of the new roses I planted in this yard. Of the five, one looked so bad this second year that I dug it up and tossed it. I did not expect my Olympiad rose to grow so well and so easily. The flowers are perfect in shape, last for days and make excellent cut flowers in arrangements and the plant has thus far been resistant to both bugs and fungus!  I had planted cosmos from seed and they have been somewhat slow to start, but flowers are now beginning to form. This was a surprise as the cosmos I see that is growing with little encouragement in the road medians seems to be very robust. I anticipate my plants will be robust in re-seeding and I will have to watch them closely next year so that I keep them in their place.My sunflowers, on the other hand, have been so very sad. Several were eaten by rabbits until I sprayed pepper spray on them and also deer repellent around them. But even so, they are struggling to grow in this wet non-California climate. While this photo above was taken days ago and the plants are now over two feet, I must admit that sunflowers are not going to be something I try again. The vegetable garden has rewarded us with spring crops and now we are harvesting our first tomatoes, cucumbers and raspberries. I find the most wonderful pleasure in getting all kinds of herbs from my herb garden that sits just outside the front door. This was something I dreamed about when I was living in the apartment in the city. These garden tomatoes above (our first harvest for this year) are garnished with basil and fennel...they look almost like a Christmas decoration."},
{"title": "Reptile Weekend", "date": "Saturday, June 27, 2009", "text": "My grandson came to visit last weekend (Father's Day) and it seemed that all of the reptiles in our yard wanted to make his visit complete by putting on a show of support. The two frogs in the photos immediately above landed on the patio door windows as night descended, two different species within a foot of each other. Their suction-cup appendages clung to the glass and they peered into our room watching us watch \"Kung Fu Panda\" on the big screen TV. Maybe we should have invited them inside.The two box turtles each made an appearance on opposite sides of the house during the daytime. One acted very much like a turtle and was totally terrified of Xman, probably with good reason. He kept his head hidden and he ventured only tentatively after we had moved inside to our lunch. The other turtle (top photo) was also terrified, but this resulted in a rather speedy run across the grass into the safety of the woods...fastest turtle in the East. He was the most stunning in color as well. (Don't let that angelic photo of my grandson deceive you.  He is very much a Huckleberry Finn when it comes to manipulating those who love him.)Xman was recklessly brave as only a four-year-old can be around them and even more brave to let this lightning bug crawl up his arm. We captured two lightning bugs and put them in the insect hotel, but they seemed to not appreciate the confined safety of a plastic room and did not let their lights shine during the evening as he drifted off to sleep."},

Since I had just come from the mom world, I had much to learn about software and hardware.  In those days the end user was responsible for defrags, backups, etc.  Our tech people were quite nerdy and also in their insecurity happy to make you feel stupid.  I was regularly reminded of how inadequate I was and was asked questions about the system for which I had no answers.  The attitude of our tech department was that they were dealing with lazy and stupid children who would never learn anything.  Having been a teacher in a prior life, my whole philosophy was that there were no stupid questions.  Their attitude was that all questions were stupid.In this prior life I was responsible for a survey regarding a price change for services that my agency was considering. We worked with universities and colleges and also the public and were required by law to survey prior to raising our service fees.  As a result, this meant I had to monitor many emails for several months and record the responses.The first thing each morning I would open my over-filled email box and begin the responses.  On one particular morning I opened an attachment from the Dean of a university to print it and immediately my email box was filled with responses from my huge address book from everyone...many of them address invalid responses.  Within five minutes the headquarters computer security office in the city called me on the phone and said I had a virus and to shut down my computer immediately.  I did.  I also walked around the building and posted signs telling staff not to open any email from me that morning.  It was the Melissa virus.I was very intimidated by this whole mess and knew that the 'nerds' were going to have a field day with me.  Because they worked late hours none of the crew got work before 10:00 AM.  I had to sit and stew for the first part of the morning without any computer.  When they arrived, they immediately wanted to know what games I had been playing on the computer, what Internet sites I had visited, etc.  When I revealed that I had opened an attachment from the Dean of a prestigious university it took most of the wind out of their sails.  I did get some pleasure from that.When I changed jobs years later the next job also had a staff of IT that felt it was necessary to belittle the 'client' and to even go so far as to correct their English on the help tickets being posted, even though there was a database that recorded this insolence.  I took a totally new approach to working with these folks.  No longer was I going to be the deer in the headlights.  I became the chatty and praise filled client.  Everything they did was golden and my questions were always coated with awe at how they did what they did.  I ignored their snide remarks. It worked!  We became the best of friends and I became number one on their help list when a problem arose.  They even began to share knowledge.This all came back to me when twice this week I was in IE browsing various blogs and when I clicked on a link the 'about:Tabs' starts up and keeps opening new tabs ad nausea um until I am forced to turn off my PC...actually I have to UNPLUG my PC as I get no response from the keyboard or off button! My PC is an oldie but a goodie, but I guess it is is now beginning to show its age.  Staples is having a half-price sale on PC maintenance---which I hope means more than vacuuming the inside of the box.  Maybe I should look into this.

Actually, there were two rainbows both forming complete arcs across the end of the finger of the river. That more complete view was impossible to capture with my not-so-wide angled lens. Even capturing the colors of a rainbow, that mystical reflection of rays of light painting their way through the raindrop, is quite the challenge as this photo does not look as stunning as the real thing. It was sort of \"you had to be there.\"It never ceases to surprise me that rainbows create such a feeling of hope and euphoria in me. Maybe it is the electricity in the air that polarizes the brain cells; maybe it is the vastness of the arc that makes us appreciate that, tiny creatures that we are, we were saved from all the thunder and lightning; maybe it takes us back to the first time in our fresh youth when we saw our first rainbow.

I wrote these answers shooting straight from the hip in about three minutes total. Only #11 and #15 caused me to pause and come back to them after some thought. If you are up to it or in blog stasis and need an idea I challenge you to play along.1. If one song were to describe your life, what song would that be?\"She'll Be Coming Round the Mountain When She Comes.\" (In other words, eventually I will get where I am supposed to be, I hope.)2. Which item of clothing do you wear most?\"Underpants\" (Cute lacy things ;-))3. When did you get up today?6:30 AM---I actually slept in! 4. Last thing you bought?Rose fertilizer5. What are you listening to:The Pink Martini (I saw them last week live.)6. If you were a God/Goddess, who would you be?Diana--she was the tough one.7. Favourite holiday spot?Some place that I have not yet traveled to. (Although if I never get to travel again I will say Bali.)8. What are you reading right now?A Thousand Splendid Suns9. Favourite Film?Out of Africa10.First thing you do in Spring?Smell the earth.11.Funniest thing you saw in your life?Well, I have answered all of the questions and come back to this and thought and thought. Something funny 'seen' usually means slapstick humor or a pratfall and I don't find those so funny anymore. I guess I haven't had a good belly laugh in quite a while and things I remember don't seem so funny anymore. (Now when we start playing a game of Ballderdash I sometimes laugh so hard I can wet my pants.)12. Who is your hero/heroine?Right now it is President Obama, but there have been many others before.13. Share some wisdom?Don't forget to breathe deeply as you start your day.14. If you were a tree, what tree would you be?A banyan...a big fat banyan.15. Fictitious character/s who made a lasting impression on you?Had to think for a while because most of those who impress me are real people, but I guess I will say Kermit the Frog and secondly Charlie Brown.16. Four words to describe you?Picky, happy, creative and curious. (Also fiercely loyal, but that makes a complex five.)17. Why do you blog?Why not? What else can I do with my words that, so far, gives me some complimentary feedback?"},

The daily to weekly rental places were busy, but the rental houses and condos were all empty.We spent a Friday morning in St. Petersburg and were surprised to see the contrast in activity from our nearby city.  The streets were quiet and parking was easy to find.  Downtown Tampa was not much busier.  Clearly the recession is here.While we were happy to see many relatives from my husband's family we also were reminded about the difference in culture of the area.  One of hubby's nephews is 55 and drives a florist truck for a living (his fourth career move) and another is living in subsidized housing at the age of 58 and has been drug and alcohol free finally for a year.  Their children (adults) also seem to have no interest in anything other than hanging out while drifting from job to job.The wife of one of the nephews brags that she has been a bartender at the same hotel bar for over 30 years.  Several of the youngest are also divorced or working on their third marriage.  None of this means they are terrible people.  It is just a culture that my husband and I are not a part of.  I do not denigrate this blue-color culture but the transient nature of the work means that no one really develops a skill...except for making drinks.  It seems that the warmth and easy living of Florida does not encourage motivation to better oneself beyond a string of retail jobs.  It was also a little bit of a surprise that the more successful members of the family did not cross the state to pay their respects.You cannot pick your relatives and we all come from the same ancestral tree and they were all very polite.This photo below is the famous Sunshine Bridge that crosses Tampa Bay.  Many years ago a barge hit one of the supports to this bridge and it was shut down for some time.Below is a photo I took in the park across the street from the art museum in the city.  It turned out pretty balanced in composition and it actually might make a nice poster...no?Florida temperatures were in the 90's and the days were very humid and we spent much time searching for shade...even at the beach.

{"title": "Stuff", "date": "Friday, June 05, 2009", "text": "Dictionary.com has over 15 definitions for the word 'stuff'.  Clearly we are lazy and use this word a lot.  Not as much a f***, but almost, being the vocabulary deprived nation that we are. On my recent visit to Nassau this store at least admits that it sells stuff by the lettering over the door.Above is someone's precious stuff that was thrown out onto the street when they could not pay rent two years ago.I have lots of non-precious stuff that should be thrown out. What is non-precious stuff? This stuff is that object that is so rare that it has remained in that dusty box at the back of the closet for years. Non-precious stuff is that very useful gizmoo that you have never used that sits in the darkest part of the kitchen drawer. Stuff is that gift you bought that you never gave away which now sits on the top shelf of your closet just waiting to be noticed once again. Stuff is that brand new hand-held appliance that costs too much to repair and would break your heart to toss away and so it sits on the garage shelf waiting for 'someday.' Stuff is that pair of shoes worn to a wedding that will never again see the light of day. Stuff are those 1,000 fishing lures carefully organized in that Tupperware container in the garage. And, if you are like me, your stuff comes with stuff. I am thinking of the 4 pieces of two-foot square 2 inch thick pure white packing Styrofoam boards that sit awaiting creative genius so that they can be made into some grandchild's project. Unfortunately, I think I packed the creative genius in one of the (unlabeled) cardboard boxes in the closet.I know that when I die my children will take most of my precious and non-precious stuff and give it away or just toss it into some landfill. I stopped buying folk art years ago because I knew I had too much non-precious stuff. While this thought of tossing bothers my husband because he is tied tightly to his stuff, I am really comfortable in knowing that I will return to dust someday and it is all just stuff!Lately, I have been (once again)  feathering my nest by adding stuff. We recently purchased some hose racks to hang our garden hoses. We just purchased two gold fish and a red waterlily for that fountain we bought last year. I also purchased several trellis stands for around the house to use on all the annual vines I am attempting to grow this year. Hubby bought a sprayer for the liquid fertilizer. We also had to buy two new cushions for the canoe and a long cushion for the patio lounge. I then purchased several new flower pots for the new deck as it was looking awfully bare.In a fit of organization we finally got around to buying some pieces of peg board and some furring strips to use in the garage so that we could actually find stuff when we needed it.We bought two new bird feeder hangers because we buried the others so carefully under brick that we cannot move them. (We try to move the feeders once a year because of salmonella issues.) We also bought another bird house to discourage the blue bird from moving into that silly little blue house without the ventilation and drainage. We failed in that attempt, of course, and we now have a brand new empty birdhouse.We had received a gift of a hammock net from our kids after our long-ago trip to Belize and I finally purchased a hammock frame that we will put together someday soon(!). I had moved one of the deck tables to the patio area so I had to purchase a new small table for the deck to replace it.The problem with all this purchasing of stuff was that I promised myself when I moved into this house, that I would start a simpler lifestyle. No more stuff! I told myself it was now time in my life to be more zen, to be more accepting of bare space.  (I had lived, quite happily I will add, for almost a year on 60 pounds of household goods delivered to my apartment overseas when was younger.  Therefore, I know I do not need much stuff.)  Having currently failed this promise to myself --- miserably, totally, agonizingly--- I promise this fall I am going through our large basement storage room and begin the process of getting rid of stuff! We have lived here almost two years and not used some of the STUFF down there at all.  Who knows, maybe we have someone else's stuff mixed in with our stuff! Next I will start on the kitchen where I have at least three of every single thing from all of my prior moves, including an entire set of cobalt blue goblets (14) that I have been unable to give away. (Pay the shipping and they are yours!)Last I will start on the closets. When there are only two of you living in a house, you take over the empty closets...all of them and fill them with more important stuff. The kind of stuff that has to stay in boxes which are never opened, so you forget what is there.Stuff will take over your life.  It will become the pack leader in compiling your list of how you want to spend your time.  I have found maintaining stuff consumes too much of my day already.  Stuff, begone, I say!This was my son's bedroom when we lived in the rental house years ago.He was trying to create a sound studio in one corner...there is way too much stuff here."},

{"title": "One Man's Meat...", "date": "Friday, May 29, 2009", "text": "Years ago when I was in junior high school my English teacher assigned me the book by E. B. White titled \"One Man's Meat.\" I read it and I am pretty sure I got an A on the book report, but for the life of me cannot remember what the book was about! I am sure it was about something very intellectually compelling because I remember I had asked to read some other book for the assignment and was assigned this one.  (The title is based on a quote with the meaning that one man's meat is another man's poison. A theme we can all understand.)Anyway, this post is a variation on that theme. It could be titled one man's cabbage is sometimes another man's/woman's weed. This post is about Aralia spinosa or what is commonly called the devil's walking stick. A blog that I have read regularly is Robert Brady's PureLand Mountain.  This blog was noted as a 'blog of interest' back in the infancy days of blogging and was one of the first blogs I started reading. Bob lives on the side of a mountain in Japan and his very well written blog is about that life. In Japan they routinely use wild plants to add richness to their diet just as we do with our wild mushrooms and fiddle head ferns in the spring. I read about his early spring search for the rare and reclusive tara-no-mein in this post .  The Bradys have to go deep into the woods to their 'secret' place to harvest this delicacy.After harvest they prepared the new spring shoots by frying them in a light batter like tempura. He followed the original post with another that discussed how he was surprised that the devil's walking stick can be found freely throughout the Eastern United States. It is not the exact same species but very close.I was clearing some weeds around some young fruit trees my husband had planted along our driveway and I discovered that I have a whole grove of these plants growing at the edge of my forest. They have sprouted from a large devil's walking stick that I kept last year not knowing what it was. The plant stalk is thorny and certainly the reason for the common name it was given. The tiny white clusters of summer flowers were so attractive to pollinators and the bouquets of hanging purple berries that appeared in early fall were so lovely, that I purposely kept the plant when I was clearing the weeds. The plant grows tall with a cape of fern-like leaves that are attractive on their own. I counted 25 of these plants along the hill falling away into the forest, yesterday. One is 8 feet high and the rest are three to four feet. Since the plant can grow to 30 feet...this grove will be interesting. I hope that I have not encouraged an invasive weed here...Now next spring I have to read up on harvest of the young shoots, as Bob says they are as valuable as caviar in Japan."},
{"title": "Thursday Thoughts #26---I Am a Very Bad Girl", "date": "Thursday, May 28, 2009", "text": "Sometimes I just can't help myself.While spending time babysitting with my grandchildren I was watching another little boy chase ducks near the playground. His smaller brother, perhaps two, was trying hard to follow but got distracted by a small mud puddle just a few feet away from me. The little guy proceeded to stomp and splash with perfect joy and abandon. The exhausted and distracted father glanced back in pain. I looked across at the young dad and said \"When was the last time you got to stomp in a mud puddle?\" I then smiled and headed for the slides.I was shopping for bubble bath the other day, and while in one of those suds and muds stores that focuses only on ones self-indulgence, the sales girl offered me the deal that if I bought 3 bottles of bubble bath I could get another 3 free! I am at the time in my life that I think 6 bottles of bubble bath a bit too much and so I said: \"Who on earth can used 6 bottles of bubble bath before their expiration date?\" Of course her trained response was to get them as gifts. I left the store with the one bottle I needed.I have been watching the chickadee go back and forth like a crazy parent feeding her little ones with insects. The house sits above one of my garden beds. I finally could not resist and stepped into the middle of the bed and peered close into the birdhouse. I saw little moving faces...how cute. But I won't do that again as the momma chickadee almost had a heart attack when she returned.When I went to pick up my vacuum and was told that the circuit board had to be replaced at a cost of $107 plus $40 in labor I actually said \"D##n!\" under my breath.When I struggled once again with the handle to my freezer and was able to snap it back on the first try I said \"Hot d##n.\" out loud in my kitchen.Last Sunday after spending two days washing windows and window screens, I did absolutely nothing all day other than read, nap, and watch some really bad movies.After grocery shopping I always step out into the yard just to 'check' on things and fifteen minutes later find I am out weeding in my good shoes and go-to-town pants. (I am such a fashion maven...you would be surprised.)I still get email from certain rather disfunctional colleagues with questions about how I handled stuff in my previous job...it has been over a year since I retired. I take my sweet old time in answering. (Why I bother, I do not know.)I have been eating waffles, whipped cream and fresh strawberries for breakfast for the last three days. BAD GIRL!I finally saw the Star Trek movie and I swear I almost cried when they brought up the theme music at the end. I am such a silly Trekkie."},
{"title": "Corners", "date": "Tuesday, May 26, 2009", "text": "Everyone needs a quiet corner or a small space that sits waiting for them at the end of the day...waiting with 'open arms.' It does not have to be a fancy place with damask and lace curtains, but it should be a quiet and clean place where one can put down their burdens and put up their feet. The corner of my recently completed patio meets that qualification during the milder weather of the year. The chairs shown are old and from my mother-in-law's Florida room many years ago. Of the original four chairs only three are left and the cushions have worn thin. The cushion colors are faded and the ties are mostly broken. The chairs do not really fit the style of the patio, but they are too useful to toss away.  They remind me of my M.O.L. who was a special and loving woman. If the cushions are not damp from a recent rain, I go out there with a good book and something to drink and perhaps my binoculars or camera and put my feet up on one of the chairs and sit back on the opposite chair and claim my corner of the world for an hour or so. (When I had toddlers the corner of respite was the guest bed when they were napping.)Do you have a corner that you can claim?"},
{"title": "Canvassing by Weary Hag", "date": "Sunday, May 24, 2009", "text": "Weary Hag posted the following questions on her blog a while back.  She has taken a respite from blogging and rarely posts anything, so I had to read this and give it a go.  Feel free to tackle and then let her know you answered.1. While typing - do you prefer classic or italics? Same answer as #2 below.2. While reading - do you prefer classic or italics?Classic always.  Italics for me is for emphasis or scientific names.3. Worst experience while blogging? [i.e. page froze, lost data, caught using dated or false info, typos - what made you gasp - even a li'l]I sent out several comments while logged in as ME.  As you may know I have a weird fear of being ‘found out.’4. Best experience while blogging? [i.e. new friendship/relationship formed, wrote a post that was just short of genius, learned new com tech skill, etc]Writing something that makes me feel good and then having one or more of the readers tell me it made them feel good as well.  Or getting compliments on how well written it was.  I am an addict for that kind of stuff.  Words are powerful when they can change feelings or help someone make it through the day.5. Let's assume you're an avid blogger - someone at an intimate dinner or party suggests that blogging is for idiots. In what way do you beat the dog meat out of them - [read: handle the situation] - if at all?I might answer that I often thought **** (you fill in the blank)  were idiots, but I now can see their side of the story.  Or perhaps I might say that blogging is so vast in scope and participants represent most of mankind, so there are no more idiots in blogland than in any other activity.  (Now twitter is another story.)6. Do you pass your blog URL out to people like sneeze molecules or do you generally keep it to yourself and your own group of mutual blog buddies?I keep it very secret and only those who stumble upon it and stay become my personal treasured readers.  ;-)7. Do you share your blog with family [children/spouse/siblings/parents] or do you deliberately keep it from them?Nope.  No one knows and when I die, I will have to leave the password in my will so that someone can let my readers know why I stopped blogging!  (Besides my family never comments on stuff I post on the family blog...why share the real me?)8. This is for those who only use a fabricated name when blogging: Do you ever wish you could tell people just exactly who you really are or are you content to remain anonymous to the masses?I am very content to remain anonymous.  I am a coward and would not be as honest a writer if people knew who I really was.9. This is for those who use their true name when blogging: Do you ever wish you had remained anonymous or are you pleased as punch to get your real self out there?See #8.10. Of these - which is your favorite genre to read in the blogging community: [choose ONLY one]:  a) how-to & advice, b) brief topics covered with a comedic edge, c) personal adventures or experiences, d) photos with captions, e) up-to-the-minute newsy type stories told with blogger's perspective or spinI really like reading all genre’s but personal experiences/adventures tend to grab me the most.11. From one to ten, when reading a blog post ... do spelling & grammar really count? (not the occasional typo). One: they don't count in the least .............. Ten: stop reading midstream and move on.I guess about a 7.  If the post is really good, I can ignore the errors.  I am a terrible speller even though I almost made straight A’s in school…hard to believe, huh?  But Blogger has a spell check so there is little excuse for that kind of sloppiness.  My grammar has gotten very sloppy and I wish Blogger had a grammar editor.12. Have you been approached to write a book or magazine article or to contribute to an existing publication in any way, solely based upon your blog? (and I don't mean by smokinbettylou or tedthetool)Hah!  Don’t I wish!13. Do you prefer the read & comment type of post or the interactive style (like this one)? I like this type once in a while.  I prefer the read and comment because it is easier to read and shoot from the hip.14. Which applies to you most often? a) I read and comment, b) I read and move along ...About 50/50.15. Are you involved in any other networking venues or is blogging your one and only? [i.e. FB, YT, MSpace, LiveJournal, Classmates, photo hosting sites, etc.] No need to name them unless you want to ... I have a family blog, I am on Facebook but rarely visit there, and have several photo sharing site(s)…but most of my computer time is just blogging here.Your turn."},
{"title": "The Non-Fixer", "date": "Thursday, May 21, 2009", "text": "In a prior post I wrote about how I fix things... at night... in bed...while I am trying to fall asleep.  In reality, I do not have a lot of talent for fixing things in the harsh light of day.The world is full of many interesting people, but I think we are we losing those all-important tinkerers. Today young men and women can work a software package, work a complicated blackberry, program a GPS, and plan a project.  But can they change their own oil?  Can they fix a clothes dryer?  Can they install a window AC?  Can they get that old rototiller running again?  Can they reset that stupid door hinge that sticks every year?  Can they take a machine apart and through examination figure out what is wrong and what can be fixed and what needs to be replaced? Of course not!  Who has the time? Who has the patience to break a nail in these stressful times.   And so our land-fills will continue to expand as we toss things that cannot be fixed.I think tinkerers are really cool people.  My 75-year-old neighbor, who was an executive for a well-know company years ago, fixes everything on the farm that he rents out.  He also rents out two trailers on this farm and repairs everything that goes wrong inside them as well.  His church loves him as he can figure out anything and fix it even if he has to take it home and work on it all weekend!  He likes the satisfaction of repairing something rather than throwing it away and replacing it by something new that is probably not as well made.My dad could fix almost anything.  He knew that we didn't have the money to buy new and so he made it work.  Both of my brothers (one who owns a small construction company and one who is a retired teacher) also have the ability and patience to fix things rather than toss them.  I did not inherit that fixing gene.This photo above is the refrigerator in my kitchen.  Perhaps in my frequency in getting access to my favorite ice cream I opened the bottom freezer too often this week and the refrigerator is trying to tell me something...the handle came off in my hand yesterday!  I got out the manual (which anal retentive Tabor filed away carefully) and read it and it does appear that one should be able to slide this handle back on the two clamps without much struggle.  It is NOT broken.  I have read the directions twice and with a Masters degree still cannot figure it out.  I am taking a deep breath and going to tackle it again later when I am more Zen.  I can still get into the freezer so there is no panic.This contrivance in the back seat of my car is my in-house vacuum cleaner.  It stopped working also earlier this week.  I unplugged, reset breakers, and reset the button on the bottom of the vac resulting in no success.  I got out the manual and researched on the Internet.  I am guessing that the starter motor on this two-year-old beast is the problem.  I called a vacuum repair place and the nice man said I really needed to bring it in if I wanted him to work on it.  He proceeded to tell me how to take it off my basement wall.  The canister had been installed about 8 feet high, and so, standing on a chair, I managed to lift this heavy piece of machinery, carry it upstairs to the garage, and battled it into the back seat of my car.  ( I may not know how to fix things, but I sure as hell lift weights and that does come in handy.)P.S.  For full disclosure, my darling husband, whom I love dearly, could not fix a squeaky hinge if his life depended on it.P.P.S.  If things do come in threes, I wonder what is next."},

{"title": "Life Story #29   - Getting There", "date": "Sunday, May 17, 2009", "text": "A number of years ago, when I knew that my daughter was close to becoming engaged and my son was close to graduating from college, and I was trying to suppress another empty-nest panic attack, I organized a family trip.  I knew this would be the last trip we might ever take with just our family of four and I wanted that time together and that memory.    We spent a week on an island called Ambergris Key in Belize.  This was before the island became so famous by being a location for the TV show Survivor.  It is (was?) a low key resort with small hotels and lots of long beaches and hole-in-wall restaurants of various quality and cost.  This first week was filled with beaching, snorkeling and bike-riding.  The second week was to be our adventure into the jungles of Belize staying at an eco-lodge.  This post is about the adventure of getting to the lodge.The airport on Ambergris Key is small and busy with various small jets shuttling tourists to and fro.  We arrived early for our 'chartered' flight inland.  We were told that no regular commercial flights went to the lodge.  After waiting 30 minutes past our departure time and seeing jets take off and land, my husband went to the charter counter and asked about the delay in our flight.  The uninterested clerk explained that our pilot was just running late.  His demeanor indicated that this lateness was usual.  We have traveled extensively and are quite familiar with the pace and attention to time as it is interpreted in other countries.  You have to go with the flow or get an ulcer.We continued to sit in the increasingly hot sunshine watching tourists while a small dented prop plane puttered up to the departure area.  It was one of those scary,  little one prop things that when you see it you wonder why anyone would place their lives on board.  Well, as I am sure you have guessed, that was our plane.It was the smallest plane any of us had every seen.  Only six seats inside and no room for much luggage.  The pilot was a tall, skinny and a scruffy representation of his profession.  He had holes in the pockets of his jeans and his greasy cap looked as though he was the mechanic for the plane, as perhaps he was.  He did not say one word to us and the only way we knew it was our flight was when the clerk indicated it was time for us to board.  The only word we heard out of \"Chuckles\" the entire flight was prior to departure  when he said, \"Vamonos!\"Tucked inside beneath gray and frayed seat belts we truly understood the expression of 'sardines in a tin can.'  Our luggage was piled unceremoniously in the back. The door on my side did not close completely and I could see about half an inch of daylight all the way around.  The take off was breathtaking.  Just the type of experience you would have if you put an airplane engine on a tin outhouse and took off with two wings and a prayer.  The noise was too loud for talk and the vibration of the plane was loosening not only my teeth fillings but kept sliding my glasses down my nose preventing me from clearly seeing all the dangers we were missing.I put on a brave face for the children although I was close to wetting my pants as we took off low over the Caye and the ocean and the open savanna.  Before we reached the jungle we entered a low hanging cloud and moisture began to form on the outside of the plane and started to spray me through the crack in the door.  I was soon quite damp in addition to being completely massaged.Eventually we made it through the cloud and I gathered my courage to look out the side window and saw we were following a river up into the jungle.   Hubby who is a social bunny (as you know from reading my blog) was attempting to use his Spanish and make small talk with the pilot who did not respond to a single thing he said.  Daughter was taking pictures of the scenery outside the moist windows and son was taking everything in including keeping an eye on the gauges in the front of the pilot as they seemed to be varying their readings rather dramatically.  I just kept very still as I was getting cold and wet and afraid any movement I made might dramatically shift the weight in the plane and alter our course for the worse.At long last, and after I felt I had aged several years, an open gravel area appeared in the jungle beneath us.  The plane began its descent as this gravel path was our landing strip.  We landed on the path in a field with squash plants on either side.  There was nothing in sight except a narrow gravel road leading somewhere off in the distance at the end of the landing strip.(In the photo above the tall skinny guy is the pilot ogling my daughter who is standing at the tale of the plane.  Do not let this photo deceive you, close up the plane was a piece of junk.)The pilot got out and opened the door on my side and indicated that we should get our luggage.  We unloaded everything and placed it on the ground.   Then without word he got back in the plane and took off into the blue sky.   The sound of the plane's engine died away in the distance and here we stood in complete and stunned silence as the jungle surrounded us.  We sat on our luggage thankful we had all our limbs and not eager to go anywhere.   There was not a sign or a single house in sight and we wondered, if like some wilderness movie, we were supposed to carry our luggage down the lone dusty road ahead.We waited for about five minutes until we finally heard the sound of a vehicle approaching. Out of the jungle a white bus appeared.  A friendly driver emerged from the bus above and helped us load our luggage.   It appeared that we had survived and now were looking forward to more jungle adventures at the lodge."},

He can stand in line waiting for tickets to the movie theater and come across an old long lost friend.  He can be picking up a cup of chai tea at a Starbucks  and meet and make a new friend.  I didn't really think about this much until I retired and I realized how low key I am in public and how energy high he is.  I am not complaining except I know that if he was in a field other than science we would be very rich by now.  He is a born salesman and if it something he believes in...look out!Years ago, my husband and I traveled to Korea for work-related activities.  During the project he actually was briefly on Korean national TV talking about the work he was doing. Later in the trip we did manage to take a few days off and play tourist.  While touring one of the historic parks in the city of Seoul we stopped in the cafeteria for some quick refreshment and were approached by the three Korean college students in the photos above.  While their accents were thick they did appear to know enough English ( and certainly more Korean than I) to communicate with us very well.  They were working on a project where they had to find people and interview them.  I think they were communication majors.Naturally they instantly decided to interview my husband instead of me.  He was the better pick as he can talk for hours on end about almost anything and when the subject is himself he can go on for days.  They wanted to know what he was doing in Korea and how long he would stay, etc.  As I look as these photos, I wonder what grade they got and if they did go on to work in television.Do you know someone with a magnetic personality?"},

I guarantee you will end up touching it up at least three times.You have reached Zen when your daughter explains that they had made too many plans to celebrate Mother's Day over the weekend, but could you come up and babysit next Tuesday?... and none of this really bothers you including not hearing from your son until Mother's Day late afternoon.I actually saw a catbird land on a stick near the bird feeder and the stick flipped and ended up 'goosing' the nearby squirrel.  That was so immature funny.You know that you are an elder when most arguments with your husband are about who forgot what.I could not remember the name of a place my hubby took me to a few months earlier and so I said \"Aren't you glad you married me for my figure and not my brain?\"  (This is funnier if you know I am mostly angles instead of curves---well maybe sorta funny.)Then this brought up a discussion of a prior girlfriend of hubby's who did have hooters and long blond hair and no brain and who actually got a degree in medicine by using those assets.  Makes you think about looking at your doctor more carefully before you choose 'her'.I am using the dog whisperer's advice on mental energy and body language and it seems to work as I was the only one that did not get head-butted by the goat at the farm we recently visited.

I have been wanting to do this for a number of years, but always put it off. It probably won't start until fall.  Now I have no excuses.  While signing up I met the instructor and asked him if there were bee keepers who needed places to leave their hives.He smiled indulgently and explained that most beekeepers will charge you to keep their hives on your property as it is a lot of work to maintain the hive.    I mumbled something about  just trying to keep the honey bees population strong.He continued by saying that the honey bee is not indigenous to our area ( I think they were brought over from Europe) and they end up competing with a number of natural pollinators such as the solitary bees, the fly that looks like a bee and a number of pollinating wasps.    There are about 4000 species of pollinators in the U.S.   Clearly he saw honey bee colonies as an agricultural invader for woodlands.  While they are important for agricultural crops, they are not important for gardens.I had not thought about honey bees in this way, and now like many environmental causes/fads, I must re-think this.We ended up buying the \"solitary bee house\" shown in the photo above, which probably was not needed unless I am detracting the carpenter bees from the wood in my house!   And yes, an idiot can make this in 30 minutes.  Is my face red!"},

{"title": "You Will Not Leave Orlando Alive:  The Rest of the Story", "date": "Thursday, May 07, 2009", "text": "Our recent Disney Cruise was better than I had hoped, but as I indicated the departure was more adventurous than we had anticipated. (Get some coffee as this is a looong story.)I will begin with the facts. There were 14 of us on the trip:  5 grandparents, 4 parents and 5 children. One set of the grandparents and all other parents and children were staying on in Orlando for a few days. We and another grandmom had flights out the day the cruise ship docked. The New Jersey grandmother's flight was mid-day and ours was 5:00 PM.The traveling grandparents had hoped to catch an earlier standby flight, so at 9:00 we headed for the airport in our two vans, one of which was rented, and both packed to their brims (and overflowing) with luggage and children in car seats.Arriving at the airport, we said our goodbyes to the various folks in the two vans and gathering baggage the three of us headed to the ticket line. It was VERY long, but when we told the airline personnel that all three of us were looking to grab earlier flights she moved us to the very head of the priority check-in line! We all got checked in as standbys and we separated from the other grandmother who was flying to another city and then headed to the security.Things started to unravel while standing in another long line at security when my hubby remembered he had forgotten his small black bag in one of the vans. It had his cell phone, day planner, etc. Our kids were flying out in three days so we guessed that they could check it or carry it for us on their flight. We couldn't call anyone because my cell phone was dead and I had forgotten my charger. While waiting in line, hubby realized he also had his car keys to our big car in that bag.  A small sour fear emerged as we saw ourselves arriving at our airport and not being able to get into our car?  In a panic we left our place in line and found an Internet access place and tried to send an email to daughter but remembered her blackberry was also out of power. We would try to email my S.O.L., but after logging into my hubby's email, realized we did not have the S.O.L.s email address in the email address folder. (All this time the little money charger is ticking away at the bottom of the screen making us even more irritated and panicked.) I tried to log into my email, but realized my provider had required a recent change to the password and I couldn't remember exactly what I had changed it too since I auto log-on from my home PC. The little counter like a deranged clock was continuing to tick away...$2.00---$5.00---$9.00!!Then some of hubby's brain cells activated their cell connections and he exclaimed \"MAZDA!\" I looked at him and realized that the car we had parked at the airport was the smaller one and I did have the keys to THAT car.  We stopped the ticker.We got back in what was now an even longer security line. While standing there, hubby pulled out his passport with the standby ticket inside and immediately realized he did not have his driver's license! He had used it at check-in and at the pre-gate...where was it? Again we pulled all of our bags out of the security line--we were getting so good at this-- as he ran across the airport and back to the first check-in area. The day was moving on without us and it was almost noon. The security lines were now snaking their way into the empty spaces in front of the stores as huge crowds were leaving Orlando. Finally, after fifteen minutes had passed, hubby returned, sweat dotting his brow, and with driver's license in hand! By now all hope of going stand-by on the only two prior and fully booked flights was nil. We decided to eat an early dinner at the Outback Steakhouse in the terminal and then head for our gate. We boarded our flight without further incident  (after all we had arrived at the airport 8 hours early)...BUT the gods of travel were not done screwing around with our family just yet.The rest of our group that had stayed on in Orlando left three days later. Two groups of parents and children were flying out and the grandparents were driving their car back up north with most of the baggage. As my daughter's family was the last to check out of the resort she noticed a medium black bag remaining in the apartment. She checked and found this was the bag of the OTHER grandfather that had now been forgotten. (What is it with grandfathers anyway??) The bags owner was eating breakfast not far from the area and using her husband's cell daughter called them about it. They asked if she and their son could drop it off on their way to the airport. Since daughter's family was running only 10 minutes behind, they did so (!).Well, needless to say, that ten minutes was the most important ten minutes of the entire trip. The lines on Sunday afternoon at Orlando airport are phenomenal. Upon finally getting through security daughter and S.O.L.  grabbed toddlers, bags and all and ran to the gate arriving 10 minutes before departure and finding the airline policy was the gate closed at 10 minutes before and absolutely no boarding was allowed after that. (It was in the small print on the ticket and this is how they meet their departure times.) Yes, they had missed their flight and the airline was not sympathetic to their problem.My daughter is a whiz at blackberrying and using her husband's device she tried everything to get a flight. Nothing was available until the following day and she ABSOLUTELY had to be at work on Monday.So they called the grandparents who were driving home and explained their problem. These grandparents, who were now two hours north of Orlando, turned the car around and picked up the family of four and all of their luggage and crammed everything into the now overstuffed van. One would think that the day had been saved...but this was not so.Outside of St. Augustine the van broke down. Smoking and belching strange smells it came to a complete stop beside a very busy highway and far from anywhere.Now the scenario involved calling for a tow truck, taking the van to a garage, and since the van parts would not arrive until the next day, checking into a hotel for the night. The greater problem was that the tow truck driver could only take two of them leaving the rest with small children beside a busy highway. Well, this would not work for daughter who ABSOLUTELY has to be at work on Monday--I think I mentioned that.  So, daughter and family spent busy time calling for a rental car and ended up driving non-stop all day and all night to their home. Arriving exhausted they unload the car and returned it and she headed into work ...an hour late...but where she was supposed to be.Kind of takes the rest and relaxation part out of the vacation doesn't it? (Long story, and I didn't even tell you about the canceled flight and plane mechanical issue on the replacement plane that the other family had to deal with at the START of the vacation!)"},
{"title": "Are you rich?", "date": "Monday, May 04, 2009", "text": "I am not going to write about richness of one's soul here, but actual money rich.I have just spent a week at a nice resort on Hilton Head Island.  Lots of rich people live and vacation there.I grew up poor and have blogged about that in the past.  I wasn't Dolly-Parton-poor, but close.  There were five kids and only one blue-collar income, so we became masters at stretching the dollar.  Food was in abundance from the garden and small farm, but everything else was make-do.  I knew we were poor, but many in our small community were in the same boat.  In spite of this income level, my parents were able to send all five of us to college and 4 of us graduated.  We all became successful in our own ways and one of us (maybe two)  (not I) is a millionaire.I have never seen myself as rich, but as comfortable and middle class.  Yesterday in a conversation with my son-in-law he said that he admired that we were conservative people even though we were rich.  (Both he and my daughter make six figure incomes, so I was certainly surprised that he saw us that way.)And yet, I guess if I think about it, by many standards we are rich.  Our house is finally paid for, we have a steady retirement income--small but one of us is indexed!  We have health insurance.  Our 401ks have shrunk by 50%, but we can actually survive without them if we live like a normal retired couple.  Due to this recession we won't have the international travel we had dreamed about, but we are not like some in worrying about health bills or other important issues.We also have many small luxuries we could cut if needed as inflation will certainly rear its ugly head when the piper must be paid.  Yep, we are rich.This last photo was taken from our bedroom at the resort.  If you click on the photo you will see why I was taken by the body language of the middle-aged couple in the lounge chairs.  Being rich has its price and this photo may tell part of that story."},

Here is something to keep my garden converts busy.Tabor's Bak choi soupHeat about 2 teaspoons curry powder, two or three star anise and 1/4 cup chopped onion in a little oil in a dutch oven or medium to large saucepan.   Do not over-heat or burn spices. Add to this:One quart chicken broth, a bunch of chopped fresh basil, a dash of chili pepper (or lots depending on taste), some freshly ground nutmeg, salt to taste, a huge bunch of chopped bok choi, and any other vegetable that you like (edamame, edible podded peas or frozen peas come to mind).  When the bak choi is tender add one half can of coconut milk  (stir to blend fats and milk - you can add the whole can if you are not into good health).  Heat gently until steaming.   (This is also good if you add fresh oysters or small parts of cooked chicken, but is not necessary.)  Add water or white wine to taste.  Wine can curdle the milk so do not add too much.  You can try to find the star anise and remove since it is not edible.Serve with fresh basil, fresh bean sprouts, and/or fresh cilantro for toppings and perhaps some nice warm garlic bread.Eat slowly as I do not know when I will have time to get back here!"},

We have a lovely three bedroom reserved and no one who has time to share with us!  So sad.  We will rattle around and maybe sleep in a different bedroom each night! Two days before we departed the yard clean-up included harvesting oak leaf lettuce and the remaining pak choi from the garden.  I was washing huge heads of pak choi that had turned juicy and green from the recent rains.  It was like the dance of spring watching sprays of water go everywhere across deep green broad leaf abundance.  We also have bunches of oak leaf lettuce that is ready to eat along with the delicious arugula.   We will be gone for a week and did not want this abundance to go to waste.  Fortunately there is a nearby church group that gives away food and we have packed two large boxes of these healthy vegetables and taken them there.I cannot begin to explain how wonderful I feel that something that has been a labor of love for me, is healthy sustenance for someone else.I do not have a laptop, so unless hubby brings his, I will not be blogging  until I return.  This is a pre-planned post and I am hoping as I write this that the North Carolina fires (a similar experience to our trip last year) will not be a problem in our travel.  It is somewhat hard for me to get into another vacation mode when I know there are people who are losing their homes.I will be visiting one of my favorite places, Pinckney Island Nature Preserve, and taking bird pictures.  Some I am sure I will post on my other blog.  Also plan to eat at least once in Savannah!  This will be our first visit here without family, so the only negotiating will be over the number of canoe trips and the number of beach sits!"},

{"title": "It's All About the Hair", "date": "Saturday, April 18, 2009", "text": "The first is a photo of my hair color about 5 years ago.The second is the color I took with me on the cruise,but I could not seem to getthe color true in this photo.Several years ago when my husband was traveling in Korea with a business friend he noticed a number of young Korean women and commented on how lovely their hair was swinging in the sun.  (He has always been a bit of a hair man and almost divorced me when I cut my long swinging hair in my 30's.)  The Korean friend added that, since these ladies were at their sexual peak, their shiny hair was what caught a young man's eye.We talk about breasts and hips and luscious lips, but hair is a big deal.   They even made a a song about it.\"Gimme head with hairLong beautiful hairShining, gleaming,Streaming, flaxen, waxen\"The health and shine of hair is noticeable in all animals.  The shiny coat of hair means more than beauty, it means the ability to reproduce. (And for those of you who read my other blog this truth also translates to the brilliant new spring feathers...which are the avian version of hair.)Age is cruel to mankind and womankind.  It causes us to lose our hair so that it no longer swings in beauty but sits lightly on top like errant peach fuzz.  Aging takes away the color and peroxides our follicles until they are sooty gray.  Some elders are rewarded with a mane of striking silver white...but most of us settle for something far less.  Our hair becomes dry and brittle and thin.  Only the last word - thin - is used when talking about how sexy and attractive someone is.The familiar term 'crowning glory' intimates the power that great hair can have.  Female news correspondents and female politicians spend at least part of their career defending their hair style choices or trying to ignore the hair comments of critics and stay on subject.  (Jane Pauley and Katie Couric are just two that come to mind.)  It is hard to let go of this power that hair has over a woman (or a man).I started to gray in my 40's and began with a semi-permanent coloring and like most addicts switched to the hard stuff as the years went by.  When keeping the silver roots at bay became a major effort, I started the familiar, time consuming, expensive, and hard on the hair follicle process of 'highlighting.'  Upon my retirement I admitted to myself that I was not a high maintenance woman in most areas of my life, and therefore, I no longer needed to pretend that I looked better than I did.  I stopped dying my hair.This was painful.  I mean really painful.  I aged instantly and instantly lost the drama that is much of my persona.  After four months of this I asked my hair dresser to try a glaze to see if I could at least have a shine.  That worked...sort of.  But it was still too blah in color.  A week before the cruise she suggested a temporary charcoal rinse that would blend everything and covered the highlighted ends.  This worked, because I was gently gray and had drama once again.  But the rinse slowly washed out and my true gray returned, and as a last resort, I went in and asked for a pixie haircut.  Something perky, spiky, flirty and young.  That helped.  It was much easier to care for and it did make me look less dumpy.  (Right, I know most women do not want to settle for 'less dumpy'.)It has been about 6 months since I started this whole madness and I now have bright silver peaking through at my temples.  I am going to see if I can live with this a little longer if I have silver hair!  I will wait through until fall leaving my hair just as it is.  Then if I can't stand it, I will go back to dying it.  I hate so much being a shallow gal, but in some ways I guess I just might be. (On a positive note, several people loved the pixie haircut and said it made me look much younger and didn't seem dismayed by my grayness.)"},
{"title": "Have You Seen Peter Pan?", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2009", "text": "This is a photo of our ship taken from the highest pointon Nassau during our one-day visit.Four nights and five days cruising the Caribbean with Disney can leave one a little overwhelmed.  Too tired and overstimulated to write anything of depth I will briefly describe for those who want to try this adventure someday.These ships don't 'cruise' on all days.  On some days they go in circles just outside the shipping lanes very slowly to make you think you are moving somewhere.  If you don't believe me, watch currents and sun angles on your next cruise.  (And you can also test one of the navigators as we did and they will admit to you are just moving around.)Even though Disney \"owns\" the Disney Island, other than the free food,  the cost of everything else from bicycles, snorkeling gear, cold drinks delivered to your chair, etc. is VERY MUCH like being on any other resort island.Every event on the cruise is all about being in the party mood and if I hadn't had small children along, I might have felt a bit too pressured to be happy!Yes, that is a new mother hovering over the table with the\"Drink of the Day\"and...no I did not have to wear one of these.Every cruise has a safety drill and it occurs before the drinking and partying.  The deck where the lifeboats were stored ended up being my favorite place as it had a nostalgic old world feel complete with shuffleboard.The cheapest rooms on the cruise (which we had booked) are very nice, clean and more roomy than I anticipated.Disney is the master of service and the staff are almost Stepfordish in their pleasant demeanor, efficiency in service and pretending they are interested in every little thing you have to say about your trip...sort of reminds me of my dog years ago.The live theater shows are wonderful and free and I think as good as any Broadway play although only an hour long.  Lots of great talent.The food is reasonably good, but I have very high standards, and when you are trying to feed 2,700 people it does get to taste a little like cafeteria food after a while, even if they are serving you lobster bisque or rum baba.Your wait staff follows you from restaurant to restaurant---assigned seating in the evenings---so they get to know your preferences and demands really well.  Most of them are from countries other than the U.S.  We had a girl from Belgium (although she was Vietnamese) and a man from Thailand.  Our room staff was from Indonesia and the Philippines.  Most of the staff at the cruise director level were from Australia although we met one fellow from France.  It is a small world after all.The last morning of the cruise prior to disembarkation (this is how you talk when you have been on a cruise) they had scheduled us for a 6:45 A.M. breakfast.  One could always go to the top deck buffet if they wanted and some of our party of 13 did that.  Some of us were drug along whether we wanted to go or not.  Below is my grand daughter who woke up at 4:00 and whom I brought to our bed.  Getting her dressed at 6:30 was an Herculean task.  I got the diaper off and changed but had to give up on the dress!The title of this post was due to Xman meeting Wendy on the first day and her sending him on the mission to find Peter Pan.  A mission asked by a beautiful girl is taken very seriously by a small boy.  He met lots of characters.Would I do it again?  Perhaps.  It was much more pleasant than I thought, but I think much of this is due to having small children with which to interact.  And there was also plenty of areas on the boat or the beach to get away from all the little ones.  Disney is also the master of programming activities for all ages including teenagers.(Unfortunately, while we enjoyed the entire trip, the time in the airport before we headed home is definitely blog-worthy of a future \"life story blog\" as it was a comedy of errors that had nightmarish proportions.)It is good to be home!"},

I have pre-scheduled this post so you don't forget me.  I look forward to reading your comments when I get back.It seems to me that the more popular blogs are those where people post their true identity and their actual pictures.  I think we are more comfortable reading about someone we know is real and then it seems more honest because they show us who they are and tell us where they live either generically or more specifically.  They are up front with us and we like that.I think I commented once on my blog about my need for anonymity as I blog.  I comment about relatives and friends and want the freedom to say exactly what is in/on my mind and not feel I have to couch terms to avoid hurt feelings or misunderstandings.  A reader of my blog might think I do not say anything too controversial about others that I know, and perhaps they are right.  But I still like to be able to write whatever I feel at the time.  While I might be a liberal in many areas I am rather conservative in terms of my privacy.  I really don't need those I love/dislike to know I am going through a down time or having second thoughts about decisions in my life.  But it gives me pleasure to post this personal journal for my loyal blogger friends to comment on. (As Colleen writes \"Things I would not tell anyone, I tell the public.\" ~ Michel de Montaigne.\")There are other reasons why I do not blog more honestly.  While I admire those who are 'out there' in all truth with their identities, I am a bit of a worry wart.  I fear that being able to learn much about my grand-children from reading this blog could give a lurking pedophile an edge up on contacting them and becoming friends.  Carefully reading several years of posts can give a good detective many clues about an identity.  Sure, the odds are stupendous that this would happen.  (Really, Tabor, how many people do you think actually read your blog?)Also, I worry that telling others when I am on travel is like putting a sign up for lurkers who can find my house and take advantage of it.  It is just like the community/church newsletter where people put in comments about their trips AFTER they return.I guess the thought is always in the back of my mind that whatever you blog can end up on the front pages of the major newspaper.   People have lost jobs, gotten divorced and even committed suicide due to something published on their or another's blog. This process is not as private as we tend to think, and unfortunately, people are not as nice as we like to think.When ML came to visit last winter on her book promotion tour, I had to reveal my honest name and email so that she could stay with us.  But that was no problem as I am not hiding my identity from my readers, just those millions of lurkers out there.  (Yes, I repeat, probably very few lurk at my blog...but it only takes one crazy person.)Therefore, I will continue to remain a mysterious woman of culture and education and sensitivity!Now that I think of it, this post might be a story-line for the Butler and Bagman Chronicles.  Although he would make it funny and sexy while I seem to be making it sad and scary.(I wonder if I am getting seasick right now....?)"},

One is a biology major and one an accounting major...can you guess which is which?My son was at the birthday party and when we hugged good-bye he told me he loved me! OMG was I in heaven for days.This big party for my favorite 4-year-old's birthday was a bowling party where they used regular bowling balls and no one broke a toe or mashed anything! I don't recall any strikes being made either. Kind of gives you a feel for this recession when they allow 4-year-olds to drop bowling balls on these nice alleys.A new experience for me was having a 4-year-old I didn't know sit in my lap at the birthday party while I pushed the accelerator and he did the driving on a video game at the bowling alley. We wiped out a ton of stuff!I had Xman the first three days after his party down at the house and am totally wiped...!4-year-olds cannot eat at the table or play games on the computer unless all four appendages are moving around like crazy at all times. This leads to your dinner plate being moved while you are eating as the table slides away and your computer DVD loader opening and closing as little toes keep kicking the button!! You have to be a pretty sharp grandparent to keep up. (I learned the last day, if you are eating at a small drop leaf table, this toe tapping leads to the drop leaf dropping and Xman's entire plate hitting the floor and shattering into a half dozen pieces!)I taught Xman about collecting colored rocks on the beach and putting them in his pocket. He asked if I was sure he could put rocks in his pocket and I said \"SURE, always!\" (I am a sneaky little grandma.)We also were the first for the new season to have him take off his shoes and socks and walk on the beach and actually wade in the cold bay water. He loved it.I made a promise to hubby that I was no longer going on international trips just because others wanted me to, and instead, my money was being saved for my next big trip in the coming year to somewhere I really wanted to go. But recently I have been asked to fly to South America to babysit grandchildren for a wedding over Thanksgiving (on my dime of course) and my SIL wants me to join them on their annual trip to Denmark this fall. I love them both and am going to have the courage to say 'no.'

Sage green moss on the trees grabbed each birdsong and tucked it away before it escaped too far into the woods.My yard has become a sponge full of water and weeps rivulets into the ravine that gently flow down past the tangle of vines on an ancient journey toward the river.The daffodils are the only ones willing to open their sunny faces in the gray dawn.  They are like little flashlights under the distant trees.A deep smokey mist has carpeted the air and hidden the details of spring from us all.  It hangs gently over the river making halos of the lights that glow on the distant docks. I breathe more carefully waiting for the dawn.And then dawn breaks and the chatter of birds starts slowly and soon becomes a deafening orchestra.  It is as if they can sing the fog away with their lilting calls and refrains.  The geese add bawdy brass notes, as if, even they, are glad to see the duck weather dissipate.I gather my energy as I know the day will reward with lime green plants and weeds racing up in their joy to finally see the sun again."},
{"title": "It's a Spring Thing", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2009", "text": "While I realize it is bad Karma and so anti-Zen and certainly not Feng Shui and definitely expensive to put up this deer fence, my greatest love in retirement it to plant stuff and watch it grow.  Therefore the front yard is now completely enclosed from deer.  (Don't get me started on how raccoons, fox, possums, and squirrels can climb this netting and now rabbits can dig under.  My first battle is with the deer.)The fence is done and the gates are up and the young man who assisted told us this little space beneath the gate that appeared due to the drop of the side yard was too large and deer would crawl under and get in.  So now we have to come up with an attractive looking guard to cover this area.  I guess I have seen deer duck beneath deadfall in the woods.I removed one of the plastic owls from the dock and brought it back to the deck to see if that would discourage Don Quixote from taping at the bottom of this door which leads to our bedroom.  Jury is still out on that.  Hubby did catch him tapping at the very top of the window the other morning avoiding the bottom of the door.The yellows are abundant including these hardy dandelions in the far yard by the woodpile.  I learned by watching in Yellowstone National Park that brown bears love to eat these flowers in the spring. (Please click on the above photo for a real sunshine experience.)And finally I must mention the true sign of spring for which I have no photo, thank goodness.  When I opened the front door to call my husband to dinner I caught him standing in the vegetable garden in muddy clothes with shovel in hand and a stupid smile on his face staring off in to the woods on the other side of the fence.  He broke his reverie to tell me I had to come outside and see what he saw.  What, I asked, unwilling to put on shoes to cross the yard for something that would amaze his mind.He looked up and called back,\"Want to come see a pair of rabbits mating?\" Having a daughter who had raised lops as a child I had seen enough of rabbit mating to last a lifetime, but he explained that what had caught his eye was their play behavior.  They were cavorting and turning somersaults and chasing each other around the ravine, and acting really crazy --- not consummating.Yep, spring seems to turn all minds to mush."},

{"title": "Life Story #26---Dealing with Madmen", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2009", "text": "Art requires angst doesn't it?.  How many artists are also crazy and need that craziness to feed their art?    This table missing the glass top and carved from the base of a hollow tree was carved by a Micronesian wood carver named Baris and is a beautiful example of the island art of woodcarving.  Baris was a crazy man.  He was about 45 years of age and was large and muscular with a shaved head, unusual for Micronesians, and this gave him a striking appearance.  He also spent a lot of time in and out of \"prison\" on Palau.  He was known at the town rapist.  This term was used by the locals as if saying he was the town undertaker or the town drunk.  It was something he did and he sometimes ended up in jail for it.  The jail was a joke in itself in that it was a concrete block building with a three foot high barbed wire fence around the outside.  If he needed to run an errand while under arrest they would let him out into the small village for the day.His sister lived in a tin-roofed grass house across the dirt street from our apartment building and so we would see him there on occasion and that is how we came to buy the table from him one afternoon.Imagine being the young age of 28, married only a few years, and living oceans away from home  and those I knew on an island in the Pacific Ocean.  Our weekends were spent sailing on a lime green Hobie Cat or SCUBA diving or shell collecting on the fringing beaches or just lying around naked and watching the crabs look for shell houses on the sand of a remote beach.  Exotic, no?  And all true, at least for one side of the story.The other side as I have written before involved lack of running water and/or electricity for days at a time in a crowded apartment in the jungle.  Learning to cook strange seafood and regularly scavenging for any type of fruit or vegetable other than bananas and taro root at the market were other activities.But when you are young such hurdles do not diminish your enthusiasm for living, and so we decided to bring another life into this exotic lifestyle we were leading.  I flew to the United States to give birth, because along with its lack of sanitation, the island hospital's interior design included bolt cutters hanging high on the wall across from the entry which I was told were used for removing spears from the bodies of natives. I do not think they were joking if you will remember my life story #3.After my beautiful daughter was born I returned via Guam to Palau when she was about 6 weeks old.  I was nursing her and so didn't have to deal with all the sanitation issues and expense of formula feeding.  By the time she was two months old she was sleeping through the night, so I was surprised to be awakened by her cries late one evening.  I was alone in the apartment as my husband was off-island somewhere at the time.  I hurried to her room and as I calmed her by feeding her I then heard our local dog which slept outside on the cement porch begin to bark  in panic.  Had he been barking all along and I didn't hear him because of her cries?  This barking was also unusual, so holding my daughter close to my breast I peeked between the lanai blinds of the kitchen window.All the expatriates in the apartment complex left their porch lights on to ward off 'whatever'  or perhaps for an artificial sense of security.  I looked into the harsh light and saw Baris stomping up and down the length of the porch past the four apartment doors.  He was obviously drunk and acting very delirious.  Fortunately our dog was not his focus of attention.  The combined anger of Boris and the anxiety of the dog brought me instant panic.  I held my daughter close to my breast and felt very very vulnerable.  I went back to her room in the dark and closed the door.I sat in the rocker in her room and nursed her in the dark feeling she must be getting a sour curdled repast as my heart continued to rise into my throat.  I felt helpless in terms of a defense if Baris decided to break down my door.  The chaos went on for what seemed like fifteen minutes and then I heard another man's voice talking with loud bursts in Palauan.  There was a choppy exchange of words with the dog still providing a chorus of angry barks now joined by another local dog.   Then instantly there was silence.  I sat and rocked for ages in the deafening quiet  imagining a dead body on my doorstep and did not put my daughter back down in her crib until I could see the dawn breaking through the curtains.I made some tea and waited for the daylight.  Just one more day in paradise.(There was no body and no blood at my doorstep...just a little sleeping dog.)"},
{"title": "Luck of the Irish", "date": "Tuesday, March 17, 2009", "text": "Yes, I should have posted this  little story yesterday, but being retired I didn't.    My husband is part Irish (also some Scot and English) and he definitely has the luck of the Irish.    He is the one who stands in the fastest moving line at the store, wins the door prize at the charity events, and has the closest parking place open up just before he gets there.I, on the other hand, have to work hard at my luck. This past Saturday was different.I had headed out to the drugstore to buy more milk for my thirsty grandchildren and to pick up a few other things.  I also had to stop by the drugstore and see if there was a toy or two that I could bring home to the little ones, being the spoiler that I am.  When I reached the drugstore I saw that the lot was full of cars and I had to squeeze carefully between two large vans to get one of the few remaining places.The weather was cold and gloomy and I darted between the raindrops toward the front door following another grandmother with her little granddaughter.  Once inside, I found a 'Cars' model that Xman did not have and I found a cute little plastic Dora for Sha.  The lines were long at the  register, but I waited patiently.When I finally got back outside I noticed that most of the parking lot had cleared and my car was one of only two or three left in the lot.  I hurried to the drivers side and just as I opened the car door, I noticed a five dollar bill lying at my feet on the pavement.  It was well worn, but just sitting there grinning up at me.  I picked it up and looked around to see if anyone was near and also to see if this was some 'candid camera' incident.  I never find lost money!  (Well, there was that one time, but that is another story.)I stuffed the bill in my bag and got into the car and backed out.  As I pulled forward passing all the empty parking spaces I noticed more 'paper' fluttering gently across the pavement at the far end of the lot before the exit.  I stopped my car at a crazy angle and got out to collect quite a few bills scattered across the pavement.I collected the money, looked up and around and saw no one outside, and got back in the car and pulled into an empty parking space and counted my find.  $106.00!  Yes, I was happy to find this money, but I am a Puritan deep inside and I knew this much money might mean much more to the someone who lost it.  The money was lost at a distant end of the parking lot, quite a ways from any store.  I sat in the car for 5 minutes waiting to see if someone came out of the drugstore or returned their car to the lot and appeared to be looking for something.  But no one appeared, and after the last car left the lot, so did I.I headed home and now must think of something 'good' to do with this windfall."},

When I was younger it was easier to throw off stuff that happened that was emotional without pondering and move on to the many activities of my day ahead and only look back on the event after weeks when the wounds of the event had healed.Yesterday after spending the weekend with the grandchildren we got ready to leave for home and Xman hugged his grandfather goodbye and then refused to hug me and with an evil grin ran into the next room to play.  We had had a wonderful weekend together, so his obstinacy was not understood.  I tried to be an adult and not let my feelings be hurt by this and gathered my coat and bag.  I kissed my little grandaughter good bye and she was full of wet sloppy kisses and sweet smiles.We headed for the door upstairs and as we all gathered for one last adieu the little gal threw herself on the floor and began wailing.

{"title": "The JOY!", "date": "Thursday, March 12, 2009", "text": "Sorry, but this is not about what someone reading the title might be thinking.   It is about changes in the American diet. (Well, guess that lost 99% of the readers, you idiot.)When I was first married and knowing that I would be moving to a remote island in the Pacific Ocean, one of the first things I purchased as my own wedding gift was the cookbook \"Joy of Cooking.\" I was going to be on my own for most of the cooking and needed some good tools.  Most Americans know that this is one of the bibles of cooking and a good basic guide when learning to cook.  Its first edition appeared in 1936 and I have been made aware that there is at least a 2006 edition; obviously a very popular cookbook written by a mother, who has since died, and her daughter.  My well-worn edition of 849 pages covers entertaining, hors d-oeuvre, cereals, brunch/lunch, sauces and gravies, stuffings, meats and seafoods, desserts, preserving, freezing, canning and everything in between.What made me think of this classic a reader might ask...the one reader who is still reading.  I also subscribe to Consumer Reports On Health newsletter and was made aware of the following information by the editor:A February study \"compared the calories in recipes from the 1936 edtion of Joy of Cooking with those for the same dishes ranging from chicken a la king to beef stroganoff and brownies, researchers found an average calories increase of 63 percent per serving.  \"We attribute about a third of the increase to changes in serving size,\" Brian Wansink, Ph.D., lead researcher of the study, said in a telephone interview.  For example, while a pasta recipe called for a half-cup serving in 1936, the serving size was two-thirds of a cup in 2006.\"The editor's note goes on to say that use of high calories ingredients, such as the addition of nuts and raisins to the brownie recipe added the rest of the calories.This lead researcher has recently written a book titled \"Mindless heating:  Why we Eat More Than We Think.\"I will never lose these last 10 pounds as everything is stacked against me it appears.  Repeat after me:  I will be more mindful of everything I eat."},
{"title": "Dischordant Harmony", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "text": "Sweetmango wrote a post about how we must learn to live with nature and not try to transform or fight its natural flow.  This is true and good advice, except for those of us who are gardeners.  Our entire mission is to transform the soil, the light, the day length, and the habits of the natural enemies of each and every plant we place in the ground.  We try to do this as organically as possible, but it is still an unnatural effort on our part to manipulate nature to meet our goals.We were teased with a brief respite from the cold weather over the weekend and into early this week.  Temperatures were 70F (21C) which is very inviting.  We moved dirt to beds, added compost to beds, finished retaining walls, weeded (yes they are already peaking above the soil in the flower beds and strawberry beds), finished a wire fence around the vegetable garden (my hands are cut and bruised from twisting wire ties), finished tacking the rest of the wire to the ground and out about 8 inches to discourage diggers, finished the gate to the garden, planted pak choi, swiss chard, broccoli, arugula etc. into the raised beds, made two temporary greenhouse covers, hauled many wheelbarrows of landscape brick and sand to border the new flower bed, transplanted a few indoor plants, moved the citrus trees to the deck (temporarily) and welcomed a hot shower or bath to ease weary muscles at the end of each exhausting day.My fingernails still have dirt under them after a long soak.All this energy spent but in one accident of nature (a wayward deer or groundhog, a strong wind, a flooding rain, a very hard freeze), most of these cool weather plants can easily 'bite the dust' if you pardon the pun.The deer fence goes in tomorrow and it will be interesting to see if this expense does reduce the tick population and the grazing decimation by deer.  Today we saw five of them in the ravine eating the new growth on the wild roses which are considered an invasive species.  So they do have a good purpose in the spring when they graze.Is there a point to this ramble, you may ask?In the photo above is a stray arugula plant that found a home just outside the garage door in the black gravel of the driveway last fall.  We walked on this volunteer frequently and most likely drove over some of it at times.  Yet, it lasted until the first freeze.  My point is that nature is very mercurial and while we think we can control it the joke is on us."},

Some become like a brother or sister.  When I first started blogging I went to Gene's blog and after reading his funny and somewhat shocking post (as were all of his posts) I started to leave my first comment.  When I found that I was going to be number 36 or 38 or whatever, I almost didn't post anything.  I figured he was so popular...who would read down that far?I am glad I posted anyway, because he told me he was glad I had commented and that I should never feel bad about being the last to post.  Throughout the years there was a little contest among his readers about who would be the first to comment on a post.  I continued to read his blog after that.  He was sometimes a little shocking for me, but always with a great sense of humor.  He was like that relative you love who always has to tell a dirty joke at Thanksgiving dinner just to see the reaction.  Yet, he would return and comment on my blog at various times with a joke or encouragement.I reviewed his blog on my blog roll comments  posts when I used to do that before my blogs-I-follow list got so long.He passed away yesterday and I will miss him as if he was my good friend.    Oddly, I had just visited his blog yesterday in hopes that he would be back in good blog form.

There are enough critics out there and I disagree with most of them, and besides, everyone has different tastes in movies.  BUT...!After hubby and I dropped off the grandchildren to their respective day care facilities we headed to the big shopping mall, the one we had not visited since before the winter holidays.  We bought some expensive tea, some books and CDs on sale and I bought a blouse that I am now thinking of returning.OK enough about shopping...we were just killing time anyway in very expensive way waiting for our matinee movie to start.We wanted to see what all the hoopla was about Slumdog Millionaire and bought two tickets.  I got a discount as it seems I am now a senior citizen for this theatre!  A week-day matinee with senior discount is probably the cheapest I will ever see a movie.  We went straight to the theater and I left my coat on the seat next to my husband and told him I had to visit the ladies room and made a quick dash before the show started.When I returned he was watching the previews.  These should have given us a clue as they were all pretty serious movies.   Once they were done, we realized we were in the wrong theater as we saw that this theater was showing Gran Torino.  Hubby quickly left and checked the other theaters and returned telling me we should have been in the theater next door.  By the time he got back I was not in the mood for leaving.I am so glad that I did not leave.  I really enjoyed this movie.  It is tight, extremely well directed, Clint Eastwood develops a great over the top character with fatal flaws, and they do not stereotype the Catholic priest, which is unusual.  Most of the characters like those in Slumdog Millionaire are foreign and not ones you would recognize.  They are given dimension in being  good guys and bad guys. This and the authentic look of the setting in Michigan is what makes the movie so real and so interesting.Maybe I liked it because I could identify with the challenges of aging, but I don't think it is that simple.I was crying by the end...but sad movies always make me cry."},

Beginning as an early reader at 3, I took my favorite books everywhere with me in place of a security blanket.I was thinking about all the places that I have read to myself and/or others both silently and out loud.  I have read at the kitchen table (but not when others are there), I have read on the backyard deck, in the living room, in front of the TV, in bed, on the toilet,  in the bathtub, on boats, in the canoe, in cars  (but not when moving as I get carsick), in a tent, beside rivers, on many beaches, beside many swimming pools, in a number of hotel lobbies, in my grandchildren's beds, in their rocking chair, in front of a classroom, on stage, backstage, in front of the computer (natch), on the dock, in a plane, on a train, in front of a fire (struggling in the dim light to see), under a table, at a park, in my garden, at an ice rink, in a ski lodge (but NOT on the ski lift), in a church, resting on a dog, under a clothes line (much to my mother's dismay---I was supposed to be hanging clothes.), in a stadium, at a bull fight in Spain (avoiding watching the fight), behind a barn, inside a barn, under a tree, in a book store, at a restaurant, at many desks, in many libraries and classrooms, and at the kitchen counter during cooking waiting for the stew to boil.  It seems I always have something to read in my hands.For a number of years now my favorite word has been essence.  This may change, but right now it means the hint of the special that is.

{"title": "Not to Put Too Fine a Point on It", "date": "Friday, February 27, 2009", "text": "Some people cut a little brush and others cut a lot of deadfall.  The tree trimmers came today.  We did NOT cut any live trees, only the dead ones that were in the path of the deer fence and that were too large for us to deal with.  At $300 an hour we think this is a bargain as the largest logs could not be cut by any chain saw that we own.  The photos were taken through the screened window upstairs and like most of my photos can be clicked on for a high resolution.  (It took only 2 hours to remove a ton of stuff!)They shred most of the small limbs into mulch that goes into the ravine and will be good for the rest of the trees and plants and bugs growing down that way.  We have removed some food for the woodpeckers, but we have dozens of other trees that are dead or dying.The work is dangerous and watching them do this gives me tremendous respect for the skills needed in this job.  The large logs they are able to cut so that they fit almost exactly as they drop them not too gently into the back of their big truck.  This is all done by eye.It is interesting to see the different colors of the shredded material that comes out of the chipper.  Some is rich and red, and other brown.  We did not try to save this as mulch because there is so much poison ivy vine mixed in with it.  We also sacrificed some of our future firewood because we did not want to interfere with their progress by trying to pick and choose.  Everytime you talk to these guys it is money! ;-)If my dad were still alive he would love watching this.  He had worked hard all his life and had a deep appreciation for work that was completed by hand and machine.

He did the prayer/chant and painted the various symbols in the air with his hand.  His wife 'Dora' was in charge of getting all the elements necessary for the house blessing together.  One last element she brought was a green candle which she lit and said was her own personal blessing for us for as long as we lived in the house and we were to keep the candle burning until it went out and therefore at the end we placed what was left of the burning candle into the fireplace.The house was blessed with a very eclectic blessing ceremony involving some Asian symbols, some Jewish blessings and some pagan symbols and chants.  Smoke and light and aromas were involved and every single room was blessed and every entryway and window protected from bad energies.During the process, which was new and somewhat strange to hubby and I, Seth who was in each room happened to look out one of the upstairs windows to the house across the way and asked about our neighbors.  Hubby said they were a very nice retired couple.  Our guest then tapped his chest and said he felt something fluttering there.  My husband then told him the man had just had quadruple bypass for the second time and our guest said that explains the tingle in his chest!We went downstairs and looked out across the river and our guest said he felt the house across the way was troubled and therefore he sent more positive energy to that part of the walls and windows of our house and a stronger block for bad energy from across the way.  Interestingly, the people directly across the river had been the ones who had called the permit office on our building project to insure it was being done legally and we had also heard from another neighbor that the wife of the couple was a trouble-maker.  Seth and Dora live far from here knew none of this.Then hubby decided to test our guest and asked him if he had any feelings about the neighbors to the East of our house.  Our guest looked across the way and said he felt only joy and happiness.  These neighbors are the ones who bought a $100,000 yacht this summer and never got around to using it and who invited their church to hold two church services outside in their front yard this past summer filled with singing and praying, but were polite enough to call me each time  to let me know there would be some noise as they were having the service outside.This analysis of our neighbors seemed to be too much coincidence to think that our guest didn't have something going on with his 'third eye' and therefore we thought he must know what he was doing in blessing and protecting our house.  At the end of the blessing a very healthy pair of red shoulder hawks flew to the trees that were very close to the windows in the back yard and rested briefly before heading down the river.  These are the first hawks we have seen in our neighborhood in well over a year and I took that as a good omen for strength, love, and new beginnings."},

I have discovered 'friends' of friends of distant friends and these are people I rarely see or talk to...so that is kind of interesting and disconcerting at the same time to open these connections and see their photos after decades.I 'chatted live' for several minutes with my son who was online at the same time at 1:40 in the early morning. Intermittent insomnia is obviously genetic. This was a greater exchange of words than we have had in months as he never rarely answers my emails or phone calls! While the chat was quick and superficial...at least we connected.Since on facebook you have dozens (in some cases 100s to 1,000s) of people who can read what you write and know who you are...you have to really avoid \"thinking out loud.\" (i.e. you cannot \"write on a friend's 'wall'\" about how so-and-so has aged or put on so much weight and you should not post in detail about that rather crazy party you recently attended as the younger members so unwisely do...complete with photos.) It is kind of like being at a cocktail party with absolutely everyone you know listening to most every word you say and you are getting dizzy from the multiple ongoing tiny conversations since many of the people you overhear are people you barely know and they are not talking to everyone as they are at a different party. In one session you may see or read brief notes about a sonogram, a drinking party, a political rally, an open invite to the movies and mountain hike depending on the diversity of your \"friends.\"Some of my kids 30-something friends think I am cool for joining and I must admit that is an ego boost when you are approaching crone-hood. I am kind of glad this technology was not around when I was 20-something as I am sure I have forgotten more embarrassing adventures than I like to admit and I would hate to have had them made available to all my future friends down the road.I have yet to reach and comment on the page of the colleague who originally asked me to join while I have \"written on the wall\" of many others!This must be a demographers and social scientists dream. I hope I am still alive to read the books on the analysis of this phenomena and the analysis of culture.FB ---as the 'young folks' call it (what an old foggy phrase)---has said they cannot promise that you can permanently delete anything you post...it will always be floating out there somewhere having been captured by someone else...just like those embarrassing incidents in high school that come up at reunions.If you follow current events regarding these social networking sites you will know that there are still important questions about copyright and ongoing use of material you write and the photos you upload in this venue. ( I have taken a few copyright seminars and this sounds like a nightmare.)When I eventually load my FB page...after much delay in loading...it is kind of like finding myself in a tabloid over which I have some control. The FB does give the impression that some people spend all their time networking rather than working at work! This is another questionable impression a young person does not want to make.Some Lagniappe: The new TV series \"Trust Me\" on TNT had an episode recently where the dad who is an advertising man secretly got the password and logged on to his teenage daughter's FB page and found she had only three friends, one of them her teacher. Being an ad man he was concerned that this represented her lack of popularity. She is portrayed as a bit of a geek in the series. He sent her an electronic message asking to be a 'friend' and she denied him. When he asked about it and about her few friends she said that she was just being very selective. Is FB like being in junior high once again?   (Another rant about FB here.)"},

The hardest part is finding the can of matching paint. Need to plan a nice menu for them as they have entertained us numerous times. They cannot visit easily as they have goats, chickens, etc. that are pregnant this time of year. Babysitting for kids completed this past weekend. Check that off the list.

Too many small magnets lying around waiting to accidentally erase PC stuff. In order to save money, I tried to do it myself and have ended up purchasing and re-purchasing parts thus costing even more than the pre-made kit would have cost.

Must do some Internet surfing.It is really hard to get 50 brand new one dollar bills from your bank...I know I have tried for days! These days banks only have dirty money. (A belated birthday addition for my baby brother.)Planning a budget for the deer fence installation. One determined deer caught his/her head in the wire cage I had placed so carefully around the new smoke bush and dragged the cage into the yard before freeing themselves. They had pruned the smoke bush cleanly insuring I will get no smokey blossoms this year!Finished The Time Traveler's Wife but found this love story very heavy and too depressing to pass on to hubby to read. Don't know what to do with the book now. Ditto feelings on Revolutionary Road, but for some reason liked it much more.Must drag out all my 8 to 10 swimsuits, many over a decade old, and decide if indeed I should purchase new suits for the \"Cruise.\" (I have decided to focus on photography during this cruise and therefore won't feel so anxious...I have other reasons for anxiety that have nothing to do with my looks in a swimsuit...like being confined with members of 5 different families on a boat and being encouraged to play competitive games. I am like Oprah and would like to hide in the closet at the Kennedy compound.)Caulk all the trim work where it is separating--5 rooms. Done!

I was hoping I wouldn't look this way on the April cruise but my hair stylist doesn't think the brown will be gone by then unless I cut my hair very short.The good thing is that I will no longer be paying to have my hair dyed or dying it myself in between times in the future...what a pain!Why in this Western culture are men considered distinguished with gray hair and women are thought of as cronish or witchy?"},
{"title": "Settling In !", "date": "Sunday, February 08, 2009", "text": "Our house was completed (mostly) in June of 2007.Within the past month I have noticed two doors in this house that are sticking at the top of the frame when I try to open and close them. Really sticking so that I have to tug quite hard to get them open or closed.  One is an inside door and one and outside door on opposite sides of the house.  I have checked door hardware and it appears that settling has caused this instead of loose hinges.  In one case the hairline crack runs from the corner trim through the sheet rock right up to the ceiling. (All photos can be clicked to enlarge.)I have also noticed that many of the window trims have started to separate at the top corners and baseboard corners.  I am guessing over time this can happen to a house as it ages, but I do not remember seeing so many trim corner cracks in the first house we built.So, I did a walk around inspection and find also that the window frames in a very few instances are pulling from the sheetrock and therefore the paint is chipping.I also found a nasty case where the ceiling tape is pulling loose as can be seen in the photo above.While much of this can be repaired with spackling or caulk and paint, is this much settling normal as a house settles?   Is this because of green wood?  Should we be more concerned?  On days when there are big changes in temperature this house will let out an amazing creak or two in the evening as the air cools down.  There are no foundation or cement floor cracks, thank goodness."},
{"title": "Isn't It Romantic?", "date": "Saturday, February 07, 2009", "text": "When you have been married as long as I have, and I have been married a lot longer than I ever thought people could tolerate each other,  it is hard to buy an original romantic something for that certain someone.  Since we were heading up to the city to babysit last week, I had planned a nice dinner at a favorite restaurant in the city for the following night and then taking in Casablanca on the big screen at a theater.  My idea of real romance...probably not my husband's...but as much as I love him, he is no where close to being a romantic, so I took the lead on setting this up.Anyway, as is well-known, he got the flu big time last week and all had to be cancelled including the theater with the resulting loss of the pre-paid theater tickets.So, not to be stymied, I had a fall-back idea.  I had ordered something for him that I knew he was going to love.  It was very expensive and I didn't realize how heavy it was until it arrived, and over three days, continued to arrive in various boxes! Thus, hubby had to find out ahead of time about the gift to help me lift and put the thing together.I am sure any nosy neighbors across the river were wondering what kind of sex toy this enormous frame with chains, etc. represented since we put everything together in the bay window of the master bedroom. The directions said that it could be put together in about an hour.  Well, that is assuming your husband reads directions and lays out all the parts ahead of time.  He started pushing in plastic  parts and it wasn't until we reached an impasse that I pointed out that the plastic parts were supposed to go elsewhere.  (No you cannot comment on our sex life here.)  This was about an hour into the project and we sighed in exhaustion and gave up until the next day. This morning hubby was determined to pull out the plastic end pieces and with some drilling and pulling and sweat he succeeded.  We once again started the project.  In about an hour the  project was finished and looked pretty good.Boy are the lights bright on this baby!   Now we will worry about whether the neighbors think we are growing medicinal plants in the bedroom.  We also will have to watch the timer as that might indeed have an impact on our sex life.This unit has three long shelves that he gets to fill with spring seedlings and he is so excited he even said I could have some of the space.  Cool huh?Post Script:  No I do not have shades or drapes for the bedroom.  We are saving up for that, although with this recession that may be a long time coming.  If anyone wants to watch two old farts walking around naked in their bedroom, here' s to em!Post Post Script:  I think this little project with its hundreds of pieces should count for good elder brain exercise.  I haven't done something like this in a while.PPPS:  Yes we once had a homemade seeding unit (quite ugly), but we no longer have the patience to try to build something like that again.  We are the kind of people that keep the gardening catalogs going."},

{"title": "Lifestory #25 --- WE WILL ROCK YOU", "date": "Sunday, February 01, 2009", "text": "I am listening to the Superbowl theme music as I sit at the computer and write this entry.  I am not a football fan and I have no intention of watching this game tonight, but it does remind me of a life story that is related.Those of us who have lived overseas and been regarded as expatriates for any length of time are familiar with losing touch with our culture fairly easily as we get wrapped up in the culture of the country in which we are living. In one instance, I remember answering a phone call at 2:00 A.M. Indonesia time one January when I lived in Indonesia sans TV and listening to some excited guy talk in detail about some Super Bowl game that had just ended while I wiped the sleepy dirt from my eyes and then gained enough sense to ask him why he had originally called.  It was about some embassy thing that had nothing to do with the Super Bowl!But this story is about another time and place.  It was January 1971 and we were living and working in Palau, Micronesia before we had children.  We were on a month's leave and had just returned to the United States for some R & R after two years of being away.  One of our stops was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where my husband's parents lived.  Hubby's parents were typical of many American parents of that time a la Madmen.  Elderly, back slapping, cocktail drinking and proud of their son's accomplishments.  It was a bit intense for me as I grew up on a quiet farm in Colorado.  But I took deep breaths and did my best to be a good daughter-in-law.During the time there was much reminiscing and my father-in law mentioned an old friend of his that really wanted to see my husband.  He explained that the guy had done very well in business and actually owned several race tracks and a Jai Alai stadium in the area.  He insisted that we take an afternoon and stop by the friend's office.  My husband didn't remember this man very well, but to appease his father he agreed.We drove somewhere outside of Fort Lauderdale to a rather simple but large, white, cinder block building in an area of town that looked much like the type of places disreputable people hang out in those Miami Vice episodes.  When we told the secretary we had an appointment with her boss she showed us into his office.  The first thing I saw was stuff and more stuff.  Piles of papers, boxes, the entire room was filled with stuff and crap and not at all what one expects in visiting a millionaire's office.  The working desk was piled high with even more stuff.  The man, whom we will call Mr. X  to avoid any lawsuit from remaining relatives, sat behind this desk and would have been easy to miss if we had been standing further away.  He was short but weighed at least 300 pounds and his age was hard to determine from my inexperience as a 25-year-old.I don't remember much of the meeting as it was mostly about hubby's youth and the good old days.  The meeting lasted maybe 20 minutes, and as we got up to leave, Mr. X reached into a drawer and handed hubby a small envelope.  It was a gift, he said, hoping we would enjoy our stay in Florida.  Hubby took the envelope and shook his hand and we returned to the car.As we sat in hubby's parents car which we had borrowed, we opened the envelope and inside were two tickets on the 50-yard line to the 1971 Super Bowl in Miami.  This was Super Bowl #5 for those of you who know your football history.  Neither my husband or I were the best recipients for this gift as during that time we were not big football fans although hubby has become a bigger fan over the years.  We went to the game, enjoyed the game, but all I really remember is crying when they played the National Anthem as I had not heard it in a long time.I think this is what they call looking a gift horse in the mouth even though we did not question his generosity.  Today, of course, we would know better."},

At first we thought it was the curried shrimp I had made for dinner (the best I have ever eaten--secret to be revealed in another blog) but since I felt fine hours later we eliminated food poisoning. This morning the agony continues along with the expected results (pushing fluids in and out)  and a 100 degree fever.  It is the flu, probably caught on the plane flight back from Hawaii.  So instead of being worried about food poisoning for myself I am now worried about getting a nasty case of the 'epizootic.'  I cancelled the promised babysitting, and I immediately made some fudge from a mix I had on the shelf, added some pecans and tiny marshmallows and when it finished setting I slowly ate two pieces.  If I am going to get sick, I want to make sure that these calories are not wasted!  (And, yes, we both got our flu shots--clearly immunized against the wrong strain.)"},
{"title": "Who moved the ladder?", "date": "Friday, January 30, 2009", "text": "(Click on photo for larger view)If you read my other blog, as I am sure many people cannot resist doing in their free time, you will notice I lately have become a bit of a bird fanatic watching the changing bird species as they visit the feeders just ahead of each weather change. They also seem to be starting their spring color changes. I (they) have been going through a substantial amount of sunflower seed and although there are about 20 birds coming and going at any one time, I was still amazed at how much was being eaten each day.Then, while looking out the window one cold morning, I saw one of our neighborhood squirrels on the feeder. He was wrapped around the green metal container with his fuzzy face completely buried inside one of the seed openings. The greedy rodent was there for a long time sucking down seeds until I finally threw a grapefruit rind in his general direction from the deck. (Yeah, don't ask.) Anyway, this particular feeder has been with us for more than a decade and proven pretty much squirrel proof, so I was curious about how this little piggy was making it up there.Waiting patiently I saw him return to the area. He scampered over the sunflower seed shells scattered in the snow and jumped to a nearby very small oak tree (5 feet in height) between our two feeders. He would scramble part way up the tree and then fly expertly as if he was a weightless kite to the side of the feeder where his clawed grip (what a yoga move!) allowed him to stick like tar to the feeder and begin his gluttony once again.I will be honest by saying that I feel everything has its place in nature but I do consider squirrels to be rats with fuzzy tails and am less empathetic to their pursuit of happiness in nature's grand scheme.The very next day we went out and cut down that little oak tree and that left the squirrels to forage for the seeds that fall to the ground. A short time later I was watching through the dining nook window and saw one of the squirrels scurrying back and forth over the seeds on the ground. He then scampered to the left to the exact place where the tiny oak tree had once reached for the sun and looked up to the sky clearly looking for the missing tree trunk. He returned back beneath the feeder and then back again to where the tree had once been maybe more carefully measuring his pace this second time. He stood on his back legs and looked up for that familiar tree trunk. It was most interesting and funny to watch. I could just imagine him counting one hop, two hops, three hops in his head and then wondering as he stared into space how he could miss an entire tree. Hubby says that they memorize the forest and thus are able to fly from place to place so quickly.Later I saw him on top of a distant tree stump eating what looked like the berries of the greenbriar vine. Certainly getting better antioxidants than he would with sunflower seeds and maybe reducing the spread of this thorny weed. This expert yoga master was captured in the photo above sitting on a dead tree stump and possibly surveying the feeders below and perhaps planning his next strategic move.The game is on!"},

I tend to like sophistication and simplicity or drama and elegance for wardrobe selection on important occasions.   Jackie Kennedy represented the first and Nancy Reagen the second.  I think the tremendous support for Obama is giving Michelle a bit of a pass with their praise in her wardrobe.  I am not awed by what she wore.  (But none of this is important in the grand scheme of things anyway.)I haven't ridden a horse since I was 11 and yet I seem to be enthralled by cowboy boots. They are practical and comfortable...but expensive.   I got these beauties for Christmas and have worn them twice.  In second photo Xman must have one of my wardrobe genes as he stole these from his grandfather who also has not ridden a horse for decades.I wish I would have had this outfit below, when my little ones were the age where Mom was still the primary source of sustenance.  It is called a h**ter hider and only other mothers know what is going on here.  This is my sweet daughter in Williamsburg a year ago.We have little, if any, snow in our area this year.  The weather woman said a few mornings ago that she was going to start a snow-watch.  She wanted the children who watch the show to put their pajamas on inside-out and backwards and do a little dance before they get into bed each night!    I guess that \"wardrobe\" is an elective subject in getting a meteorology degree. (Since I started this post we have had an icy snow storm plummet the area.  Who knew that weather women and their junior fan club had that kind of weather-power?)My 'cruise' wardrobe planning is going slowly.  What does a white...really white...elderly woman wear on a 4-day cruise?  I frequently wish I had Harry Potter's cloak of invisibility .  I do not want to hide how I look, but how cool would that be for taking photos of everyone?Another of my holiday gifts was lounge wear.  I got tired of hanging out in faded sweats and yesterday wore a holiday gift --- a lovely soft pink velvet outfit...pants, shell, and hooded jacket around the house.  I was doing laundry, cooking, and most importantly keeping a warm fire going in the evening.  By bedtime as I changed into nightwear, I realized that I would have been better off wearing the faded and stained sweats.  Housework is not for sissies.In my twenties I wore 5-inch heels, in my thirties I graduated to 4-inch heels, my forties 3-inch and my fifties 2-inch heels.  Today I wear comfortable bedroom slippers in the cool weather and go barefoot in warm weather and it seems that one's feet stretch when not routinely confined in shells of leather.  I have learned that my feet do ache when wearing some shoes in my closet when I head into the city.  Lately I don't get my bra on until midday...from what I have learned about shoes.,this does not bode well for the future.  (Not that I need a bra !)"},
{"title": "Habitual Carelessness", "date": "Saturday, January 24, 2009", "text": "Retirement has been a wonderful gift for which I am daily thankful.  I have good health and reasonable economic security, neither of which I take lightly, as I know like everything else in life, both of these will change over time.  My life today has been the result of planning, learning, hard work, but mostly luck.  I am lucky to be born in this great country.  I was lucky to be able to go to college and pursue a career.  I am lucky to have two beautiful and healthy grandchildren and two wonderful children.  I am lucky to be married to a patient but energetic man.  I was lucky enough to never win the lottery or some contest which would be a true burden in this simple life I now have.Thus, I do carry some guilt with me as I do not think I have 'earned' this.I carry some more guilt because I have not yet ventured out to share this time in a structured way with others who are not so lucky in this new community where I live.  I am guilty because I do not feel lonely for being able to go for days at a time without meeting or talking to anyone, especially when my husband is on travel.  I could so easily be a hermit.I think this temporary withdrawal is because I was so bitter about the mediocrity and falseness of my last 5 years of employment.  I was paid very well by the American taxpayer and not allowed to accomplish anything.  I worked with people who created budgets that were never implemented and listed goals and milestones that could not be met without a fixed budget which we never got.  It was a Dilbert world without the humor.  (Our illustrious leader was a political appointee...need I say more?)  Thus, I retired early taking a cut in retirement income.  As a Type A, the alternative would have been slitting my wrists.Perhaps, this procrastination now is because I feel as if I still have wounds to lick and a mind to heal.But I have also learned that all those times I used to tell myself, \"Once I get some free time...\" have arrived.  \"Once I have more free time\" I will exercise every day...not happening.  I will sew those curtains after the New Year...fabric is still sitting in a plastic bag.  I will paint the front room built-in so that it matches the trim...guess I will wait until spring so I can open the windows.  I will repaint the trim in the kitchen so that it matches the cabinets...ditto.  I will start with babysteps and drop by the local library and see if they need a volunteer or have a list of volunteer programs...soon I hope.  I will garden more...that one is easy to do.It is scary how easy it is to procrastinate especially when there are no immediately seen  consequences for your bad habits."},

My new granddaughter struggles with pronouncing nonna---now neeena--- and calls me nana.  I feel like a fruit.My daughter's in-laws wanted to be called Mom-Mom and Pop-Pop and my daughter now says her children do not have grandparents.Sha, my granddaughter, was fighting a cold and some intestinal issues during the visit. When her mother said one afternoon, \"Oh no, there she blows!\" this meant one of two things, neither of which I will detail.Sha spent many minutes each day with her nose pressed to the window to watch the birds at the feeder.  That window now looks like some abstract art as it is covered in snot.My daughter and I could only exchange short sentences due to toddler interruptions and got very good in talking in code as we tried to have adult conversations throughout the long weekend.I continue to find little things as I clean the house...an empty sippy cup, a little ball, a lego piece and I have to take a deep breath so that I don't tear up.The place at the foot of my bed where Xman's portable bed goes when he visits seems very bare after he leaves. I am just getting used to sleeping without the night light.While putting on Xman's shoes for his departure I said that winter was very cold outside but I was sad we have not had any real snow yet.

This is one of the most anticipated inaugurations in our nation's history and also one of the most protected. I will not detail the 3,000 restrictions that are being placed on attendees including carrying nothing larger than a lunch bag to some of the areas. My lovely daughter and her two children are fleeing the area and joining me at the house late Sunday night through Tuesday evening...or perhaps staying until Wednesday morning.   She is not going in to work on Monday or Tuesday.  Why is this,  one might ask?The highway and bridge she takes to get into work will be closed as will every other bridge in the immediate area.The garage beneath her office where she regularly parks, which is about a mile from the Capital, will be closed to the public.Everyone will be forced to take Metro or  a bus or walk. (The Metro is a VERY crowded trip on the 4th of July when there are fewer people coming to the city.)The events begin Sunday and go through Tuesday.There will be hundreds of celebrities.They are predicting 4 to 5 million people will attend. It will be miserably cold, so I am predicting about 2 million people.Someone said there will be 5,000 port-a-potties and an 'expert' analysis said that is not near the amount needed.  (That should be fun in cold weather.)Every hotel is full and some folks are renting their apartments for $1,000...my son, whose apartment is walking distance from a nearby metro station, considered this but then got cold feet as the day grew closer.There will be great concerts...some free and some requiring tickets.There will be a parade...a very cold parade unless you are marching in it.There will be 10 inaugural balls (and no place to sit at these balls if one wears high heels.)Therefore, even those attending will have to brace themselves for a challenging event.  My daughter is afraid she won't make it to work...much less make it home to pick up the kids from day care on those days.And thus, I will not have the courage to go myself, even though I think it is a big deal.  I will raise a glass of bubbly to the big screen TV and wish him a decent first 100 days but not expect more than is realistic in these difficult times.  (For a little more inspiration...go here.)"},
{"title": "Life Stories #23--The Mark, the Patsy, the Dupe", "date": "Saturday, January 17, 2009", "text": "Years ago, when I was living in Indonesia, I spent much time discovering many wonderful temples and architectural wonders in this exotic country.  One of my very favorite places to visit was the famous Buddhist temple of Borobudur, \"a mountain of a thousand statues.\"  When it had been excavated  and the jungle cleared by the British governor, Sir Thomas Standford Raffles, the temple was open to theft and destruction over the ensuring years and that can be seen when touring the temple.After newly arriving in Jogajakarta, and once the rainy season had slowed and the muddy roads had dried, my family and I went to visit this famous temple for the first time.    This temple is one of the most visited Buddhist temples by tourists from all over the world, and can be quite crowded most days.  There is a narrow initial entry, and as we approached the steps, the ventura effect of the narrower entry with the wave of many tourists caused us to be pushed closer and closer together until we were shoulder to shoulder with many others.  There was a young man in front of me assisting a frail elderly woman make her way slowly up the steps.   The crowd flowed around me on either side and as I was pushed forward into the couple  tried very  hard not to knock them to the ground.  The elderly woman was barely able to make it up each step and it was impossible for me to get around the pair and so I accepted my fate of inching upwards.  People kept pushing me from behind and it took all my energy to just maintain my balance.Finally we reached the plateau above, and the crowd dispersed and I could breathe again.  I pull the canvas bag from off my shoulder where its weight had caused some strain and that was when I notice a clean razor cut in the side small pocket where my wallet of Rupiahs and my International driver's license had been stored.  I  knew immediately when and how it had happened and did not bother looking for the team of thieves.Several years later I was vacationing with my husband and children in Spain.  We had arrived a few days before in Madrid and were getting an early morning start for a drive to the ancient city of Toledo.  Hubby was having some health problem, which I cannot recall, and so we parked the car at the side of a lovely tree-lined street and he walked across to a corner pharmacy.  I waited in the rental car with the two little ones in the back seat.  The early morning light was lovely and golden as it filtered through the trees.  A young and very attractive man stepped out of the nearby alley ahead of the car and leaned against a brick wall and smoked a cigarette enjoying the morning.   A middle aged couple, just beyond him up the sidewalk, were sauntering arm and arm towards us lost in each others company.  In less than three seconds as they passed the man he had removed the purse from her shoulder.  She let out a small scream and tried to hang on, but was too slow in reaction.  The man disappeared down the alley with her purse.  The couple ran after him, but he evaporated into some well planned escape route.   By the time hubby returned to the car with his curative, I had decided to be far more alert the rest  of the day.Again, several more years have passed, and one spring afternoon I had left my work for a meeting in downtown Washington D.C.  It was April, the Cherry Blossom Festival was in full swing, the weather was wonderful, and I left my meeting early deciding to play hooky the last hour of the day and walk under the Cherry Blossoms at the end of the Mall.   As I crossed the Mall a woman of about 35 approached me.  She asked if I knew where the Metro station was.   I was slightly suspicious but pointed the way.   Then she asked if I knew how much it would cost to go from point A to point B.   I told her that they had posted the rates at the station and again started to walk away.She immediately began to follow me and launched into a long and detailed story of how she had passed out from some illness the night before at a restaurant, had been rushed to the emergency room of a city hospital,  had called her sitter that night to watch over her daughter, and had just been released this morning.  Her Priest had sat up with her all night and both were relieved when her illness proved to be minor.  Her priest had just dropped her off to take a metro home and she realized that she had absolutely no money in her purse.  Did I have any dollars to loan her?  She had to get home and release her sitter.I stopped in my tracks and studied this very intelligent face.  It was a very compelling story and I cannot replicate the skill with which it was told in this writing.  But, even though I knew this was a scam, there was something making it hard for me not to believe her.  I took a breath and then looking her in the eye, I told her she should go into acting.  She said something to me in response that I cannot write here.  But the little Catholic woman had learned some pretty saucy language outside of her church.  She stomped away already looking for her next victim.  Had she broken into tears, perhaps I would have given some money.And then just a few years ago I had blogged about this little incident."},

{"title": "Thursday Thoughts # 18 -- Things I Have Learned from Mother Nature", "date": "Thursday, January 15, 2009", "text": "Mother Nature never throws anything away.  She always recycles.   But, we live in a culture where it  is considered good for our society to get rid of the old stuff and make room for the new stuff.  This includes housing and so a healthy economy means we build more houses and sell more houses.    We buy more stuff and get rid of old stuff.  This is good for the economy.  When I continue thinking along this path it all looks more and more like a giant pyramid scheme to me.The old adage about bending like the willow so that you don't break leaves out all the gray nuances in life such as when you bend, and maybe aren't watching, sometimes someone will come along and chop off your head or make you feel as if they have while you are trying to adjust to some major change in your life! (another post)Some days I don't feel as industrious or energetic as I think I should at this elder age and then I see this:and realize I have not a clue about industriousness and probably wasn't very high energy when I was younger either, and then I try not to be so hard on myself.When we first bought this vacant peninsula of land a lovely swan greeted us at the dock as we ate our recently purchased Dunkin Doughnuts' breakfast.  I forbade my husband to feed the swan as I didn't want swan poop all over the dock in the future.  Today, years later, two lovely swans were cruising near the dock and I handed hubby a slice of stale bread and told him to go down to the dock and feed them.  They swam eagerly forward, picked at the stale bread, turned up their noses and swam away.  Even in nature fresh ingredients are important.Having a good group of friends to hang out with and party all night is one honest way to make it through a long cold winter.  Boy were they noisy last night!Below is another less demanding way to pass the gray winter days  but I think  just as psychologically restorative.  (As anal as I have been criticized for being I did not screw the containers together alphabetically!)"},

It does not mean I am important because anyone who contributed to Obama's campaign probably got one of these.  I have gotten invites years ago from Bill and Hillary, but they looked more like invites to a 'party' whereas (note the use of the archaic here) this one looks like an official document, is letter size, card weight and is even embossed.The odd thing (other than the fact that I am not going) is that this also came along with an ad for a half dozen items I could purchase to remember the important event.  Mugs, coins, whatevah.  That sort of took away the dignity of the whole thing for me.  Having worked with archivists who preserve realia for a living I am not much of a memorabilia collector.

{"title": "Pretentious Vanity", "date": "Tuesday, January 06, 2009", "text": "It is pretentious for me to hit my sixties and say that I do not care how I look.   I have drawers full of cosmetics and face creams and hair goo.  If I didn't care how I looked, I would throw all of these out and go plain Jane.  I do go plain on most days.  Putting on only moisturizer and hair conditioner to keep me from flaking away.  Some folks were born into that gene pool of aging gracefully and look just as good without makeup as they do with it.  Sissy Spacek comes to mind.  She looks 16 and has looked like a teenager her whole life.I don't care how I look (just stop by for a visit) when I am lounging around the house, when I am cleaning the house, when I am stacking wood, blogging in the early morning  or when I am digging a garden bed.  I really do not care, because the evidence of my actions excuses my messy looks.I care just a little how I look when I have gotten through rolling on the floor with a toddler, cooking a rather industrious meal for guests, or changing planes at the airport.  I do want a brush through my hair and some lipstick help before I settle into that next plane for hours.But, I am nervously vain about appearances when I am going on vacation to areas where the climate insures that one does not wear many clothes.   All the make-up and hair spray will not make me look healthy in a swimsuit.Last year we agreed to a Disney Cruise with my daughter and her in-laws this coming April.  Yes, a cruise where the majority of passengers are below 3 feet in height.  Yes, we agreed to being confined on the ocean on a boat with tiny cabins and hundreds of busy activities run by scary high energy employees in costumes...not my idea of a vacation, especially when you shell out such sums of money for this.  But I was determined in my elder years to be more generous in avoiding regrets by failing to do things in life that seemed regrettable and thanked them for remembering us and purchased the tickets.My appearance concern starts escalating because I will be with a 60-something grandma that has a lovely figure and two nicely built thirty-something females, one of whom used to be a professional cheerleader.   You know the type, artificial breasts, straight blond hair and the sweetest little face.  I have been trying (without success and empathizing each day with Oprah) to lose about 10 more pounds so that I don't look like a walking light bulb.  Yes, a low watt bulb, a dim bulb but a bulb none-the-less.  I am a healthy grandma.  I am not asking for a 50 pound re-make here, just a little reshaping.Can I lift 12 pound free weights for 20 reps ?  Yes.  Can I run a 3 minute mile?  Yes.  Can I do 80% of that nasty yoga tape before collapsing in a sodden lump on the mat?  Yes.  Can I do 5 minutes of very intense ab work?  Yes.  Can I lose more weight around my mid-section?  Apparently not.Last week I avoided the 3 ten-minute miles on the elliptical every other day (YES, dear readers, 3 TEN MINUTE MILES(!)) in favor of an old 'Firm' tape that used to push me to the limit with both weights and aerobics.    The d**n thing runs for a full 55 minutes and I was determined to make it through the entire excruciating ordeal at this re-start of a new direction in my weight loss program.I made it.  My form was somewhat sloppy, but I made it to the end of the tape.  I was sweating and breathing heavy...but I made it.The very next day I could barely make it out of bed.  That afternoon it felt as if knives had been plunged into my thighs, buttocks and calves.  The day following that I took that forest hike I had written about on my other blog and I honestly thought I would DIE from the pain of just walking.  The vision of being carried out on a stretcher by two forest rangers did not seem unrealistic.  Two more days and some yoga later and I still consider it a torture to go up the stairs to blog in the morning.  I still take Aleve when I fall into bed at night.  I still have not lost the 10 pounds!  Yes I have gained a pound...sure, you can tell me it is muscle, but it didn't land anywhere useful that I can see.Vanity is a most poisonous sin but it does not eat you from the inside out...at least not so it shows."},
{"title": "Being in the Moment", "date": "Sunday, January 04, 2009", "text": "Honoring my ongoing promise to myself to be more 'in the moment', I fixed a dinner of rosemary lamb chops, garlic and curry roast potatoes, and a healthy baby spinach salad with orange-wedges (from my favorite clementines), thin red onion slices and almonds. The meal was beautiful to look at and in honor of being in the moment I did not rush away to take a picture for the blog. (The picture above was taken on another day with silly glasses that do not match.) I took my time to inhale each captivating smell as I sat down for dinner, and while we do not say grace, I was thankful in my heart and soul and to the powers that be for this meal. I slowly chewed each bite of food and let the flavors linger before swallowing. My husband and I respected the value and precious quality of this meal and the quiet time we had to linger over it.My husband had made a fresh pitcher of cold green tea and in keeping with the spirit of the moment I brought the glass to my nose to inhale as if it were a fine wine before taking my first sip. The green tea had been enhanced with a sliver of the little kaffir lime that had clung to the tree for months before falling to the floor when I turned the tree in the sun that morning. When I inhaled, the aroma was like a verdant spark.  It was lime but not lime. It was like a sweet floral perfume but not heavy or out of place. It was better than even drinking the lovely green tea itself. This gift from the 4 foot citrus plant in a green plastic pot tucked in the corner window was one of the best gifts I got over the holiday season.I will try to be in the moment more often."},

They have driven down south with a boat in tow and will spend the night in a hotel. Thus  I have two precious half days to myself.In the last few hours I have just finished reading:and was feeling a little cold and wet like the characters in this mystery that trudged through Venice in search of the murderer during the high water season.I put on the above music, which was a holiday gift,  as I prepared a light and warming lunch and when finished eating I  continued my immersion in all things Italian.As I sat on the couch, I tucked my stockinged feet under me and opened Michael Krondl's \"The Taste of Conquest\"  which is about the \"rise and fall of three great  cities of spice\" and once again found myself back in Venice but at a much earlier time when European involvement in the spice trade flourished.    And, of course, the first city he visits is Venice.  It appears that Venice began with salt and war...no surprise there and since they controlled the trade sold salt to Italy at an 80% profit.I visited Venice a number of years ago and it is a city that is overwhelming in its beauty and somewhat frightening in it decadence.  It is my understanding that because the city is sinking its population is dwindling.  All things change and nothing stays the same.Well, excuse me, must get back to my reading."},

I began to let go.2008 was the year I got better at being a grandma. Instead of staring at how fast they were growing I started to participate in the event.In 2008 I lost 10 pounds...no more and no less...but there is yet 2009.In 2008 I evolved into a much better cook with the time to be creative and invented new dishes with all the herbs from my garden and ideas I gleaned and modified from my many cookbooks. I learned that you can teach an old dog (cook) new tricks.In 2008, speaking of gourmet cooking, I made S'mores with the grandson and I haven't made S'mores in decades!I have pretty much taken 2008 as a laid back vacation doing only what I wanted to do, when I wanted to do it. I am so thankful for such luxury.In 2008 I lost 100's of thousands of dollars (I have lived pretty frugally most of my life) in the stock market and I don't care because I realize I don't need much in this new life I am living.I do need $1.99 persimmons and I splurged and bought 4 of these beauties yesterday.In 2008 I did not beat myself up for wanting alone time anymore and accept the fact that this is one of the ways I charge my batteries and restore my soul.In 2008 I also accepted the fact that just looking at a flower or interesting plant this year can restore my soul for the rest of the day.In 2008 I also learned how high energy my husband is and I am trying to meet his needs as we walk together into these days ahead.2008 was the year my youngest turned 30. That was harder on me in many ways then when I turned 60!My resolution this year will be to get back on a schedule and try to give more of this precious time I have to others.I made it to 13 and that must bode well for the New Year, doncha think?"},
{"title": "The Dinner", "date": "Tuesday, December 30, 2008", "text": "The restaurant she had selected was a high-end seafood chain located in the Galleria near the more expensive stores. She had hoped that the empty parking spaces outside were a clue that the restaurant would be quiet inside, but the holiday season had packed both the bar at the front and the tables in the various rooms with festive customers.She and her husband were led to a room near the far back and that helped reduce the din. Trying to look a little fashionable, she had carefully dressed in a loose fitting black turtle neck sweater and a faux suede skirt cut on the bias that allowed her new tan and dark brown cowboy boots to show. The weather had turned unusually warm which meant the brown tights she had decided to wear instead of a slip were making her a little uncomfortable. Her husband, who spent much of the last few weeks in jeans and sweatshirts, had found it more difficult to dress wanting to wear the new mock turtleneck sweater he had gotten as a gift and finding most of his slacks too dressy for the casual knit. He finally decided on a faded pair of Dockers. They looked like a typical middle class retired couple pushing unsuccessfully for an upper middle class look.Their waiter arrived almost immediately upon being seated. His head was covered by a thick heavy thatch of dark hair shooting every which way and his face was covered by a dark beard making him look very much like a terrorist rather than a waiter, but his smile was easy as he filled the water glasses. She ordered a holiday cocktail to help her relax and her husband ordered the usual soda water.They both checked their phones for messages and then made idle conversation hiding the slight tension as they waited for the third party to arrive. She had called him twice during the afternoon and didn't get an answer. Finally she pressed upon her husband to call him once again just before they parked the car, and that was when their son returned the call to say he was finishing the final load of laundry and would be running a little late.They were in the middle of the 'calamari trio' appetizer when their son showed up dressed casually and with his favorite torn jeans. (Did every pair he owned have torn pockets?) He order a soda and she had mixed feelings about his avoidance of a bottle of beer. It was good because he had to drive out later to his apartment and meet up with friends for the rest of his birthday celebration, but she wondered if this meant he would keep his guard up during the entire meal.Small talk about the crowds and the holidays and the sales drifted into talk about the Christmas day memories with the little toddlers. She and her husband ordered the special with the recommended glass of wine. By the time they were well into their entrees the conversation had drifted comfortably into politics and religion. The subjects that all were in agreement on and safe in discussing during the rest of the meal.As the final espresso was ordered her son began a story about a friend of his and the friend's girlfriend at a recent night out. Her son had been scolded by the girlfriend because he had brought another friend of his with two twenty-something sisters who were in town for the holiday. The girlfriend seemed to think he was trying to fix her boyfriend up with one of the sisters and angrily reprimanded him, and the whole event sounded like the Bachelorette or one of those other inane junior high level reality shows of this thirty-something generation where the women are so insecure that only 20k of plastic surgery will calm them down.At the end of the story, her son smiled and said he felt sorry for his friend and then said he was glad he wasn't dating anyone right now.They paid the bill and then walked to their cars and exchanged some gifts and Christmas cookies she had made. She hugged and kissed him goodbye and drank in the smell of him under the aftershave, perhaps clinging a little too long as she knew it would probably be months before she could get their paths to cross again. He opened the door to his car and gave them that familiar sideways smile and little wave before he ducked inside.Well, she thought to herself, that went as well as can be expected."},

This included quite a number of songs that they had memorized and a jingle bell ringing as they sang Jingle Bells.  As you can probably imagine, the little boys got quite carried away with the bells wringing as they had been standing still for most of the program.Holiday at the daughter's house was wonderful with Xman understanding the gift part of Christmas for the first time.  He was so excited and thrilled to be passing out gifts to everyone.  My son came early the night before and I was overjoyed to spend time with him and see that he seemed to be weathering the recent breakup with some balance.  I hope to see him tomorrow for dinner.Been just a little busy and except for the first photo you can see I have been away from the house.

{"title": "Life Story #22- The Rest of the Story", "date": "Saturday, December 20, 2008", "text": "As some readers may recall, we left our newly married royal couple in a small cabin in the woods as the night was falling in the tropical forest with what seemed like a not so happy ending. Fortunately, with the resilience of the young they awoke to a much brighter day and after a breakfast of eggs and fried breadfruit and sliced papaya, they packed their chariot to begin the second day of the 'rest of their honeymoon.'A wedding couple does not have to stay in a 4 star hotel for a beautiful honeymoon on the Big Island, because most of the real tropical beauty is away from the hotel's boring swimming pools and crowded beaches. (Besides if you are graduate students, you barely have two nickels much less $200 for a night in a hotel.) Hawaii is called the 'orchid isle' and it lives up to this name with orchids growing wild everywhere, even along the roadside, causing the Princess on their second day to ask the Prince to stop the chariot every few minutes so that she could bury her face in their sweet smelling blossoms. A drive down the 'chain of craters' road where they eventually had to come to a complete stop because of the cold lava that merged like frozen molasses across the road, amazed them both. Hours later, the newly-weds danced under the giant tree ferns, picked ginger blossoms for the dashboard of their chariot, visited historic Cook's Monument at Kealakakua Bay, let their fingers trace centuries-old petroglyphs in the volcanic stones nearby, explored dark lava tubes and soon forgot about the prior day's disaster.But when they stopped for a family-style lunch at Volcano House, they were reminded of the prior day's debacle as they sat at a large, rustic, round table with the other tourists for a family style meal. The initial noise of the restaurant was that of normal conversations among happy tourists, but at their table the conversation among the fellow diners dwindled immediately into uncomfortable silence as people politely passed food and surreptitiously directed side glances toward the Prince with his oddly deformed lip. This deformity also meant his enunciation was muddled and the Princess had to speak for him when he needed food passed. Suddenly the Princess realized what it must be like to be a person with a deformity in a society where everyone else is \"normal.\" This was an eyeopener and gave the Princess a new appreciation for the \"commoner\".The Princess explained that they were on their honeymoon and had had an early mis-adventure with a honey-bee. The atmosphere at the table immediately thawed and idle conversation began once again with everyone wishing them a happy future.The following days were somewhat of a blur visiting Pahoehoe Point, Kamuela, Kohala Road, and Saddle Road, until on the next to the last day the couple reached the end point of a paved road at Pololu Valley. This point is the start of goat trails to five deep and beautiful valleys on this side of the island. The royal couple had brought their rustic backpacks and proceeded to descend into the northern most valley, Pololu, by following a trail down a 420-foot cliff face that zigged and zagged sharply toward the bottom. (Reminder, this team was not very worldly). When they reached the valley the cool ocean breeze across the crescent beach was very welcoming. They paused for the traditional peanut butter and jelly sandwich lunch (not exactly gourmet) and then climbed up the next very steep ridge and descended into the next valley. The climbing and descending were so totally exhausting that after crossing a number of streams, the small shelter of Australian pine trees at the base of the valley near the ocean was immediately chosen as the evenings camp spot. The royal team set up a primitive campsite which consisted of two sleeping bags, a plastic drop cloth and some cooking utensils---such luxury. During the day as they had crossed each river in both valleys, the Princess noticed that the streams were filled with dead or dying, floating, dangerously red centipedes and the evening music that accompanied that night's dinner was the sound of a nearby violently crashing surf against the rocks blending with the sounds of squealing wild pigs up in the valley. The Princess had visions of either drowning in the encroaching surf waters, being attacked by a wild boar, or being bitten by one of the four-inch long centipedes that had washed down the valley and that could seek shelter in her sleeping bag.The plastic drop cloth that was to be used as protection from the impending rain, became a sail that captured the choking campfire smoke when the wind changed direction from blowing onshore to blowing offshore---as any naturalist would have known. Not much honeymoon lovemaking or much sleep for that matter took place! (Looking back on this beginning it is a wonder that we ever had any children.)The Royal Couple survived this final night of celebration of their marriage and looking like mud-covered warriors and being given second and third glances by the mainland tourists in the parking area, they returned to their chariot to begin the life of a more normal couple. But that is several other life stories and adventures for a later book."},

What was this life that they had shared with people in another era? They were just old boring parents as I knew them.This past weekend I was at my daughter's house when she was opening her mail which consisted of at least a dozen holiday greeting cards that were, for the most part, photos of grinning or mugging little children. Who were these dozens of little people? What part were they playing in the lives of my daughter and son-in-law? The cards were a little window into a current social world that was unfamiliar to me.Last week I got an email from my son's girlfriend letting us know that we would not be seeing her over the holidays as she and my son had recently broken up. It was a mature separation that appears to have left them both in a lot of pain. This was sad news for me as my son is not a social butterfly and being alone over the holidays is not how I wanted to picture him. What we have is a failure to communicate when it comes to this parent son relationship and this gal was my little tiny window into his life of un-returned phone calls and rare email responses. Now that this window has been closed, our worlds are once again drifting apart. I am so sad."},
{"title": "Rewarded with Rushing", "date": "Monday, December 15, 2008", "text": "Hubby and I are heading into the city not to see the lights or go to a fancy holiday party...but to babysit, of course. This activity seems to be the most popular on our social calendar over the winter holidays. We have also been asked to pick a 'few' days during the two weeks that school is closed over the holidays to spend time with (take care of) the grandchildren.I know the cost of babysitters and know that we would be saving them a fortune, and I love being with my grandchildren, and do not resent this in any way. We are asked and not 'expected'. But I can see how some grandparents would consider this an imposition if they found children exhausting or their own lives more interesting.I, on the other hand, know how fast life rushes by and how fast these children will want to spend time with friends their own age rather than old people, so do not regret one second. And my holidays do not require much rushing around now that I no longer work.Having said that, rushing to make and decorate Christmas cookies is not as good an idea. But my problem is that I say \"When life gives you lemons, you can try still life art.\" My reach frequently exceeds my grasp. I also say that cookies that look handmade are far more delicious to eat. (I admit that adding the sprinkles was a bit too much!)"},

{"title": "Blue Christmas", "date": "Sunday, December 07, 2008", "text": "I am sitting here in the early evening after a cold winter wind has rattled the windows all day long. Even the wrapping of presents could not shake the gray loneliness from my shoulders. I was in a pensive and cold mood. I had read Tammy's post where she indicated that her holidays did not necessarily leave her with nice cozy memories. Divorces and children scattered to other geographies left her more pensive than celebratory at this time of year. I put on my old Christmas CD's, and of course, the first to be played was an Andy Williams CD. Talk about nostalgia! After reading Tammy's post I remembered those Christmases after the children had grown and were living too far away to come home for any holiday. Our house was so quiet and empty. I just could not wait for the weeks to pass and get on with preparation for springtime!Now once again I am blest with family that is close and even new little ones to bring back the old memories. But Tammy's post reminded me that not everyone is feeling so warm and friendly this time of year.I will keep this thought close and remember to smile more when I go out, say nice things to strangers that I may encounter and to keep my wallet close to the top of my purse for those charities that need help. I will also remind myself to gulp every day as if it was golden honey, because the times will come when each day is not this way."},
{"title": "Thursday Thoughts # 16 ---Categories", "date": "Thursday, December 04, 2008", "text": "Under the category of way too much time on one's hands I was in a Michael's craft store looking for gift boxes for some clothing I had purchased when I overheard another customer ask a saleswoman if the kits for homemade Christmas cards had arrived(!).Under the category of way too much stuff and not enough time I had told my kids I didn't want anything for Christmas and when they protested, I said, \"Alright, give me a gift certificate of your time.\" \"That's hard.' was the response.Under the category of being married too long hubby indicated he only wanted to get me something I really wanted and not needed. So, I found the coolest pair of cowboy boots in the Coldwater Creek catalog and he immediately went into the next room and called an ordered them.Under the category of missing fashion opportunities what I really need is something that is comfy to wear, something I can clean house and cook in, but something that is stylish enough that I can still answer the door without looking like a couch potato. How does Diane Keaton do it?Under the category of Rome is burning falls the headline about the poor soul who was trampled to death by a bunch of brain dead consumers---may their holidays be filled with no electricity. (Isn't this holiday supposed to be about the birth of the 'Prince of Peace'?)Under the category of dichotomies we saw once again a black domestic cat cruising our woods this morning and had found evidence of a dead bird on the dock the day before. Hubby actually briefly wondered if we should shoot the cat. (Sorry cat lovers...but these guys can be very destructive.)Under the category of mission accomplished all of my holiday shopping is done except for one person and a birthday gift.Under the category of what did you expect? our winter maintenance heating visit revealed that the reason we were feeling a little cold was because the valve to the heater was not working and we were depending on the heating pump alone...cost to fix (as it is under only 1 year warranty): $500.Under the category of reality bites is the news hubby is once again going to Hawaii in Jan or Feb for this project start-up and in order to save money he will be staying with distant friends (very conservative in both their eating habits and their activities) on the side of a hill in the suburbs. While invited, I would not be near a beach or shops or beautiful jungles...so probably will not go as I envision fixing PB and J for lunch and wandering around in their back yard for a week!Under the category of enlightened or unenlightened it wasn't until I saw Obama's acceptance speech that I realized the first lady was black and both her children were black. In all honesty I did not see this in my mind's eye until then!Under the category of getting too old, I had a loosening of something (particles) in my inner ear that gave me nausea and vertigo for about a week up and through Thanksgiving until all was reabsorbed. The first 'attack' was when I got off the elliptical and I, at first, thought I was having a stroke. And finally, under the category of pleasantly surprised it took less than 10 minutes to both change our health care status and change my auto deposit of my retirement check to a different bank with only two phone calls."},
{"title": "Advice for the Family Holidays--thursday thougths #15", "date": "Friday, November 28, 2008", "text": "(Tabor really wanted to decorate the tree with her lovely gold and red globes and red glitter birds from last year...but the traditional 'safe' ornaments were the necessity of the day. Someday, Tabor will get a grown-up tree.)If you are looking forward to having the family visit and you have become accustomed to the retirement lifestyle for some time I have some helpful ideas for you: 1. Once you are retired you become blase about having time to yourself and having quiet afternoons and having more than 3 minutes to complete a task and more than 1 minute to complete a thought. You must accept the fact that this is a ridiculous and abnormal lifestyle in the real world.2. I have a more normal scenario. Start the water in the microwave for a well-deserved cup of tea and the second you finish pressing the last button, run to the other end of the kitchen to catch the toddler before she falls into the plants by the far window, and as you navigate this route, trip over the dog's water bowl (which you forgot was there because you don't have a dog), and finally, as you try to prevent yourself from doing the splits, grab the tablecloth so that the bowls of salsa can topple to the floor just missing the little dog who is anticipating another \"food fall\" of the day.3. Another typical event: If you roast a 20 pound turkey and hubby volunteers to cut everything up at the end of the meal so that you can have slices for freezing, sandwiches, etc., and if you notice that it seems to be taking him more than an hour to complete this task, you need to interrupt the activity immediately. If you don't, fatigue is going to win over and he is going to carve with one hand and push the platter across the counter with the other resulting in a free fall of your tall containers of olive oil and canola oil on the very same counter and as they crash to the floor...well you know the rest, just read #2.4. If you notice a strange expression on a small dog's face or a small child's face this means you need to provide access to the outside for the dog and access to the guest bathroom for the toddler ASAP.5. You will become something of a scatological expert over the visit as parents will inquire about the ease of delivery, consistency, and color of the toddler's product. The pet owner just wants to know if the dog did both #1 and #2 when he/she got outside.6. Breakfast works for the old folks, the younger ones do not get up until 11:00 as there was probably 9 hours of football well into the evening of the day before. If, like me, you are not crazy about football, do not expect this time to catch up on your reading...you are toddler watching. Toddler watching involves very little sitting time, you will burn off all the calories from any substantial meals recently eaten.7. You will notice that educational toys are used very differently based on the gender of the child. The three and a half year old male will bang and bang on the buttons frequently while totally ignoring the directions given by the talking toy while he tries to make as much noise as possible. The 14-month-old female will hit the button for the cat when the machine says 'cat' and then giggle. (You will agree that this gender relationship to following directions and being goal-oriented continues in later life.)8. Remember the board games that you used to play with the older kids over the holidays? Well, you can still do that if you are still awake with a functioning brain after the toddlers are finally asleep at 9:00 P.M. No one at our house had reached that goal.9. If you decided to make a family activity of decorating the Christmas tree while all the loved ones are around, as I in a moment of insanity decided to do, be prepared for more undecorating than decorating.10. And finally, accept the fact that not everyone will be happy at the end of the day.  Post Script: While it may sound like I did most of the work (and perhaps I did) I loved the entire exhausting weekend and each moment will be my treasured memory in years to come. Post Post Script: Stock up on paper towels, napkins, toilet paper and kleenex...you will need a LOT!"},

{"title": "Shop Until You Drop", "date": "Sunday, November 16, 2008", "text": "I had to drive my husband to the airport and also was asked to babysit the two grandchildren over the weekend.  This left me 1.5 free days in between to myself to spend in the 'magic mall.'  The 'magic mall' has one of those tremendously large consumption arenas where you can walk for almost a mile before getting to each store and can spend as much money as you want on stuff, things, junk and treasures which will eventually fill a landfill across the ocean.I only go to the mall when I absolutely have to shop for something, and since my retirement, that is maybe once every three or four months.  The holidays are fast approaching and as somethings abhor a vacuum, I abhor volumes of people rummaging  through piles of crap looking for that one good bargain.  Thus this time before Thanksgiving and \"Black Friday\" as it is know in the U.S.---the shoppers best sales day---I decided to enter the arena and purchase a few items and browse for some ideas.If you have never been in a major city mall, the decadence of  variety and the stupidity of junk will amaze you.  You can buy any tiny crystal thing to spend your life dusting, any exotic lacy boulder holder to truly reveal your age or recent surgery, any latest facial cream to pretend that you do not have wrinkles, any number of fuzzy wuzzies to keep your feet and hands warm long before the first snowfall, any number of electronic devices that vibrate (not that kind!), beep, blink and talk to you, and any number of ball gowns, if perhaps, you are attending one or more of the Presidential Balls.  There was an entire store devoted to ties, another devoted to cell phones and a third walk-in store that sold only pictures...really ugly pictures...like those of Elvis singing.  In addition there are pretzel palaces and coffee corners to satiate your hunger and thirst needs forever.  Interestingly enough, there are very few clothing stores for anyone over the age of 25.It is not unusual to forget where you entered the mall and where you parked at the end of the day---I now write this location down when I leave my car.Some new things that I noticed were an abundance of very helpful sales people.  I had one woman offer to give me a free make-up session OR a free facial at least three times while in one store.  She accosted me in the sweater section, the shoe section and the men's pajama section---this last a little unnerving.  Another 18-year-old male offered me a paper cup of face cream as I passed his kiosk.  I clearly do not have a memorable face, or on the other hand, perhaps I really need some help with my face!This mall is in a rich area of the city and had quite a few shoppers who did not appear to be affected by this recession or the pouring rain.  BUT the prices were being slashed almost everywhere.  Some stores had 20% to 30% off on everything in the store while others had racks with 50% to 75% off on items.  It is sort of sad that in this time of my life when I don't need anything and want even less, there are so many bargains.  Such is life.I did manage to get a few gifts purchased, downed a latte and croissant, and did some people watching which is a favorite sport AND found my car at the end of the day."},
{"title": "Life Story #21---The Wedding and the Honeymoon and the Horror of It All", "date": "Monday, November 10, 2008", "text": "A long time ago (38 years) in a land far, far away (Hawaii) a young prince of a man and a young princess of a woman met and fell in love. The prince and princess were from poorer kingdoms but the paradise of the land in which they found themselves made everything seem possible. When they could remove their noses from thick textbooks, they spent mornings on the white sand beaches, afternoons hiking in the flower-filled rain forests and evenings eating ice cream cones at the edge of posh hotel patios. The world was a magical place in those days before the mortgage witch and the health demons had found them. They had known each other only three months, but knew they were soul mates for the rest of their lives. Throwing caution to the ocean breezes, as only the young can do, they made plans to marry.Their marriage ceremony was held in a small local church and the wedding guests, none from their bloodlines unfortunately, ranged in age from the late 70's down to 10 years of age. This was certainly a good omen. The ceremony was smooth except for the slight loss of voice on the part of the Prince when he had to say \"I do\" which he managed to squeak out eventually. The Princess was slightly dismayed, but told herself it was just nervousness. The celebration, held in a nearby hotel lanai at the edge of the ocean, went on late into the evening filled with fresh seafood and fresh fruits. One hundred flower leis, that had been made by hand by the determined couple, filled the air with a tropical fragrance that could not be described. You may ask how can a poor couple afford 100 leis? (Cemeteries in Hawaii are filled with plumaria trees.) You may also ask how can a poor couple store 100 leis until their wedding day? (The University of Hawaii has a walk-in refrigerator in the biology department!)Late in the evening, the celebration finally came to an end and the couple retreated to a nearby motel to sleep a few hours before their early morning flight to the Big Island for a rustic (camping) honeymoon.The prince had made reservations at the rustic but charming Pohakuloa cabins in Mauna Kea State Park and after renting a chariot at the airport they made plans to stop in the small village for food to take to the cabin.This chariot was a luxurious Volkswagen Bug...the premium choice of transportation among the young of that generation. It did not have air-conditioning as very few chariots did on those days, but the moderate climate of the Big Island was very comfortable. With the windows open and the little \"wing\" window (this design did not survive the 70's) pushed out to bring air directly inside to the driver, the happy couple were off quite speedily.The drive was pleasantly uneventful for the first 20 minutes or so. Then, as happens in real life, without warning everything changed. The prince violently started pumping the brakes, placed both hands over his face, jerked violently forward and backward, and cried out as if in agony. The princess froze in confusion and dismay as the car bumped dangerously to the side of the road and then came to a complete stop. In the immediate silence except for the cries of the prince, the thought crossed her mind that she had known this prince only three months. What had she been thinking? What did she really know about him? What did she know about his bloodline? Was he having some seizure? Did he have some family illness that she had not known?Eventually a semi-calm returned to the prince and with water-filled eyes he turned to the princess and said, \"I have been bit by something!\" The left side of his upper lip was red with a small pin mark, and after some discussion, the couple determined that a bee had hit the \"wing\" window and had been impaled on his face.Then the discussion turned to allergies, the tenderness of the lip tissue and the dangers of that. The Prince did not think he was allergic to bee stings, but he was beginning to feel strange and weak. There were no royal physicians for miles but they determined that a military encampment was not far ahead, and perhaps, they could persuade a medic to take a look at the damages. They reached a nurse who checked all vital signs, gave the Prince a shot, and also wrote a prescription for some allergy medicine.The royal couple hurried to the nearby store with curatives and purchased the potent brew. The prince took a hearty dose and immediately fell asleep in the back of the chariot. The responsibility for navigating through the forests to the small cabin then fell on the delicate but not timid shoulders of the princess. She held back her tears and concerns as she made her way up the side of the volcano to the primitive--hardly palatial--honeymoon cabin. Upon finally reaching their destination, the royal couple unpacked their food and minuscule belongings and entered the rustic cabin. Two sleeping bags were placed on the floor and both collapsed into the reality of marriage. The princess tried to gently kiss the prince good night, but even that proved too painful an exercise. As the prince drifted into a deep sleep, the princess counted both her tears and the ants crossing in a line on the floor toward her sleeping bag.(The rest of the honeymoon ?...Well, that is another long story for another day.)"},

She acts in and writes melodramas. I never knew anyone who did that. How she found me I do not know, but I am most flattered! Of course grandchildren and the shortness of some of her entries encourages me to visit more often.Bad Aunt---Present Simple A New Zealander teaching in Japan...always rewarding reading such life adventures on a blog. She has been blogging a long time, since 2004. I have not had a chance to read many of these older entries. Since she teaches English to Asians, she probably has something in common with my recent house guest Mary Lee.Whoops, forgot to add Darlene at her \"Hodgepodge\" in Arizona. She is 83 and one of those bloggers who reassures me that life does go on and it is rich and full.

{"title": "Too Much of a Good Thing--Again", "date": "Saturday, November 08, 2008", "text": "(Photo above I took from the deck yesterday evening as the sun was setting across the river and my weary body was screaming for rest. Click on photo to see the details of the last of our fall beauty.)I have taken dozens and dozens of pictures in the yard this fall as the season peaks. The variety of tree species complimented by the diverse fall colors have been most obvious this fall, and the peak beauty has been more exciting than I have noticed in the past. Since all good things must come to an end, the prior night's wet winds brought millions of leaves to carpet everywhere. The weather yesterday was in the 70's and we knew we had to get the leaves off of the the driveway and the lawn before the coming front that would bring more leaves and more rain. We had to use our non-environmental leaf blower because the new lawn was still too wet and soft to walk on and rake and the gravel driveway does not lend itself to raking. I created large snake-like drifts of leaves in places down the long winding driveway and these we captured and put into a metal garbage can. They were broken down with the weed eater into a wonderful rich nutrition that was added to the newly created raised garden beds that now await the birth of spring. Hubby is so excited about this humus rich black gold that we have created that he cannot walk down the driveway without stopping to enjoy the results of his many days of labor.Since the ticks are dormant we can wade into the 'jungle' and clear the non-indigenous wild rose that strangles everything in its way climbing high into 30 foot trees. Even though I covered my body in loose clothing and wore jeans, the tiny tenacious thorns at the ends of the branches would fly over my head and bite me in the butt, pull off my cap, and tangle my hair as I pulled them away into the open areas. I also fought with the green briar (such a lovely name for such a nasty plant). I now look as though I had fought with a wild cat---so glad I do not care about that stuff.The day before, we had created a large and very warm brush fire with all the downed limbs and weeds we had cleared. Yesterday flew by too fast for us to start on that project once again, but now the holly, dogwood, linden trees and other plants are free to breathe once again and we have space to put in our plastic net deer fence around the perimeter. The deer have mowed the mums and trimmed my pyracantha hedge and the low growth of the new hybrid dogwood. While I spray deer repellent it has become a careful dance between them and us as their fall food cache diminishes.I awoke this morning to another carpet of leaves almost as dense as the one we cleared yesterday! Some times I think mother nature is too rich for me."},

It is odd that newspapers trumped by technology are once again front and center and in demand and some issues are selling for over $100 on the Internet due to this election. 2.  I was talking with hubby about the successful cloning of the frozen mouse and how creepy it was to think they could possibly clone a mastadon.  Hubby (ever the scientist) thought that sounded 'cool' no pun intended.  I responded with my concern about some virus for which we have no immunity that might come along with that frozen mastadon tissue.  His face fell and he said, \"Yeah, there are always hitchhikers in biology.\"3.  I am seeing more roadkill (deer) these days.  Hubby explained it was probably due to mating season.  \"The hormones rise and the deer get crazy, unlike male humans whose hormones are always up and therefore, they are always a little crazy.\"4.  I got tired of spreading the composted soil that hubby was dumping in each of the raised beds with the wheelbarrow.  Wiping the sweat from my forehead, I complained and hubby (who has a Ph.D.) said he was the one that got to pile higher and deeper and since I had only a Masters...I had to do the spreading.5.  While I was in the nearby larger town last week for my mammogram (OUCH!) I saw a sign above the door as I entered that said Medical Arts Building.  My immediate thought was that I wanted the Medical Science building not some artsy-fartsy place.6.  Hubby was reading our latest retirement financial report and sighing audibly.  I glanced over his shoulder and looked briefly at the bar graph and the line graph at the top of the report.  Since nothing was above the baseline on the bar graph I immediately said he was holding the report upside down.  He glared at me and said NO...he was right!7.  I cannot keep thinking that Condolezza Rice would be a good Secretary of State for Obama...but with Kerry in the running and being owed for all those emails I kept getting from him during this campaign, it will never happen.8.  I thought it odd that McCain drove away all by himself out of the garage at the hotel in Arizona the following morning.  Where was his wife?9.  I learned this month that it takes almost a year for birds**t to wash away by weather from the roof shingles...just a little trivia for your information.10. Speaking of birds**t, the cardinal is back and hanging out on the inside edge of the lantana pot.  He was eating the bugs, pooping into the pot and then tapping at the bottom of the deck window at his image.  Now I know why my lantana is so healthy. Hang in there, Colleen, I will try to make it to thirteen... some Thursday...but don't hold me to a theme ;-)"},
{"title": "The Morning After", "date": "Wednesday, November 05, 2008", "text": "The lines at the voting booth yesterday morning were somewhat long but it only took me 30 minutes waiting time before I did my duty as a citizen. Everyone in line was calm and friendly and the polling staff were super friendly...almost as if anticipating frustrated citizens.I came home and spent the better part of the day watching the election coverage while doing laundry, small cleaning and nursing hubby through a cold he caught from his precious granddaughter.As the rainy day progressed and the tension built I tried to keep my mind on busy activities. I channel surfed through a dozen news channels to make sure I didn't miss anything. In the P.M. I ran outside and took some pictures of the fall which has peaked in my yard but was drawn to the TV each time I came back inside. I knew and told my husband that we were not going to get any resolution on this until at least 11:00 P.M. and so we prepared for a long evening. Late in the evening after dinner, as the network I was watching ran the final vote of Virginia across the screen; we turned to each other and high-fived each other realizing that at last our hope for this country to get back on track was now very possible.I was so impressed by John McCain's speech and wondered why he had let the party base transform him into that very erratic and angry man that we had seen over the months. Yes, he was talking about losing to my candidate, but the real man came through and I realized the election could have changed on a dime if he had been his true self.Then we watched the faces of all the people in times square as Obama made his dignified and statesman-like speech. No bragging, grinning or fist pumping. He knows the huge challenges that lie ahead and that is why I voted for him. He knows that this is about turning the Democracy around as the world watches--and the international newspaper headline this morning confirm my view. I had tears in my eyes and was so elated that it took quite a while to fall asleep after watching the happy black and white families on the podium wave to the citizens.Now this morning I realize that wasn't just a romantic dream and feel so relieved...so safe...so honest once again."},
{"title": "VOTE!", "date": "Monday, November 03, 2008", "text": "Tomorrow, as early as I can muster, I will go to my polling place to vote.  I am \"dreading\" the possible rainy weather and the possible long lines since I did not decide to vote by absentee ballot.  If I had lived in this small town for longer, perhaps I would see this as an opportunity to visit with townfolk that I had not seen in a long time.  It would be an opportunity to catch up on the activities of children and grandchildren.  If I had volunteered, as I was asked a few weeks ago, to work at the polling place, I would be so busy that I would not have time to dread a long line.  Instead I would be dreading the long day!   But I passed this effort this time and actually hope to volunteer in some way in the coming years.In all honesty I am not totally dreading the voting lines or the slowness of process.  I am excited as I always have been every time I voted over the years. I am romantic and passionate about my country and the beauty of this process whereby we select those who will lead us.  Sure, sometimes my candidate doesn't get in and once or twice we even get a duffus who hasn't a clue about the constitution and the significance of the job ( like the last two presidential elections).  I only missed one vote  since I turned 18 and that was when I was living overseas and failed to get an absentee ballot on time.  Early years that I  have gone to cast my vote I took my small children with me so that they could see this important process.  I talked to them about how powerful it was and when they grew up, they all could be a participant in this process.I disagree with Sara Palin and honestly believe that every single person in line with me tomorrow will be pro-American.

{"title": "The Room With Walls or the Wren House", "date": "Monday, October 27, 2008", "text": "Due to the cooler evenings and my craving for a substantial dinner, I decided to roast a 4 pound chicken for our meal two nights ago. I marinated the fat bird in the early afternoon and started to preheat the oven. I stuffed the bird with onions and sliced apples and it took several hours to roast making the kitchen cozy and warm. Adding some cheese potatoes and a nice salad made the meal complete. When all was ready, hubby and I sat down to a perfect late October dinner. We threw our healthy caution to the wind and proceeded to stuff our little stomachs to the brim. With my last swallow of wine, I pushed myself back from the table and wondered if I would regret my piggyness. Hubby graciously offered to clean up after dinner and I slowly burped my way upstairs to read some blogs. I heard him banging the roasting pan lid trying to get it clean. He called up to me asking what he should do with the drippings at the bottom of the pan. I did not want all that tempting but unhealthy fatty salty broth sitting around and suggested he may want to dump it in the woods outside.I heard him open the front door and then I heard him bang the pan on the stoop and I heard a whuffet sound and my husband swearing softly under his breath.When I called down asking about the commotion, he said that the new porch resident, a wren, flew into his face. We have a little wren that has tried to set up tenancy in my autumn door decoration and with the addition of the bug-filled split wood for the fire now added to the porch, she has a grocery store just beneath her new home.I could hear the door was still open. \"She didn't get in, did she?\" I asked.\"I am afraid she did.\" hubby sighed.Well the next hour (or what seemed like an hour) of our leisure evening with stomachs full of food was spent trying to encourage a small wren to leave the house. We closed all the doors and cupboards and turned off the ceiling fans. I had to get out the very, very long light-bulb changing pole to make her leave her perch on the chains of our hanging foyer lights in the second story. Hubby almost destroyed the geranium I had recently brought inside and placed on a corner near the window as she tried to hide behind that plant several times.After depositing bird doo on various walls, she eventually tucked in behind some decorative basket ware that we have on the shelf above the foyer. Hubby was determined to get out and balance on that shelf and try to catch her, but I was adamant that I was not willing to add a visit to the emergency room to this evening's adventures and insisted that we try alternatives.We don't have a butterfly net, but in desperation, got out the fish net to see if we could capture her. Of course, the weave is too big and although we swooped it over her several times, she acrobatically made it through the holes. Once hubby and I almost bumped heads as we dived for her, temporarily caught beneath the net on the kitchen floor.Eventually she became tired and we were able to catch her in our hands. We very gently and carefully took her out the front door where she instantly dive bombed into the shelter of the wood on the porch. I sw her hopping around the porch today, appearing none the worse for wear, but chiding me in her whistling fashion. (The photo above is of another wren, perhaps a juvenile relative, that was on our deck this summer.)"},
{"title": "Full Fathom Five", "date": "Saturday, October 25, 2008", "text": "According to a search that I completed on the Internet, 101 submarine movies have been made and viewed by American audiences over the years. I have, oddly enough, been attracted to submarine movies and I am guessing that is because I would be terrified to be out on a submarine. My fear of being beneath the surface of the ocean and being cramped in a metal machine probably allowed me to enjoy vicariously the challenges by watching the adventures of submariners much the same way that people watch horror movies. Therefore, as I perused the Internet list, I have seen approximately 30 of these movies. I do not read books about submariners and their adventures or the history of the Navy.But, I had been reading Mary Lee Coe Fowler's blog about living in Maine for over a year and when she published her book, I decided to give it a try.ML's book is introduced this way on the cover:\"Mary Lee Coe Fowler was a posthumous child, born after her father, a submarine skipper in the Pacific, was lost at sea in 1943. Her mother quickly remarried into a difficult and troubled relationship, and Mary Lee’s biological father was never mentioned. It was not until her mother died and Mary Lee was a middle-aged adult that she set out to learn not only who her father was, but what happened to him and his crew, and why—and also to confront why she had shied away from asking these questions until it was nearly too late.\"The book is filled with the extensive and dedicated research that she did to find all of the puzzle pieces to put this compelling story together. It was a rush against time as many of the people she talked to and corresponded with were quite elderly. But it is not written like a research treatise. I found it easy to identify with the little girl in search of her father, her mother who finds romance with a young Navy man, and the young seamen whose lives depend on the leadership of this man, her father. Having traveled throughout Hawaii and the South Pacific and having seen the remains of the war with the Japanese on some of these Pacific Islands, I was very familiar with the setting of the latter part of this book.I learned about the bureaucracy of the Navy Department, and how back then, much like today, a bureaucratic and career protectionist leadership can hinder the safety and success of the missions we give to our sailors (military). I was inspired by the tremendous dedication these Navy men gave to their jobs under very difficult conditions.This is a well-written and also compelling story. ML is able to step back and give the story the balance it needs as she searches for the truth about her father. It is one that is, perhaps, enjoyed more by readers with the perspective that comes with age and experience. So, if you are looking for some good reading as the seasons change and you must remain indoors for longer times, I can certainly recommend this book by the fireside."},
{"title": "Meeting the Spirit of Blogging", "date": "Wednesday, October 22, 2008", "text": "The ghost of Mary Lee Many bloggers, especially those who have been posting for a number of years, have had an opportunity to meet and greet an actual person that has a blog that they have been reading.  While I was fascinated by this social activity, as I would read about the event in the many other blogs, I often felt that it must be something like a blind date... exciting in the beginning but usually somewhat disappointing at the end.  We all have images and expectations of these bloggers that we think we know from regular reading of their blog, but to put these expectations to the test I felt would only result in somewhat of a failure.  What we see through the blog can be revealing, but we are complicated individuals and I think we only see a ghost of that person since we are not able to read any body language or hear a tone of voice in the sometimes superficial ongoing digital conversations that we have.I had an opportunity to meet a 'blogmate' recently and was filled with a little dread in the beginning...would they like me...do they really know me...do I know them?!  I mean this wasn't just a lunch date, I actually invited her to spend the night.  I live in an out-of-the-way place and when someone visits it means they have an hour and half drive to the activity that brought them to this area in the first place if they decide stop by my house as part of their travels.I wrote Tammy about this potential meet-up to voice my concerns because she meets bloggers fairly often, many of them involved in her mission in life.  She encouraged me to go for it and insisted that I would not be unhappy with the meet-up at all.  While I realized I should take her advice I also took it with a grain of salt knowing that Tammy is a really nice person and I cannot imagine her meeting anyone that she would not be able to adapt to or like.  So when Mary Lee Fowler emailed me that she was coming to give several book talks in my area and wanted to see if we could meet and also asking how close I was to several nearby cities and towns where she would be, I offered to drive up for a coffee or lunch.  Then I threw caution to the wind and also asked if she would like to come down my way.  I explained that it was a lengthy trip and she should plan on spending the night if that could be worked into her schedule. She accepted!   Of course, the closer we got to the day, I became a 'little' nervous wondering about her expectations and mine.  Some of the few readers of my blog may be wondering about my maturity right now...but I am a little anal and want things to go fairly well or not at all.  (ML is probably smiling at this revelation as she reads this.)Well, of course, the meet-up went very well.  We were in sync on politics and religion and didn't have any tension in talking about the things for which we feel great passion.  We also both love the out-of-doors and worked in a long morning wooded walk to a small beach, which is a great activity for someone who has been sitting in a car for over 10 hours.  She had to leave by early afternoon which gave us just enough time to not get tired of each other.  I cannot help but think how brave she is to drive alone almost 600 miles to meet a stranger and spend the night in their house!  I don't know that I would have that fearlessness.  I certainly hope she sold a lot of books.BlogmatesNext post I will write about her book which I read."},

I am very very tired of hearing how getting an ivy league education makes you an elitist.  It makes you (or means your already were) smart and/or rich...and only, perhaps if lucky or hardworking, you can become a member of the elite.   Was our last Ivy League educated president an elitist?  (Def. elite:  being an expert in an area.)2.  I am very very tired of class warfare. Some rich citizens are greedy crooks and/or lazy and some poor citizens are greedy crooks and/or lazy. Making everyone a black or white peg is even more lazy and cannot help solve our problems.  Most of us are hard working and honest.3.  I am very very tired of all the hoopla about the price of gas. We in American are not having any effect on its rise or fall in price anymore...other countries are.  We have lost our strong economic lead in the world...get over it.4.  I am very very tired of hearing how the \"bailout/rescue\" package will work. Anything it does is temporary. The economy will be forced to correct itself when the value of everything from stocks to housing prices to jobs reaches true values once again and this will be months and months from now. There will be more death and destruction along the way. (Most of the rich will be impacted only in the amount of caviar they can consume.)5. I am very very tired of hearing talking heads on TV discuss the stupid issues and refuse to delve into the more complicated issues because we are a nation of channel surfers and want our news microwaved not baked.  (ACORN is a primary example.)6.  I am very very tired of  Barack Obama being touted as the first Black American candidate who has gotten close to being elected.  Our culture is so prejudiced that his mother's heritage is trumped by any tinge of 'other.'  I've got news, if elected he will be our first Bi-racial President.7.  I am very very tired of the lack of statesmanship and honesty that this election has been reduced to.  Both sides have gotten mud all over themselves and it isn't even solid enough to make good pottery.  Where are the great leaders?8.  I am very very tired of the argument that 'experience' trumps intelligence when we are looking for leadership.  A President will have access to great advice.  So if an intelligent  candidate seems inexperienced look at the advisers that he/she selects. And of course the counter argument put out is that being an insider and having lots of experience is bad.  Just look at the their record.9.  I am very very tired of the lack of transparency in our Republican candidates.  John McCain's wife said that Sarah Palin was vetted very carefully and she was ready for prime time and to \"Bring it on.\"  OK, when is this babe ready for taking on the \"liberal press?\"  As Tina Fey comments, she gets lost in a corn maze when talking about important issues.  (I remember Bush's restriction of access by the press and lack of press conferences.  The free press may be mostly liberal because it constantly questions, but truth trumps all.)10.  I am very very tired of the fact that this Presidential election has taken the focus off of our Congressional and State elections.   This is where much important work will be done in this economy.  Thus, I am all for shorter campaign trails with more restricted spending on them.  (Disclosure:  Since I have recently moved to this local part of the state I need to get my game on in this area.)Now I will go take a nap and not rant about this election anymore because whomever inherits this mess deserves a medal, it is a promise!"},

I said to my husband that my mother would be greatly dismayed to learn, after my expensive college education, I had become a 'ditch digger' in my old age. His response: \"At least it's your own ditch!\"2. I do not know which I hated most yesterday as I sat on a small stool in the dirt and wound large bolts into the posts of the retaining wall...the smell of the deer repellent I had just sprayed throughout the yard or the smell of the Deet that I had sprayed on my legs due to the mosquitoes.3. We are approaching what is called 'open season' in the health care world and my husband and I will be changing health insurance carriers. Why do I think this is going to be a maze from which I will probably need hospital care?4. I have been married 38 years yet I keep forgetting that when my husband asks if I want to go for a boat ride, he really means do I want to spend 4 hours fishing up and down the bay---NOT a lovely sunset ride with a glass of wine in hand?5. My kitchen floor is frequently covered with bits of food after cooking which is a very good reason I need to get a dog. My floors were clean when I had a dog. Even the one-year-old granddaughter cannot keep my floors clean these days.6. I am thinking about letting my hair go gray...yep...Oddly, Hubby is more shocked about this thought than I am.7. #6 above means I am probably letting myself go in retirement, but I still put on mascara and lipstick before I head to the Post Office. All of my vanity is not totally gone.8. The whole family sat around the metal fireplace that we put out on the new patio last weekend. I noticed that sitting around fires keeps the 20 and 30-somethings and even the little ones subdued long enough to have great conversations.9. Loving this 80 degree weather but I know that the colder fall air is jet-streaming over the trees this week.10. I have been using the elliptical machine fairly regularly (running 2.5 miles about 3 times a week) and after much sweat---real, honest, disgusting sweat---I have finally lost 10 pounds. 15 to go...I hate the elliptical...love the free weights and the yoga and most especially the stretching at the end when I get to lie down."},
{"title": "Who is to Blame?", "date": "Wednesday, October 15, 2008", "text": "The media seems to be ignoring the statistics and facts on the demographics of the subprime crises perhaps because they are not sexy.   But, by paying attention to these demographics we can perhaps craft a better fix so that it does not happen again.\"The problem with portraying the foreclosure crisis as a minority and low-income problem is that it affects how solutions will be approached. If, on one hand, it is believed that subprime rate loans were predominately made to marginal segments of society (Black, Hispanic or low-income) housing policymakers may approach solutions with bias assumptions about minorities and minority qualifications (low education,  bad credit, and low-paying jobs, etc.). Thus, there may a tendency to write-off the subprime lending debacle as a type of affirmative action gone bad. On the other hand, if it is believed that the foreclosure crisis affects broader and moredemographically diverse segments of society then a more politically responsible approach is likely, thereby changing the tone, climate and context of how solutions are crafted.Not enough research and media attention has been devoted to other causes of the subprime crisis that may have race and gender effects. Issues of steering, weak underwriting, fraud, and discrimination have not been aggressively investigated. Despite the presence of federal regulation and periodic examinations for safety and soundness, Community Reinvestment Act compliance and fair lending compliance, efforts to uncover whether subprime rate loans can be explained by legitimate business justifications will be impaired based on erroneous assumptions about thedemographic distribution of subprime rate loans.Last, if it is believed that subprime rate lending is predominately an urban minority problem, officials will fail to see that in 2006 non-Hispanic Whites had 1,108,676 subprime rate loans of which 868,806 or 78.36% were in census tracts <30% minority. The subprime lending meltdown is better described as a mainstream white suburbia problem with aspects that affect minorities and urban communities.  Erroneous assumptions about the demographics of subprime rate lending will only lead to poor decisions that result in ineffective solutions.\"  The whole report is here:In addition, note that the primary areas for defaults on subprimes are in the states of Florida, California, Arizona and Nevada and a substantial number of these defaults are for NON_OWNER occupied homes.We can't fix this if we don't fully understand the details and try to determine the causes."},

{"title": "Fall Projects", "date": "Thursday, October 09, 2008", "text": "We had saved up a sum of money to put in a patio under our deck this fall and we now realize that was better than leaving it in the market!  For the past week or so we have been doing our little bit for the economy by employing almost 4 men full time to clear grass, put in drains, set paver stone, aerate the lawn and seed the destroyed areas.  It was supposed to take a little less than 4 days, but I think that with economy slowing down the landscape firm was in no rush to have staff return to the store and sit waiting for another assignment and so the crew was actually here for 7 days which did not increase the cost of the contract.During that time my husband and I began clearing the garden and moving ALL of the soil (he did most of the work as I have been fighting some illness) and now we will level the whole area and put in a series of raised container beds.  We spent the last of the wad of money on cedar boards--the worst grade they had which is stunningly beautiful even so---for the walls of the beds.  Hopefully with landscape cloth and mulch on the paths between the beds, we will get some control over the weeds next year.They had to tear up the lawn with the little bulldozer, but also aerated and reseeded the areas and now we wait for the lawn to come up once again.  We also had them take down some dead trees on the edge of the lawn in the front yard, and now, guess what?  I get to put in ANOTHER flower bed.  (I still haven't gotten the deer fence up but I tend to be more optimistic than realistic!)  The far side of this bed will be for cut flowers.  I love cutting flowers and bringing them inside the house to enjoy as I do my chores.The new patio provides a rather large sitting area beneath the deck that will be handy during the hottest part of summer and also nice for fall when we want to sit around a small fire pit.  Right now a fine layer of dust and dirt is everywhere --- on the window sills, the deck chairs, the potted plants and the brick.  Thus the project today, if the weather stays warm enough, is to wash all of the outside before the grandchildren show up on the weekend.   S'mores anyone?"},

It was a good cause, but I am glad he still has his day job.The location, Constitution Gardens, was perfect for both dogs and their owners.

I haven't attended one of these in a decade and discovered in my old age that my palate can get quite tired of the swishing and not swallowing  as much as it got tired of the actual drinking.  There is only so much wine an old palate can survey before it all starts tasting the same.  I decided I was going to just compare the cabernet sauvignons, pinot grigios and maybe a chardonnay or two...but I also came across a new wine called a traminette. Some of you may  be familiar with this white wine, which used to be NY65.533.13 and has only recently been given the name Traminette.  It was developed at Cornell---those aggies have a grape breeding program. If you go to the link you can see that the wine grows best in a climate such as the mid-Atlantic and thus the one I tasted was both fruity/spicy and also smooth without being sweet.  So with a 15% discount I had to pick up 6 bottles of this and then 6 of another wine they had, the Viognier.  This is an old grape but also one with which I am not familiar..  Its buttery flavor on the tongue was what won me over.I now have a mixed case of white wines to get me through the crisp fall days.  I also bought a small basket of fuji apples that are so crunchy sweet we may eat them all before I get around to making another pie.  I sliced (too lazy to peel) them and fried them in butter, brown sugar, threw in some cinnamon, freshly ground nutmeg, black walnuts and some dried sweet cranberries...a dessert that was so quick and easy last night and put the perfect ending on our dinner of fresh corn on the cob, tomato salad and crab from the dock.

{"title": "Where Have All the Leaders Gone?", "date": "Sunday, September 28, 2008", "text": "A month ago I heard Jim Webb, best selling author, on National Public Radio talk about America's current situation.   I liked so much what he said and even more so the tenor of his speech that I immediately ordered his book \"A Time to Fight, Reclaiming a Just and Fair America.\"  I am not as smart as I should be and I really didn't know anything about Webb prior to this radio interview and prior to reading this book.  He is a bestselling author, a former much-decorated marine, an award winning journalist, a highly placed member of the Reagen administration and now a Senator with a son who fought as a marine in Iraq.I have just finished this book and was relieved to find that intelligence and common sense do exist in at least one member of the Senate these days.  This is not a fun read nor a beach read, but something that helped me put together the pieces of the puzzle that form the picture of America today.  This book reassured me that leadership of the right kind can set this country back on track.  Rome is burning, but its citizens can put out the fire with this election.\"In short, our problems are not systemic, as in those of other countries where despair, tyranny, and revolution became the order of the day. ..Our challenges are not in repairing our system of government but in improving the way we have been selecting our leaders. .. Those who do not want significant reform in America enjoy the emotional arguments that occupy hours of political commentary while keeping our citizens distracted from the issues that truly threaten our future.  Should we imprison people who burn our flag?  Should gays be permitted to marry? Can you love the troops and still hate the war? Should Britney spears be allowed to keep her kids?  Did Charlie Wilson use cocaine?...\"We need to get past these artificialities and focus on the long-term good of the country.  And today, the inalienable bottom line of solving America's may problems is to simply find good leaders and hold them accountable.\"I saw the most recent debate and I am voting for the candidate who was not condescending, could look his opponent in the eye, dismissed simple solutions, and kept all options open, including diplomacy, in solving the worlds most dangerous problems.

Those who made 6+ figure salaries and bonuses and actually had authority to make these greedy decisions should be sent home to lick their wounds and use this as a learning experience.  There is no doubt in my mind that many of them have sheltered most of their wealth prior to this debacle anyway.  I do not trust those on Paulson's team who decide who gets this big bag of money.  I do not like the fact that they are giving the greedy and stupid a pass while those banks and investment firms that were careful and honest will not be rewarded for their contributions to keeping our economy stable.  Maybe the money should go to those smaller banks and investment firms who are not in the red and let them decided which 'toxic' assets they wish to purchase at a discount.  Let the Feds work on regulation---again!!Having written the hard line above, I must admit that I have the luxury of not having to live off of my small stock portfolio which has already lost 30%.  I have a small retirement salary that is insured by the feds as does my husband, our health insurance is insured and transferable and our daily needs  have been reduced greatly in retirement.  Our home is paid for.  Our biggest expense is property taxes, but the value of my home has fallen 13%---so maybe in a year or two I will be rewarded by that.Yes, I accept that inflation will rise rapidly (which it may do anyway) and that affects those who are not as lucky as I am.  Perhaps we can use this money to stimulate that side of the economy, subsidizing fixed needs--let socialism rear is ugly head.  I also accept that heating oil may triple in costs as will food.   I also realize that my portfolio may disappear.  Those who, with pain and sacrifice, lived through the Great Depression came through and were wiser and stronger.  Maybe this is the dose of medicine America needs when we complain about how expensive it is to heat our swimming pools and eat in 4 star restaurants and plan those huge weddings and put gas in our luxury transportation vehicles.  We already use most of the worlds resources per capita and now is time to pay the piper for that lifestyle."},

This point is the southernmost point of the United States and from what I remember during the two times I have visited there, it is a windy and vast and humbling place.   If you walk toward the water you will see the green sand beaches where polished olivine mineral colors the sand with lime green.  I love places like these.  I love the desolate parts of the desert in the mid-west where the sound of human civilization is not heard.  You are all alone and you can almost feel as if you are the only person on the planet.  South Point also gives this isolated and breathtaking feeling.  My inner spirit does not  shrink with loneliness or fear or loss in places like these.  I do not feel alone, but instead, feel as if I am part of something so big and so wonderful that I also have a place on the vast green beach just like the grains of sand.  These isolated places are restorative for me.  They give  me some perspective on my daily problems and concerns.While visting South Point, my husband encountered a Canadian couple on their honey-moon trying to take their own picture.  He volunteered assistance and that lead to a conversation about the U.S. election.  The Canadians asked my husband where he stood in this time in our history.  My husband is an ardent supporter of Barrack Obama as he feels his ideas reflect global views and reasonable approaches.  He explained that having a President of color would also improve the skewed view that the world currently has of us.  It would show that we have moved beyond prejudice and finally grown up as a country.   As they talked, the Canadians could not believe that there was still prejudice in the United States to the extent it would affect an election.Well, it appears from a recent poll that the evidence  (and I caution my readers that I do not place much weight in political polls nor do I think the connection of the dots in this particular poll is necessarily supported)  does not bode well for our evolution as a country.  If you are still afraid of something different, big changes or concerned with something you do not understand about human behavior that bothers you, I strongly recommend you take a course in Critical Thinking."},

After all, we were going to be pretty close to Asia and I might get a chance to visit those many exotic and intriguing countries...and I eventually did!

I actually lived on Oahu for over a year when I went to graduate school there.  I spent my honey-moon on the big island---which is very interesting life story in itself that I have to blog some day.  I have passed through the tropical state and spent weekends recuperating on return trips from living or visiting various parts of Asia.So, yes, Kenju, I did pass up the trip to Hawaii.  I do know that I am not so jaded that had the month been January or February, I probably would have thrown a swimsuit into a bag and jumped at the opportunity.  But for now, retirement and free scheduling around my house are still very fulfilling.  After all, yesterday I cleaned out the refrigerator for the first time in two years!   And today I have on my schedule to paint those two large iron suns that hang above the garage doors so that they match the window frame colors more closely.  (Smile.)Sometimes, being jaded just means you have lived a pretty rich and fulfilling life."},

Thus I finished the apples and peaches and have a freezer full of pie fillings.  Next my energies were focused on filling ice cube trays with parmesan pesto to use up a lot of the basil.  Then I filled the cookie sheets with leaves of Thai basil, licorice basil, and lemon basil and then put those trays into the freezer for about 20 minutes.  Then working like Speedy Gonzales I placed the flat leaves into zip lock freezer bags for this winter's meals. Finally, I have begun to fall behind on using the fresh tomatoes---and believe me, this year we have a very small harvest because my husband put in a fast garden.  I dread the tons of tomatoes we will harvest next year when he really gets his game on.  I had to preserve the plum tomatoes and so I made my version of tomato sauce---which means I am too lazy to remove the seeds---and I got about two quarts of garlic, basil tomato sauce which I froze.  I might have been able to make more if I had been less sloppy!One of the nicest things about retirement is that one can enjoy life's harvest at leisure.  I do not have to cram all this cooking into a weekend along with doing the laundry and driving kids places and paying bills!  I can actually slow down and smell the sauce and take my time in labeling the zip locks and plastic containers so that I know what in the world these gray freezer bags contain when snow is on the ground and I need something for dinner.  I can actually take time to rearrange the freezer under the refrigerator and the chest freezer in the garage so that the older things are near the top.  (We finally finished the last of the frozen crab from last year this summer!)Yes, one of the things about getting old is that it tends to be all about food!"},

For some historians the Battle of Gettysburg was the turning point in America's Civil War.  The fact that hundreds of books, new ones each year, are written about America's Civil War are testament to this wound that still scars our history.The photo above seems so sterile compared to the lives lost and blood soaked ground that it represents.\"In the aftermath of the battle, every farm field was a graveyard and every church, public building and even private homes were hospitals.\"While reading some information about this war I came across this quote:\"The most astute theologian of the crisis, a layperson named Abraham Lincoln, framed the issue in simple terms: \"Both sides read the same Bible and pray to the same God.\" And since they prayed for different outcomes, \"the prayers of both could not be answered.\" In an environment like ours in which the role of religion in public life is energetically debated and values such as freedom are said not to be \"America's gift to the world\" but instead \"'God's gift to humanity,\" the Civil War provides a cautionary tale about the limits of religious belief in guiding a democracy.\"Sound familiar?  I guess what amazes me is how easily some folks take the high ground without a second thought.  They clearly have a clearer channel to the pure truth than I do."},

{"title": "JOY", "date": "Thursday, September 04, 2008", "text": "There is clearly not enough joy shown by me in my life and the older I get the less it rears its orange head.There are common places to find joy...other's joy...dogs, grandchildren, newlyweds, rock stars. Once self-consciousness and self-awareness begin to grow as we become teenagers and young adults, it seems that the joy level in many people gets buried under what looks right and what feels normal and what we know is acceptable. Or it manifests itself as dorkiness.Sure, there are lots of cool souls that keep their joy levels erupting at regular intervals and feeding energy into the atmosphere for the rest of us. I remember years ago going to a country western bar at Disney World, and as the band started playing, this 70-something lady in a country western skirt and shirt began clapping her hands high over her head as she stood in front of the band and let the music fill her soul. She was singing out and having the best time of her life and would have been acting this way even if no one else was in the room. I am guessing that she would not need a country western band to let her joy show. She is the kind of person that probably shows joy in a perfect morning breeze! You know, the person who throws their head back and grins at the sky as they walk.Several of \"my\" bloggers are the joy-filled type. I could get a whole new perspective if I hung out with them. They savor the minutes and give thanks through passionate release of joy each day.I will give you a full-faced smile, but that is the extent of my dorkiness release. I am married to someone who has no problem dancing in the streets at a moments notice. He can get excited like a puppy dog at bait fish jumping or a lovely sunset. He is that balding wild guy at the wedding that has a ton of fun without a sip of alcohol. And,yes, the joyful energy is magnetic.Hey, I can show happiness...but joy(?), I have always been too auto-pilot self-conscious. I guess I have to work on that before turn into an old fart."},

Very soothing.5)  If you are going to the toy store to pick out a toy you have to be firm that the little one STAYS in the shopping cart.  If you give in and let him free, all is lost.6)  Waking up to the sound of a little voice rather than an alarm clock is golden.7)  Bubble baths in the big tub are very wet even if you are not the one getting the bubble bath.  And it is very wicked if your daughter puts some \"squirty balls\" in the overnight bag.8)  The biggest surprise of all this week was that he never got homesick.  Sitting on the couch one evening, he asked my why I have my own house.  And one other night he asked about his mommy and daddy.  But not once did he fell sad or ask to go home.  We are heading out late this afternoon to return to his home after a brief appointment and I will miss him soooooo much!  I will miss him from the earth to the sun as he says.9)  I do know how to count my blessings."},

{"title": "My Little Secret", "date": "Saturday, August 23, 2008", "text": "This next week I will be taking care of my grandson, Xman, since his Montessori school has closed for 8 days.  My daughter took off from work last week for three days to watch him and when she asked us to take him this week, we agreed.  It will save her money and we love the child, so, are more than happy to get geared up for the challenge.  He is inquisitive, emotional and self-centered.  He is physically active and has no fear.  He finds joy in most things but can get quite unhappy when he doesn't get his way.  I am guessing that without Dad or Mom or the 'other grandmother' to run interference for him, he will be more amenable to hearing a 'no' now and then.I have my reservations on his homesickness level as this will be the first time that this 3+ year-old will be away from both parents and his home for at least four nights and five days.  I know that it will be a good growing experience, but that does not mean we won't have down times.  I am going out to buy some games and videos this afternoon as tranquilizers if needed. Xman then gets returned on Friday of next week by us.  Then my son's girl friend has talked him into coming down on Sunday and spending the night through Labor Day to spend time with us.  My Secret is  that, guiltily, I did not invite my daughter for this three day weekend as well, because I would really like some adult only time with my son and his girl.  Hubby wanted everyone here for that three-day weekend, but I would end up doing most of the cooking and much of the babysitting and wouldn't  get a chance for adult exchange and told him that.  My daughter and I can rarely complete sentences with each other when both little ones are underfoot!

{"title": "The City Mouse and The Country Mouse", "date": "Tuesday, August 12, 2008", "text": "The majority of my recent adult life I have lived in the suburbs and most recently I have lived in the city...or within walking distance of one of the city centers.  I enjoyed the ability to be able to walk to a large movie theater and safely walk home after seeing the movie.  I enjoyed being able to walk to restaurants, and even better, being able to visit a large Borders Book store and waste away a Sunday afternoon.Then we started and finished that epic part of our lives where we built the cliche retirement home in the country.  We are so far into the country that, if I have my bedroom windows open, I hear roosters crowing in the distance in the early morning.  I hear strange noises in the night such as large limbs falling from trees in the ravine or screech owls as the dawn breaks.  Yes, living in the woods is just as noisy as living in the city.I love the country, but schizophrenic soul that I am, I also miss the city.  I miss the restaurants and plays and museums and little stores for shopping.   Last year we learned that our small town, which consisted primarily of a brand new post office, a corner gas station, a liquor store, and the elementary school, was going to build a new shopping center...actually two little centers within a quarter mile of each other.  These were not malls, but traditional shopping centers: one anchored by a SuperGiant grocery.  It has been exciting watching the one area go up with a doughnut shop, a cleaners, a pharmacy, a steak and ale house, a small exercise gym, a  real estate office, a nic-nac shop and a second liquor store among others.The second and slightly larger shopping area started with a Starbucks!  This got me excited but in the year it has been open, I have driven by each time on my way to the post office and not stopped once.  This second center, which is just down the road, added the Giant grocery, a Food Shoppers grocery, another cleaners, two pizza restaurants(!), another pharmacy, another liquor store, another doughnut shop--this one with an ice cream wing, two mexican restaurants, one Korean restaurant (totally awful food and terrible service), one Japanese/Chinese  restaurant (serving even worse food in a clinical plastic table atmosphere), and a paint store.   There are several finished buildings waiting to be leased, but I have long since given up any interest.Is this a country thing?  What economics planning went into this development?  This is a rural community,  although with a nearby military base and all the resulting contracting companies, a nearby atomic energy plant that is adding another reactor, and a growing community of city retirees---I don't view this as a typical rural community.I drive by a large dirt filled area behind the new bank and hold my breath while wishing for a movie theater with a wine/beer/cheese bar attached and a little second hand bookstore on the side or a branch of the library which is 12 miles away.  I also would love a non-chain restaurant that serves interesting and healthy food.Yes, I know.  If I want all this I should move back to the city."},

{"title": "Some Bad Karma--Life Story #15", "date": "Wednesday, July 30, 2008", "text": "Fear is a really useful but also dangerous energy in this life.  (The most obvious recent example of the bad things fear can do is the 100's of  thousand deaths of innocent people caused by this stupid war brought about in fear of a vague enemy.)  I have not been truly afraid for a long, long time and so this recent fear came to me as a strong jolt, and in hindsight, I am not all that proud of how I reacted.Hubby was working down at the dock getting the boat cleaned and I had finished some errands in the house and was heading down to ask him some question.   We were going to take some friends out on the boat that afternoon, and since we are all getting older, one of my routines is to pick up all the newly fallen broken sticks and branches in the path to the boat so that no one accidentally falls on the hilly path.When I reached the dock and hubby emerged from the small boat cabin, I asked how things were going.  He looked at me and asked me,\"Didn't you see the dead copperhead on the path?\"I, who had so carefully scanned each and every inch of that path picking up snake-sized sticks did not see anything out of the ordinary, and I told him that.  He looked at me in disbelief wondering how I could have missed it.  He explained that he had almost stepped on it as a bucket in his hand had blocked the view of the path and he immediately knew he would dispatch it with a large log by smashing the head.  (Killing snakes is not nice even if they are poisonous, but he had a grandson who ran willy nilly to the dock recently, and therefore, we would not be able to sleep at night letting this pit viper survive.)Hubby followed me back up the path to show me the location of the snake with the smashed head.  We got there and we peered every which way.  There was no snake.  Hubby was sure he had crushed the small skull, and therefore, wondered if in the short ten minute span an animal had taken it away to eat.  I said it might have been alive enough to crawl under one of the logs lining the path. We poked around another minute or so and then decided it had snuck away to die a slow but peaceful death.  I turned to head back up the hill and as I got closer to the top I saw the fat  fellow just a foot away.  It lay right in the middle of the black sand path  as still as a curved stick and looked none the worse for wear.  If you have never seen a copperhead, it is truly a beautiful animal.  It almost looks as though some artist had painted the coppery and grayish tones of color across its back with a brush.But, this close encounter caused me to almost swallow my  tongue as I leaped back to my husband's side.  It had appeared as if by magic out of nowhere.  It was fat and healthy and not moving---thank goodness.  If it had been scurrying, I would have probably swallowed both my tongue and heart in fear.  Hubby quickly grabbed another large piece of wood and pinned its head against the sand once again.  I told my husband not to move while I hurried up the path to the garage for the shovel.  When I returned he severed the head quickly with the edge of the shovel and we threw the beautiful animal into the river.I realize that copperheads are not as aggressive as people commonly believe and that the freezing in place was its defence mechanism and that we should have just tossed him by stick into the woods to go on his way or walked widely around him.  But neither my husband or I could bring ourselves to be so fair.  We were frightened for our grandchildren and that deep primitive urge to protect our own rushed forward bringing with it adrenaline and no immediate regret as we ended the life of this innocent animal.I am sad that I did this, but I also am honest with myself and mother nature, in that I would certainly do the same again.(Seems to be an unusual amount of references to snakes, rubber and real, in my blog these days!!

Remember, it is said that you sometimes get what you wish for...Recipe for potential disaster,  mix the following carefully:         4 thirty-somethings--two males and two females          2 toddlers--11 months and 12 months          2 preschoolers--3 + years old          2 old fartsIf your first-born grandson sleeps in your room because the baby sister is sick with a fever, you will not need an alarm clock.  He will present you with a rubber snake before the sun is up.Fortunately, he can pretty much dress himself.  This is very useful as your eyes are not yet open, and, unlike him, you cannot form complete sentences.  Thus, you are not much help.Baby sister does not let a little flu bug hold her down.  She may have gotten the household  up three or four times crying with a stopped up nose and congested lungs, but she still takes her morning crawl right after  a breakfast of blueberry pancakes.  Note to new grandparents...you had better keep up!  Mommy is barely functioning.Once you pass the test to see if you can get to all the dangerous places in the house before the crawler and retrieve all the bugs you thought you had vacuumed, then it is time to go on the post-breakfast constitutional.  This usually results in one or the other being carried on the way back as the morning gets hotter.  Do not hold your breath as you will not be the one to be carried.After lunch it is time for the mid-day swim.  Remember to keep your camera dry because you will get wet even though you do not get into the tiny pool.No one is safe from getting wet including the local wildlife.The first day begins to wind down with a toe counting exercise.  As luck would have it all of them have all of their toes!!And, as usual, it is the male of the species that crashes just before dinner as the sun is receding behind the trees.Footnotes:1)The adult males were the only ones who had time to play several games of ping pong, fish from the dock and actually stay up late and watch a movie.  How in the hell we let them get away with that I don't know, but we continue to let them think they are the stronger and smarter.2) This visit 90% of the folks were excellent eaters and praised my meals until I got that warm glow of energy to do it all again the next day.3)  Tabor lost 1.5 pounds!!  I have been putting in two miles on the elipitcal many mornings with out budging any fat cells.  I just need more weekends like these where I never sit and rarely eat."},

It is cubist in form and was about fours inches in size.  Any ideas anyone?  What are the chances of a mycologist reading my blog?  And, no, we didn't drop anything chemical in nature...that we can think of."},
{"title": "Glutton for Punishment?", "date": "Wednesday, July 23, 2008", "text": "Oh, yes, I guess that is what I am...a glutton for punishment.  Sometimes it seems that things happen to me without any pro activeness on my part. Actually I do know that this coming weekend was not even a glimmer of an idea in my mind, because I have been sleeping so well these evenings.  Certainly this was actually all my daughter's idea.  I do NOT remember initiating this.  I do not even remember talking about it at length with anyone...but then, one of the lovely attributes of getting older is that darn forgetting part.  Just because you do not have it written on the calender, does not mean it was not scheduled.  After all, it WAS on someone else's calendar.Tabor's B&B is once again opening for weekend business.  It seems that my daughter and her husband and her two toddlers are joining us ALONG with her friend and her friend's husband and THEIR TWO TODDLERS.  Yes, I will be entertaining four very tired adult parents and four very active tots under the age of 3.5 that are pretty much as mobile and curious as un-housebroken puppy dogs.  This may be just the breakthrough I need to lose those last 5...10...alright, 15(!) pounds.I have planned a menu or two and am cleaning the house, although with four little rugrats being set loose, only God knows why!  I have battened down the hatches, even though I have found that little fingers are really experts at hatches.  I have stocked the 'larder' with applesauce, microwave mac & cheese, colored goldfish, and frozen juice bars.  I will set up the small rubber swimming pool with grandmotherly sprightliness.  I will take my vitamins.   If I were the religious type, I would pray, but perhaps some of you can do that for me.OH, this should be so much fun...right?  Photos to follow..."},
{"title": "The New Blogger", "date": "Tuesday, July 22, 2008", "text": "While leaping into the new blogger and using the easier editing features which add the ability to change fonts, background colors, and to some extent, drag and drop various page elements, I also found that adding links to a list such as the blog roll was much easier.  To create the blog roll you just have to add the URL into a window menu and it will automatically add the blog name as well as organize it by title or by most recent blog entry!  Saves me a lot of time not writing the html code for a bulleted list as I did in the old days.  The template that I chose was not as flexible, but maybe I will fiddle with another template in the future and just make it part II while linking back to the old blog...!"},

I usually post in low-res for those who do not have great band-width, but thought 'stretching' the photos on the template might be nice.Unfortunately, you must completely re-load your template and I mis-read thinking it was going to back up the old blog template...which it did not.  Then to make my morning more challenging, it does not appear that the template I had chosen allows me to use the blog 'stretch' feature, because I cannot find that option anywhere.And just to keep me on my toes, I have lost my blogroll in the process.  I do have the blogs bookmarked so I will have to reconstruct that all again in the future.  I must say, that I usually am the type to look before I leap, but when it comes to computers, I just plunge in!Anyway, here is one of the looks I settled on after getting sick of changing fonts, colors, etc.  I do not know if I can live with...will. see."},
{"title": "Tabor Dancing", "date": "Friday, July 18, 2008", "text": "The weather has been so hot and muggy that hubby and I decided we just had to head to the nearby mountains---nearby being a relative term as it was about a 5 hour drive, carbon footprints be damned.  We had visited and even camped in this national park many times, and thus, it was like visiting another home.  Some of my  blog readers will be able to identify it, I am sure.We stayed at one of the lodges but I am proud to say that the second day we put in a 10 mile hike.  I have not done that type of hiking in years and am glad that I found I still had the stamina.The initial trails are usually clear and well worn even though you can see the summer has been wet.The initial signs are usually quite clear for the trails as well even though the Park Service is on tighter and tighter budgets.As we got farther into the more isolated trails, we found the signs not only less clear but even more telling!Coming across this on the path gave us pause and also helped us understand the previous sign.Even though we were above 4,000 feet the mid-day temperatures were pretty warm and we frequently sought shelter under the shade of trees in the high meadows.  We were careful when we left the trail, because as you can see from the photo above, the trail can soon disappear.  I photo-shopped it with ladybugs to show how camouflaged it could get just a few yards off the beaten path.This lovely spruce forest floor makes for very quiet walking and that is why I stepped on a 2.5 foot snake without he/she or I being aware in time to avoid each other politely.  I had paused to catch my breath when hubby came up behind me and looking at my feet said calmly but sternly,  \"Keep moving.  Keep moving.\"  As I lifted my right foot I glanced down to see the coils and instantly danced to the other side of some rocks skinning my shins nicely.  While my legs have some lovely scabs, the poor snake got the worst of it as he seemed to be somewhat lumpy as he scooted away.  We had been returning from the day's long hike, and I was being rather heavy footed with fatigue.  We, of course, tried to remember what mountain rattlesnakes and copperheads really looked like as we hustled more carefully on down the trail counting our blessings only to see a smooth green snake scoot in the grass ahead and also what we identified as a common water snake just ten minutes further down the trail.  We were blessed, I guess.  Upon reaching a visitors center we pulled one of the guidebooks and determined that I had stepped on a juvenile rat snake.In spite of the adrenalin rush the rewards of the hike were many including fresh blueberries for munching and......a blanket of wild bee balm.We stopped at the top of the ridge for a late lunch and had some of the best views above the woods.  I don't know of any fancy restaurants that can provide this kind of atmosphere."},
{"title": "That's the Limit", "date": "Monday, July 14, 2008", "text": "While I was sleeping someone caught his limit and more!  So hot and humid here that I think it is time for a two-day trip to the mountains tomorrow.  I will let you know if we did it."},
{"title": "This Sunday Morning", "date": "Sunday, July 13, 2008", "text": "Although I have been retired for some time, I do not seem to be falling into much of a regular pattern of daytime/nightime activity.  Yesterday I slept until 7:30 (after being lightly wakened by hubby at 4:00 who was heading off for a fishing trip with buddies) and this morning I woke up abruptly, looked at the clock and saw that it was only 4:30.  I tried to drift back to sleep, but after 40 minutes I admitted defeat and got up.Sitting here on the stairwell balcony, where I blog, I can smell the coffee that is ready in the kitchen, hear the faint chirp of birds just waking and hear the deep and regular breathing of my husband in the bedroom below.  Today, like most days, is a totally free day for me.  I can do whatever I want.  Yes, I have a project list, compulsive creature that I am, but I also know that 90% of the things on this list do not have emergency status.I am not yet too full of free time, not yet satiated and ready for something scheduled that forces me to get up and get going.  Perhaps this winter I will look for something to do that fulfills that need, but now I am still in wonder at this endless free time given to me each day.  I sometimes think of my mother and father and the early years of their retirement.  I wonder what thoughts they had about this time in their life with their children grown and involved with their own lives.  My parents were busy and hardworking people and idle time did not come easily to their generation.  I know that in their last years watching baseball on TV in the afternoons was my father's respite after clearing weeds and working in the garden.  My mother would do her flower gardening and some canning in the summer and then look forward to an afternoon nap.  Was this enough to fill their day and the all the rest of the days of their lives?I do know that the nagging concern I had about having too much time with my husband and not enough alone time, which I so desperately need, has not been a reality.  He is a self-starter most days and we spend about 50% of our time doing things together and 50% on our own separate projects.  He does not need me to be his oxygen and that is a relief.  He also continues to let me be the bossy one in structuring many activities and I am trying to be more compromising in that area.  Now that I have so much unstructured time I do not feel the need to be so regimented.Another good thing I have noticed is I am becoming less anxious about this thing called retirement.  Eventually, I may more easily accept it as my new way of life!"},
{"title": "It is starting", "date": "Friday, July 11, 2008", "text": "We are now one for one as hubby has retrieved a tomato from the garden and today I get to harvest my patio tomato.These photos should go on my other blog about the wonderful planet earth...but I am so excited that I have this little bit to share. Everyone from Earth Home Garden to East and West at Every Turn has been posting delicious photos of their bloomers far outshowing my humble efforts.  My beginning perennial garden has been a struggle this year. I read somewhere that it takes between 30 and 50 years to get a decent perennial garden established and I do not have that much time!  So I will enjoy what I can while I can!  The photo above is a healthy achillea (maybe vista?)  that adds nice warm color to the end of a flower bed.  (The orange flag shows where a soaker hose lies.)Yes, I am cheating, by including some annual container plants below.Here is a small chaste bush/tree that seems to be deer resistant.  When left in a clear space in full sun they become big and lovely like the butterfly bush and the bees love them.These lantana are in a container on my deck where I had a lovely crowded cover of yellow pansies.  These are now suffering from summer heat and therefore lantana will replace that.This lovely fellow bloomed last week and the rabbit ate the stem and left it on the ground with about three other potential blooms!  The plant now sits behind a wire cage and is allowed to bloom once again.Moss Rose are always perfect on the south facing heat of the back deck as are the lovely purple petunias and sage below.The guara, below, I planted last year and although it is now in the wrong place blocking the path,(covered with bumble bees which is not good for the insect phobic relatives) it will be moved and do very well in a few other places I have planned.My tempermental hybrid tea rose gave me a lovely first bloom in the early spring.  Later I battled with thousands of Japanese beetles in early summer  and lost a half dozen other blooms (but now  seem to have won the war this year with a beetle trap on the back of the house) and now it is giving a lovely full bloom.Well, it isn't much but it does warm the cockles of my heart these days."},
{"title": "The Tobacco Barn", "date": "Wednesday, July 09, 2008", "text": "On the side of the entrance to the county park just before the posted map of the trails, we saw this old tobacco barn.  The last public tobacco auction for the county was held a few years ago and this part of American agriculture is now history.  The countryside is dotted with these aging gray barns that are no longer used due to a buyout for tobacco farmers that was successful, and even though there is some small effort at preservation, these historic structures are not being preserved in most cases.  If this barn had been used for drying tobacco I would have readily been able to see the rust colored leaves hanging down inside.  Unfortunately, the structure and shape of these barns doesn't easily lend itself to reuse.   There were varied shapes to the barns in parts of the South but this traditional barn shape is the most common for our area.There was a sign on the outside of the structure saying KEEP OUT which of course motivated me immediately to walk through to the cooler inviting shade.  It was being used for keeping straw bales dry.  I aged this photo as homage to those farmers who  built this country with honest sweat and determination.  The tobacco industry may have been an unhealthy crop, but at the time the money it brought in to farmers was significant as it was a 'mainstay' crop for the area.I could not smell the tobacco as some say you can inside these old buildings, but the daylight peaking through the slats was quite romantic.  This, along with hinged openings, insured the tobacco would cure correctly.  If you click on the photo above you will be able to see the saw marks left from the circular saw that was used to cut the wood at the saw mill.  This circular saw was probably powered by a late 18th Century water powered saw.  Do you remember Little House on the Prairie when Laura's dad worked at the water powered sawmill in town?  The time when people did the work that had to be done to feed their families...not just for that big screen TV."},

So, I have asked Daughter and her family and her in-laws down for the weekend this year for a little celebration.  This will be the first time Xman gets to stay up to see the fireworks.Thus far I have made a pasta sauce, a fruit bowl, banana muffins, choco-chunk cookies, potato salad and lemonade.  The rest has been food shopping, and more food shopping for the BBQ.I also rewashed the front windows and got ride of several wasps nests around the house (after one nasty sting), finished putting in the underground drip system and mulch for the two flowers beds, and completely cleaned the house.We have washed off the deck and scrubbed the outside grill.  We also scrubbed down the fiberglass and chrome on the boat...which took about two days alone!I now remember why I usually don't have company for the holidays.  Hopefully I will feel like doing some real writing after the long weekend.HAPPY 4th to those of you smart enough to sit back with a cool drink and watch the fireworks!"},
{"title": "If the Shoe Fits", "date": "Friday, June 27, 2008", "text": "The luxury of both wild and domestic raspberries!  I have been retired almost two months now---58 days.  But I still feel that the shoes don't really fit.  It is like I bought a lovely pair of Manolo Blahniks on sale and have worn them for 58 days straight and am still conscious that they are on my feet and that they fit a little stiffly.  They also are so luxurious and attention getting that I keep thinking I don't deserve them and they don't quite go with my personality or my pace.Don't get me wrong.  I have no regrets about quitting work.  I do not feel lost when I get up in the morning and do not have to rush off to work.  In contrast, I luxuriate in the opposite, pacing my morning with a slow cup of coffee and reading while the sun comes up.I do not feel badly about being on a tighter budget and once again in my life looking at price per unit and looking at coupons when I shop.  I am so lucky in having everything I want that a little frugality is a nice seasoning to my life.  (Of course, if this administration continues to ignore the downward spiral of this economy, I may be wearing tennis shoes soon.)But I have so much time to ponder my future.  The work that I am doing now (gardening, cooking, decorating) does not require focused thought and so I have time to let my mind wander in other directions.  To overwork garment analogies I guess I am waiting for the other shoe to drop!"},

{"title": "Blogroll #4", "date": "Thursday, June 19, 2008", "text": "I have been meaning to do this for some time, but since it requires a little research and more time at the PC and more time coding in Blogger  I have put it off until now.  But today is the day and some folks are going to get rolled since they visited my blog before I got to theirs.  I got this idea from Hoss over a year ago when he profiled those bloggers that he read or that commented on his blog. If you want to read about other bloggers that I read or that visit my blogs (or used to, as bloggers come and go like good friends), go to my right sidebar and select the blogroll links near the bottom the green section!  Now for some new bloggers.BearNaked has a fetish with teddy bears and the photos alone that accompany each of her posts are charming and will bring a smile on your gloomiest days.  She blogs from Canada and therefore knows more than most of us about bears.  She found me rather than me finding her and that is most flattering.Another blogger who has stopped by my place is Beverly who is a neonatal nurse of longstanding.  Doesn't that sound like one of the most important jobs in the world?   Such a profession lets you know she is a woman of great courage.   She writes from Tennessee and leads a very traditional southern grandmotherly life...except for a few surprises---like she once kissed Elvis!Ernestine is on a Journey to Mindfulness.  She has had to say goodbye to a farm where she could garden prolifically and say hello to the city life where she at least is close to her children.  She shares my love of plants and has learned about the love of dogs.  She also is going through the same thoughtful pauses that I have in having more time on my hands.  When you see how young she looks you would be surprised at the age of her grandchildren!Grannie Annie visited me a while back (only grannies visit me these days!) and I noticed that she had started blogging back in 2005.  Talk about cutting edge blog boomers.  She is prolific in her writing and there is no way I can keep up with her posts, but I do stop by when I have time.  I, like her, have re-instituted my exercise program.   I don't run a chicken farm like she does, but if our covenants allowed my husband would have a dozen hens right now.Mary Lou is retired from the Navy.  Lordy, she started her blog entries in 2003!   I didn't even know blogger was up and around then.  \"I'm not sure what type of blog I want here, just brain dumps, or a real log. Do I want to get into emotions and feelings for the world to see? Do I want to write this just for me, or with the thought that others will be reading it also..\"    Sounds familiar to some of us, doesn't it.Richard who live in Atwater is also retired Navy and maybe came by way of Mary Lou above?  While I worked for an organization that was full of former Navy folks, I really don't know anyone currently in the Navy.  Anyway Richard loves birdwatching as I do and seems to be single-handedly feeding every bird in his state.  He has some good construction skills, which we could certainly use around here, as he has actually built a shed.  We bought ours from the Amish.I am extremely flattered that \"Vishwa\" from India also visits my blog. He is young and lives so far away!  He doesn't have lots of entries each month, but each entry is well-thought out and well written.  This entry about why we write blogs (http://vishymn.blogspot.com/2005/12/where-minds-meet-and-wisdom-arises.html) got me thinking once again about why I write a blog.  Stop buy and take a \"Walk in the Drizzle.\"Please stop by these blogs if they interest you and please tell them that Tabor sent you!!  (Now I won't be blogging for a while as I have lots of blog reading to catch up on.)"},

This is a luxury meal that is much easier to prepare in retirement as picking crabs requires a leisure morning.2. I have trepidatiously planted one hybrid tea rose in a bed near the front of the house knowing full well that they are like creme brulee for deer.  I was weeding around it this morning and I looked up to marvel at the dozen or so pink buds getting ready to open. Then, even before I sighed with pleasure, the plant said, \"I'm too hot. I'm thirsty. My feet are getting too wet. There is some strange fungus in that mulch. That salvia is too close to me...\"on and on the temperamental beauty ranted.3. I just noticed that I have not worn my engagement ring in almost a week, a longer time than I have ever had it off. I took it off to work in the garden and to clean and move basement boxes and it seems that I am doing all of this constantly these days and the ring sits in a ceramic box near the sink.4. I got an email from work yesterday asking me if I remembered my Safeboot password for the laptop I had turned in. I laughed so hard I almost wet my pants.5. Daughter is coming down this weekend since both of our husbands are otherwise occupied with fishing and/or golfing making us weekend widows. Since my husband is taking my son along for all of the following week, I may get to see his new girlfriend as she drives him down.  I am trying to get her to stay the night...it might be a fun girly weekend after all---although there are toddlers involved so we will have to be wise on the wine.6. I have not had to plan exercising time much this past month. Moving tons of dirt, digging holes, laying out bags of top soil and peat moss and working it all into the mounds of clay-based soil, laying out bags of mulch, lifting small shrubs and trees in containers all seem to be helping me get plenty of weight lifting and aerobic exercise. Just to increase all this fun, I and hubby have put down quite a bit of landscape brick after putting down the bed sand.  Below is just one of the beds we have been working on.7. I finished reading the Namesake but found the Kite Runner more moving and poetic.8. I live out in \"NO-NPR\" land and there is a religious radio station that sits right next to NPR on my dial and overpowers the signal. I have spent time trying to get an antenna to capture NPR but have had no luck. I can only really enjoy NPR very early in the morning or while I ride in my car and now the tuner button has broken on that as well!9. Kafir lime leaves are quite pungent and certainly two different meals (salmon patties and beef with asparagus) using this flavor are enough to satisfy us for quite some time. My tiny Kafir lime tree is also pleased that I have stopped denuding it for a while.10. I actually did a crossword puzzle yesterday. That may be common fare for some people, but for me it always was something for those who have idle time which I never had. Although I love words and their meanings, I am not very good at crosswords and actually somewhat intimidated by them.  I also rarely have the patience to sit and complete one puzzle.  I didn't finish this entirely...but I got close!"},

Cleaned out the basement and we (me---hubby won't part with anything!) threw away a ton of stuff so that my newly finished basement is more inviting.But I also passed the afternoon watching Out of Africa.  I cried and cried and cried.  I cannot watch that movie without bawling my eyes out.  (Out of Africa even makes hubby tear up.)  It will always be one of my favorites as the beauty of the photography alone keeps me coming back again and again, and I rarely find a movie that I will watch over again.The movie says so much about how we fall in love and become part of that something (Africa) or someone (Robert Redford's character) that we love so deeply.  This just doesn't work, because we bring our own ideas which bring changes and those changes attempt to change what we love, to make it better.  And what we love is ever-changing anyway.  And eventually we must say goodbye to it all.Now it is your turn.  What movie makes you cry?"},

She got me pondering about this space in time I now have.  Am I hurtling through this free space so fast because I am waiting to hit another dimension…some great new insight…a black hole…a sudden stop at the brick wall?  Am I keeping so busy trying to finish my extra long list because I need to?  Is it because I really want to?  It certainly isn't because I have to. Is it just habit that all the responsible things on the list are first and all the fun stuff is near the end? Will I ever outgrow this bad habit?  Am I afraid that I will not have something to add to the list as I get near the end?  Am I afraid to really look at the list and find nothing important is on the list?Am I afraid that if I have nothing to do, it means I am close to death?  That is certainly a morbid thought and I am pretty sure I can’t find this thought in the forefront of my mind anywhere.  But then, at this time in my life I misplace almost everything at least once!  I do know that I actually feel guilty sometimes that my dear kids have to work so hard and wish I could share my free days with them.I remember a training course I took where one of the exercises was to write your own obituary.  Maybe I need to do that over again.Am I afraid that if I get some empty space, I mean days here not hours, I will realize my life has become more meaningless and less important?  Now that is a heavy thought.  If we are not saving the world or running people’s lives are we all that important anymore?  Well, after re-reading the above, I think the reason I am keeping busy is that I am a very depressing old fart."},
{"title": "No Hippie", "date": "Friday, May 30, 2008", "text": "I got my graduate degree from the University of Hawaii in the late 60's just as the Hippie culture was getting established.  While the drug scene was delayed in spreading its mellow yellow across the Pacific Islands, it had arrived in full force by the time I was there.  You may have read my Mary Jane story.  If not go here and I will wait.I have always used the excuse that I was too poor and too serious about my education degree to get caught up in even the milder illegal drug scene as a young adult.  That reason is probably an artificial excuse.  I never would have been a good hippie.  The young man with the long flying blonde pageboy and flute in hand who asked me if I wanted to live in his cave up Manoa Valley when I was crossing campus one day got only a smile from me and not even a second thought.  I guess I was born older than my age.  I could see ten years down the road to the future after that cave of free smokin-free sex- good times.  I was like an old adult already in my mind.  I am sure that I was clearly no real fun at parties even though legal alcohol flowed freely.I have revisited this part of my personality upon retirement.  Today I washed 21 double hung, casement or french door windows.  Yes, 21!!  My hubby came back to the house for some business and yard work and I decided that this day had to be filled with some accomplishment on my part.  I even vacuumed the layer of pollen from all the screens.  I can see the green mansions clearly now.I took a warm jacuzzi to ease the aches and pains from this labor and then put on my soft white robe and sprawled across my bed with a good book.  I am such a Puritanical spirit that I cannot just enjoy such an activity without it being a reward for some work well done.  I am the kind of free spirit hippie that Gandhi was.  I understand his approach to life.  I never felt in sync with Jack Kerouac or Jerry Garcia.  The 60's were clearly wasted on me."},

My daughter is with friends and her family in New York.  My son ... my son...what he is doing today is anyone's guess.Yet all is well with my small soul as I got up early (5:00 a.m.) and started cooking at 6:00 a.m.   I am spending next week with my daughter due to a number of social activities as well as getting hubby at the airport near her house.  Therefore, at 8:01 I have completed a Tuna Noodle Nicoise Casserole, a Turkey Cheese Enchilada Casserole and 23 Devils Food cupcakes.  I still have to make a fresh strawberry pie.  I NEVER go empty handed to the house of a woman with small children.  One MUST bring food.  I can hear the envious sighs from across the blogosphere.The Devils Food cupcakes are supposed to be one of those super healthy recipes...one small (13 oz) can of pumpkin filling and one devil's food cake mix.  That is all that goes into this recipe!  Mix and bake as directed on the box.  I have never tried this recipe.  The batter was sort of fudgy rather than battery, but seemed to taste OK.  We will see how these low calorie snacks turn out.  I did not think I would finish the casseroles so early, so now I have the rest of the day to get the potted plants ready for being ignored for the next 6 days.I also made a banana cream pie...not my favorite but a great way to use the extra pie crust and leftover bananas."},
{"title": "Life Story #14--Someone Else's Life", "date": "Saturday, May 24, 2008", "text": "I may do windows, but I don't do lawns.  For some exotic reason I have avoided mowing lawns my entire married life.  We have had both sit-down and push mowers in our house-owning life, and yet, while I do not mow the lawn, I will do with enjoyment the edging with the weed-eater.  The grooming of the vast lawns we have owned in our married life has been left to hubby.  I think it is because I do not like engines and all the idiosyncratic illnesses that they get.  Hubby is now overseas for a while and the lawn has enjoyed the cool spring and weekly soaking rains and soon was lush and thick and needed a mowing.I called the young man in the middle of the photo above about mowing the lawn, since he is one of the few people I know in this area.  We met him while getting the house built.  He and his two young friends in the background of the photo helped our builder put in the retaining wall.  He is out of high school and I have no idea what his plans are for the future.  He does not have the motivation, the learning or the money for college.  He seems to be following in the footsteps of his mentor in the foreground of this photo to work in the building industry.He is a quiet, shy and handsome young man that brings out the mother in me in an instant.  When he had finshed our huge lawn with the push mower, I paid him probably double what a lawn mower gets in this area, certainly out of guilt for his circumstances.  I gave him a large box of warm strawberries I had just picked, and with a surprised pleasure, he sat on the bench under the front porch eating them and drinking the water I gave him while waiting for his girlfriend to pick him up.  He enjoyed the strawberries more than any young person I had ever seen.  My children like strawberries, but don't really enjoy them with the enthusiasm this fellow had.  I hadn't washed them and told him that even though they were organic, they probably had some dirt on them.  This did not defeat his pleasure in any way.Now for the rest of the story.  Shortly after that picture above was taken, this young man along with the two boys in the photo and another boy not shown, were involved in a tragic car accident.  There had been alcohol and teenage carelessness in the mix.  Fortunately, no other car was involved.  Among the four young men in this accident one died, one is now a paraplegic  and one is in jail for drunken driving.  This young man who mows my lawn escaped with his life 'intact' but forever changed and is now slowly piecing his spirit together."},

I have to pull some cookbooks I guess!  I need a large family.  I feel guilt at this abundance after watching the tragic news these past few days.  We have been blessed this year with quarts and quarts of strawberries.  I dread facing the garden after the rain today to pick even more!  I have not picked since Saturday morning due to weather and being very busy.

Had this child been older and recognizable, I would not have posted this photo.  But she will look very different in a few months.  I think this Western society can no longer see sexuality as basic biology that is important to our survival as a species.We all have masculine and feminine attributes from birth that are important and make us who we are.  I do not feel these in and of themselves are bad or should be ignored.  They make us the unique adults that we become.  Some of us will have real struggles with these traits in a society that so objectifies everyone.    I do agree that focusing on these attributes and ignoring a child's intelligence, personality, and health while raising the child is not a good thing.  But I do think this is a LARGE leap to say we are 'objectifying' a child while recognizing their femininity or masculinity."},

{"title": "Every Day IS Saturday", "date": "Saturday, May 10, 2008", "text": "One of the jokes and truths about retirement is that you lose track of the days of the week and the months of the year. If one does not have a mandated schedule, everyday becomes a Saturday with chores and errands, but nothing really essential to complete. Since my retirement I have started another list. It is a learning list --- things I have learned from recent observations since my retirement.1. Every day IS Saturday. There is just no pressure to get everything done before dinner, because tomorrow is, after all, Saturday!2. Some of the working friends and family are jealous, so you have to be very low key about your new life. The more mature former working mates are more than happy to smile at your pleasure. And, of course, the really young are so happy that they are not old like you even though you do not have to work and they do. They would not trade places with you for a second.3. Some days it does feel like you are free-falling. Free-falling is both exciting and scary...so you don't think to much about the end of the fall.4. Yes, you do realize that the ultimate change ahead is death. And yes, you do think about it. But not often or with too much trepidation. After all, today is just Saturday.5. On day 5 of my retirement I actually felt a teeny, tiny bit of trepidation about not having anything important to do...while gazing at the creeping phlox beneath my oak tree that feeling soon passed.6. I spend more time observing since I don't have to be thinking about managing my time. Remember all those old people you see sitting at the mall or park who steadily watch the busy people hurrying by? I am now one of those old people.7. Sitting at an Austin Grill eating a pre-midnight dessert on Friday evening I was watching dozen of couples of all ages 'dating.' Lots of eye contact and lots of joking and some flirting even among the 50-somethings. The place was full and busy and I found it hard to realize we are in a recession. Clearly this recession has not hit the restaurant trade in this area. I have several months yet to see how my retirement budget is going to work.8. Sitting in the Pannera on Saturday morning savoring my coffee latte I watched a group of attractive women in their late twenties gathering at a table for some meeting. Some knew each other and some didn't, and watching the body language and the banter was interesting and reminiscent of another time in my life. Most of my observations now bring back such memories.9. My daughter's retirement gift to me is several hours with a fashion consultant. Close your mouth and stiffle that laugh. Yes, I love her to death and I have learned in my many years of gift recieving, that gifts you get from others that seem odd are actually gifts the giver would like for themselves. This woman will visit my closet and tell me what works (perhaps that black tank dress) and what doesn't (certainly that navy blue flower bordered mini I bought in Hawaii ten years ago) and then we will go shopping together so that I can buy clothes...silk pajamas, perhaps, because I think she will frown on those elastic band sweat pants I have had my eye on.10. I have finished two books already. House Lust, which is certainly a thoughtful look at our real estate addiction in light of this mortgage crisis and Eat, Pray, Love which is was a quick and fun read about a tremendously insecure woman who seems to find her place in this world. I am now reading The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri and Into a Desert Place by Graham Machintosh. With my eclectic tastes in reading material, I will have thousands of books to read in my retirement.11. Industrious things besides reading include washing the four rattan chairs and table that were stored in the garage, laundering their cushions, mopping the tile floor of the newly finished basement, and dusting everything in the basement including the elliptical glider which I have not returned to using as I promised...using energy to clean the damn thing, but not exercising on it, that says a lot about me doesn't it?12. I have always loved the end of the day after work, anticipating the slow exhale as the sun heads toward the horizon. Now the late afternoon arrives with so much more peaceful acceptance on my part. Yes, the melancholy of goodbye to another day is still there, but the anxiousness about stuff undone for tomorrow is no longer eating at the edges of my mind."},
{"title": "And Thus Retirement Begins", "date": "Thursday, May 08, 2008", "text": "I certainly thought that I would have more time and more motivation to blog after retirement.  But that is certainly not the case.  Blogging becomes one of the \"I'll-get-to-it-later' activities.Spring is planting time and I have spent a good part of my days starting the container plants on my deck.  Since I  am being lazy this year, they are all from purchased plants.  In the future, I anticipate being more frugal and starting from seeds.  I am an addict when entering the garden/landscape stores.  It is as if I have been given a shot of some drug that suspends time and makes me need to see every planting table, pot and greenhouse section of the store at least three times.  I wander and dream among all the treasures for sale . The trees are particularly enticing.  Finances and deer that eat everything I plant are putting a healthy break on the purchases.  Hubby and I have to figure out a fence system or see if the deer are being more tentative now that we are here full time.Frugal YET!..we buy a water fountain that is so heavy it took four men to lift it into my husband's tiny trailer.  There it sits until we figure out where in the back yard under the deck we want to put it.  There it sits until we figure out how in the hell we are going to move it ourselves!  It was 50% off since it was last year's fountain design.  My mind boggles at the thought that even fountains have styles that come and go.  The intricate pattern which may be over the top for some folks, reminded me of my days in Indonesia and the temples overgrown with jungle vines that we visited.I also bought a number of herbs --- rosemary, sage, various basils...one patio tomato to compete with those hubby has in his gardenWe also bought a calmondin orange tree.  We had one of these many years ago in our other house.  It produced wonderful flowers in February which filled the house with fragrance like the breath of an early spring.  Then I harvested hundreds of tiny lemon-like oranges for drinks, baking, etc.  The tree got to be about 6 feet tall and I had to give it away when we moved.  Now I have a new one foot tall tree with blossoms on my deck waiting to re-establish the pattern.I also bought a Kafir lime tree.  I spend too much of my time hitting oriental markets looking for Kafir limes for my cooking.  They are a rare and delicious treasure.  And now I have a three foot tree filled with blossoms on my deck that has just been re-potted.  Both trees will have to be moved inside next to the south facing window and pruned judiciously each year and re-potted every few years.  AND moved back out onto the deck every spring.  But, the rewards will be well worth the work involved.  Thus the addiction begins once again.(I will post pics on my other blog.)"},
{"title": "Being Dishonest with Yourself", "date": "Monday, May 05, 2008", "text": "Onward and UpwardFor a number of months, if not a number of years, I have imagined my first day of retirement.  I kept thinking that the very first thing I would do would be pretty much nothing  for a long time.  Remember the movie (and book) The Da Vinci Code?   The first victim uses the symbol of  Vitruvian Man  as his clue upon his death.   I have always been intrigued by that  image created by  \"the Roman architect Vitruvius. Vitruvius, a proponent of the Sacred Geometry      of Pythagoras, designed temples based on the proportions of the human body,      believing them to be perfect.\"  It seems to represent Mankind's way of trying to merge with the 'imperfect' biology of the planet.  In some way, that has been my nemesis...always trying to get to that level of perfection that brings peace.  This is why I need to work on meditation, exercise, gardening...so that I find the inner perfection that is the only real perfection.For some reason that symbol has floated in my mind for years --- this was one of the images NASA sent into outer space to identify mankind to the aliens.  It is a mathematical representation of mankind, but to me it represents the essence of the human being with that full frontal, open armed 'take me as I am' stance.I kept thinking I would like to take a bare space on the floor of my house the very first morning and actually lay down stark naked in exactly that position with a sort of yoga attitude and \"reach\" for my potential once I had acquired my 'retirement freedom.'   I imagined this numerous times...but, I didn't do it.  Maybe because I had done it in my mind so many times.   I don't know.I do know, that once you have free direction and lots of free time, you are who you are and will end up doing what your true self tells you to do.  I am a busy bee.  I can only be happy when surrounded by organization.  The first day I was on my feet all day getting my closet in order.  I had brought down the winter clothes last month and they remained hung or piled in arbitrary fashion.  I separated clothes to be pressed from those to be mended.  I found that shoes were everywhere and I threw many out.  My plastic bags of shampoos, creams, etc. that I had stored at my daughters house added to the large collection of stuff I had already put in various containers here at the house.  Living in two places means you forget what you have and end up with too much stuff everywhere.  I cleaned out the medicine drawers and threw away hundreds of dollars of expired concoctions and remedies.At the end of this long day of lifting and sorting, I 'rewarded' myself by cleaning all of my jewelry.  I have a small collection of silver necklaces and earrings that have not been polished in ages.  I washed the pearls and other natural stones. I sorted out the amber. I do not own any valuable jewelry---diamonds, rubies, gold, etc...but have a number of pieces acquired over the years of natural stones as reminders of trips, etc.  I took a trip down memory lane with each of the pieces.Then I started the first of the laundry loads.  As the end of a beautiful spring day eased in, I poured a glass of wine and headed out to my lovely deck to look at the water through the 'green mansions.'  Hubby and I were amazed at how lucky we are at this time in our life and pray that this luck holds."},

My tiny car now looks like I may be living in it.7:00            Clean out the last drawer at work and go through the last of the professional documents on the remaining shelves above my desk.  I have already filled a large green recycle dumpster with files no longer needed.  So much of what we do at work is busywork.7:45            Go through some historic materials and sort certain files for boxing and mailing to remote staff.8:10             A few farewells from staff who stop by the desk and one surprise hug.  I send out a thank-you to that 'Team' who gave me a nice lunch the day before.8:30      Exit interview with the person who oversees all the divisions including ours.  I was calm but honest.  Bottom line is that resource depletion, a few dysfunctional personalities and a few hard-workers who spend time looking over their shoulder are interfering with the peace.  He actually said he would implement some of my ideas because they were good.  He has several idiots under his domain and knew exactly what I was talking about.9:30               Take exit form around for signing and find that since I had parts of it pre-signed yesterday (by appropriate staff), it made the person who starts the form today look like she wasn't doing her job (??)  15 minutes of small talk and reassuring her and I finally get the signed form back to walk around!10:00               Get a lovely figurine from our secretary and a rose.  Unfortunately the figurine got broken in the transport, and while easily repairable, she is devastated.  She will miss me the most as I have been the one she leans on when stressed, and she gets stressed a lot.10:30            Get an orchid corsage from the other division head who insists this signifies the start of the party.  She is the one everyone hates as she micromanages the hell out of things and never listens to you.  Today she has gone out of her way to be considerate...who knew?  The orchid is missing the plastic tube for attaching and we jury rig with some brown book tape someone had in a drawer.  (Is all this an omen?)10:45               Write a lengthy memo outlining the history of a project that never got off the ground and for which monies had been allocated and then disappeared.  While I didn't point fingers I made clear where the problems were.  Also find some last minute digital outreach files for colleagues who are in a panic about loosing them.11:15              Hubby has come to the building and is meeting with an old friend and then we head out together for a quick lunch.11:45              Heading out to load the over-crammed car with yet one more box!  Now I have only a tiny place to sit as hubby will be driving.12:15             Going over the last of the email folders and files on my PC to make sure I didn't miss anything.12:45            Labeling the last of the packages that need to be routed to other offices and washing down the bare shelves and desktop...yes I am anal.1:30           The Party Starts.  I am surprised that both of my children can make it.  I also see a few colleagues from remote areas of the program that I haven't seen in a while.  I didn't expect them because the flyer about my retirement was posted just the day before.  Over thirty people show up (including two that I am sure I do not know!) and the table is spread for a king.  (They love me, they really love me ;-))1:00       Lots of very nice speechifying with just a little roasting.  Several paper certificates and gift cards.1:30           My brief farewell speech.  At the first I almost loose it and then tell myself I refuse to cry and I hold it together.  I actually stupidly hadn't planned anything to say...so am doing a stream of consciousness thing.1:40           More gifts, lots of photos.  I am beginning to feel like some movie star as even people I hate have to have a picture taken with me!3:30           It is finally all over.  Such a rush-around morning followed by a very emotional afternoon.  Send out my final thank you email to all.  Hubby and I gather the gifts and once again cram the car with more stuff.  Farewell to the children.3:40           Head down to my new house for the very last time from this office.  Very much a stunned thought time.  You know it is coming...but like having a baby you can't really get your mind around it until it happens.Such a milestone.  And definitely worth a thoughtful blog entry once all has been digested."},

{"title": "Stream of Consciousness Tabor", "date": "Monday, April 14, 2008", "text": "March 28:I was in a dark nightclub in a scuzy part of town (rereading this sounds like a Guy Noir skit).  We took a cab because daughter and I were too scared to leave a car ANYWHERE IN THE AREA.  Nightclub  was filled with twenty and thirty-somethings.  A very few were \"over-medicated.\"  Even though I was one with the beat once the band started, I kept thinking the little flecks of light on the floor and lower backs of people from the turning mirrored balls above was a toddler moving between the adults.  Sort of a grandma reaction that took a while to shake.  My daughter said the crowd was 'alternative' due to the facial hair and just a few with tattoos.  The bouncer wore spiked wrist guards and looked so totally bored.  He had that expression on his face that a parent has when he has just put the child in a time-out for the fifth time in an evening.  Music was great even though the sound system was mediocre.   My son introduced me to a chatty Kathy that was a total fan of the band.  Said she was a \"band-aid.\"  Seemed to be totally jazzed about meeting my son's mom and sis.  Please God, do not make this the final girlfriend!Left  the club after midnight and took a cab back to the car which we found had been towed!  They towed it an hour before the meter expired, but have not been able to get justice on this to this day!  The extra $100 fine did put a damper on the evening.March 29:A whiplash Saturday morning for this old head.  Up early with toddler  getting ready for a trip to a museum with another toddler friend to have an early celebration of grandson's  third birthday.  It was far more scary than the night before watching toddlers run beneath displays and climb upon metal chairs and benches.  Then back for gift opening and homemade chocolate birthday cake which daughter and I had decorated with a PERFECT Lightning McQueen frosting graphic, if I do say so myself.March 30:Sunday was a second birthday celebration with the arrival of the other set of grandparents.  While I would have loved to lie around in bed or watch cartoons with grandson, I escaped to the mall to give the grandparents one-on-one time and to give me some sanity time.March 30, March 31, and April 1:Took daughter and I three evenings to watch the movie \"Rendition\" which we had rented while both hubbys were on travel.  (\"The story of an Egyptian, married to an American, picked up on the suspicion of links to terrorist organizations and shipped to a friendly (with US) Arab country for \"enhanced interrogation.\")  We could only get blocks of 45 minutes free time before we both were ready to fall asleep.  The Egyptian is kidnapped just after arrival in the U.S. from a business trip and the wife spends the rest of the movie in a panic trying to determine where he is.April 2:Hubby is arriving - finally - from Korea in the early evening.  I get ready to meet him with a call the airport to confirm his flight arrival time.  They tell me  the arrival time is 30 minutes earlier than I had scheduled, so I tell daughter and rush to the airport.  The flight has arrived by the time I get there and for some reason my cell phone is not working.  I go ahead and park and head to baggage claim.  Many of the passengers have gotten their bags and are leaving.  I scan the crowd, but no hubby.  I wait until just a few stragglers are left collecting their luggage.  I go to the United desk and try to get information.  The lady behind the desk is vague and suggests I just go home  and wait for his call.  (This Rendition movie is beginning to nag at my brain.)  I decide to wait for the final flight from Korea which comes in a little later.  So, I ask her if by any chance he is on that one.  NOPE!   I cannot get into my voicemail on my cell...geeze.  I head to daughter's house.I reach there at 9:30 and ask daughter to check her email on her blackberry since I do not have a computer at her house.  She doesn't have any messages.  She cannot get into my email with her little machine--probably javascripting block.10:00 PM we get a call from Hubby who was caught in the major FAA/United  cancellation of flights--guess I should have been watching the news instead of a movie.   He and three others worked the desks at Pusan like a team and were able to get out of Korea that same evening.  There were only 8  from his flight who made it out of Korea that night...he is pretty enterprising!  The only problem is that he is now in New York and he lost one bag!  He has a morning flight home scheduled.April 3:I get Hubby without incident and we rush down to the house to pack.  We are heading for a week's vacation in Sarasota, Florida.  Why the rush?  We have to meet daughter and family at the Tampa airport in just two days and we are driving down---with more baby and toddler junk than is found at a Babies \"R' Us sale in the two backseats along with two newly installed carseats.  We work hard to squeeze in our two small suitcases and a few beach chairs while leaving room for two adults to sit in the back.April 4-11:A blur of beaches, aquariums and DisneyWorld.  Forgetting the long lines at DisneyWorld, the expense of gas and the strange leg rash Hubby got from wading through seagrasses, methinks everyone should have this much fun in their old age.April 14:WE MAKE IT BACK HOME!

When I ‘lose’ a family member in the mall, they save me time.  When I am trying to meet up with friends or family at a specific time, they come in handy.  A cell phone is necessary sometimes when meeting someone at the airport after flight delays, and they are so valuable for emergencies when you are not near your land line.As a devotee of new technologies I am willing to work on that necessary learning curve.   BUT, yesterday, I was in agreement with Tammy.I had recently seen my son on Friday night after a long hiatus and when I got a text message on Sunday morning, I knew it was him since he is the only person who text messages me and I have never text messaged back.  This time I was up for it.  It went as follows (names and locations changed to protect everyone):The Text message I received:  “Whazup?  Son son”Me:  “Goin shopin, Smith’s coming later, daughter mulchin  call if you want”“WTF did u just write”  (When did he get so rude with his mother?)My diplomatic response, “Call me” “When”“Anytime”“okey dokey imam call u when I get back in “State”Once I reached the mall I decided to check this text message dialogue to see why my son was out of the state and what was going on.

{"title": "An Email Smile", "date": "Saturday, March 15, 2008", "text": "Just got this email from hubby in Korea:\"I must say one thing I am going to have to go on a diet this next two weeks and do exercise as the trips are just one big eating orgy.  There are big lunches and dinners, you remember our Taiwan experience where we hoped we could take a break from eating for three days or so because of the constant large meals.  The Koreans always seem to have about four surges of food in addition to all the little side dishes they bring out.  The food has really been good but they always want me to try new things so I overeat.  My clothes still fit OK but I know I am heavier.  \"I have been living (at least on weekends) in my new house for almost 18 months now. As with any new house, there is always what the builder calls a punch list that is reviewed when the house is 99% done. The punch list is a list of items that the builder or the owner identify as corrections to mistakes or things that need to be finished but were overlooked. They usually get done prior to the final payment or within a month after the final payment. Since my husband and I are relatively easy going and have made our final payments, there are still a few things that need to be done. I am not worried because the builder's subcontractor is free-lancing by finishing our basement. He has said he will get to these items and he is a reasonably nice guy, so I trust him. I also find that my karma gets really crappy if I turn into one of those bitchy homeowners that feel it is necessary to get in the contractors face every time I see him, when I see that he IS doing work. As a side comment we are actually having the basement finished based on a handshake, an estimate that is not in writing and by writing checks every now and then when asked. I do not recommend that homeowners do this in real life, but it seems to be working for us.ANYWAY, one of the items on my punch list is that foyer light above. The larger light in the foreground was hung quite high with the builder's brother telling me that was necessary to allow a decorative view from outside the front door when it was on at night. There was a spot light over that window that fell on that small landing below---this landing is found in many new homes and is a totally useless feature added by architects for you to place totally useless decorative crap that you could not reach to dust without endangering yourself. This foyer light in the foreground was found after much searching in several light stores and catalogs for something large enough in size and with a style that fit with my \"pseudo-Tuscan\" approach. The light was found hanging in a corner of one of the larger light fixture stores covered in dust. Naturally the builder hung it with all the dust still intact! When I explained to the builder that the foyer light was so damn high even my husband could not reach it to clean it or replace bulbs with his two story ladder and that it needed to be lowered, this led to me purchasing a similar light (from a totally different company) that hung directly in front of the window where the ceiling spot was. (WE RARELY USE THIS SECOND LIGHT!)Now I continue to see my foyer light dusty and with one burned-out bulb hanging at the same height as if in some vacant house.  I wait patiently for them to lower it at least two feet.  They keep saying they will get to it. I will keep those blogreaders who are on the edge of their seat about this challenge posted."},

{"title": "Little House Life Story #13", "date": "Saturday, February 23, 2008", "text": "Living on a remote island in the middle of  the vast Pacific Ocean requires depending on your  resourcefulness almost all the time.  The stores in Micronesia were very similar to the old-fashioned one-stop store in \"Little House on the Prairie.\"  You could buy almost everything in one of these stores, but there wasn't much of anything at any one time.There were a few canned goods, a few types of hardware, a little fresh produce.  One had to be very resourceful to identify what was useful.  You could never predict what you might find in the store.  But, interestingly enough, due to the proximity to Asia and India there were bolts and bolts of summer fabric: fabric of all types, colors and weaves.  Fabric did not spoil or damage easily on the long boat ride to Guam and the trans-shipment to Palau.  There was always a selection of colorful bolts to peruse.  If you could sew, you could fill your days with making things.In one of my recent blogs I mentioned how I made clothes for my baby girl out of fabric scraps.  Well I pretty much had to sew everything I wanted out of these tropical patterns.  The photo above shows a cover that I made for my bamboo furniture in our little apartment when the original fabric wore out.  I am sure that I found this quite the interior design solution.If you keep reading, you will notice that the fabrics in the photo below are the same as the one on my baby girls outfit.  This is a photo of the bedroom.  Yes,  the bedroom!  I must have loved the pattern.  I am sure that I thought it was very stylish and a wonderful example of creative interior decorating.I must have had absolutely no taste after years of living on a remote  tropical island.

I was going through old slides and albums for ideas and then came across this photo of my husband and some islanders during one of his many island hopping jaunts when we lived in Micronesia.I had to scan and post this because the picture tells a story or two if you look closely---no, my hubby is not gay---he is the most unselfconscious, unpretentious person I know and is totally relaxed with his body.

I guess it means we are still alive if we can still learn.I have recently (re) learned the following:1)  When you receive a call from one of those little people that starts with \"I go poo poo in potty.\" you still react with the same manic enthusiasm you did when you had little tykes of your own.  Obsession with pee pee and poo poo goes on and on from generation to generation.2)  Potty training means a child may wake up in the middle of the night several times screaming that he needs to go to the potty.  3)  Watching a child bounce off the walls due to too much Valentine's Day chocolate and candy is almost as frightening as a Stephen King movie scene.4)  The reason they are called the Terrible Twos is because the child can be really, really, really terrible---behavior that one expects in an insane asylum comes to mind.5)  It is definitely time for mom to feed the toothless one when the toothless one starts grabbing food off of my plate and then commences screaming when I pull the plate away and lick her hands that are full of my mashed sweet potatoes.6) At day care little girls are little girls---hugging and hanging on to X-man and little boys are little boys--- running around the room casting glances as they try to impress the visiting grandma.7)  Being around small children brings to mind the same question I ask about Presidential candidates...Why would anyone in their right mind volunteer for this!8) The answer to #7 is that you are in love with the idea, the process and the result."},
{"title": "Happiness is Overrated", "date": "Saturday, February 09, 2008", "text": "The February 11 issue of Newsweek has an article titled \"Happiness:  Enough Already.\"  The gist of the article is that melancholia \"generates 'a turbulence of heart that results in an active questioning of the status quo, a perpetual longing to create new ways of being and seeing.\"  And the authors conclude that this is a good thing.  In other words if you are perpetually happy you no longer long for anything and become constipated, boring, and coasting through life. Some of the article is based on a new book coming out - \"Rethinking Happiness\" by a father and son team --the Dieners.Since I have not read the book, I cannot comment on it.  But I do tend to agree with the Newsweek article on the popularity in our society of medicating anyone who finds themselves depressed.  The clinical definition of depression is too easy to fit most of us at many times in our lives.  Medicating this feeling away seems to me a false approach to growth and understanding.  Yes, there are people who become suicidal and therefore need medical intervention.  But too many of us in our wealthy and self-stimulated society are taking pills to avoid normal pain, to pretend that feeling depressed is not natural.Pain/depression is a lesson.  It tells us something is wrong.  It tells us we must step back and move in a new direction.  It reminds us that we cannot make it alone in this world and we should turn to those who love us for help.  It tells us we are alive and when we begin that time of happiness (and it will come) -- great or small -- we will only fully appreciate it if we can contrast it with the sadness.  We can also be more emphathetic and understanding of others' sadness when we take time to go through our own periods of the blues.The cliche that great art results from great sadness seems to be true.  Therefore, will our society not produce any great works of art because we are counting out pills from a bottle with each hiccup in our life's path?I also think that if our society accepted mild depression or sadness as a temporary transition rather than a permanent setback, we would have fewer suicides.  If we accepted that folks are going to be gloomy for a little longer than we like, than we would be more tolerant of their struggles.  We need a little patience in this solve-it-in-24-hours-so-we-can-get-on-with-our-lives.  We need to hold their hands and see if they can turn it around.  We need to remind them of the good times or share our good times.  We need to be patient.  It is a fine line, but if we follow our instincts we will know the difference.As Lucy would say, that will be 5 cents please."},

I do love life and I do find each day an adventure, but I am one of those people who is always thinking too far ahead.For example, when my daughter was a baby, each time I nursed her,  I would think sadly about the day I would have to start weaning her.  Then when she became a toddler I would get sad thinking about the day that she would head off to school and how I would miss our hours together.  Then, as you can probably guess, the years in junior high for both of my children were filled with my thoughts about the empty nest when they would head out to college and their bedrooms would be filled with dusty prom trinkets and forgotten basketball photos.I really do try hard to live in the moment.  I certainly think that is the healthiest way to get the richness out of each day.  Having written that though, it seems I am always hardening myself to what I am going to miss when something good comes to an end.  I can remember an really odd moment during (probably) desert storm in the 1980s when I saw a handsome and healthy group of sailors at DisneyWorld on leave. They were having a wonderful time.  I was sitting at a table with the family eating a hotdog and suddenly tears filled my eyes and my hotdog became a lump of clay in my throat because I thought about what they would soon be facing.  I was embarrassed needless to say,  and my husband tried to make light of it so that the kids wouldn't misunderstand.I really try to be an upbeat person...I am sure that is what my family would say...   We have a weekend visitor from Korea.  He is in charge of a marine laboratory in Korea and while visiting my husband also will be visiting relatives living nearby.  As Asians always do, he brought a lovely gift and presented it with gracious charm.  The box itself was first wrapped in a silver-gray scarf with writing that meant something about power (?).  When I accepted the gift I was surprised at how heavy it was.   It is about 2 feet by 1.5 feet in size.  He carried this all the way on his trip!    When I accepted the gift I am sure it weighed 15 pounds!!  Inside is  a very beautiful assortment of  Korean sweets.  Far more than my husband and I could ever eat.  We will share at dinner tonight and I will also share some with my grandson who may  enjoy them. Now we have to think of something nice for my husband to take on his trip back next month..."},

In the background I can hear the sweet sad horn of Chris Botti playing on the stereo. I had been to a concert of his recently and remembered that I had not listened to his wonderful music in a long while and pulled out the three CDs I own.Today is one of those days of strange dichotomies.   I am lonely and yet savoring it.   I am sad for no reason but know that this sadness can only be appreciated because my cup overflows with happiness.   I feel the pace of my breath and heart slowing to a rhythmic peace in sync with this silver gray day.   This sadness is bittersweet.  This melancholy is the one side of the whole that keeps me from flying off into space.I am savoring 'Empress of China\" tea in a cup I had made with my daughter at a pottery place a number of years ago.  It is an ugly green and purple and thus fits completely with the strange day.I know that part of this strange feeling is the nearness of my retirement.  I have told the important people at work and therefore solidified this leap.  In the spring, I will be retired.   No matter what angle I look at this, it is another milestone in my life.  It is another major corner turned.  It is like a gift that I have been given, but it is like a large beautiful bowl in which I must find beautiful things to place.  There is a real danger of filling the bowl with bits of flotsam and jetsam.This milestone also means that I have definitely moved away from those parts of living that meant so much.  There is no innocence, there is no pureness, life is what it is.  When the bowl is full there is no more pleasure in finding new things to place there.  At the very end, there are only old memories after all.  All the fresh new memories will be made by those that follow us.It is sad, but it is also wonderfully sweet this little bit of life we have been given."},

They will be shocking in their brilliance and seduce us once again into purchasing joy for the spring season.  I am writing about the seed and plant catalogs, of course.  My husband will look forward to the heirloom plants and think about planting his 'half acre' of tomatoes.Because of my Italian heritage, tomatoes have played a very important role in my dietary preferences.  As you may know, if you also love tomatoes, during this time of year (actually during all but the late summer and early fall months) the stores are filled with red orbs that are labeled as tomatoes, but taste like cardboard and have the texture of mushy apples surrounded by a hard gelatenous layer.   I have discovered an acceptable substitute in the grape (and sometimes) the cherry tomatoes.  These grape tomatoes (the size and shape of grapes, duh) are sweeter and while not excellent, have a touch of the essence of tomato.I got a Nigella Lawson cookbook for Christmas from my daughter, (Yes she is that lovely and voluptuous--stop drooling guys-- and a wonderful chef as well.) and we decided to check out the tomato recipes and found this recipe below.  I have to paraphrase since I left the book at my daughter house.Preheat oven to 450 degrees.  (232.2222222 degree Celsius)Slice tomatoes  (as many as you want) (large tomatoes need more chopping)Set in large baking pan or dish and drizzle olive oil over allChop an herb (basil, oregano or the recipe called for thyme)Sprinkle herb, kosher salt and a tiny bit of sugar over all. (you can also add pepper to taste)Pop in the oven and turn the oven offLeave in for about 12 hours.Enjoy in so many ways--spread on toast, in salad or eat them like popcorn as I do.The flavor or the tomato is very concentrated yet they are still a little juicy and less chewy unlike the dried tomato.  The recipe allows use of regular tomatoes, but I think that cherry or grape are the best even though slicing them in half takes a little time.  If you crave that tomato taste in the winter, as I do, I think you will like this.  Let me know what you think if you try it.PS--While these can be stored in the refrigerator...they must reach room temperature or be gently heated for best flavor."},

They jump in arms wide and mouth open.  Even as they see they are sinking to a dangerous point of no return, they do not regret the loss of control and they continue that sweet roll.  Not this chickie-poo.  While it was intense when I fell in love in my youth, I still had my feet touching the ground and my head was reasonably clear.  I sometimes wish I had been the free spirit, free falling type of woman.   The lady with the laugh in her eyes and the never-look-back attitude.  But, I think that while my passion was not as abandoned neither was my pain as endless.I have always been able to do two things at one time and while I was studying that sparkle in his eyes and the softness of his lips, I also kept track of exactly where I was standing in this dance.  Girls who remain in control of themselves are not as sexy.  They also make clear early in the relationship that they have expectations and we all know that men do not like expectations.  Most men remain little boys all of their lives.  There are a few grown-ups in the XY line, but they are as hard to live with as us females.  I do not regret that I was careful in my approach to life, but I do sometimes wish I could have led that other life in another dimension without all its painful consequences...those which would be manifesting themselves in twinging ways as I reach the age I am now.Yet once again as I age, I have learned something about myself.   Everyone has their price.  I have fallen head-long in love with the two little humans above.  I have jumped in arms wide and mouth open.  None of my feelings are being reserved for logical thinking.  I know that the pain will be devastating when I am thrown aside for their other loves.   The rejection will require numbing medicine and lots of staring into space.

{"title": "Gender Motivation a Postscript", "date": "Tuesday, December 04, 2007", "text": "I have been mulling...and like a spiced wine, I am just a little bitter.  I think I am attracted more to uniqueness because when I got old I realized (or at least THOUGHT) I would never again have any kind of power.  Why try to pursue power and strength?  It sounds like a race or a battle and I am not in any nature for that.The older people I know who have power are pretty demanding and even manipulative.  Many use guilt to hang on to this power.  Therefore, I am being very female and attracted to 'uniqueness.'   Uniqueness means I am closer to being the real me.  The inner me, that maybe I don't even know.My goal in the immediate (and perhaps distant) future is to find and nurture what is unique about me.  This is going to be much harder than obtaining power!  I don't even know where to begin.  There must be some process.  Making a list?  Making a wish list?  Meditating?  Going on a fast?  How DOES one find one's uniqueness to nourish?"},
{"title": "Gender Motivation", "date": "Monday, December 03, 2007", "text": "I was doing a lot of driving yesterday and I was listening to my favorite radio channel (NPR). Helping me pass time in traffic was an interview with Judith Thurman about her new book \"Cleopatra's Nose.\" Ms. Thurman's book is a collection of her essays in the New Yorker over the past 20 years. When asked by program host, Bob Edwards, about any insights she gained while reviewing the past 20 years of her work, she said that she discovered an interesting difference in the motivation of men versus women. She found that men are in pursuit of doing something important with their lives while women want to be seen as unique in what they do. This sounds quite true to me. Allow me to gender generalize. Men want to be responsible for change, for completion of large projects, for being know as leading powerful directions in their professions. Women want to be seen as unique --- from other women in particular (since most cultures see them as women first and skilled or talented human beings second) as well as unique from both genders. We want to be special in some way by those we work with or those who love us. Most of us pursue this uniqueness in a good way. Of course, some women want uniqueness in their sexuality or beauty that makes them stand apart from other women---personally, I think that society has short circuited their minds from seeing the big picture.Anyway, this concept makes sense as women, who were commodities and not human beings, needed to survive in the ancient days and their uniqueness was the only way they they could stand apart from all others. They did not have power or money to be a mover or changer and therefore, being unique was the key in many ways. Scheherazade comes to mind here. Remember her? That skill is still used by many mother's surviving endless days with sick toddlersGrandma was remembered for her unique recipes or unique quilts. Mother was remembered for her unique birthday parties or landscaping. Today those skills can be translated in the workplace, but not yet to unique leadership skills. Hillary Clinton comes to mind here. She is unique in that she does what men have been doing for years. Her uniqueness is more of a threat to insecure woman and of course small-minded men. Which is better. To want to do something important or to be unique?"},

I know there will be years in the future where it will just be hubby and I and other years when cooking will not be possible for any number of reasons.  I am truly thankful.3) No unusual recipes will be tried.  We are going traditional all the way (except for one small dish.) I am truly thankful.a. (H’orderves:  toast tips with salmon spread, grilled oysters on the half-shell, carrot sticks and dip.)b. Roast turkeyc. Cranberry relish (which no one ever eats…but it IS a tradition)d. Herb/sausage stuffing (wet and dry)e. Garlic mashed potatoesf. Sweet potato casseroleg. Green bean onion casseroleh. Spring greens saladi. Pumpkin pie with whipped creamj. Key lime piek.

I am truly thankful.5) My son did not respond to my email over a week ago asking if he was coming.  So typical of him.  I hope he does show up but he is a moody one.  I am truly thankful that I at least have him in my life when he deems possible.6)  My favorite dish at Thanksgiving is my homemade stuffing although pumpkin pie with whipped cream runs a close second.

{"title": "The Grass is Always Greener Life Story #12", "date": "Friday, November 16, 2007", "text": "A common disease among young mother's is brain meltdown.  This disease manifests itself in many ways and has several symptoms.  Some of the more common aberrations include inability to concentrate for more than 30 seconds on any one thought, using one's nose and sense of smell to determine all future actions from changing clothes to selecting food from the fridge, accepting spitup as an accessory for your wardrobe, and adapting to constant noise as the norm, thereby becoming jittery when there is no noise.A great strength is the ability of young mother's to adapt to this disease.  Your brain is melting and so you accept the fact that while you can still do two and even three things at one time, you often cannot put simple sentences together.  While you can repair the most complicated train-track layout and successfully install teeny tiny batteries into even smaller places, you cannot remember where you placed your car keys or why you just ran upstairs leaving both small wonders to their own devices.Ninety-nine percent  of mothers live through the disease which can last for several years even.  Society does not talk about the other 1%.  Usually you know you are over the disease when you sit looking at your bare toes one day and have the urge to paint them; or you look in the mirror one morning and, in heart-attack horror, think you see your mother; or you walk  back into a very quiet house and realize it is quiet because you are the only one there.Thus, in a moment of idiocy, you feel you must start volunteering or go to work to pay those mounting bills.  The house is too quiet and the hushing silence is getting on your nerves.  It is too clean and you begin to think you are turning into Heloise.Doing adult activities with other adults outside of the house begins to look inviting if not downright exotic, especially as it requires new clothes.  (You have forgotten the Benjamin Franklin aphorism you learned in school:  \"Beware of all enterprises that require new clothes.\") Mmmm..!  Black nylons and a short skirt and cute high heels and a new haircut and you look almost sexy...wait isn't that what exposed you to the former disease in the first place?  You push that thought to the back of your mind and put on make-up and  nice pearl earrings and feel oh so grownup once again.  Your brain even seems to be humming like a fancy sports car motor.You get into the car with your new leather purse and head out to office that in its wisdom saw your intelligence and creativity and hired you.  You pull into rush hour traffic and feel more grown-up than you have felt in years.  You look into each car and wonder if the drivers notice how you are now one of them.  You are part of that busy bustling machine that makes the world go round.  This glow lasts several weeks and maybe even into the months or years if you like the job or volunteer work that you are doing.Unfortunately, you will catch a new disease down the road.  This disease is like a leaky gasket that pulls the energy from every pore of your body.  Getting out of bed and into a car to fight the headache of traffic becomes a monotonous chore.  That neat gray suit is starting to hang funny, especially across your butt.  All of those people at the office that admired your creativity and energy have changed their tune and seem to feel you are way too energetic and too creative and are actually making them look bad.  Just because you are young and cute doesn't give you the right to outdo them.  They were there for years working their asses off while you sat at home and played with babies.  They won't say that, but they do think it.  And then the worst happens with this new disease...you become one of them!  Every idea you get is echoed with \"been there, done that.'  You find the new young staff so annoying and so cliched and so very naive. You begin to count the days when you can sit home in a quiet house with the hushing noise and the \"Heloise\" kitchen and the grandchild baby for playtime."},
{"title": "Memories -- long ago", "date": "Tuesday, November 13, 2007", "text": "I am having a number of deja vu moments as a grandmother living with my daughter. I am so happy for this experience, because we forget (I forget) so much of my past life as I plow through my current life of deadlines, dinner and diaper changing.I had forgotten how rejecting my little girl was of her father in her early months due to my nursing. She wouldn't go to anyone at all because I was the sole source of sustenance. I would thrust her into her daddy's arms and tell him to just cope, because I had to start dinner! I knew she was fed and dry and I wanted some time without someone in my arms, so her crying didn't bother me all that much. But, it totally stressed our Daddy-o. He was that blue-eyed guy that was NOT used to being rejected. Babies have excellent survival instincts. My daughter is also nursing her little gal and now at three months, Angel is rejecting all of us at most times. She will billow and coo until she realizes that she is not in her mother's arms and then her agony cannot be assuaged. I can calm her intermittently but I think that is because my voice and face remind her a little of mom and that confuses her enough to calm her for a few minutes. I can already tell her personality is different from her brother's at this early age. She is very much a clinging girl. She likes to bury her face under my arm with her pacifier trying to shut out the world. She will nurse, pull off her mother's breast and then thrust her small face under Mom's arm and hide until she falls asleep. She also uses food to calm her every moment. Definately a 'food soothes' everything kid. She will probably have a weight problem growing up.It is fun seeing the small parts of Angel that emerge each day. I have no time for myself at the end of the day as the result of living here, but this is a small sacrifice to be part of the lives of these very special people."},

In spite of peeling skin, they still remain cuter than anything you have seen all day.• Even if flights are delayed, baggage misplaced, and traffic is horrendous due to drenching rain, the metal pole in the garage will not be the item that bends when you hit it with the car while backing out and moaning how late you will be to work.• Fall rainy days invite that first cozy fireplace fire, but artificial logs do not give off much smoke and you will be well into sootsville and ceiling smoke hanging like a low cloud when you realize that you have closed—not opened—the damper on the fireplace in your newly purchased house.  Trying to carry half the artificial log out with a shovel only increases the probability of disaster.• Soot on the newly painted fireplace mantel doesn’t really look as romantically antique as it should.• Dumping the smoldering half log on the driveway in the pouring rain means you will have wonderful gray mush that little boys can walk through and eventually bring back into the house.• Husbands are a little clueless when it comes to putting on Halloween costumes so, do not be surprised if your little guy goes out with his Lightning McQueen costume on backwards!• Direct  TV is a lousy company. Their website says:  “We Do the Work, You Watch TV.  DIRECTV provides free professional installation free, service and maintenance and a 100% satisfaction guarantee. You can't get that with your cable TV company or other satellite TV companies. The proof is in the pudding!”   The proof is they send you not once but twice a defective HD-DVR box.  They speedily (3 days delay) send out the third box and they expect you to install it yourself.  They also expect you to swallow the loss of hours of programming of your favorite series that still reside on the old box.  This is a big deal only because the kids paid so much for the stupid service.• If you ask grandpas to help with garage clean-up you must realize that it will be natural for bull-in-a-china-shop type of activities to transpire.  The garage door opener will cease to work and you must wait for grandma to get home and figure it out."},

The first two days my hubby and I just goofed off,  enjoying not having any kind of schedule.  We slept late and then went to bed late.  When my daughter joined us with the littlest one several days later, the pace slowed down even more due to stopping for diaper changes and feedings.Then the very next week daughter and her family headed to Orlando for time with the in-laws and some last minute Florida sun--the condo was paid for, so why not? Hubby headed down to the house and this left me with a week of time alone at my daughter's house between working.   I did receive a call two days in from my daughter with the reminder to not set the alarm on the day the housekeeper worked, water the mums each day, take the garbage to the curb on Tuesday morning, pick up the mail and make sure the bags and boxes in the garage were also taken to the curb.  (Just a few directives!  I kind of felt a deja view like the roles had been reversed.)But for the most part I was all alone, eating what I wanted when I wanted, watching what I wanted when I wanted...sort of a third dimension experience.  I was totally laid back and not quite prepared for the re-entry,Friday here was drenching rains and this weather made my normal 30 minute commute drag out to an hour and a half.

{"title": "A New Take on Writing Your Own Obituary", "date": "Wednesday, October 24, 2007", "text": "Many of us have taken at least one training class or self-improvement seminar where the leader asks you to write your own obituary and then read it and see if you are leading your life in the right direction so that you are remembered for what you love or what you do well.  It is sort of an exercise where you look at what you have done so far and what you think people would say about you.  It works pretty well if you do it honestly, although like most activities of this nature, you need to take it home with you and apply the lesson learned every single day.  That is a difficult thing to do, unless the lesson learned stimulates you to make a major change or two in your life.A few days ago, I got home from work and turned on the last half of the Oprah Winfrey show and found a very inspiring new take on this type of activity.  A Carnegie Mellon professor talks about the \"last lecture\".  If we could all face our mortality so impressively, the world would be a much better place.  Watch this video and see if you aren't as challenged as I was to meet his level of humanity.     \"There's an academic tradition called the 'Last Lecture.' Hypothetically, if you knew you were going to die and you had one last lecture, what would you say to your students?\" Randy says. \"Well, for me, there's an elephant in the room. And the elephant in the room, for me, it wasn't hypothetical.\"For some reason the link above does not seem to be working.  The original video not edited for TV can be found doing a Google video search with the words \"last lecture of Randy Pausch\"  There are several versions with longer introductions so you need to search through them for the thumbnail with his picture.  The Winfrey program video can be found using the search \"Randy Pausch reprising his \"Last Lecture...\""},
{"title": "Time for Thought", "date": "Sunday, October 21, 2007", "text": "I have been thinking a lot about aging these days, probably because I am looking forward to retirement and realize that I must plan my future carefully if I expect to get the most out of my remaining years. I think when you reach that certain age, if you are lucky, you begin to realize that life is giving you a second change chance. When you are young and raising a family you are busy living in your waking hours. Each day is auto-filled with necessary deeds and tasks. People need you, so you spend time working on filling those needs---whether it is earning a living to pay bills or cooking and cleaning and kissing boo-boos or consoling a broken teenage heart. It is a daily race and you fall into bed at the end of the day, hoping your mind will slow down enough so that you can sleep. Then, almost suddenly, but not without warning (children entering college, getting married, having their own little ones) you realize that the race is slowing way down. You have time to look to each side and not always ahead. You are going slow enough that you now no longer worry about tripping or mis-reading signs and taking the wrong side road. As a matter of fact, a side road is most appealing.If you have good health and your finances are secure your side roads are more interesting and more available. But even if life didn't end up like a bushel of sweet peaches, there are still different opportunities and angles that you can think about.I watched a movie starring one of my favorite actors, Judi Dench, called Ladies in Lavender last night. A scene in which Dench is lost in thought about missed opportunities in her life and future choices she must make remains in my thoughts. Dench is lying casually on her bed with daylight crossing her face showing how lost in thought she is. The scene hangs in my memory because the impression given was that she had been lying there thinking for a long time. I realized that I have not had an opportunity to be lost in thought for quite a while.I remember days as a young child daydreaming for hours. Do children have time to do that today? Are their days so programmed with activities or so filled with technological temptations that they fail to exercise their thinking muscles and in turn their imagination growth? Are we becoming a nation of doers and not thinkers?I guess this is why activities such as camping and canoeing appeal to my soul. There is usually time for thought. Walking is another thought-provoking activity I enjoy. I have decided that getting a little more peace in my life for thought and helping others realize how important thought is will be a new goal in retirement. The next time someone asks me what I will do when I retire, I will answer \"Think more.\""},

As you will remember from my prior blog I realized that my birthday (and therefore my arrival on the face of the earth) was significant. Recent events have confirmed this power has been transferred to those who follow me.Let me elaborate. This week I am spending some vacation time with my husband and daughter and granddaughter in Williamsburg Virginia. This area is full of history on the beginning of our country. Williamsburg, Jamestown and nearby Yorktown are filled with historic places and museums and street plays about the beginning of our country. With the beautiful fall weather we have loved sauntering through the tree lined streets and reading about the fight of our ancestors against the Spanish and the British to gain their liberty. We attended a wonderful lecture by \"Patrick Henry\" where in getting a personal history filled with amusing anecdotes, I learned Patrick had something like 77 grandchildren before his 60-sum years came to an end. Now, I am certain you are eager to see how I will tie Patrick Henry to my family as the Center of the Universe. No, I am not related to the gentlemen...although with 77 grandchildren, I am sure there are many ancestors who could step forward. My granddaughter is also the Center of the Universe ---not just my universe--- but the universe in Williamsburg. We were continually, constantly, endlessly stopped on the streets so that people could comment on her \"darlingness,\" ask her age and coo and fawn over her. Yes, most of these people were my age...already grandparents or wannabees. They were totally entranced. (It was beginning to get on my nerves.) We entered a lovely giftshop to look at holiday garlands and decorations and all three retail sales ladies stopped everything they were doing and talked to my granddaughter AND daughter for at least 15 minutes. Angel (my granddaughter) cooed and smiled and put on a perfect show for them. At two months she has already got this flirting thing down. My daughter got no shopping done.My husband (who was the frequent babysitter on the benches outside while my daughter and I perused the shops), was always visting with 'a gray haired grande olde dame when we returned with our wares.' He was so amazed at this human phenomenon. If we could bottle it, imagine the drugs we could create.The climax came today when eating lunch at a nearby Friday's before bidding goodbye to my daughter, a lovely elderly couple (he was the age of 91 and she 88) that sat across from us engaged us in a lengthy conversation once they saw there was a little baby under that blanket. This fascination with a small baby doesn't not seem to diminish with age. He was a jaded journalist who had retired from work at the White House just a year ago...and he still was interested in Angel!(Pictures to follow...)"},

After all, I was the first born of five sweet cherubs.  The first of five  smart futures.  The first of five beautiful replicates.  Unfortunately, she got over that idea in a few short months.  Fortunately, I have never really accepted her theory that I am not one of the most important people in the world and that the Cosmos is not linked to the date of my entry into the world.     Why, you may ask, in your serious interest in my life, do I think this?  BECAUSE, recently this was confirmed by a number of cosmologists---note I did not write cosmetologists.  (They are too expensive.)I never have been much of an \"end of days\" or \"apocolypse\" person.   S**t happens and we don't need to try to predict it.  (Believe me, after living with two small people in diapers I know this.)   But I saw a re-run of a program on TV a few nights ago and found that the Mayan Calendar ends on my 66th birthday.   According to this calendar the poles of the earth and the magnetic forces shift on my 66th birthday.  There is some re-alignment of milky way...I mean, are you surprised...really?On August 3rd, the History Channel aired a program about my 66th birthday.  See!  According to the documentary my birthday will start a cataclysmic event in the history of the earth or perhaps it will mean an opportunity for monumental change for the good depending on which expert you believe.  The History Channel is favoring disaster it appears, because after all, it sells.  Disasters with blondes (Hilton, Spears, Lohan) sell.  Why not disasters of the world?   (Disasters with our illustrious leader are not nearly as commercially significant to the media...maybe too predictable?)But some of the touchy feely experts think this change is going to be a transition to a better way of life.   Go on and read this, I will wait.............And why not?  I think that this version is just as good.  (I sent my hubby this link and he sent me an email saying that this was perfectly understandable since marrying me was the beginning of his life...I know girls...you are sooo jealous.)Regardless of the outcome, it will happen on my 66th birthday.

One parent is on a four-day golf trip and the other parent is on an overnight to watch a dance show! My conversations with this small person revolve around Sally and McQueen although I have to listen carefully as it sounds like Sayee and Keen when discussing their various attributes or where they have hidden themselves. If you don't know who Sally and McQueen are, your life is bereft of meaning...what can I say.He discovered his pockets this morning and found that both Sally and McQueen can fit inside them. This is a very good talent, because Grandma pointed out that his suicidal trips up and down stairs can now be hands free so that he can hang on to the banister, as opposed to holding a toy in both hands and attempting a heart stopping gymnastic balancing act. His Mother now has the fun of learning what small boys can cram in their pockets before or after doing the laundry. (This basement gets some rather large crickets as the weather cools, so that should be interesting.)As I am writing this blog, the little guy went upstairs to the kitchen and I heard his little footfalls on the dining room floor. Then I heard him calling my name in great excitement. I couldn't quite understand what he was saying. It sounded like \"Neeaa! Sum up!!\" and when I made it to the dining room I saw it was filled with rays of bright golden sun and realized he was telling me that the Sun was up! This was what was making his day. (As you can guess he got me up before the sun.)His grandfather cannot understand why all the doors and windows in the house must be closed as he goes from room to room and yet Xman wants none of his toys to remain in their containers when we straighten up the playroom.He is the energizer bunny. My daughter was fighting a nasty cold earlier in the week and he was home from daycare fighting the last of the same germ, so she had both little ones to care for as well as herself. When I got home from work a little early she was so relieved. Near tears she told me that keeping up with one sick boy and a new baby when feeling so bad herself was about all she could take for the day. She told me just one of her adventures. She had to go to the bathroom (of course) and asked Xman to be a good little boy while she placed Angel in the baby rocker and then went to relieve herself. She told the me the results with tears in the corners of her eyes and a smile in the corners of her mouth. \"Mom, everything was very quiet, but when I left the bathroom as I went to pick up the baby I saw that Angel had train stickers all over her forehead!\"We are going to the zoo this morning after Grandpa and I hit I-Hop. I will be bringing the camera and adding to my album of Xman. Probably to the thousands of photos already and he is only 2 and half. What will I do when his Sister, Angel, begins her activities?Well, it is now 9:00 and I am still in my pajamas and wearing bedhead. Must get moving."},

Unless I do it just before I fall into bed, which is not exactly the best time.  Also, there is not really any room for good aerobic exercise where I now live.  Any outside walking that I do involves the company of a little guy with short legs, so the only exercise I would get is the heavy weight of my grandson in my arms if we go too far and I have to provide his transportation on the return.  I have tried to remember to walk during lunchtime at work, but I keep finding myself interrupted by yet another task or meeting.  I know that I am rationalizing by telling myself that in less than a year I will be retired and can exercise all I want then!In addition to this self-proclaimed moratorium on exercise (including lifting weights) I have gotten lazy and not renewed my Fosamax  prescription for many many months.Well my recent dexa scan reveals that I have early osteoporosis of the hip and osteopenia of my spine. This disorder is sneaky.  It is not painful and years ago, before such excellent medical testing, it was only discovered after the spine started to fracture and the traditional dowagers hump appeared or you fell from an unknown hip fracture and got a broken hip.This is not the end of the world as an aggressive campaign of taking the medicine and doing my exercise should return me somewhat to my former self.  I guess I was being cavalier because there is no history of osteoporosis in my family.  This new version of the medicine has a weekly vitamin D supplement (which helps to absorb Calcium) since I have been told that we cannot get enough vitamin D from winter sunshine alone.In addition to my daily yogurt or cheese snack, I am also going to be taking a Calcium supplement.  One 550 mg in the morning and one 500 mg in the evening.  The body can effectively absorb only 500 mgs at a time, it appears.In case you are wondering why I am not taking \"Sally Fields\" Boniva which is a monthly dose (we should all look like her!), my doctor just likes the greater number of studies from Fosamax.Getting old and can't deny it."},

This I learned from my daughter.  I thought I was pretty much a girl-girl, and I distinctly remember a green pair of hotpants, but I guess not.You have to be moving all the time in this household.  If you stand still too long, someone hands you a kid, a dirty plate or a load of laundry.Although my bedroom is on the lowest floor in the basement, I must hit every single staircase at least twice during a day.When you take the house alarm off of instant and then set the alarm for 'away' (since you are the first to leave in the morning,) it beeps for 45 times to let you know how much time you have to depart.  I make sure that purse, lunch, coffee, dry cleaning and everything else are close at hand before I set the alarm.Those expensive tasso coffee machines cannot be used with tall travel coffee mugs.All those instinctive thoughts on taking care of a baby come back pretty fast.My daughter watches the Food channel most of the day and by the time I get home, she is starving!I keep thinking in the back of my mind, I am still waiting to exhale."},

She is only 30 minutes from work...and I still have to work at the monkey house (another long story.)There is a lesson here.  Children, your parents may return!  They may move in, actually, if you have a basement with a tiny bedroom, small kitchen and teeny weeny bathroom.  But unlike family members who move back in with laundry, your parents will do their own laundry!  They also work as free babysitters, allowing you to check your email or nurse your baby or take that well earned sitz bath at your leisure.  Guess what, some of us even pay a token rent!!As you will notice, your Daddy does the lawn, sweeps the driveway, picks up at day care and is great at BBQ.Your mom, granny,  allows small infants to throw up on her without flinching and can help with planning dinner and shopping.  She is also great at playing with Thomas the Train for an hour before her head explodes.  And at the age of 60, she can bend over and push a little plastic car around the park chasing her grandson as he pushes the other toddler car for quite a few laps.  Of course, after a half dozen laps around the park, she looks a little hunched in the back area when she tries to stand upright.  But does she complain about the pain?  Never--unless you count that groan that scares the little poodle on the bike path.Then like the good guests (hired help) that they are, they disappear on the weekends to their own place, so you are left to entertain the people of your generation who also have munchkins and talk about important things like reality TV and football.In all honesty this little hiccup in our life has worked out far better than one would think.  We are a help, we give them their space, and we contribute to costs.  (Also, in another 'all honesty' hubby is having his challenges remembering to put every pen, pencil and laptop out of the reach of a toddler.  He completely forgot to bring his laptop down this weekend as he had put it high on the mantel and ended up grabbing an empty backpack!)In return, I have gotten so close to both grandchildren and fully realize how very very very  rare and special this time is."},

We are all from the same generation and four had science backgrounds and the other two (me included) were in information dissemination or information technology work.  We talked grandkids -- everyone's are gorgeous --- how about that?  We talked the bureaucracy of our government and how it is keeping out the good scientists but letting in more budget analysts and policy wonks...whose primary role is to perpetuate their jobs, not necessarily make the program more productive.  That was a depressing part of the conversation.   We never got to any movies, as we talked ourselves silly into the night.The day was hotter than you-know-what, but we still had a lovely boat ride and saw about TEN eagles, dozens of osprey, seagulls and pelicans and even tried to catch something in a school of bluefish chasing baitfish.  No luck, but still fun.The meals that I served were also excellent if I do say so myself, and maybe this weekend I will post the recipes if anyone is interested--  Most of which I sort of made up, but they came out luscious anyway.Prince Harry visited and the guests loved him and his gentle ways.  My daughter's pending child did not interrupt the weekend, and we even celebrated my husband's birthday on Sunday with a breakfast sitting outside at a restaurant overlooking a finger of the bay.If this is a preview of retirement, I am so looking forward and not backward."},

We headed out to dinner once we got here and then returned in the dark to be greeted by two deer (one a fawn) on the side of the road.  When we got into the front yard, another deer at the side of the woods carefully and with confidence moved away from us in stops and starts staring at us as if he was trying to communicate.  I decided to take the opportunity to talk to him and proceeded to explain that he was welcome in the yard, but it would be greatly appreciated if he restricted his diet to  the wild food and not our planted ornamentals and vegetables.  I don't know if he understood the English, but I am going to work on deer language.I woke up at four this morning, perhaps eager and nervous to get my house cleaned and menus planned for company, or just my usual insomnia due to stress at work, but sitting outside on the deck and looking at the stars I entered the zen time zone. Far away from the land of deadlines and people needs and artificiality.  Slipping into the quiet black velvet of the forest just as it is sighing itself awake,  I have noticed that down here there is a showtime...somewhat predictable, but always  mesmerizing. The frogs sing rhythmically to put me to sleep at night, they drift off and then the crickets are in full song in the early morning before the sun breaks the horizon.This world goes on like this and wanes with the seasons and the moon.

I am going to tell you a little bit about them (you get a peak) and then I am going to ask for some help.  But you must respond before Thursday at 3:00 as I will be on my way down to the house. One couple we have worked with over the decades and after our car pool broke up we have not had chance to see them.  They are Chinese American.

The second couple we have known for a long, long time but we rarely get together because everyone's lives are crazy.  He is retired after being a leader in an office in the FDA and we met when he and his wife were graduate students with my husband.   She is a lovely but also very smart chemist from Thailand who has lived in this country and raised her family here after meeting him in graduate school in Hawaii.  OK, enough info.  Now my stupid but important question, which you are totally not expecting.  Has anyone seen the movie,  \"The Good German?\"  We have it from Netflix and I am thinking of showing it the night we are all together after we have talked each other out and are tired from spending the day on the boat.

{"title": "Gutter cleaning and other dangers", "date": "Sunday, July 22, 2007", "text": "Why installing gutters makes me depressed.  No, it is NOT the cost.We had gutter covers installed on the gutters of our new house over the weekend.  We had been debating long and hard about what type of gutter protection we could use.  We are in the middle of the woods and the trees constantly shed their branches and leaves like dandruff.  The more famous brands like Gutter Guard which are the more substantial come with fees in the thousands of dollars which is like $15-25 a foot...this is just the cap not the installation of the gutter.  We clearly saw this as a ripoff.  So, we looked around for a gutter cleaning service to get their take on this.My husband interviewed a number of folks and decided on a very nice young man who ran his own business.  He was about 35-40 and quite nice in looks and personality.  He explained that these permanent gutter guards still need to have gutter cleaning as wasps nests and small soot and seeds do get under the cap.  They are harder to clean because of the substantial cap.  I did some research on the internet and found the same information.Therefore, we decided to go along with some snap-in screens that can be cleaned without removal or easily removed if major cleaning is required.  Hubby is not doing this installation because there are parts of our roof that are THREE STORIES high due to the way the hill falls on one side.The young man got busy cleaning the gutters which were full of stuff having not been cleaned since late last fall.  My daughter was visiting and the young man saw her huge belly and they started talking about kids.  He has four.  Both my husband and I immediately thought about the dangers involved in this job where he has to move about on the roof and lean over or climb up large ladders.  We asked about insurance for injury or accident.  He said that he had a million dollars insurance for his customers (us): in case a ladder falls on us, I guess.  But when he looked into insurance for himself it was almost $700 a month and he said he just couldn't afford that.My heart stopped in my chest and I felt that I couldn't breathe well and after visions of my recent viewing of the movie Sicko flashed through my head I felt very very very depressed.  I do not handle the vulnerabilities of nice hard-working people very well.  I had to go inside and hide and I was depressed the rest of the day."},
{"title": "Thursday Thoughts #6--All About the News", "date": "Thursday, July 19, 2007", "text": "1.   There was a news special this week called \"Hotties on the Hill.\"  Yeah, it was all about the beautiful people that work in the Capital.  Does anyone besides me find this really annoying, irritating and just plan STUPID!!  I was guessing that there would be no one over 35 on the list, and while they didn't give ages, I was pretty much right.  Clearly being sexy in politics can have its disadvantages if history proves anything to anyone who follows history.  Most of those interviewed thought it was a 'career move' to be selected.  Maybe I am just jealous because I was never placed on a 'hottie' list.2.  There was also a news item on vandalism of Hummers (the car - not the guy who sits behind you in church) in some local neighborhoods.  Several vehicles were all but destroyed by what appeared to be metal bats (the sports equipment not some robotic air mammal). Theoretically these acts were linked to environmental passions.  This was deduced by some graffiti scratched on the side of the car. I don't think breaking the law is going to win any points with those of us who really think the environment needs help.3.  The weather service keeps predicting major storms...never happening in my area.  Must be REALLY localized stuff they have been talking about for days and days.  My poor lawn is not even gasping anymore.  It is just lying down and dying.4.  My television station has a blog site that asks you to vote for which news item you want to see.  When did the decision on the news become a popularity contest voted on by the type of people that would vote on news stories?  You're right, the voter is that guy who sits on his porch in the same T-shirt every afternoon watching the world go by and I am not interested in any news he is interested in.  Or perhaps it is that high school student who wants more information on P.H.  (I am not referring to the student's paper on battery acid, urine and drain cleaner.)5.  No, I don't think I will comment on the leaking of the latest Harry Potter book.  I will leave this to anthropoligists and historians who will provide a better perspective 100 years from now.6.  OK, I admit that I am leaning towards John Edwards even though he is third on the ticket.  That wife of his has faced death's door and is more honest than you or I could ever be and he loves her enough to let her take that ride.  He has real values and is very intelligent and strong and has experience both in politics and negotiations.  I would like to see a John Edwards/Barrack Obama ticket and I do consider myself a feminist.  Feminists don't vote for women just because they are women.7.  I really think Soccer is a supercool sport (was a big fan when my son played it and my husband coached it---it is STILL soccer folks even if big bucks are not involved) and I thought it quite intriguing to watch onTV...more so than that smash and bam football.  But I don't think Beckham and his exotic wife are helping...?8.  And this leaves me speechless (blog textless?).9. On a final note my husband is currently negotiating a part-time job in Korea.  He has a 50/50 chance of solidifying the project.  After this news article I am thinking maybe spending part-time in Korea might be good for my health!"},

Waaaay too late!3) After you reach 60 there will be days when absolutely everything is going super well and you cannot keep your mind off the thought that some bad news must be just down the way...at least some of us feel this way. Optimists you need to share more (are you listening Colleen?).4) I saw \"Sicko\" last night with friends. Michael Moore is getting really good a pushing peoples' buttons. Thank goodness he is funny because this is a tragic movie. You need to see it and then write your Congressional representatives to see where they stand. Most of the criticisms of the movie cannot hold a bandage.5) I live in two places--at least for a short while longer. I can never remember which refrigerator has the Redi-Whip and this is really, really, REALLY irritating. I also have arguments with my husband about which things go in the little cooler back and forth!  Do they address issues like this in marriage counseling?6) A younger colleague who has a chip on her shoulder but looks up to me found a FEDEX envelope--unopened--on a desk in a corner of an unused cubicle. I remember how it got there. I was trying to help the team secretary juggling her duties and handed her this envelope I had been given and she threw it in the corner in frustration. I thought for sure that she would retrieve it when she calmed down. That was June 28. The Secretary has gone on a family emergency. Guess what was in the envelope...someone's official passport!7) On another work note, two people came to me this week asking if they could use me as a reference in jobs they are applying for. Can you tell I work in a not-so-pleasant place?8) Hubby left for Hawaii yesterday...I'm just a little jealous but also looking forward to a weekend all alone down at the house.10) Millie commented on my new icon blog photo.  I have not tweaked the picture...but I don't really look like that.  It's the 20% of my face that looks alright.  The rest of me looks normal."},

Hubby and I took a trip to George's Washington's birthplace recently. This is not the more famous Mt. Vernon area but 80 acres set aside in Westmoreland County, Virginia. The old farmstead used to be 600 acres, and thanks to Washington's interest in surveying, the extent of the original farm, formerly belonging to his parents, is well documented.  This is one of several farms owned by his family.  While George grew up in a situation of reasonable wealth he was the only child that did not get a formal education, interestingly enough.  There is nothing left of the original farm -- no buildings.  They are still discovering where they think the original farm was located through an ongoing archaeological dig.This building above in the distance was at one time thought to have been one of the original structures on the farm, but research indicates it is newer and was built after he died.There is a visitor's centers and a small traditional garden in the back.  Above is tobacco which was one of the primary economic crops during that time.  They also grew grapes, and while we asked the volunteer which grape this was, we never could find out.Below is cotton, another important crop for the South.These historic places operate on a very tight budget, and if it wasn't for gracious volunteers like the woman below, they would probably be unattended acres of ground.We walked down the hillside and along the Rappahanock River and then back up into a wildflower meadow that they had planted.   It was full of butterflies and bees.  The brochure also said that it was a great place for bird watching in the spring and fall and we made a mental note to return again during one of those seasons.HAPPY FOURTH OF JULY in one of the best countries in the world."},

Certainly in this American culture aging is not beautiful.  We must plump the lines, pull up the sags, remove the spots, dye the hair, remove the protruding veins, and in general strive for Stepfordness in any way that we can afford.  If you don't look good then you are not good.  Of course this change is for those in their 40's (and idiots in their 30's).  All the rest of us are over the hill and no amount of tweaking is going to bring us back into the mover and shaker fold.I have succumbed to thinking about this calling vanity.  I would like to pull up the sags so that I don't look so grumpy and tired.  I am much happier and perkier than I look!  But I am also cheap and cannot allow myself the expense for that vanity.My husband and I were watching a show on television and there was some comment by one of the characters regarding baldness and thinning hair.  The woman in the TV show deleted the male character from her \"Candidates to Date\" list due to his receding hairline.I mentioned to my husband (who is almost bald) how I like guys with hair but also find baldness very sexy...which I do.  I mean picture Jean Luc Piccard with hair?  Puhleeze!

The kick-up-the-heels giggle at long warm days at the small town swimming pool.   I miss the bookmobile that stopped at the end of the road and, like a metal wrapped present with smells of musty paper, offered adventure and travel and more laughter.  I miss the energy of chasing after the ice cream truck and licking creamy hands as the ice cream in the cones melted faster than could be consumed.Feet were always dusty and dirty no matter how much we swam or bathed.  We never wore shoes.  Bikes were for racing and getting a cool breeze going in your face and then hitting the top of the hill and putting your feet up on the handle bars and coasting down the long road on the other side.If there was errand money, I could spend the afternoon in the cool darkness of the movie theater, and then after the movie ended and the credits rolled being totally disoriented emerging in the bright light and heat of the day feeling as if I had just landed on some alien planet.Now I only notice the details of the season in passing.  I spend most of my time in a climate controlled office and hear the complaints of others about the heat.  Here it is the first day of summer and the crepe myrtles are starting to bloom!  They used to be the late July flowers.  They were what I planted for late summer color when all the other plants had wilted or dried under the intense heat.  Is this global warming?

The article I read in addtion to \"Full Fathom Five's Father's Day post motivated this blog entry.  It really should be posted in my  Room Without Walls blog, since it is about my outdoor rooms,  but, I think after reading MLF's entry, other people are also good Samaritans when it comes to helping these slow and gentle creatures--although I don't think her turtle was a box turtle.Anyway, her husband actually stopped traffic to help a turtle off the highway on Father's Day.  And in perhaps not an odd coincidence, we did the very same thing the morning of the very same day.  We were leaving the house and heading up the hill just beyond a blind curve.  I made hubby put on the hazards even though the road was quiet, because the teenagers sometimes take that country road like a speedway.  I dashed out to pick up this small box turtle and put him gently in the grass on the side of the road where he was headed.We have at least two resident box turtles in our land at the house.  (I guess when I finally move there full time I won't keep making the above a qualifying statement.)  Anyway, one is particularly lovely with the brightest yellow.Earlier in this same weekend when I was sitting in my easy chair I came across an article about box turtles.  This is what I learned:  Box turtles are rare in our area.  They need a \"mosaic\" of environments to survive---more than just woodlands.  Picking up the animal can be stressful and endanger its health.  If you move a box turtle too far from its path or turn it in the opposite direction, documented research shows that it can become disoriented, dehydrated and eventually die.  The author did say that you can pick up a box turtle on the highway and help it go in the direction it intended.So, we did our good deed and maybe saved this rare fellow who might have been a father.  So, now you know."},

In an article from the Alaska Journal of Commerce  \"Lane estimates that Taku Fisheries processed about 10 million pounds  of fish annually, and given about 35 percent waste, was grinding and  dumping some 3 million pounds of fish wastes annually. \"Now where in pristine Alaska were they dumping all this, I wonder?                                  6) Did you know that Thomas the Train stories were originated by a minister and that some of the episodes are narrated by Alec Baldwin?

It may surprise you that I know the exact age of this shirt --- 35 years old this July.This shirt entered our lives in 1972 when we were living in Palau, Micronesia.  It is a shirt made by my own hand.  There are no shirt stores on Palau, or at least there were not any stores like that when we lived there.  I was quite the little homemaker back then and for hubby's birthday and in anticipation of a potential trip back to the states in the fall, I made him a couple of shirts.  I French seamed them if you notice that kind of thing.  It still fits, if you note that kind of thing.

It will be at some financial cost , but I am so stressed that I think it will be worth it.  It will also mean I have less clout with other staff, but I am tired of fighting battles.I am asking the retiremnet people to crunch the numbers and if they are not too painful I am going to trade time for money.

{"title": "Johnny Depp and My Grandson", "date": "Wednesday, May 30, 2007", "text": "What does Johnny Depp have to do with my grandson?  Well, pay attention and I will draw the lines.Hubby has been on travel for quite a while and so, like the typical person I am, I spend a lot of time channel surfing when he is gone.  I can watch 15 minutes of something and then jump to something else for a short time and then onward to the next batch of schlock.   Once in a while I do find something that I watch to the end.  But without hubby, who approaches everything very linearly (I don't think that is a word.), I don't have to stay on one channel.  Linear...lines?...yes, I am getting to drawing them, patience.I was hanging ten with the remote when I came across the biography of Johnny Depp.  He is one of the most interesting actors around these days as well as sexy in a very odd but acid-taking-intellectual way.  I had to stop and watch the interview and the biographer's comments.  While watching there is always this little voice in the back of my head that keeps saying \"He's just BS-ing everyone.  He isn't really like that.\"As I watched I told myself (with hubby gone I talk lots to myself---even out loud many times), \"He never steps out of character from interview to interview, so maybe he is true blue.\"Then he said the following (which due to my age and memory skills I clearly paraphrase.)\"It all about family.  I mean hanging out with them.  If it is a 12-hour-day of Barbie, than so it is.  That is what it is all about.\"See, he IS BS-ing!  I just spent an 8-hour day keeping my grandson out of trouble while his parents packed up their house for the upcoming move.  We did 1 hour of trains, 2 hours of push the cart around the park/playground, 5 minutes of swinging, 1 hour of trains, 30 minutes of hide-and-seek, 30 minutes of attempted lunching, 30 minutes of watching High-5 on TV and 1 additional hour of wandering from room to room and finally a drive in which he fell asleep.  The return from the car in 20 minutes meant he was still sleeping in my arms as I sat down on the sofa and parents assured me he had to stay there in my arms.  So there was another 2 hours of napping--which in spite of my tone here really is heaven on earth.Now, please try to counter my argument.1)  No child that I know does 12 hours of  ANYTHING unless there are medical problems.2)  No parent or grandparent could remain sane if the child did 12 of hours of anything.3)  2 hours of any activity while fun quickly becomes enough for any adult with a brain!I want a video of Johnny Depp playing Barbie with his child for 12 hours on YouTube."},
{"title": "Some Pathogenic Thoughts", "date": "Friday, May 25, 2007", "text": "This may be a little graphic for some of you.  Those of you who have reached that time in your life where nothing shocks may get a chuckle.At our house we have been doing lots of 'brush clearing.'  This is now a national cultural thing with the examples set by our illustrious leader, and my husband and I are eager to be the true patriots and try our skill.  (Actually we have been doing this for years in many countries and states and probably considered ourselves somewhat the experts.)You may remember my recent photo showing all the red lines on my sexy legs from the wild roses but not showing the poison ivy's wrath that appeared a few days later.  I don't think our illustrious leader gets that down and dirty, because he never seems to have any scars  or weepy sores to show off.Anyway, since my hubby is partially retired he gets to play in the jungle (forest) more than I.  I was able to wangle a working-from-the-house day today and was focusing on a nasty database entry at about 7:00 in the morning when hubby shuffled out of the bedroom scratching his you-know-what and looking around surprised the sun had come up already.He started the conversation (after \"Good morning.\") with \"I think I have a little problem.\"\"What?\"  I asked not taking my eyes from my laptop screen.\"I found a tick down here.\"  He was pointing to that nether region which is so venerated by the male of our species.Me: \"Oh?\"  Now realizing I was going to have to take a work-break.\"Yeah.  I got it out, but I think there is another one down in the same area.  Can you take a look?\"\"Can I get my camera?  This would be great for my blog!\"\"No.\" he groaned.  Then he hit his head on the lower wall groaning again while he lay down on his back on the floor and assumed the position.  The reason he hit his head is that men don't usually get to assume 'the position.'  There he was with his pants down and his legs spread eagle and his hand on one of the two orbs pulling it aside. Sure enough there was something brown and round and small next to some red skin.  It didn't look like it had legs or a head, though, but at my age, I can't see anything smaller than a pea.\"Do we have a magnifying glass down here at the house?\"  I asked.He pointed to the paperweight on top of the desk where I had recently been working.  I don't have the right computer to resize---so photo will be high res.  How apropos is this crab, don't you think?Well, to make a long story longer, I actually still had trouble pulling the little brown dot away from the skin and eventually realized it was a skin tag...amazing the pain a spouse will let you inflict when he thinks you know what you are doing.Later at lunch I went out to weed the beds for about ten minutes and when I came back inside found that I had a number of bites on my legs.  I mused out loud...\"Great, now I will get both Lymes disease and West Nile virus.  They will never be able to diagnose how I died.\"Hubby smirked...\"Maybe we could get Dr. House to help.\"For those of you who do not watch TV this is an egocentric, genius, pathological doctor who solves the most ridiculous medical cases each week, usually after he inflicts lots of pain on the patient while belittling his attractive interns.(My scenario would be,  after he removes about three organs he would solve my diagnosis.)"},

I love planting bloomers and I love putting out those plants that provide something I can cut to bring inside to keep the outdoors alive.  With new shrubs that are too small to trim away blooms (rhododendrons, roses, etc.) at the new house,  I have very few plants  that I can cut.  Those few the deer are helping to prune.  So I planted a few perennial sunny happy daisies.  Each plant different and blooms about two weeks apart.  These were the first to bloom thus far, and yes, I cut most to bring inside and then had to pad the whole display with ornamental grasses and wild grass seed heads to keep it less anemic.

{"title": "Kinnikinnick for Mothers", "date": "Thursday, May 10, 2007", "text": "The name sounds like a dance or a bird call or a rhythmic clicking of tongue and tooth when pronounced.   Perhaps a dance done by Indians in Latin America using bamboo poles?  According to the National Wildlife Federation the definition is not so romantic.  It is an Indian word for many tobacco substitutes.  The species name Arctostaphylos uva-ursi is broken out to mean \"arctos=bear\" and \"staphyle=grape,\"  and in Latin uva is \"a bunch of grapes\" and I am guessing that ursi also has something to do with bear--- thus the common name bear berry.As a small child growing up in Colorado this little bush was everywhere in the lower mountains.   I remember how strange its name sounded when my mother joyfully pointed it out each spring.  I remember how much my mother loved the appearance of the little pink flowers hanging like gentle bells.    I just recently learned that it is a cotoneaster...which I should have grasped if I had any observational skills.At any rate, it was one of my mother's favorite plants.   She always went for the quiet underdogs over the showy botanical specimens.  My mother was a prickly and darkly mooded person in some ways, and that is why I don't write about her much.   We had our lack of meeting of the minds as I grew up, and I really think the fault was mostly hers.    I say that without anger or recrimination because I know the fault is mostly mine for many other things.   Among her children I was the showy specimen, more attractive and louder than the others and moving boldly into others spaces like some crazy spreading wildflower with too strong a fragrance.      This was just me and I couldn't change my personality for anyone.  Therefore, mother favored my other sister who was the quieter one and certainly the more generous in spirit.   Like the kinnikinnick both were the sturdy ones while I became emotionally vested and overwrought in stuff of little consequence.  And yet, both have passed on, one certainly way before her gentle time.Therefore, when selecting plants for my landscaping I came across this shrub and felt that I needed to purchase two for the bed by the front door,  as homage to that woman who, in her own way, made me what I am today ---whatever that is.And  also I must remember the other important mother in my life...my daughter.  And above is an image I created just for her that \"madonna of all things small.\"  (Hard to believe she is 6 months pregnant with that figure!)I am off on another adventure with my daughter and son-in-law and husband, so may not be posting unless hubby has access with his laptop.  BUT I wish all the mothers strength, love and understanding and command that all the kiddos be there for mom even though she is a pain in the butt sometimes!"},
{"title": "What Goes Around Comes Around", "date": "Tuesday, May 08, 2007", "text": "I got my questions from Maya's Granny, the deepest of thinkers in Alaska.Here are my questions to answer:1. Name one thing that you wanted to be when you grew up that you didn't become, but that has shown up in other ways in your life. Tell us about it.I wanted to be an actress--loved the melodrama and was convinced I could really act.  I even minored in drama in college.  This skill shows up ALL THE TIME in my life.  Timing of ones lines is, of course, everything.2. What one thing would you change about yourself if you could?I would be more mellow and more wise in the grand scheme  of things.  I tend to dwell on stuff that isn't all that important.  If I could fly up high and get some perspective I would be a better person.3. What is the most important thing to find in a friend?Loyalty.  Through thick and thin and even when you screw up.4. Tell us about one thing you did before you were six years old that is in some way typical of you still.I got my fingers pinched in a door when saying goodbye to an Uncle as I was leaning forward.  My mother thought she saw it and I fought back the tears and pretended that I had not gotten hurt.  I tend to hide my vulnerabilities to this day.5. If you could grant three wishes, who would you grant them to?Boy this is a hard one!  Off the top of my head I was going to grant the President of the U.S. the wish--as a generic ruler here--not really thinking of my good 'friend' Bush.   But clearly re-thinking this decision in that I cannot crawl inside the heart or mind of a future president.  So,  I am going to cheat and grant one wish to three different people:My son.My youngest brother.A random young soldier in Iraq.OK:  Your turn readers.  (I will be on travel this weekend...so be patient if I don't get back right away!  Also, remember, I can be ruthless.)1. Leave me a comment saying, “Interview me.”2. I will respond by emailing you five questions. I get to pick the questions.3. You will update your blog with the answers to the questions.4. You will include this explanation and an offer to interview someone else in the same post.5. When others comment asking to be interviewed, you will ask them five questions."},

I was awakened by the intermittent rushing noise outside, which I, at first, thought was a distant motor boat out in the bay with its sound carried by the wind.

Yesterday's gentle soaking rains have cleansed the air of all softness.  The morning sun is sharp, the leaves are kelly green, the bark and branches are crisp in the shadows and the sky is scattered with leftover racing clouds still dressed in their early morning gray and pink and lavender nightgowns.Even the birds are dashing to the feeders instead of gliding.My 6-month pregnant daughter now waddles down the stairs in blurry-eyed search of a cup of milk for Xman.  I offer her coffee, but she is not ready and will return to bed and snuggle with Xman while he gets his early morning sustenance.All are missing this magic time.

{"title": "Lonely Afternoon Adventures-Life Story #9", "date": "Tuesday, May 01, 2007", "text": "It had started out as a typical afternoon on one of  the remote islands of the South Pacific.  It was a relatively calm day with coconut fronds waving gently at intervals and with moderate temperatures.  My husband and I had headed out on the laboratory boat with another scientist to survey some wild oyster beds.  The morning went fairly fast and we collected enough data to stop for an early lunch at the edge of the mangroves.    I was eating my tuna salad sandwich and gazing over the stern of the boat watching  an archer fish with fascination as he skulked in the shadows waiting for a meal from an unwary insect.The water in this area was shallow, only two feet deep, dropping gently to about four feet toward the open ocean before reaching the boat channel.   Brushing bread crumbs from my swimsuit, I stepped around the outboard and holding the top of the motor housing slipped over the back of the boat for a cooling swim after lunch.  Hubby and the colleague decided to motor to the other side of the mangrove peninsula to the mouth of a river in search of some innocuous biological event that I have since forgotten.Once the sound of the outboard had disappeared behind the mangroves, I realized how quiet it was with just the sound of my hands in the water and the insects on the island. Other than the boat just a short distance away, I could imagine I was the only person on the planet.   I poked in the soft sand with my toes and watched the sea birds in the distance and listened to the lapping of the gentle waves against the mangrove roots.  I was concentrating on retrieving a terebra  that I had unearthed with my big toe when I thought I saw the shadow of something on the surface of the water beside me.  I looked up but only saw the gently rippled gray surface of the water.  I looked down at the sand again, replacing the mollusk and slowly worked my way toward the open ocean until the water came to just below my shoulders for a complete cool down.   As I looked toward the horizon I once again caught movement out of the corner of my eye.  Suddenly, being all alone became somewhat unsettling.  I started scanning the waters around me and in a few minutes a gray dorsal fin broke the surface about ten feet away and swam a foot toward me and then moved away disappearing beneath the surface.I was guessing by the size of the fin that it was a small gray reef shark, maybe just over two feet in length, surveying the area.  In less than a minute, he returned.   Initially, I was fascinated by this typical behavior when he started circling me ever so slowly.   The concentric circles made by the dorsal fin that broke the surface of the water were about six feet away and getting closer.  I wasn't afraid of such a small shark until I remembered he also wasn't afraid of me.  He was a “teenager” out for an experimental event.   I had felt the sandpaper skin of a shark with my hands not that long ago and realized if he swiped me it would hurt and possibly draw blood, not a good event in shark country.The boat was too far away to hear my call and the prevailing breeze would have pulled my voice away anyway.  I also was too embarrassed to admit I needed help against such a little guy.  I moved carefully, walking backwards toward the mangroves, and scanning the surface of the water around me as I did so.  There was no place for me to get out of the water and the water wasn't shallow enough to prevent the shark from swimming directly at me.  I decided to throw caution to the wind (avoiding thinking about water snakes or crocodiles among the tangled tree roots—both of which existed in these parts) and stepped up to carefully balance on the larger arching mangrove roots as I leaned against the trees.  Leaves and blunt branches poked my head and shoulders as I squatted in precarious balance.  After about ten minutes of this yoga experience the shark became bored and left the area.As I sat balancing awkwardly on the roots in my bare feet I began to survey the mangrove jungle and did not realize I was in store for a second adventure of the day.  Behind me I heard a weak squawking noise that I must have missed earlier in my mild panic to eliminate the shark bait.  I couldn't see where the sound was coming from over my shoulder, and so, gently entered the water and walked behind the first section of mangroves to another sandy space behind the first patch of trees.  About a foot above my head I saw the cause of the noise.  A small blue heron had become caught in the mangrove branches.  His head was caught in the fork of a branch and while he flapped and squawked ever so weakly, his position and weight had trapped him.  His outspread wing was the only thing keeping him from hanging himself.Wary of his long and sharp bill, I realized that I was going to be responsible for his rescue.   I tried to balance on the roots but couldn't get high enough to grasp him safely…safely for him and for me.  The eye that stared at me was still clear but his movements were very weak.  He must have been there for hours.  I watched a few minutes more trying to think of some way to lift him from the branch.  I was starting to panic for him.  I called to my husband.  My call was lost in the great expense of water.  I walked around the trees and to the front of the island and putting my hands to my mouth called, hooted, and whistled toward the mouth of the river.It seemed that a lot of time passed, but eventually I heard the outboard and soon I saw the boat approaching.  My husband could see I was trying to convey some emergency, and when he kicked off the engine, I explained the plight of 'my' heron.  After I lifted myself aboard we poled our way to the back of the mangrove and were able to get close enough standing on the side of the boat to reach and eventually release the bird.  Actually, my husband did most of the gentle pulling and lifting while I provided encouragement.  We placed the bird carefully, with hands on bill, on a tree root and he paused getting his balance.  Like the shark, he too left us shortly for another clump of mangroves and the pursuit of another meal.  I didn't mention the little shark adventure until after we got back home."},

Only one little tick  and a beautiful lizard after all that tromping through the woods.  We were wary of copperheads, but didn't disturb any from wherever they were hiding.  Gee, I make my yard sound like a dangerous jungle!We also moved the pile of rocks and pile of bricks that the builders had left behind to a less obvious place.  That move disturbed a few dozen beetles. Above is the first bloom on the lovely clematis that I planted near the front door.  It is so fulfilling to start to see the plants come out of dormancy and open their blossoms. My weekends are so full trying to get the yard in order that I have little time to think of problems at work or otherwise.  I guess this is a good thing.  It is kind of a scary thing also, because I am afraid that when I retire the sudden lull will be like hitting a brick wall.  I better have something lined up.  Any ideas?"},

{"title": "A Dance of Love", "date": "Friday, April 06, 2007", "text": "Robert Brady, Claude at Blogging in Paris, and Chancy have all written recently about the pollen  or yellow desert dust or air born stuff and in some cases the resultant allergies.  Their posts brought a recent but slightly different image and experience to my mind.Twice in the past few years while hiking I have experienced what to me was a special and marvelous event.  It was unexpected, quiet, and very subtle; and had I been looking the wrong way, I would have missed it.  I probably had missed it many other times in my life.  The first time I saw this natural phenomena was on a hike in the Colorado Rockies.  We had just crossed a ridge and somewhat out of breath had paused just below the crest to look down into the next valley of firs and pines and junipers.  It was a quiet spring day except for the call of the jays and the occasional spring breeze that touched the evergreen branches.I was staring at the tops of dozens of elegant pine trees.  Then just below their tops, and without warning, a puff of yellow dust covering yards of space flew from one tree drifting like tiny sparks of life down the valley and across the other trees. Less then one  second later the next tree released its pollen and so on down through the valley just like a wave of golden phosphorescence.  The magic was in the timing and the silence.  It was clandestine and confidential as if I was observing the lovemaking between the trees, which in a sense, I was.I observed this same phenomena when I was in the desert in Arizona recently.  We were hiking back into the valley and paused to gaze back at the trail while standing under an Arizona pine tree.  Then just above my head the pine tree released a golden shower across the area.  The thing I noticed this time was there was no breeze, no  air movement that I could feel although clearly the air was moving above my head.  I touched the pine branch above my head to see if I could release more pollen and nothing, not one little spore, was released.I did some research on the process and the science indicates that there is \"no explosive dehiscence\"  in the process.  Maybe not, but they \"talk\" to each other in some way.  It is some dance of love that we cannot understand and it is sacred when you see it."},

He shares everything!   I was down at the new house and didn't have any mouth wash or vitamin C for the sore throat so spent the afternoon gargling with rum--really--probably not the best approach.I nursed a little temperature and upper congestion early in the week, and then feeling better, went to work last week for two and a half days, then totally lost my voice at the end of the week and stayed home once again.  I pushed myself over the next weekend, because I really wasn't feeling all that sick, just not sleeping well at nights due to coughing.I had to go to work this week as two new 'head' people have come on board and I am doing work for one in an Acting position and had to debrief him and the other is a new supportive person to my other program, so felt I had to be there.  I was also asked by my boss to coordinate a new project that may be like pushing jello uphill since no one seems to have a vision for how this project will contribute in any way to our colleagues and 'customers' needs but everyone wants their name on it so that they  get visibility.  I am trying to bring some semblance of reality to this...but may end up producing something flashy and useless as my illness has  compromised my energy and diplomacy.  I have been pushing and pushing at work and now feel I need to reboot.Soooooo, today I am calling the Doctor after having another rough night, and while intellectually  knowing he probably can't do anything, at least I hope to rule out bronchitus or pneumonia.  Maybe he can give me drugs.  I have caught two -- maybe three -- illnesses this year that seem to be due to my love of a grandchild who is building his immune system the hard way.

I do not have any furniture for this room so will have to find something that goes with plum wine?  At least if people spill their drinks, it will blend.  Hubby painted the trim on the bay window and deserves an award for that work.And below the wallpaper guy has taken on the dangerous job of completing the kitchen.

I have to put up the two samples this weekend and decide.As you can see from the photo below of the master bedroom, we are really getting settled in now and developing that lived in look.  I had to make curtains for the masterbath as I was tired of feeling strange walking around in the nude even though no one within miles can see in and no one would look twice if they did!  I was going to sew the curtains and then got lazy and just used the iron-on tape and they came out pretty good, even if they do look a little cheapo!The two framed harp shells are from something I did in Indonesia when I was working in batik.  The colors don't really go anywhere in the house, but the frames were so nice and matched and so we decided to put them up in the masterbath.  Yes, they ARE too far apart, but between my cold and the difficulty of hanging stuff at the end of a long day, we just decided to live with it!For what we did outside go to the \"Room Without Walls\" blog."},

I am watching a program called \"Impossible Islands\", a National Geograhic show.    This show is about that enormous palm shaped artificial island being built with oil money in Dubai.  The island is a palm tree shape offshore which will be a luxury resort and ocean city.  The engineering aspects of this monumental task are phenominal.  Using a private satellite is the only way they can get the curves on the palm branches accurately curved.  Tons and tons of rock are taken from the inland and delivered on a 24-hour-a-day schedule to build the breakwater which I see slowly takes place before they can deposit the sand for the actual island on the inside of the breakwater.This whole enterprise is mind boggling.  The narrator explains that enough rock to build two pyramids was used for the breakwater.  Tons and tons of sand are dredged for the island.  Environmental issues have not reared their tenuous head yet on the show, although I admit I am watching from the middle of the program.  Somehow, though, while I have personally listened to Arabs criticise the way Americans waste petroleum resouces, this argument is not being applied in Dubai.The engineer that they interview sounds as though he is American.  Why do I think that Halliburton is involved somewhere in the massive distribution of money?Lots of engineering problems are discussed such as stagnant water during the finish of the breakwater (no biologists were clearly consulted in this engineering nightmare), being built in an earthquake zone, and problems with newly deposited and uncompacted sand.\"22 hotels--3 mile island--two years to complete phase one--400,000 apartments and shopping malls.\"  All of the houses are sold in something like three days with the most expensive going for 1.2 million dollars.  They keep adding and expanding and as I watch this I wonder why anyone would want to live on a crowded busy island with the business of Miami...wouldn/t a tiny island with a small cottage be so much more lovely?In a world with starving people, weapons of mass destruction, and new disease challenges every day, this whole project is such a waste of resources and time to me.  If I were a Crown Prince, I would like to think I could spend my money in better places.  For centuries leaders have built temples, palaces and pyramids to insure eternity of their memory and to show their power.If you get a chance to see the show, it is most fascinating!"},

Nineteen species are endemic to Arizona, which means their national champions must be in Arizona\" he says.

I deleted a few, but the natural beauty of this harsh land lends itself to the most amateurish of us.  The weather was variable and one day we even got caught in a light rain and I had an umbrella in my back pack which I used.  It was exotic being in the desert during a light spring rain.If I was a geologist I would point out that \"Major depositional episodes occurred in the later Paleozoic, Paleocene, Miocene and Quaternary periods.\"  According to the local tourist page  this  beauty was \"formed from ancient deposits of limestone, mudstone and sandstone when this area was the west coast of a still emerging continent.\"  Hey were are talking 2 billion years here folks.  Think about that as you smoke your peace pipe and gaze out over the valley and watch the bluejays perform their mating swoops.  We are such a little teeny tiny blip on the surface and in the grand scheme of things.  And while we are quite lovely, we don't hold a sparkle to this beauty.Sometimes you will see granite that formed from the volcanic explosions that has layered over the exposed red sandstone.  The exotic presence of this violent geology seems to attract psychics and spiritualists from everywhere.  They feel the overwhelming presence of locked time and try to grasp its meaning, share its energies, explain its strength, feel its vortexes.  But we are too small and we try too hard (and the commercial exchange of money for this is most annoying).I reduced the size of the pictures, so I apologize if the digital rendition is compromised.  And where you may ask does the red come from?...iron oxides.The next lesson is on botany and involves tree bark...yes more photos of tree bark that are like Monet  or Pissaro paintings.

Something was odd...what was I missing...oh.. yes, that great cup of coffee had been left on the kitchen counter.I was over half-way to the office, so, since my walk takes me right by the Caribou Coffee store, I decide to get a cup from them.  The lights were on low toward the back of the store, but the door was unlocked.  There were two people ahead of me waiting for their order to be taken, and the two java vendors were busy setting out all the carbohydrates for \"breakfast on the run\" and getting the paper cups stacked.  They seemed to take their time taking orders.  First the woman in front got her coffee.  I wasn't paying much attention when the man in front of me got his coffee.

{"title": "Travel is REALLY so much fun! LifeStory #8", "date": "Monday, March 12, 2007", "text": "I have to admit that I have traveled LOTS and LOTS in my life. I have traveled across the United States, throughout ASIA and even somewhat in Central America and Europe and Northern Africa. This was due to a promise I made to myself as a young girl that I would see as much of the world as I could, come hell or high water. And, after all of these trips, the airlines has lost my luggage only once. This was on my first trip to my new in-laws in Florida. I didn't panic too much because at 24 you can still look good in clothes that you have been wearing for 24 hours. With the luck of being young, the very next morning a van arrived at my new in-laws door and dropped off the suitcases intact and locked. I was watching the Today Show a few weeks ago and they were talking about lost luggage. The guest expert was providing tips for when the airlines lost your luggage. He repeated the word \"when\" and emphasized that he did not say \"if.\"If you live and travel long enough the world changes and your luck changes. Upon our arrival at our airport in the early evening this past weekend, we noticed a large number of people waiting for their bags at one baggage claim. We lined up like penguins and waited and watched as the intermittent and sometimes static aluminum delivery belt went round and round. After 20 minutes my husband realized that our luggage had not made the transition from Phoenix to Denver to Columbus and to our final destination. (When you travel on 'points' you get to see a lot more of the country than you can imagine or actually want to see.) . Shortly after my husband's realization, there was an announcement on the loudspeaker system that the baggage officials (hiding behind the speakers) were very sorry but they did not know where the luggage from the Philadelphia flight was. They were working on it and they asked for patience. About 50% of the people moaned, groaned and wandered off. We were not on the Philadelphia flight and while wondering how an airline can lose all of the luggage on a flight, we became more concerned about our sweaty but well-packed clothes.We were rewarded almost an hour later with a blue form to complete regarding our missing luggage. (One of the wives asked her husband if this meant they would get a free flight---she hasn't traveled much I was thinking.) I walked the length of the entire baggage claim area which is about two football fields and I hate to tell you that I saw hundreds and hundreds (not exaggerating) of suitcases and bags that sat on the floor forlornly alone next to baggage claim areas on that Sunday evening. The dozens of strollers alone made me sad for the aching arms of mothers and fathers in our nation.The announcement that we had been recently moved from yellow to orange in our homeland security settings (much like the settings on your oven) did not assure me in any way as I saw all these potential lethal weapons of mass destruction sitting on the floor as far as the eye could see.Thus, we went home and to bed.Hubby got a call at 1:00 P.M. on Monday. \"This is United. Are you going to be home for the next 4 hours? \" When he answered \"Yes.\" they hung up. They were either planning on delivering luggage or robbing us. So, he waited patiently.Five hours later I was home and had eaten dinner and there is still no luggage. Hubby called the number that had called him at 1:00 and heard from a computer that they were too busy to answer the phone and to call back later. My guess is that the all-great office of baggage losers had been discovered and passengers were holding them hostage.After this recent trip, I wondered if the wagon trains crossing the desert had it any easier? I really think that the good ole USA is getting to be more like a developing nation each and every day. It is a good thing I have traveled in the 'third' world or I would have said some of the things that were being said at the airport last night when people headed for their taxis empty handed.Post Script at 6:00 P.M.Hubby is currently talking to a computer.....Now he is talking to someone who clearly lives in India or Pakistan...Now he is listening to very irritating United Airlines music ...good choice on their part to continually remind us of the company that screwed up...9:10 P.M. the phone rings. Our luggage has arrived and doesn't appear much the worse for the wear. I wonder where it got to travel?On some of the days the sky in the desert was an indescribable blue.  Have you ever seen such a color?  I didn't do any digital tweaking and for once the camera lense captured what I saw against the white bark of this desert sycamore.  The green in the center is mistletoe.  They must do a lot of kissing in Arizona, because it was everywhere.  (Click the photot for a bigger view.)The mornings were a cool 45 and by afternoon Sedona hills were warming to a toasty 70 degrees.  Perfect weather for hiking if you layered your clothes.We had not been to Sedona, Arizona for almost a decade and I noticed substantial changes starting with the fifteen minute traffic jam to get to the other side of the hill where we were staying upon our arrival.  This place in the desert among the red rocks is being loved to death by soul searchers, mystics, retirees, real estate developers, bike riders, hikers (us), rich Californians and tourists from around the world.  The year-round population of Sedona is supposed to be about 12,000 but this is followed by the statement that over 4,000,000 tourists visit each year.   The city of Pheonix to the south is growing even faster.In spite of the initial shock we were able to get away from it all and find some restorative hours studying the flora and fauna each day.  We packed light lunches and extra water and always found a challenging or not-so-challenging trail to fill our day.I still have over 300 photos to sort, but will not post them all here."},

I have many regrets and pain and just CANNOT share it.  I may be a coward but I just need time.   So enough on that.Now for some random thoughts that are keeping me sane.1. How do you think Al and Tipper's evening went and what were they thinking when they ate dinner with people who use double-sided tape to get dressed?2.  I may never retire, with today's stock market free-fall.  Have you bought anything made in the United States lately?

I will not get a lifetime achievement award in my field (as my husband has recently gotten) when I retire unless not killing an immature twit that I work with counts as a mature gesture on my part.  I am still trying very hard to kill her with kindness and this gesture deserves some type of reward, don't you think?4.  Now the US Center for Science in the Public Interest says that chain restaurants routinely serve \"A 2,000-calorie appetizer. A 2,000-calorie main course. Another 1,700 calories for dessert.\"   While I am smart enough to know the caloric dangers of eating in a restaurant and frequently split entrees or desserts with my hubby, I am a little sruprised at these numbers!  Shouldn't we get a little truth in advertising on the menus?  After all, this isn't a once a year visit to Roy's, my favorite restaurant.5.  Whoopee!    Spring is coming.  After my memorial long weekend with my family, my husband and I are escaping to Arizona using up some 'points'.

A morning doctor's appointment followed by a ten mile drive and two afternoon meetings. These days she had a second job as back-up for a departing colleague.  Two jobs and her time was always overfilled.  She wouldn't have been late except for the 6:00 AM phone call.  That call resulted in several other phone calls all of which took more precious time. Time she didn't have.  Also she was moving slowly and without energy because for some reason she woke up at 2:00 A.M. after just a few hours of sleep.   She found herself lying in bed --wide awake.   Never really got back to sleep.The trip to the doctor's was way back in her old neighborhood.  Morning rush hour was in full play and she had to squeeze her little car between two big SUVs.  Although she was driving back to the old neighborhood, she found it irritating that the new buildings and road changes were confusing.  This confusion seemed to happen to her more often these days, and it was irritating.  She began to realize that her distracted mind needed to concentrate or she would miss the turn.Arriving at the doctor's office 20 minutes early gave her time to make some calls to work to let people know of her changed schedule.  Too much sympathy and chit chat.  Just make sure that the right people get the changes.  Just need to get through this day.She liked this doctor and had gone to him for years.  He asked how she was and she provided the usual 'fine.'  He didn't really want to know and she didn't really want to start the conversation.  Four clinical breast massages later he called the nurse into the room and Tabor took the 'position.'  God this was painful this time!   It felt as if he was inserting pointed knives.  Tabor bit her lip as tears streamed down her face.  Doc E. apologized and did try to be more gentle.  Tabor commented that getting old was the pits.  She knew if she didn't stop these tears they would flow like melting snow.  Doc E. asked again if she was OK.  Tabor smiled and winced.It wasn't until she got to the technician who was taking her blood later that the how-are-you question was answered honestly.  Tabor was surprised that she was able to say directly to this perfect stranger that her father has passed on last night.  Now she had said it three times this morning.  Once to her husband, once to the secretary at work and now to this perfect stranger.  Since it didn't get any easier, Tabor decided she wasn't going to say it anymore.Tabor dealt with things in the cliched fashion of not thinking about it, not talking about it, not retrospectively writing about it, not dwelling on it.  It was over.  The long battle of hospitals and IV's and feeling guilty because her brothers and sister  and sister-in-law bore the heavy burden was passing.  Tabor felt relief.  But she wouldn't tell her family that.  They wouldn't think her honest...just cold.  She knew that she would be dealing with this in bits and pieces in years to come.  But that was the only way she could swallow it right now.Now for the call to the kids...Tabor realized she had to say it again."},

Our starting point was bitterly cold and the land was covered in about an inch of white snow covered by a crust of ice---like a white chocolate covered vanilla ice cream bar.After we had gone about 10 miles the snow disappeared and the land was covered in a silvery glitter with dirty mounds of earth peaking through the farm fields.Then after another 10 or 15 miles the land was clear of ice, but the trees and shrubs looked as if they had been painted with silver paint.  The sun was bouncing off the sices of the branches making it look like a forest of minimilist Christmas trees.As we reached the last ten miles, the trees resumed their normal winter gray dullness but when I looked at their base I saw broken silver bits of glass beneath the branches in a circle like a round lace petticoat.When we reached the river, it was frozen over and mirrored even more beautifully the various sunlight angles and shades of the late afternoon.  At times the view from the window was a watercolor painting.  There was a small pocket at one end of the river that had not frozen over and the geese were using this area as their strategic starting and stopping point.(By the way, Weary Hag, is back.

{"title": "The Oldest Profession", "date": "Tuesday, February 06, 2007", "text": "Well, while it is the oldest \"job\" and really is a profession there is yet some discussion on whether it is 'paid.'   I am talking about motherhood.I have been reading and watching someone in blogdom go through a painful breakup of a marriage involving small children.  (Blogdom is like the rabbit hole...you fall into another's honest life and it becomes as important as the lives of those you talk to each day.)  Like all marriages her's is complicated and there are many sides to the story including the sides of the children.  She has decided to get a divorce and that decision is neither right nor wrong.  Since this decision involves tremendous pain and sacrifice, I know that she has thought long and hard about this and feels that it is the BEST decision for her--and for those she cares about--maybe even including her future ex.  While I have never gone through a divorce (and therefore probably cannot really write about it)  I always thought of it like the amputation of a limb.  Sometimes the limb is so diseased and painful that the owner does not miss it nor its usefulness for any length of time once the initial pain and inconvenience are gone.  The fear and pain of the amputation is replaced by a deep breath of freedom and safety.  For others, this limb is loved and useful but requires too much bracing and support and therapy to keep it working and the owner just becomes tired --- muscle tired, bone tired.  So they carefully and intellectually proceed to get the surgery.  It is preceded by therapy and advice from EVERYONE around them.  They know, even without hope, though, that the divorce is the final necessary act.In so many cases  marriages dissolve because the woman loses herself.   She views the marriage like any very important job.  She puts in 125%.  But there is no promotion and certainly no change in status in this world.   She works 24 hours a day  seven days a week and doesn't think about down time or her needs.  She is going to be the best G--D--- wife ever and her kids are never going to want for support and sustenance and her husband is going to be treated like the breadwinner king that he is.   This is a particularly difficult role to play if you are also working 40 hours a week as many women are.  Of course, hubby is in shock when the big D rears it ugly head.   Men (and yes, I generalize here) are not perceptive in relationships and tend to ignore subtle and blatant clues.   He thought that the pure love was the only currency necessary.  He thought she really was passionate about all of this stuff.  Clean toilets, perfectly crafted couponed shopping, child psychology on call, and of course, sex on call.  Few men are raised to look at marriage the same way they would look at a business partnership.  I admit I didn't raise my son that way. And then as the children grow and she gets a little space and down time she has moments of clarity that she lost her real self somewhere along the way.  She realizes that the woman her husband married is deeply buried in a half-lidded body and an ugly gray sweatsuit.  She finds there are things she would like to change in the marriage, but she doesn't have the necessary power or energy to make the changes,  that is, until she makes the BIG change.I wish there was some magic formula to make marriages work for those intelligent people.  Some perfect therapy or medicine or chant.Oh well, it is not the end of the world in the grand scheme of things.  It is the beginning of a new life and both will stretch and grow and learn.  And both will look back on this time, and if they are mentally healthy, they will view it as a lesson and it will make them better people.Your turn."},

If you recognize him, I would love to send him this photo which came out very well.The title of this blog was taken from a movie called \"My Cousin Vinny\" which came out in  1992 starring Joe Pesci, Ralph Maccio and Marisa Tomei.  It is a silly black comedy about a murder trial and the class of regional cultures  in America.  Due to a series of miscommunications and misunderstandings, two young New Yorkers are charged with murder in a small Alabama town.  Joe Pesci, a personal injury lawyer, flies down from New York to save his cousin.  He brings along his girlfriend Marisa Tomei and the clash of cultures begins.  The line above results from a discussion between the boyfriend (Pesci) and the girlfriend (Tomei) who accuse each other of not fitting adequately into the rural southern town setting.  The movie did not get great reviews, but it obviously has struck a chord with me if I remember it after more than a decade.  I loved the clash of the culture of New York 'gansta' and Alabama 'good-old-boy'.  I am drawn to those stories where characters from totally different backgrounds have to interact, adjust and begin to understand and respect each other.  Vinnie is totally regarded as a loser at the beginning of the movie because of his thick accent and strange black suit.  He wins the case with the help of his 'smart' girlfriend in leather and boots and raw outspoken bravada.  While it had a predictable ending, I enjoyed the cultural dance and surrprise.I was intrigued by, if not quite understanding the allure,  the recent news that the Japanese woman are drawn to the cartoon SpongeBob Squarepants  thing and that all of his iconic wares are selling like hotcakes or should I say okonomyaki?I was reassured (not threatened) by a featured news story about a a very popular New Jersey theater that shows only Bollywood movies and serves Indian food.  The Asian Indian Americans can relax in a theater and pretend they are back home.I am pleased to see the salsa dance clubs that are filling our cities  due to the influx of Latino immigrants-- even though I think I have forgotten my salsa steps totally and could never match a real latino woman who loves her rhythm.While waiting in line at the maternity store this weekend (for my daughter, of course) I watched and listened to the ebullient discussion between a woman from the Philippines who was interviewing a woman from Gabon for a job in the store.  Each with their own thick accents talking in English.I have a friend who years ago had car trouble in her hometown of Miami and had to pull into a gas station in a part of town where no one spoke English.  She spoke no Spanish.  It was a very difficult night for her.  I don't feel so good about that incident as she related it, and while I respect other cultures, I think English does have to be the official language.  Communication is everything.  English has to be the language we can depend on in our schools and our businesses allowing other languages to be  used for supplement and assistance only. (Although I will admit the media has allowed American English to fall into the realm of disaster!)(As a 2013 addendum to this post, I watch refugees take shelters in every ruined corner of the world and on every open dust swept dessert this year and want to find them mixing their accents in my neighborhood.)"},

What would the Dali Lama say?\".. .Be gentle with the earth.\"  Is that because he knows it will quit sucking if we aren't gentle?1.  Today the office received a FedEx package that had been sent from our own agency in an office only two doors away!!  The strangest thing was that 50% of the people who were told about this were not surprised.  As long as we continue to hire people based on their politics and not their skills....2.  I was told to pick up a new access pass for my apartment today and to turn in the old access pass.  The lady who gave me the new pass said that it should be operational, but she also handed me back my old pass and smiled, \"just in case.\"  Lucky for me I had the old pass when I tried to enter my apartment building on this very cold afternoon.3.  My husband called from the house to ask about pulling a wine from my little chiller so that he could bring a gift to his Carolina friends when he drives down this evening.  I cannot tell you how funny it was trying to understand what he was saying as he read each wine bottle!  I finally told him to just go the wine store and tell them he wanted a nice Cabernet in the $25 range.4.  My co-worker told me that his father-in-law, who lives in Las Vegas, thinks that the whole recycling program is a Communist plot and he refuses to participate when he comes to visit.  Guess which party ticket he votes?5. After perusing my latest order from Netflix and watching my choices for TV shows, my husband has suggested that I may have a bit of a personality disorder. I like to watch Monk and Gilmore Girls, both TV shows that reflect very neurotic people al la Woody Allen with much second guessing, over-talking and lack of self esteem. I also seem lately to order movies from Netflix that are dramas about the racial problems and wars in third world countries. What is up with that? (In defense I think Ugly Betty is one of the best TV shows to come along in a long time and watch it regularly.)6. I love Star Trek--the TV shows-- and think Rosenberry was a wonderful writer but the Star Trek actors are given terrible lines. Great plot yet such soap opera dialogue and over the top acting. Just turn off the sound and watch the TV show and see if you can keep from laughing.7. I am moving from an area where I am in walking distance of a 20 screen movie theater and also another 5 screen venue for art films. In the future I am moving to a place that has an old movie theater with just one or two screens and an audience that talks back to the screen.8. After much searching on the Internet I found the location of the showing of  the movie,\"The Painted Veil.\" If you like a rich and realistic love story set in an exotic location with lots of good drama and great acting, than this is worth a long drive to see. This movie will rapidly disappear from the listings, so catch it now."},
{"title": "Get Your Whirligig On Straight", "date": "Thursday, January 25, 2007", "text": "The world is a whirling place.  It stops for no man and as everyone's lives around you also whirl you most certainly will wake up and find yourself in a strange or different place before your whirling is over.  Last night I had drafted a blog on how miserable I am at my job and realized before posting, but after the cathartic writing, that people who have truly difficult jobs or even more challenging, no job at all, would not really be interested or sympathetic in my painful office politics or how useless I feel in my waning career these days.  (I make good money, I can pretty much do what I want each day...get over yourself, Tabor.)  And while I blog primarily for myself and posterity, I also have grown to love and admire co-bloggers and therefore feel some responsibilty in wasting their time.  So I deleted the post.Then, as if this realization was not enough, I was standing in my boss's office talking this morning when one of our guest speakers was  brought in for an introduction.  This man had had a good career in the environmental sciences in the military and retired in his mid-50's and was currently working on a PhD in another area.  One chapter from his thesis was what he was going to talk about to our group.He was small in stature and not exceptional physically in any way.  You would not notice him passing on the street.  But his personality was noticable.  He was energetic and effusive and charming.  There are people in this world that just love life and love what they do and when they stop doing what they do, they find something else to love and you can feel the magnetic pull of that enthusiasm.  They always seems to land on their feet and see the glass as half full.  In talking about his life and family  he revealed that he had two children.  One of them was a daughter who had drug problems and also had a two-year-old out-of-wedlock child.  He said that she was going to lose custody of this child and after many meetings with lawyers and social workers, he and his wife realized that if they ever expected to see this grandchild again, they would have to adopt her.  He clearly was still working through this big decision.  The fact that he shared it with complete strangers without compunction puts him in that category of people who have total trust in the world.  (Not a category where I have ever had the luxury of being a member.)He mind was filled with questions about how his physical stamina would be so that he could still be a parent in ten years when this girl was 12.  His whole concern was about his energy levels waning...not at  all about the expense and scheduling adjustments and personal sacrifices involved in raising a small child.I have a grandchild that is about the same age, and while I would throw myself at the foot of any judge without a second's thought to beg for custody, I also could not fail to realize all the work that is entailed in raising another human being.   All the sacrifices, the compromises, the intellectual effort in trying to find out what is happening in a young person's culture.  Trying to understand MySpace, YouTube, Wii and still sharpen the tools to protect that person from all the bad stuff while ALSO defending your gray hair and cane in this youth obsessed culture is not a challenge I would be eager to face."},

{"title": "Out of Place  Life Story #7", "date": "Thursday, January 18, 2007", "text": "In every person's life, most likely when they are crossing that uneven bridge between childhood and adulthood, but many times happening even later, there are times when you go to a social gathering or you are among strangers and you know immediately you do not fit.  You are suddenly and coldly an alien on the side of the planet where you have just landed.  This has happened quite a few times in my life, maybe due to my insecurities or maybe due to my conservative (don't laugh) nature or maybe my plain impatience with society and unwillingness to \"fit in.\"In graduate school in Hawaii, as a very poor student only months away from obtaining a teaching certificate, I and a date from Nicaragua (another life story) went to a party at one of the houses near campus.  Neither of us knew the party givers very well, but we sensed almost immediately upon entering the dark living area that we were out of our place.  The group of young men and women were very casually sitting around the floor draped around furniture and each other and talking in quiet tones as if they had known each other for many years.  The sweet smell of marijuana  took its laid-back time reaching us as we both sat on the floor with our backs to the wall.  It may come as a surprise to readers, but I never tried the stuff. I knew it was against the law and while I may have gotten three sheets to the wind on good beer in my college days at the dance hall near campus, I was not going to risk losing my teaching certificate (my ticket out of poverty) just to try some illegal buzz. Everyone was facing a screen at the end of the room with a slide projector set up at the opposite end.    There was some food on a table behind the furniture, but no one seemed to be interested.  In a short time familiar psychedelic 60's music started and the projector was turned on.  The slides seemed to be about some camping vacation that several of the people in the room had taken, although it was too dark for me to really tell who in the room matched with the slide photo.  Pictures of the camp set-up, food cooking and people sitting around a fire were the first part of the show.  No one in the room did any talking, everyone just watched.  The following slides of the next day's camping were a little different.  Everyone had seemed to misplace their clothes and the weather in Hawaii was warm enough that no one on the camping trip seemed to notice that they were all naked.  Looking back on this show, I realize it was not as shocking as I thought at the time.  I wasn't all that innocent in life, but my date (a good Latin Catholic) turned to me and suggested we may want to leave and go get some coffee somewhere.  I found myself very uncomfortable seeing people I didn't even know in their birthday suits and agreed to leave.  We made a 'graceful exit.'  Perhaps if I had really known these folks, I would not have felt quite so odd and out of place.  Maybe if it had been more than the second date with my Nicaraguan friend, I would have felt more comfortable.  Who knows.  I just know I was Out of Place.It has been a long time since I felt uncomfortable in any social or other situation.On Monday morning my husband and I were on our way back to the city from our house on the river.  Since we were goofing around and failed to eat breakfast, I proclaimed that we deserved Dunkin Donuts and coffee.  This is a rare treat as we tend to eat healthier in our old age.  After loading the car we headed to the nearby shopping center.It was about 9:00 A.M. and several early workers were already taking their mid-morning coffee break.  We seemed to be noticed by several of them as we exited our car, which would not have surprised me so much when I was a young and, if I do say so myself, attractive woman.  But since this was certainly no longer true, I was wondering what was up.  Then my husband passed ahead of me in his eager stride toward the pastry palace.   Aha!   Mystery solved.  He had on a very nice suit and tie for a luncheon meeting that he had planned in the city.  He looked so out of place and I quietly mentioned it to him when I caught up.  He threw back his head and laughed, which caused an elderly man in front of us to turn and look, not once but several times.  My husband said under his breath \"Make way for the Senator.\"  Something only a man raised in the South would say and I had to smile.Upon entering Dunkin's my husband actually turned to the two men behind us and smiled and gesturing to his suit said apologetically, \"I have a meeting today.\"I grinned thinking they probably thought he was appearing before a judge.  Weddings and court hearings would be the only time one would see someone in a suit in that part of the county...unless they were a Senator, of course."},

A lot of energy was expended by them to live on the river next to man who uses the river as a freeway.By the time we caught up to where they were resting there was only a floating \"calling card.\"Note the photos have not been downsized so be prepared for slowness of loading if you click for a larger view.I don't know if this was the same fellow/fellowess who ate lunch in our backyard a while back.

I think one of these is call \"beerblogging\".  Well, I am on my second glass of a blush wine that was actually made by a friend of mine and so I am \"blushblogging.\"This rose is very good and reminds me of the Portugese rose that was all the rage among the young college set  in the 60s and 70s.  To a college student the wine seemed so exotic and came in an interesting and unsually shaped red clay-colored bottle.  It had gentle little bubbles and was as close to a champagne as we could afford.  I cannot for the life of me put my finger on the label...but I am sure my peer bloggers will help me out, please!  I think it was introduced via the soldiers who traveled to Europe and then came back to let us know how sophisticated they were because I remember that I discovered it from a soldier or two that I dated.Anyway, enough about my youthful love life, because this blog entry is about something else.  Two glasses of wine now have made me admit after all these years, that birthdays are sort of important.  In case anyone is interested, I turned the big 60 on the 21st of December.  My sister remembered and sent me a lovely cashmere shawl (?), my daughter and her husband got me an espresso coffee maker (? kitchen appliances at 60?) which I returned for a food processor which is a little more practical, and my hubby and son bought me a lovely drusy necklace with a garnet that they got at a Colorado gem store.  And that was it! I turned 60 and I actually thought something really monumental would happen even though I am always ready to poo-poo birthdays as just numbers.  I thought I would get the first payment on an African safari (which is something I have been dreaming of for years) or maybe a trip to a New York broadway play. I mean 6 decades should be worth something a little special!  On my husbands 60th we went to a salsa club and danced the night away with about a dozen friends and our kids and their dates.No luck.  Daughter was sick and the putanesca pasta dish that I asked for, in spite of the fact the I am the only one who likes anchovies, was inadvertantly mixed with the jar of vodka red sauce my daughter also bought at the Italian store as a second choice for the small group of guests for dinner.  My daughter was sick and passed the recipe on to my hubby who mixed the two sauces, either subconsciously and on purpose to overcome any teeny tiny flavor of anchovy which he hates, or accidentally, because he was trying to impress our company, mixed the two recipes...thereby totally negating the meal.At work I got absolutely no notice (although the two guys who turned 50 and 60 earlier in the year got cards, well wishes and small gifts.).  I mean I don't really care...REALLY.  It is just a little irritating as I think this is a BIG birthday.Oh well enough whining into my wine.  Happy Birthday to me!!P.S.  YES, Peruby, it was Lancer's.  Wouldn't you know it would have a name like that.  For those of you who find the number 60 important...go here for a nice walk down memory lane. http://moreoldfortyfives.com/TakeMeBackToTheSixties.htm"},
{"title": "If it is not one end, it is the other! Life Story #6", "date": "Monday, January 08, 2007", "text": "Years, alright, decades ago when I lived on a very small island in the South Pacific with water that ran or not and lights that lit or not and cars that started or not, I had a very bad case of the flu.  I swear to this day that it was Dengue fever but I am usually poo-pooed by medical intelligentsia when I say this.  I guess one should not live through Dengue?    Dengue fever makes you feel as if you have been run over by a large train and every joint aches.I had a two year-old daughter at the time and was confined to a small apartment with no real help...including my hubby whose life revolved around his job and who never took any of my illnesses very seriously anyway.I clearly remember being up part of one night helping my daughter through her share of the illness only to have her reach the top of this roller coaster ride to health and end up the next day as the energizer bunny.  Something that happens to small children with amazing  and unexplainable speed.  Their eyes become bright and they run everywhere and their chatter can hurt the ears when only hours before they were panting with weakness on your chest.I was lying on the sofa in real pain when my little two-year-old found the two-inch-thick tabloid-size fairy tale book she had received for Christmas.  She lifted the book (almost as big as her) with surprising ease and hurried across the room.  She lost her grip just as she reached the sofa and dropped the book like a slab of concrete across my abdomen.  I almost blacked out from the pain and barely heard her sweet voice asking me to read her a story.  Trying to care for a tiny someone when you are sick is a real challenge!Now to the present.  This weekend we babysat for Xman who had the flu.  He hadn't eaten much in days and had intestinal flu and all that that entails.  His dad also had a long night rendezvous with the porcelain throne the night before.  Mom, who is now pregnant, is sick from  the pregnancy and may be fighting a lighter version of the flu.  They were a trio of sad sacks.  Fortunately they have us and we took Xman for a long drive and a brief visit to the park so that they could recoup and re-focus. Family is so important and I sure could have used a grandparent when my husband and I were being adventurers in our youth.It seems to be a week of movie going for Tabor.  Months go by and we don't go near a theater and then we spend two weekends in a row taking in movies.  I saw The Good Shepherd this weekend.   It was a last minute decision and I was not expecting much. Although the story line has a few more twists and turns than expected, it is still a bit plodding and could certainly use some humor—even if it was black humor.The movie is a fictionalized account of the start-up of the CIA and is directed by Robert DeNiro who also plays a small role as a retired General.  Matt Damon plays the lead as one of the new spies selected from a carefully vetted group of young men from families of wealth.  These men selected seem to all belong to the 'formerly secret'  Yale \"Skull and Cross Bones\" fraternity.   Angelina Jolie who plays his long-suffering wife is totally miscast in the part.  Her personality doesn’t match her actions and her interest in Damon (who plays an unbelievably stiff conservative patriot) doesn’t make sense.  The movie is dark and slow.  The primary theme seems to be that you cannot trust anyone.  People will betray you either by design or accident.Some of the spy techniques such as the tedious way that photographs were analyzed before our new digital technology were interesting.There is one scene in the movie which left a very chilling impression on me.   Damon goes to visit Joe Pesci who plays a cameo scene as an Italian (Mafia man?) who is being asked to assist the CIA with the Bay of Pigs operation.  Pesci ,who clearly has no respect for the CIA guys and says the CIA creates the “big wars,” then asks Damon to tell him what he has.  Pesci says (and I paraphrase) “We Italians have got our family and our food, the Jews have got their tradition.  Even the Ni**ers have got their music.  But what have you guys got?”Damon replies expressionlessly, “We have the United States of America and we let you live here.”   Whew.  (Does this bring to mind anyone---maybe someone who retired from a Cabinet position a few years ago?)"},
{"title": "The View on the Other Side of the Castle Wall", "date": "Saturday, January 06, 2007", "text": "I renewed my prior free subscription to \"Food and Wine\" this year because I found the recipes and wine news interesting, even if a little luxurious and expensive.  I had received this subscription free last year when I bought my daughter a gift certificate to Williams Sonoma ---a very expensive 'kitchen' store.I am sitting on the sofa perusing the February 2007 issue and decided to share some of this with bloggers who might never pick up such a magazine.On the cover is a lovely photo of a red bowl of butternut squash soup with apple slices and smoked cheddar.  (Already I am hungry.)The ads show luxury gourmet kitchens, luxury vacations and products that only lottery winners could afford.  The editors page talks about how unexciting Februaries are following the holidays and discusses a feature story about how two famous chefs in Colorado arrange a meal in a \"gorgeous old barn...surrounded by huge snowdrifts...prepared a delicious grilled meal of capon with salsa verde, meatballs and butter coal-roasted potatoes.  Winter grilling...\"  Being the age I am and having grown up in Colorado, I am thinking how cold it must be to eat a meal in \"gorgeous old barn.\"  The beauty of a Colorado winter is in the warm sunshine...not the shade of a windy old barn.  I picture myself trying to cut through the capon with woolen gloves.The \"news and notes\" page does talk about products that are good for the environment...a floor cleaning solution ($25) and reclaimed hardwood from Seattle made into lovely tables ($1,200).  It appears to cost money to do good.  (To give them some credit they do talk about an Oregon nonprofit that sends bikes to Rwanda so that the coffee farmers can transport their coffee beans to market.)They also praise a velvety jam that is a dollar an ounce and only 100 jars are made each year.  Among the rich it is all about getting the rare.There is a really neat ad for a Breville blender that they claim transforms ice into snowflakes via a patented \"hemisphere bowl/blade system\".  The design eliminates all 'dead' zones and makes smoothies with no lumps.  It seems the rich never have to take their lumps.So why am I on this luxury rant?  I think it has something to do with the movie I saw last night--Blood Diamonds.  As a side comment, this movie is well done (just a little derivative) and it has made me a big fan of DiCaprio.  I saw him in the violent bloody Departed a few months ago and he is much like Meryl Streep in being able to fold gently in the subtle differences of each character.   There is a reasonable love story and a heart-wrenching father son theme and the great scenes of that beautiful continent that contrast with the blood that runs so freely. Blood Diamonds tells the well known story of how we rape Africa to support our luxurious life style in the rich nations of the world.  It makes you watch the news with impatience at the stupid stories and with cynicism at the others stories.  It makes you look at diamonds in a whole new glint.  But, for me, I now feel, once again, that my retirement hours must be spent more usefully as payment for all my good luck at being born in the right place at the right time."},

First memories are wisps of smells and sounds that tuck themselves into corners of rooms and are unexpectedly revealed by a ray of sunlight or the wind racing through the door before it is closed behind you. They pause over your head as you sit down for a cup of tea during the day. They hide in the smudge on the newly painted wall in the hall. Memories make the house sigh happily in the afternoon or creak loudly in the night as it makes room for more of the same.I think that I may feel I am coming 'home' the next time I come down this way for a short and busy weekend and not just to someone's new house."},

She actually spent one afteroon of her days with us on the bathroom floor. (This past week she scared a coworker when she was accidentally found under her desk at work because she felt so nauseous.

This is because we will be back in the city for New Year's to catch a few movies.7) One of the nicest things about the holidays is that I can have pumpkin pie with whip cream for breakfast and munch on holiday cookies as I do the laundry and feel no guilt.

My hands feel empty because they have nothing to do for him.  If I sit on the couch I miss his head against my chest and his hands in my hands as he drifts off to sleep.  Yep, I spent the entire weekend beginning Friday night with Xman and it was wrenching (for the both of us) to separate on Sunday afternoon.  I miss the smell of his hair, his quick smile, and those honest brown eyes that would study my face.  His pleasure was so pure when we were doing something he liked.  Even when he was grumpy, it was just a mild protest to let me know he still wanted to be the boss, yet, I eventually got my way.This power that my grandchild has over me is a little scary but oh, so addictive.  Even when totally exhausted after putting him to bed at the end of the day, I wanted that one last little smell and kiss before I would head down the stairs.

Hubby ran to get the binoculars --- that expensive Swarovski set that I bought him five years ago and which has panned out to be one of the best gifts I ever got him.He generously handed me the binoculars first to see the close up of our visitor. He was definitely a male in his prime. His colors were lustrous and his feathers full and rich in the cold afternoon. The eagle then gently lifted his wings and glided closer to another nearby snag. That is when I saw he had a fish in his talons. He landed on the branch and I could see the silvery menhaden flapping against the branch as it hung down caught only by one claw.The eagle ‘eagle-eyed’ his domain and then took a small bite from his sashimi meal. The menhaden continued to flap while the eagle continued to nibble. This predator prey drama was not for the weak of heart. The eagle would pause between bites and survey the river at his leisure. This lasted for just a few minutes more.Before long, a crow flew in to a branch just above and to the right of the eagle with intimidating body language and a noisy jabber indicating clear interest in the mid-day lunch. In a very short time a second crow joined him and landed just above the first. Both seemed to me to be too close to the eagle. Daring black bullies they were. Two more flew in and landed to the left of the eagle. One of these flew down looking for fragments of flesh on the forest floor.The eagle had now changed from the leisurely meal with a view on the water to the fast food manner dictated by the nearby company and he soon finished the fish. He proceeded to clean his bill and claws on the bark of the tree and the crows eventually lost interest and departed.The eagle sat on the branch for almost an hour longer letting us observe him and giving us an excuse to halt the Christmas decorating. Then he took off, swooping with breathtaking grace down the river making a dip at the far end…too far for us to see if he caught dessert."},

My son was the only one who was going to join us for TG Day. I could have called some friends, but was too lazy.  They were also thinking about calling us and didn't!  So there were going to be only three for the big meal.Location:We could have eaten down at the house using the new kitchen, but I had to work on Friday so that was a long drive back at the end of the big meal that I didn't want to make.  We could have eaten at my son's condo which has a larger TV to watch games on, but my son indicated he didn't really care about the football all that much---Translation:\" I don't want to have to clean the condo for you guys.\"  We could have eaten out somewhere, but we took so long to plan that that option disappeared fairly soon. Thus, we ate at the apartment.Decor:Hubby generously brought home a bouquet from the market to brighten up the table.  So not too much more decor needed for  just two guys.Menu:In years past I went all out with the meal.  I like to cook, hubby likes to cook and the kids even like to cook.  So some made pies and side dishes and I would work on the turkey, stuffing and sweet potatoes and a special salad. Ah, but this is a lot of food to prepare for just three people in a tiny kitchen. So this year we had 'take-out.' from Boston Market via the Giant supermarket. This box feeds 8 to 10 and costs $60.00.  That comes to about $6.00 per person, the food is good if not outstanding, and there are leftovers and plastic leftover containers for everyone.  All we had to do was reheat the meal in the oven and microwave.I would never have thought of a Thanksgiving like this years ago.  But I guess I am getting more mellow in my old age.  Release the control, let go of the remote, put down that camera, hand over that turkey baster and just mellow out."},

{"title": "LIfe Story #5", "date": "Thursday, November 16, 2006", "text": "A long time ago when I was living in a land of artists and spiritualists and peaceful people with violent rivers inside their souls (Indonesia) I took a batik course at the Palace grounds in Jogjakarta.  I was taught privately by an old man who was as small as a goat and as brown as  a coconut.  He was always patient and smiling  through his many missing teeth.  He also taught batik to a class of young Balinese men, who were the real artists and devoted their lives to the medium, in early afternoons.  I have had no formal artistic training ( unless you count the elementary teacher's art class I took in college many years ago), so his patience with me as I practiced in this very unusual medium was amazing.  Of course he probably saw me as this rich, idle, American who helped him put rice on his table.  I was too young to see myself in that way and I was also tutoring American children half days and desperately needed this artistic break.In my memories I can visualize driving down a street toward the Palace past the Chinese men who cut hair and trimmed toenails at their stands on the narrow sidewalk.My work would take place in a small room with bamboo walls and a dusty floor.  It was so dark inside that  I can remember looking through the spaces in the bamboo and seeing the lady who sold birds in cages on the sidewalk outside.  The smell of the pine resin that was added to the wax was pleasantly welcoming when I arrived each afternoon.  The dyes were strong and we washed the fabrics carefully in very hot water over a ditch outside behind the building.  I purchased all the chanting tools, bowls and kerosine stove and was fascinated with the shapes and rustic metals of each one.  I bought large blocks of wax and small blocks of pine resin and would melt them together for the correct mix.  The dyes would come as fine powders in small plastic bags and I could not really tell the exact color I would get until I dyed the fabric.At first all I did was try to copy the batik patterns I saw in the fabrics around me each day.  Then I decided to try something original.  The batik above was one of the very first pieces I did.  It took quite a while between the washing out of wax and the application of each new layer of wax for the new phase of dye.The subject appeared from nowhere into my head.  Since I am allergic to cats I am not really fond of them, and I don't really know where the idea of this brown cat came from. I made him guilty, so I guess my lack of love for cats shows.  I did a lot of needlework at one time and that was added.  I also fell in love with a maidenhair fern that was growing on the wall behind my house in Jogja.  All of these were added into my piece.This batik has sat for decades folded in a box.  My powderoom (with the famous sink) in the new house happens to go with these colors, so I spent a small fortune at Michaels getting it matted and framed.  I have an Egyptian parchment cat that I framed to go on the opposing wall.  No, the powderroom is not that big, and the batik just fits on wall, but that is the only room where it seems to fit in color.The young woman who matted and framed it at the store kept praising it and several other patrons in the store also said it was a very nice work.  I never thought about it much, but now I guess I can share it with you."},

(I have this inner feeling that tells me if you are 'working' on a tanka it is no longer a tanka.)  So I published it before I left for the house late on Thursday along with the picture of the tree that motivated my creativity.  Virtual electronic spirits, whose primary diet must be pixels and digital bits of light or whose primary entertainment must be squirreling away pixels and bits of light, absconded with my post.  I don't know if the post sits in their tummies (I wish them much indigestion) or if it lights the way down their hidden bandwidths.  Where do posts go when they disappear in the ethernet?  Do they end up on someone else's blog as a shockingly naked invasion?  Do they sit in a place somewhere that will someday explode in bites all over the Internet?  Do they evaporate into the atmosphere and are they a future carcinogen that we should be studying?  Did this one go into a collection of tankas that sit in a folder somewhere just waiting to be re-discovered?  Or perhaps, my tanka was so painfully bad that the Internet police decided that they just could not let it get by.All I know is that I don't feel I can re-capture the thought any time soon.Have a good weekend."},

He is such a drama king, though.I spent part of the weekend taking care of Xman who is not a happy camper since he cannot get around easily.  He is slowly getting the courage to stand, but has to be distracted by something.  Needless to say, he is getting tons of attention from everyone and has his own little party going on where he is the center.  He is a flirt and loves to pretend he doesn't care that we are totally interested in him.  We talked about how hard that will be for him, when in the future, he is treated like a normal child after the cast comes off and people tend to ignore him much of the time.I am continuing to have issues at work as are several of my other colleagues with the same problem.  I still haven't decided whether to just keep a low profile the next two years and do standard work, or try to venture out and be creative with projects and ideas even though there is a chance certain entities will fight me on anything they think will take the focus away from them.  It is really hard for me not to be working hard on something.  (My supervisor is being very understanding...whether she will do anything is another matter, of course.)I was down at the house on Sunday bringing some end tables and lamps from the apartment.  Hubby cleaned out the gutters which were full of leaves while I did three loads of laundry and went through several weeks of mail...mostly junk mail.The bush by the dock has turned to snow.Since we didn't get down there until almost noon the day flew by.  The sun was setting as I was trying to sort some groceries for the freezer when Hubby came running in and said I had to get out to the dock and see the sunset.  I was totally focused on a bunch of other stuff, but reluctantly relented.  I took some photos and did some breathing in and out.  I must have done something right to get this guy to marry me!

At work someone's supervisor (not mine) edited a report that I had veted through my supervisor (who is the overall supervisor) and proceeded to delete 40% of the content.  I never got any feedback on that and her staff person was told to publish it ( I wouldn't have known except her staff person had a sense of ethics and was very uncomfortable about it).  Guess what I will be doing early Monday when my supervisor returns to the office?  At least I will be calmer by then and allow my supervisor to breath between my venting.2.  Then I got an email from the \"colleague\" who had called me stupid (and later apologized) asking for some input on a project.  Since I didn't know anything about the project I asked for background, scope, meeting notes, etc.  Her reply was that \"I could leave you out of this input if you feel this way.\"  Fortunately my supervisor and her supervisor were included in that snotty remark.I remember that about two years ago I loved this job and was excited about coming to work and contributing.  Now all I want is to stay out of everyone's way while they claw their way to the 'top.'3.  I am venting and under more than usual stress because, on the day that my Dad was supposed to go home from Rehab (two days ago), he contracted pneumonia (a rare virus or bacteria version) and is now back in the hospital.  We are all checking on him daily and hope to finally have him home this weekend.  He has lost his spirit and is frequently confused about where he is and what is happening.  It is a common but still sad story.  Send good thoughts (or prayers if you pray.)4.  The final note (I thought bad things happened in threes?) was that Xman in going down the slide at the park with his father twisted his leg and fractured either his tibia or fibula and is now in a cast for the next three weeks.

{"title": "The Time Between Times", "date": "Friday, October 27, 2006", "text": "A number of years ago I had reached the time in my life that was after my children were on their own in junior high school but before I had become comfortable in my new role as 'lone adventurer'. Children had become a nice buffer for me on my life challenges. It didn't matter if I got lost or used the wrong product or dressed poorly or made a public mistake. I had two kids that were distracting me and who in turn could be used to distract the focus of others on me. I was an overworked mother who was allowed mistakes. My entire day revolved around their needs and the tight time schedule I had set for myself regarding family life.I look back on that transition to adulttime now and wonder when I had accepted with blase the habit of using the kids as my invisibility cape, but I do remember the first time it was very strange to enter a restaurant as just me and to sit alone at a table and to order adult food and to eat the food all alone. (One of these times was in Houston at a conference in a restaurant across the room from James Darren at another table.  Honest!)  It was strange to drive in a car and not be distracted by munchkin battles or flying cereal or upset stomachs. It was strange to have free afternoons (though short) to go anywhere I wanted and to do what I wanted. Being the good Puritan I always ran the necessary errands before dinner.Years ago I was in Raleigh, North Carolina with my husband who was attending a meeting. This left me with free days exploring on my own. I enjoyed walking the town and visiting the farmers market, but I eventually realized that I would have to take the rental car and do some country exploring to fill the final remaining day of the trip. Those of you who are born to explore cannot imagine why it would take courage to do this. But I was very uncomfortable with the thought of going out all by myself in a different car and reading a map all by myself to drive on different roads for several hours.There was a recreational lake and state park about an hour away and I decided that adventure would be my afternoon. I studied the map, scolded myself about how childish it was to fear this little adventure and used my instincts and made it to the resort without a hitch. Weather was still warm and so there were quite a few families on picnics or boating on the lake. It was a lovely blue sky day. I explored the lake and then found a long path that walked around the lake. It was a very long path and I knew that I could not make the entire circuit, but I could walk a short way before my time to return to the car for the drive back to town.I was twenty minutes into my walk when I saw grass movement just ahead and to the side of the gravel path and then I heard a gentle but somewhat familiar vibration/buzz. I could not stop myself, but had to get closer to see the source of the rattle. I just knew it was a small rattlesnake, but the closer I got and the nearer I peered into the grass the more insistent became the rattle. I never saw the snake as I would have had to reach out and part the grass and did not have the courage for that. But somehow, just then, I felt as if I had made some personal growth that day by testing my fear against my curiosity and feeling good about it.I no longer felt odd as a single person.Now I have a new time in my life. Twice in the last month I have had trouble finding my car in the parking lot at the shopping mall. I was sure about where I parked my car last weekend and walked back and forth down the parking row several times as darkness moved in before it dawned on me that the parking space I was searching was where I had parked on a prior night...not the current night! I then did some hard mindbending thought and remembered I had parked the car further up and around the store. This forgetfulness is not normal for me and I am afraid it is a small or maybe a large transition I must face as I get older. I know that this is a nice Saturday Night Live skit for many, but for me it was also a damn nuisance. But as with everything, I guess I will have to take it One Day at a Time."},

{"title": "Truffles, Wine and Goodbyes", "date": "Sunday, October 22, 2006", "text": "This special journey was coming to an end in just 24 hours.  We had seen old and new and were privileged to meet some very special people.  If you read the link in the prior blog to Ankhura you will note that both Chris and Christina, owners of the bed and breakfast, had very sophisticated backgrounds.  They had decorated the Inn with art from Asia and architecture from Tuscany.  They were gentle and intelligent people and made their guests feel totally at home,  even though we were much less sophisticated than they.  Chris had even done much of the tile and construction work.  They had purchased the building from the church and you could tell that in a few short years they were probably going to move onto another phase in their rich lives.Christina had given birth to both of her two boys in Tuscany and now a third child was soon on the way.  They planned to close the Inn in December and her family would come out from Malaysia to stay with herWhile showering that morning I noticed the rustic travertine tile which is common to the area and was too expensive for my housebuilding enterprise.Christina was up bright and early setting a lovely table of homemade yogurt, homemade granola, freshly sliced fruit, coffee, toast and juice on the patio outside.Chris was squeezing oranges and the smell filled the kitchen as we passed through.  Then he changed clothes and we headed out for the truffle hunt he had arranged.The gentleman who took us us on our truffle hunt brought two of his dogs.  He had a full time job working at the local Home Depot, but did truffle hunting on days during the high season which was just starting.  Truffle hunting is very competitive in Tuscany, especially for the white truffle which we were pursuing.  There were tales of dogs being poisoned because of their exceptional skill in sniffing out the round treasure which could be a deep as a foot underground or just below the surface.We stopped at a road near a Truffle Preserve but carefully skirted the area since tourists were not allowed inside.  The dogs found several small and average truffles and then one excellent truffle the size of golf ball.  Truffles can get to be twice the size of a potato.  But size is not always an indication of quality.  Our guide had brought some photos of the annual truffle fair with some pictures of very large truffles he had found.When the dogs find a truffle they are commanded to sit and then they are rewarded with a piece of bread.  The pigs used to just eat the truffles if the master didn't get there fast enough.I didn't capture a photo of the larger truffle, but here my daughter is holding one of the smallest.  The smell is strong and I could smell it from the other side of the camera lens.After several hours of hiking along the sandy ravines we were rewarded with a picnic of chicken sandwiches, tomato and cheese sandwiches, prosciutto, capacolla, fresh sliced tomatoes, and red and white wine as we looked across a hillside with a rabbit hunter in the distance.We could have napped during the few hours we had in the early afternoon before our wine tour when we got back to  Montengriffoli, but we had a chance to see the village in daylight as well as the nearby cemetery and so we went walking.Our wine tour was to a small 2.5 acre winery run by a widow who was about my age.  She generously took us through the small and very clean winery and we tasted her Brunello from the vat, then the oak cask and finally got to taste both a young and an old bottle.  Quite a privilege since Brunello's are pretty expensive in the U.S.   Her bottles are all purchased by a distributer in Canada, so we couldn't buy any.The tour was given by Guelfo Magrini who has written a knowledgeable book about the Brunellos of Montalcino.  He is on the far right in the photo below.  The other man was a journalist who joined us and who has studied wines in France, Germany and Italy and has written five books on wine.  My daughter thought he was a little full of himself, but we certainly learned a lot about wine between the two men!  I bought Magrini's book and am enjoying it thoroughly.We finished in the late afternoon with coffee in the town of Montalcino at a modern little coffee house.  The weather had turned cold and wet, so hot coffee and tea were a great idea.We got a quick view in the town of the famous wall of plaques on a building off of a main street in the town.  One of these ceramic plaques goes up each year as demonstration/comment reflecting the popular opinion of the value of the wine each harvest season.  It is a sort of tongue in check response to reflect that even the wine experts have a sense of humor in all seriousness.Then it was time to return to Ankhura for a dinner by Chris who is a Rome trained gourmet chef.   We ate upstairs in a small dining room with lots of candles and near a little fireplace.  The other dining partners were a young couple from Germany that had gone on the truffle hunt with us.  We were served an eggplant/mozzarella tart floating on a basil-tomato sauce, followed by a pasta with lots of thinly sliced truffles (a donation from our truffle hunter and probably the most expensive thing I have ever eaten--so pungent and special) and then we had a veal steak on a bed of 'lamb's lettuce'  which while a little tough, was also very delicious.  All of this was washed down with a rather expensive bottle of Brunello which REALLY blossomed with each glass as it was exposed to the air.  Dessert was a tart of thinly sliced fresh mountain apples on a buttery crust.As the evening progressed we headed up to bed and savored the days memories knowing we had a plane to catch in Rome and had to head out by car by 7:00AM.I have enjoyed writing about this trip as it has been like taking it all over again--getting to savor it twice.  Although I left out lots of stuff, still I am glad that I have this journal to motivate me to do this."},

This was my last night in Tuscany and I came to the full realization then that I had ARRIVED.But enough of that.  With a romance and a temporary but passionate affair such as this, one should always start at the beginning.Tuscany is a region somewhat known in America due to a number of romantic movies and books such as \"Under the Tuscan Sun\" and  \"Room With a View.\"   Sometimes when things are loved to death through literature or media they cannot possibly live up to their reputation and the resulting expectations. Fortunately for us all, this is not the case with Tuscany.  It is all the smells, sights and feelings that you read about and see and it is more.We left Sicily and arrived at the Rome airport.  There we rented a car with a GPS and headed out to the mountainous region of Abruzzo.  We spent one night in a small abandoned village with a B&B.  That is another VERY LONG blog about getting lost as the sun sets,  finding long lost relatives, showering with small scorpians, and enjoying a frugal meal of bread, hard cheese, proscuitto, and olives with small boxes of red wine as the haunting wind whistled outside the door and across the stone streets of an Italian ghost town.   As if this wasn't exotic enough, after our make-shift supper, we watched an iffy TV cable reception beaming in from Northern Africa of the 2000 movie  \"The Gladiator\" with French-African subtitles!So, I will skip to warmer and more romantic Tuscany.We left Abuzzo and drove north to the Tuscan region along the Autostrada which is just like the freeways we have in the U.S.  It was not too crowded and there were only one or two 'crazy Italian\" drivers and only one or two drivers who insisted that they needed to straddle both lanes in order to drive effectively.   The rest of us knew what we were doing and where we were going...well sort of.  We were fine except for when the GPS episodically disconnected at the most inopportune times.We stopped briefly in the medieval walled town of Orvieto for a very nice lunch at a touristy place called The Grotto---now I know where that expensive restaurant in New York got it ideas.  Not the expense...but the decor.This is the outside of the restaurant and when you enter you head immediately down a flight of stairs to the grotto.  There is a window to an outside fortressed wall at the end of the restaurant that lets in a little light.We ordered a bottle of Vernaccia di S. Gimignano---a very nice white table wine.  I ordered a ravioli stuffed with wild boar and floating in a buttery sauce, probably too robust for the wine, but like my feelings for art I am confident enough to appreciate things in my unique way.  Besides my table mates were getting tired of the robust reds.  They each ordered a pasta dish as well, one with a sweet sausage and one with ham.  This was preceeded by a nice antipasta plate of cheeses and meats and olives.We then took a walk to the walls of the city to look out over the country below as the afternoon was starting to wane.  (Remember, you eat the midday meal in Italy starting at 3:00, so by the time we had wined and dined it was getting late.)The city was arty and had lovely things to buy.  Very much geared for the spending tourist.And of course, the city had its important church in the center off of a large piazza at the highest point of the town.  This one was most impressive, I must say.  More lovely on the outside.And the tourists were watching the locals who were watching the tourists!We ended the day with a walking dessert at a world famous gelato place.  They had a poster up that showed Alexander Solzenitzen eating gelato there, so we just HAD to try it.Then trying to avoid putting our arrival too close to dark we reached the Agritourismo farm Locanda Rosati an hour before our scheduled 8:00PM family style dinner.  We had brought playing cards and proceeded to sit at a game table in one of the farm-like sitting rooms playing games and sipping the wine brought by our host, Paulo.  The dinner meal began in a large rustic dining room with introductions of all the guests and a vociferous welcome from Paulo.   Many bottles of red and white wines were brought to the table for us to help ourselves. Then we started with a pate of boar, chicken liver, lime juice, olives, etc.  to be spread on some salted puffed breads that were very much like sopapillas only salty.  This was followed by an excellent mushroom rissotto, which was then followed by a meatloaf of wild boar, some wild bird and pistachios with a side dish of roasted potatoes.  More wine and then a buttery fruit tart.  Finally bottles of grappa, limonchello, and mezzaluna arrived and people freely sampled everything.  I am not big on sweet liquors, but had fun watching my two mates get a little plastered and silly.  After all, our room was only a short walk up a few steps.Early the next morning we explored the grounds and found a lovely orchard of chestnuts and met our host's sister-in-law filling plastic bags with those that had fallen.We checked out of the Inn after a breakfast of coffee that was to die for and an assortment of fruit, pastries and breads.  We obtained directions to our next stop from their Internet, and thus plotted the day.  We had been told that Italy's shopping outlets were on the way so we decided to stop at one called \"THE MALL\" just to see what an outlet in Italy was all about.  There were stores from Fendi, Yves St. Laurent, Valentino, Gucci,  Georgio Armani and a bunch of other old guys I had not heard about.  These were the kind of stores that, in the states, you would wait for someone to unlock the door for you to enter.  Here there was a steady stream of customers going in and out, many rich Asians with lots of bags over their shoulders.  Items inside were 50 to 70% off!  But since most items started at over $1,000 including simple silk blouses, I had to pass on any souvenirs from this place.  (I played mind games in my head on what the ironing board thin 'customers assistants' in their designer clothes were thinking as I entered with my Macy's purse and sporting goods store walking shoes...and controlled myself so that I didn't laugh out loud.)Then, as we settled back in the car, we read the directions from Chris and Christina to their Inn called Ankhura.  They went something like this:  Follow the exit to (Tuscan town) and then as you enter the roundabout take the exit to (another Tuscan town) and follow this road up the hill past the exit to (another Tuscan town) and take the roundabout and pass the exit to (another smaller Tuscan town) and head out and past the exit to (a very small Tuscan town) and then go on a gravel road and past (a named road) and head up the hill and pass the road to the cemetary and then you will reach Monterongrifolli.Park your car at the sign that says \"no parking beyond this point\" and then go around the church and we are in the back up the street.(At first we thought that the symbol below was the no parking part!  I took the photo the next day when we discovered it in the daylight.)We arrived in the dark after 8:00 after much reading of signs and maps and second guessing and even going down a few blind streets in little unknown towns.But the place was tremendously lovely and the hostess was graciousness personified.  So, now it was time for my well-earned sleep on her lovely Malay linens and you too must rest for tomorrow we head out on a truffle hunt AND a wine tour."},
{"title": "A Sicily post script", "date": "Monday, October 16, 2006", "text": "The Sicily sun is intense, and even in the fall, so warm that we frequently sought the shade of a building or tree.   The beach itself was very peaceful and sandy.We stayed at Hotel Spendid  in the little beach town of Mondello.  Each night there was a little market along the beach walk where tables were filled with crafts from Northern Africa and rural parts of Italy.  One stand was roasting chestnuts which were in season.  It seemed to me that most of the tourists were Italians.The best seafood in Sicily was the shrimp and squid which were fried.  I had the stuffed squid which was tough and not all that appetizing looking.  We also tried the mussels which were fat and fresh.I tried hard to find fresh fish, but was unsuccessful.If I get back to Sicily again I will rent a car and just slowly make my way around the island stopping at the various villages---each has something unique to offer."},
{"title": "The Island of Sicily", "date": "Monday, October 16, 2006", "text": "Commenters have asked for food pictures--and I don't think I took to many. I was always diving in and eating rather than focusing!  And for my dear blogger, Colleen, that was my daughter and her M.I.L. behind the Venetian masks in the store photo.Sicily is a fairly large island to the south of the peninsula of Italy and maybe most famous for the volcanic Mt. Etna.  Most of what you read about Sicily will mention that it is a poorer and less pristine part of Italy. I think the Sicilians are a generous and polite people and several went out of their way to caution us about pickpockets and thieves.  We did not encounter a single bad incident.  My lovely daughter did get the 100-times-over from a man twice her age on the bus into town one morning.  They are NOT shy about looking!  There are also cautions about the criminal element, since the Mafia began here. (As an historic note, the big M began because Sicily felt it was being taxed unfairly by the main government in Italy but not getting the resources and support. They didn't like the main government setting up all the rules and regulations, so they decided to run their own little government.)My daughter selected 2.5 days in Sicily because her M.I.L.'s mother's side of the family came from that region---was that clear?  Anyway, because we did not have a car and had to rely on buses and trains, we touched only a small part of the island.  I missed some great cultural and archeological parts as daughter and her M.I.L. were into the churches!We stayed at a 1950's type hotel on the far point of one of the lovely beach areas. It was a little bit of a walk to the beach, but we did manage to soak our toes at the end of the days.  The hotel is way at the end on the point in the photo above.  It looks far from the beach, but I was taking the photo from the first drop off of the bus at the days end.Each day we took the bus into Palermo which was the primary city nearby.    It was a quick 15 minute ride.  Then we had to walk a few blocks to catch the bus/train that we needed for the next leg of the day's journey.The first day we went to a lovely village on the coast called Monreal.  We were very lucky in that we got there early in the day.  While we were eating a lunch of pizza across from the piazza in the photo below,  I saw the police beginning to set up street barriers and various officials in fancy dress arriving.   By the end of our lunch we discovered that this day was a funeral for their Archbishop who had passed away a few days before.   The death of an Archbishop is a big deal in any country, but especially so in Italy.  Dignitaries paraded in with banners and flowers and full regalia for several hours that afternoon and we just sat and sipped our wine and watched from our front row seat.  We eventually moved to the church and got inside for a quick look before it had filled and the service started.  They even broadcast it on a large TV screen outside.  Below, the villagers that lived across the piazza watched the parade from their balconies.Then we took off for a walk around the village since everything had started to close.  Going up and down hills like these is what keeps Italians so thin after eating plates of pasta and pizza.We encountered small children in the alleys and byways playing and taking advantage of their time off during the funeral.  These two lovely ladies below were playing with Barbie dolls, of course!And here is a sign outside the local day care center...?The trip back on the bus was an interesting but it is a longer story...which I will save for another day, if reminded.Our second day in Sicily required a train trip.  Trains in Italy are so easy to use and so comfortable and really on time.  We took the train to an even smaller village called Cefalu--to look at the church in the picture below.We hiked outside the city walls and saw are a close-up view of the lovely Mediterranean Sea.On our last night in Sicily we had eaten so much food that day that we decided on a dinner of cheeses and wine ( a nice Sicilian white) at an outside Enoteka.  This was followed by a gelato (or cannoli in my case) in the piazza of the small beach town where we stayed.  It was a good decision since we were given the fun of seeing the town wind down as the locals stopped in the piazza and viewed a local classic car show. The drivers were dapper as they had dressed for the occasion and clearly were enjoying the attention!My next post will be the last  of Italy but all about romantic Tuscany."},
{"title": "Rome Part II", "date": "Friday, October 13, 2006", "text": "We had allowed time to spend a second day in Rome.  This turned out to be a good idea since we had only seen the outside in a sweaty blur as we taxied and then ran by.  The Sistine Chapel was closed because it was a Sunday, so the M.I.L. had to forgo that tour for another time.  Hubby and I had seen it years ago and it was beautiful and we felt  worth the time if you could get your mind around the hundreds of tourists at your shoulders, the guards calling out telling people to keep moving, to stop talking, and the people ignoring the guards and talking, etc., etc.   If I had to see it again I would pick a cold day in winter.   Also we were wise to bring binoculars as the ceiling is far above you.This trip we toured the Roman Forum below:and the areas around that which are a necessary part of a Rome visit.  We started with Circus Maximus which was near the hotel...a large area for horse racing and mock battles.  Now just a large open area in the city and a long walk to other places.We had lunch at an area near the Coliseum where back in history they did some outside training of the Gladiators or animals or whatever. While historically there were all kinds of events at the Coliseum including flooding the place and holding mock naval battles, the Coliseum always resides in my mind as such a blood-thirsty place that I have very mixed feelings when going there.  It is also very touristy--notice all the heads below in the photo.   Mock Roman soldiers with large hairy legs beneath their plated skirts willing and  ready to get a picture taken with you for a fee--I did not take a photo!We did set aside time to see the Baths of Caracalla which I had not seen during my prior visit and this visit was most impressive. Some of the wall and floor mosaics were still visible.  This engineering marvel built in 212 AD used between 15-20,000 cubic meters of water (both hot and cold) per day and held as many as 1,600 daily visitors.  Due to the tight living quarters among the Romans it was a central part of the Roman social life.The photos above don't really do it justice and I didn't want to load ALL that I took.Next week on to the sunny island of Sicily."},
{"title": "First Day Rome Arrival", "date": "Wednesday, October 11, 2006", "text": "Flying into Rome from America usually results in leaving late in the afternoon, flying overnight, and with the back crossing of time zones, arrival is the next morning.  The airport is about 16 miles outside of the city and taking a taxi into the city costs about $50.00 depending on the going rate of exchange.  NOT in our favor these days.  You can also take a train into the city which is cheaper, takes a little longer, and requires a little more vigilance for pickpocketers as well as schlepping your bags.Going through customs was a brief courtesy since Italy has thousands of tourists each day from the U.S. We had booked Splendid Hotel La Torre in Rome, but  on arrival, we were transferred a few blocks away toHotel Villa San Pio.  The location was a lovely, quiet suburban area.  The three of us shared a room with an additional bed.Below was the view from our bedroom window.Since we could not actually check in, we dropped all our bags at the hotel and then requested a cab to the Vatican.  Because we were booked for the Scavi tour at 10:45 A.M. and had arrived at the airport at 8:30 A.M. we were under a very tight schedule.  We hadn't showered but were able to change clothes a little in the bathroom at the hotel lobby .  In our pathetic Italian and rudimentary English we explained to the taxi driver that we had reservations for the tour of the excavations under St. Peter's Basilica.  Only 120 people a day get to tour and we didn't want to miss this opportunity.  He indicated that he knew where we should go.  As we drove around the Vatican on a Saturday morning, we saw the line of people for the tour of the Sistine chapel...blocks and blocks long.  He dropped us at the front of this line.  We now had a little less than 20 minutes and were feeling pretty good about the time we had made.  We, of course, were told by the guards at the drop off that the excavations' office was clear on the other side of the Vatican and our taxi driver was already gone.  We held out purses and camera tightly to our bodies and actually jogged all the way to the other side of Vatican City past the line of tourists.  I am sure they thought we were crazy...I have never seen anyone jog across St. Peter's Square, that was a first.We arrived at the office out of breath, and a little sweaty, but on time.  Our luck was holding as there were only three others on our tour and the women who gave the tour was magnificent.  She knew her subject well and gave us lots of time for questions at each stop.  It was not a religious tour, but an historic tour and most rewarding. It ended at the hall of the Popes where we were gently and firmly pushed aside by a Cardinal and his minions on a tour reminding us abruptly of our place in this structured Catholic society.The Swiss guards at the Vatican are very patient in answering the tourists questions every day.   They are also cute.Here is a quick shot inside St. Peter's.We then walked to the Pantheon which is a must-see for any first time visitor as was my daughter's M.I.L. As you can see they were way ahead of me!During the walk we stopped to visit the shops and be silly since we now had been up for over 24 hours.The Pantheon is most impressive with a span of over 142 feet.  It was originally a Roman temple and survived by being consecreated as a Catholic church.  The architect is unknown.  I had taken many pictures on a prior trip, so was able to just enjoy the building this time.Within a few blocks was a small and lovely church that we had passed before and decided to visit.That evening was M.I.L.'s birthday and so we took a taxi to the top of Janiculum Hill for a meal at Antico Arco.  This place is expensive and has recently been re-designed with a modern minimalist interior.  The wait staff anticipate your every need before you know you have one and it is just the place for a memory.  Don't eat here if you want lots of food at a reasonable price...memories are more expensive.  I ordered a raw seafood salad, a wild mushroom pasta dish, a lemon veal, etc...I can't remember what everyone else ordered but we shared and tasted since they provided tasting plates of what others had ordered and it was delish."},

By the time we drove to the Rome airport, checked our bags and got through two security checks, caught our plane to Boston where we went through customs and caught the second flight to Philadelphia and then drove home we had been up and moving for almost 24 hours!  My daughters M.I.L. had been on 6 planes by the end of the the 10 day trip and handled all like a trooper.  She now is thinking she may want to do more travel!Still shaking the Tuscany dust off my shoes and trying to adjust to another continent, I have many lovely memories.  My daughter had planned all of the this trip and it was one of the most rewarding I have ever taken.  So I will take the blogger through step by step so that I have a good journal of the experience for myself and can share with readers as well.Hundreds of pictures were taken and, of course, I cannot post them all, but will share some of the best."},

I  can probably do more to help all of them once Dad is moved back into my brother's house.Today they moved him out of the hospital and into the therapy care house where they expect him to stay for the next three weeks.  He seems reasonably strong if somewhat confused.  The pain is finally subsiding for a while.  From my brother's description everyone was in extreme pain just watching him struggle from the chair to the bed.  We have never seen my father in pain.  He has always been a go with the flow kind of guy, so this is very upsetting for all of us.  And, although he is 92, he has never been in a hospital except to stay with my mother who there many times.  Really!Old age is not for the weak of heart or mind.With regard to the Italy trip, I will post some pictures or at least talk about the trip when I return.  My daughter has planned this trip for her mother-in-law's 63rd birthday and asked me to be the partner in the crime.  Her M.I.L. has never traveled much anywhere in her life and is afraid to fly on planes.  We will ply her with liquor and laughter.  Three silly woman.  I hope that we do well.  We are going on a truffle hunt and wine tour.  That should be something to blog about.I will miss my blogging buddies and wish I could take all of you.  You would all add something unique and special to the trip.  But instead, I will try to take you virtually."},
{"title": "The Boynton Beach Bereavement Club (2005)", "date": "Tuesday, September 26, 2006", "text": "We had to leave the apartment for a dinner out and a movie last night since the managment told us the carpet cleaners were 'on the way\" and had been delayed by a clean-up of a broken pipe. (They weren't and didn't!  That is another story.)Anyway we saw a movie that I had been hoping to catch sometime this month.  Reviews, backgrounder and info can be found at Ronni's Guest Blogger entry at Times Goes By .  Guest blogger did an extensive review of the movie, Boynton Beach Bereavement Club, which is about elders in a retirement community in Florida.Anyway, the movie was very interesting in many ways but not all that compelling. The actors were all top flight folks and the dialogue was not all that bad although some of the jokes were predictable.  The whole theme was about loneliness and love and in some cases sex among the elderly.  It was pretty lite fare considering the lives of people in a retirement community are not that shallow.  You won't see much of the younger family members either.It is refreshing to see natural wrinkles and sags and real people on the big screen and maybe this will be the beginning of more movies like that.I did find it painful to watch the actors who had filled their lips with collagen and tightened their faces so that they looked like perpetually smiling mannikins.  The actors who had not were much more interesting to watch.As an aside, I read an article recently which stated that Jane Fonda and Sally Fields had made a pact to not have plastic surgery.Well, enough of this stupid blogging."},
{"title": "Bad Kharma", "date": "Monday, September 25, 2006", "text": "I am exhausted and really cannot continue anymore at this pace and with the type of news I am getting on the weekends.  I actually think work will be easier than weekends!Friday evening.  Getting the spring and summer clothes out of the tiny apartment closet and exchanging them with the fall/winter clothes down at the house.  (EVERYTHING going both directions appears to need spot cleaning or washing or mending or just throwing away--but no time now.) Rushing to move all the furniture and loose and breakable stuff as the apartment management has promised a free carpet cleaning on Monday.  I will not miss all the spots of my history this past year, but cannot do any cooking.Saturday:Loaded the car with STUFF.  Stopped at Radio Shack and bought a battery charger for the phone that will work in Europe to prepare for my Friday departure to Italy.  Visited my phone vendor and got them to set up international calling on the cell—setup is free but the calls are 99 cents a minute.Called my sister to let her know I have the international service so we can arrange a meet up in Rome via cell after her week in France.  Unloaded the car at the house and then tried to salvage the lawn with my husbands suggested tool of a pick axe, wheelbarrows full of top soil and handfuls of grass seed followed by armloads of straw.  Setting many timers and many sprinkler moves was how I spent a long, dusty, and muddy Saturday afternoon outside.In between times I swept away a hundred spider webs across each window and over each door.  Hubby even shook out a spider from my tennis shoe which I had kicked off near the front door just 30 minutes before.  The web across the mouth of the shoe caught his eye in the late afternoon sunlight and gave him the clue.Sunday:Sunday morning was spent hanging the bathroom mirrors…all four…which are VERY heavy.  Husband and I had reached the point of yelling at each other because we could not seem to be able to successfully measure and complete the hanging in one try--both of us have graduate degrees mind you.  We did achieve success with the the last mirror and that probably saved the marriage.  Did laundry while waiting for a furniture delivery which never happened because the furniture truck broke down.  Wrote the final punch list for the builder as I walked through all the rooms with pen in hand.  Boiled and cleaned crabs for the freezer (husband's project).Sunday Evening:Driving home, and in the dark, unloaded the pile of winter clothes and boots and leftover food from the refrigerator.  Vacuumed the apartment in preparation for the carpet cleaners, put clean sheets on the naked bed and then ate leftovers before falling into same dressed bed.While Drifting to sleep in the eve and the phone rang.  It was my daughter who told me that S.I.L. and baby brother in Colorado had been trying to reach me all weekend and left messages on my cell --- none of which I got.  The quick jist:  Dad fell on Saturday afternoon two steps into the sunken living room which resulted in breaking the ball joint in his hip.  He was found shortly after the fall sitting up on the bottom step and continuing to eat the cookies which had been the motivation for the errand up the steps inthe first place.  He claimed he had no pain but a trip to the hospital by ambulance was necessary.Saturday night at the hospital they decided at first that there was no reason to do hip replacement on a 92-year-old.  Then the nurse tells the doctors to look at the patient and evaluate him --- thank goodness someone thinks in that hospital.  They decided he is in excellent health with more years ahead of him and proceeded to set up surgery on Sunday morning for a hip replacement. My daughter tells me that she was told surgery went very well and he does not appear to be in pain and they are going to get him up and walking on Monday morning.  (It was after 11:00 at night by then, and of course, I had trouble falling asleep.)Monday morning:Here I sit in the office waiting for the Colorado morning time to call and see what is happening.  Finished the call and all is as well as can be expected.  They are not letting my sister know as she is in the middle of a week of gourmet classes in France and all of us feel she should enjoy her expensive vacation.  (Wondering now if she will meet up with us in Italy or head on back.)Called Dad this P.M. and between my bad cell connection, the hospitals 'iffy' phone, Dad's slurred speech due to drugs and his bad hearing, it was a most frustrating although sometimes funny phone call.  He is in pain and discouraged.  I gave second brother a pep talk about what lies ahead (had the same process with my M.I.L. when she came to visit years ago).  I will call again Wednesday before I decide if I am going to cancel the Italy trip and lose all the money.Oh, it is now 4:51 and no one has shown up to clean the carpets yet! Maybe this  equinox thing is bad kharma."},

I never was able to wear a size zero in my earliest of days anyway.  My daughter wore that size when she was 18 and now that she is over 30 and has one child she is up to a size 4-6.  She runs around like a chicken with her head cut off, so I know she gets plenty of exercise.  Lifting Xman 20 times a days should count for something.  And all that bending and clearing of floor areas is better than touching toes.  Ands she has the cutest little figure in spite of her size increase.I still want better proportion for myself and need to get rid of that pudgy middle which contrasts so well with my thin arms and legs.  Some days I think I look like a woman who is malnurished rather than overfed. I have learned that 100 sit-ups a day for weeks will not work.  It does give you excellent back and abdominal strength for standing tall and removing lower back pain, though.More aeorobics and less food.  This is my mantra before I leave for my trip with my daughter to Italy at the end of the month.  (Geese, have you SEEN how stylish those Italian women in Italy look while walking down the street...including those in their 60's and 70's?  No wonder they set the standard for style and weight.)"},
{"title": "Last Week's Errand", "date": "Friday, September 15, 2006", "text": "Hubby is planning a business trip and has discovered that both of his razors have been left at the new house.  So, just before ten on a Saturday night we make a trip to the nearby drugstore to pick up another razor before his flight tomorrow.  I caution him that this may be a more expensive errand than he anticipated as I have run out of a number of age-stalling tools.While looking for that great expensive face cream, I hear hubby swearing under his breath in the shaving aisle.  \"They don't even have my razor here.  They have three--four--five razor gizmos that cost a fortune.  What happened to the good old fashioned shave?\"  My husband hates planned obsolescence---especially that which relates to unnecessarily looking good.I hand him my expensive cream and a jar of clear nail polish and smile sympathetically and tell him I will meet in front at checkout.  I then walk to the front of the store hoping he won't take too long to pick something...anything.  While standing near the front door a very thin elegant looking black woman walks in mumbling under her breath. She is dressed in black slacks, a gray sweater top with a white lace collar, pearls, silver hoop earrings and some new stylish gray baseball cap.  I don't scrutinize her except to notice that she is carefully put together and about 55 in age.She glances up at me and smiles.  \"Did you hear me?  I am sorry. I didn't mean to be so loud.\"I indicate with a nod that this not a problem and proceed to look at the newspaper headlines near the exit door.She turns again to me and says, \"It is just that I put something in the trunk of my car and slammed the lid shut with my keys and purse inside.  AND my cell phone.\"I suggest she may use to store to call her car club for help.She sighs.  \"It is a BMW and can only be opened by a laser key and my BMW service says that they are backed up for three hours.  I have an extra set of keys at Silver Oaks where I live.  I just need to figure out how to get there.\"I suggest she contact a police officer.  I am beginning to get more uncomfortable with this whole conversation.She grasps my hand with her thin bony one which is so very cold and smiles and introduces herself.  She is a lawyer downtown and she rattles off some firm's name.  \"You can call this number and see that I am not lying.\"  She hands me a card.  Then she goes on to explain the laws of liability which police officers are under that precludes their helping her.OK , now I have caught on and am really uncomfortable. I study her thin face and realize she was probably quite beautiful in her day.\"If you could just loan me cab fare, about $30.00 I will pay you double that when I come back to open the car outside.\"My husband (who is incredibly naive) shows up and I cut the conversation off before he gets me in deeper than I want.\"All I have is $5.00 but maybe you can get more from someone else.\"  I cram the money into her hand and grab hubby's elbow as I direct him out the door.Outside I say aloud.  \"God, I hope I didn't contribute to her cocaine habit.\"Hubby pats me on the shoulder and answers matter-of-factly...\"You probably did.\"  A number of years ago I had reached the time in my life where my children were on their own in junior high school but it was also a time before I had become comfortable in my new role as 'loner'.  Children had become a nice buffer for me on my adventures.  It didn't matter if I got lost or used the wrong product or dressed poorly or made a public mistake.  I had two kids that were distracting me and who, in turn, could be used to distract the focus of others on me.I look back on that transition now and wonder when I got into the habit of using the kids as my invisibility cape.  I do remember during the transition when it seemed very strange to enter a restaurant without kids and to sit alone at a table and order and eat food.  It was strange to drive in a car and not be distracted by flying cheerios, upset stomachs and arguments about space. It was strange to have free, even though short, afternoons to go anywhere I wanted and do what I wanted at my own pace.Years ago I was in Raleigh, North Carolina with my husband who was attending a meeting.  This left me with free days exploring on my own.  I enjoyed walking the town and visiting the farmers' market, but I eventually realized that I would have to take the rental car and do some country exploring to fill the remaining last day.  Those of you who are born to explore cannot imagine why it would take courage to do this, but I was very uncomfortable with the thought of going out all by myself in a different car and reading a map all by myself and driving on strange roads.  It was a new and different phase in my life.There was a recreational lake and state park about an hour away and I decided that adventure would be my afternoon trip.  I studied the map, used my instincts and made it to the resort without a hitch and with great relief.  Weather was still warm and so there were quite a few families on picnics or boating the lake.  It was a lovely blue sky day.  I explored the lake and then found a path that meandered around the lake.  It was a very long path and I knew that I could not make the entire circuit, but I could walk a short part of the way before I had to head back to the city.I was twenty minutes into my walk when I saw grass movement and then heard a gentle but somewhat familiar noise to the side of the gravel path just ahead.  I could not stop myself, but had to get closer to see the source of the noise.  I just knew that is was a small rattle snake, but the closer I got the more intense and scary the rattle became.  I got as close as I dared.  I never had the courage to part the high grasses to see what was below. Yet, I felt very satisfied that I had tested my mettle thus far on so many goals that day and drove back to the hotel with a smile on my face.Now I am at another time in my life that makes me uncomfortable once again.  Twice this past month I have forgotten where I have parked my car when I went to the mall.  The first time it took a short while and passing a number of rows before I stumbled on the  little beast.  The second time I wandered back and forth down the row of cars as darkness started to surround me for quite a while, trying hard to see my little car.  Eventually I remembered that this was the row where I had parked the car a few days before on my visit to the same mall and with a little mind bending I finally remembered that I had most recently parked up the hill and on the other side of the store.  This could be a small transition or a large transition that awaits me in the coming years and it has given me a twinge of concern.I guess I will have to take it One Day at a Time as I always do."},

(Either that or he has a death wish.)  While Xman was being fed from a jar of pureed peas of the most emerald green color, he got it into his head to reach for the place mat on which the peas rested.  While his mommy was retrieving a fallen napkin, deft little fingers grasped the fringe of the mat and with a very professional twist of the wrist pulled the cloth mat determinedly up toward the air.  The place mat flew in his grasp across the room and the spoon, the jar of peas, and another container of applesauce (as yet unopened) all took flight until gravity reminded the solids of their place within the laws of physics.Everything went crashing to the floor, and like a good scientist, Xman carefully observed the results, including the swift actions of various adults rushing about with paper towels and sponges to protect all the surfaces of the new house.  It seemed that some peas landed on the table, others on the floor and even dollops decorated Xman's clothes.It wasn't until Xman's dinner came to an end that Tabor happened to look upward and saw that quite a few green circles of food had risen to the ceiling above.

Most of these Thursday Thoughts are about spending or losing money.1a) My sister saved my image this last trip when my hubby saw her new wine cellar with over 600 bottles of wine.  My wine cellar is a small cooler which holds just over 32 bottles.  He now no longer thinks I am an extravagant connoisseur.1b) On a similar note my sis and my B-I-L took us out to dinner and bought two bottles of wine at $35 each to go with our meal.  It was great wine…and I am glad he picked up the bill.  Those of you who regularly spend that much for wine…just shut up!2)  I am now into shopping for heavy duty and easy to clean bedspreads for my guest bedrooms.  This is an important selection due to the following event:  I purchased a nice and somewhat expensive red silk throw at Target and unpacked it to drape across the bottom of the master bed in the new house.  Within seconds Xman had run to the material and bit into it and then left wet drool everywhere.  (Note:  he no longer 'walks' anywhere.)  Patience…patience.3)  The recent Atlantic storm downed two trees at the new house, left lots of limbs and leaves across the deck, but spared the boat on the lift.  My husband lost a year of his life on the plane trip home until we saw the boat was safe.4)  I just purchased a $10.00 glasses case for my 15-year-old Christian Dior prescription sunglasses.  Guess what…they are now back in style!  If you wait long enough everything comes round again.  Of course, your eye prescription has to not change very much.5)  Hubby and I, while walking through the mall last night, purchased two Godiva dark chocolate truffles at $1.65 each.  Are we the last of the big spenders or what?  A woman my age that I didn’t know who was standing behind me during the purchase told me that I was worth it.6) Did you know that it can cost hundreds/thousands of dollars if you lose your cell phone and don’t have it password protected?  I go through this fear every other month while my hubby rushes around trying to remember where he left his cell phone.7)  And, not related to money at all but related to that great neighborhood of bloggers, please send good thoughts to Hedwig at Living the Scientific Life so she can get back to blogging, and send good thoughts to Peruby as she makes her SECOND batch of buckeyes and cares for the dog that ate the first.8)  On a final note, I sometimes think of (and miss) Carol at The Cerebral Outpost who has taken a brief, lengthy or permanent respite from blogging.   My thoughts returned most recently when I came across this fellow below while walking around an area near Boulder.  Carol will know why."},

While I have tremendous respect for Mr. King's writing talent I am not a big fan of his genre.  Anyway what do Stephen King and the photo above have in common?  The photo is a rock promontory called twin owls outside of Estes Park, Colorado and it rests above the Stanley Hotel which was the hotel used in the movie.  The reason I have posted this photo is because it was a scene which I knew well.  One of my girlfriends in elementary school had a father that managed that hotel.  We got to play many an afternoon in that place which seemed enormous to me at the time.   By today's standards it is not a very large hotel.  We played in the pantry, the kitchen and the downstairs hallways.  Today I am amazed that we were allowed to do that.  Maybe nobody knew.  It was winter and the season had slowed, so the hotel was not very busy as I recall."},
{"title": "That Strange Shape-shifting Time", "date": "Tuesday, September 05, 2006", "text": "Sitting in that gigantic metal airbus which, using any rational reasoning, should not be able to overcome earth’s gravitational pull much less fly over miles and miles of checkerboard farmland, I settled in and begin the time shift.  Not the shift of time from Mountain Standard to Eastern Standard, but rather the shift in mental time from oldest daughter in a family that was started a long time ago and now exists with missing pieces to the my current mental time of being a wife, mother and grandmother whose days are filled with activities far from that former family.My father, whose gentle demeanor and small stature would never fit the imposing image of Patriarch, is now ninety-two and a half.  His walk is slow and careful, and his hearing is down to 30%, but his outlook and general health are miraculous.  With pressures from his “busy-body” daughter-in-law and his first born (myself) he is adapting to some new digital hearing aides.  The cacophony of daily noise is slowly being filtered by newly awakened neurons in the brain.  The buttons and dials that rest above his ears are tiny and hard to identify for the awkward and numbed fingers of a 92-year-old, and yet he still tries to adjust.  They actually seem to be working as I had several long if somewhat innocuous conversations with him.  My father was never one to exchange deep thoughts, therefore, it is mostly talk about the “old-days” or what is currently happening.During most of the week I was at my first brother’s house.  Dad was far more active than he had been while staying at my youngest brother’s house, which had been his new home since Mom died over a year ago.  This second move was necessitated by the unhappiness of my other SIL who after a year of living with Dad was requiring more privacy.  (My judgement was that she was totally being selfish, but that is another story.)    So the other SIL and brother have taken him in.  We walked several blocks in the neighborhood each day, walked around Walden Pond outside of Boulder and elsewhere.  We could see his strength and balance improving each day and he even commented on this himself.  His gardening, which he loves, was limited in this new place due to the width of the vegetable beds.  Still, he enjoyed watching the squirrels steal the strawberries as he sat at the kitchen table.The next door neighbor had a sewer problem which also became my father’s new feature show.  Since he was in construction years ago, watching the work of the back hoe and the activity of the laborers became another fascinating pursuit.One memory I have from when I was a very small girl was watching John Wayne movies on TV with my father.   I had purchased the John Wayne/John Ford DVD set for his birthday a while back and we watched one of those movies together while I was there.I am involved in that traditional race where we try to fill our parent’s lives with activities and exercise to extend their life span...that race ahead of inevitable death.Strangely, it was not unbearably sad to leave at the end of the week this time, but perhaps it was because I did not allow my mind to wander to those places in the future.  I was concentrating only on the moment."},

I don't care how much you like it, you will get tired of too much exhilaration.Last week I was reading a news story about the sea life in La Jolla, California. I remember visiting the shoreline there a few years ago. I could smell the richness of the sea long before I reached the walkway to look over the coast. The richness I am talking about was the smell of sea lion feces and old fish. This was in thanks to the many lumps of sea lions lounging on the floating docks and rocks in the water.

They stare at you like cattle casually chomping on that hosta leaf and wondering why you bother to come home each evening insisting they move. Hundreds of thousands of dollars of shrubbery and landscaping have been eaten to the bare bark. Neighbors try to protect rows of dramatic hostas and gardens of colorful roses with bird netting. Netting that gets tangled in the lawn mower and gets tangled in your shoe laces and doesn't look all that pretty and thus, distracts from the beauty of what you are trying to raise.We have a private botanic garden nearby that finally put up a ten foot metal fence around its acreage with an automatic gate for cars. They were losing rare plants that were hundreds of years old due to deer foraging. Too many deer and probably too many people loving the plants.  Ten years ago they did not need a fence around the garden.Well, it should all slide back into place in the coming years.

{"title": "Black Talk", "date": "Thursday, August 03, 2006", "text": "“Caw.\"  \"Ca rue ca rue.”Two feathered friends’ rhythmic coolSummer jazz sessionAlice was talking to the White Rabbit last week about her upcoming croquet game with the Queen and how nervous she was at making an effort to do well so that she could  make the Queen look good. (She had been invited to join the Queen’s Team by the Fish-Footman recently at a high-tea.)The White Rabbit briefly checked his watch, and then casually pointed out to Alice that her way of playing croquet with the Queen could be so improved if she took advantage of some strategies that had been demonstrated by the Cheshire Cat last year and written up by the Dormouse.  It should be noted and was forgotten by Alice at the time that White Rabbit always had good ideas that weren't always well thought out.The Dormouse had never made a lot of money, but was much smarter than most subjects in the Kingdom and did lots of strategizing and writing.  The White Rabbit suggested she follow him down the Hole of Possibilities for a demo of this strategy.  Alice eagerly complied and when they reached the bottom, he demonstrated this strategy on his new large computer and Alice, of course, was impressed.  She knew that the Cheshire Cat had gotten an award by the Wonderland Croquet Association for his innovative approach last year and since she had some leftover cake in her apron pocket, she was hoping that she could get him to let her in on the little secret. After all, this would benefit all of the kingdom and not just her, because this would make the Queen very generous and happy for months.After thanking White Rabbit Alice decided to run this idea by the Mad-Hatter.  He seemed to be her mentor these days.  His style of insanity seemed to work the best in the Kingdom.  He also agreed with White Rabbit about approaching Cheshire Cat as a good way to use up the cake before it got stale.  The Kingdom of Wonderland is full of stale cake at this time of the year.So Alice put on her cleanest apron transferring the piece of cake to the starched pocket and went off to visit the Cheshire Cat at his office. Cheshire Cat was one of the few people in the Kingdom that had a windowsill to sit and dream on, which he seemed to do more often than not, and that was exactly how Alice found him.    He smiled his 'Ultrabrite' toothy smile as she approached.  (Alice hated that easy smile of his.)  He stretched very slowly before leaping from the window sill, and took his time recognizing her presence.   She explained her venture with the Queen and then told him she had talked with White Rabbit who in turn suggested she might use his \"already created, magnificent, brilliant and very original strategy.\"Cheshire Cat started purring and then looked off into space as if he were thinking.  Somehow, above the noise of his loud purring, she knew he wasn’t thinking about any one thing and was just stalling for time or maybe deciding if he could disappear easily. After stroking his whiskers with both paws he finally stated that this type of strategy cost lots of cake and the time of someone very wise, such as Dormouse who happened to be under Cheshire Cat’s domain at the time.“But you have already developed the strategy and I just want to implement it on the exact same croquet field?  This would make us BOTH look good.  We could BOTH benefit.  I would certainly mention your name to the Queen.”  Alice reasoned.Cheshire Cat looked at her as though she were speaking French!  He seemed insulted.  (He had recently lost three mice due to starvation because he moved some cake into incorrect pantries and therefore, lost it, and as a result, he was a little on edge.)“How many pieces of cake and how much time?” she finally asked.Cheshire Cat stared at the ceiling.  “Uh…” pause…”Ahem…” pause “maybe…I guess between 20,000 and 50,000 pieces of cake and …I don’t know how much time.  You would have to ask the Dormouse but, unfortunately, he is visiting his Aunt Brie in Iceland right now.”Alice stared at her shoes.  She had only three days before the big event.  She had 45,000 pieces of cake in her freezer, but she needed a new cake plate which cost about 6,000 pieces and she had promised Mad Hatter she would help him with a tea party that also needed cake and she didn’t know how many people were going to be invited to the tea party so she didn’t know how much cake would be needed and oh dear.“Ok, I'll let you know if I can get my hands on some more cake,” she said and left.Alice was low in mood and just a little panicked.  She passed Mad Hatter by the stream and told him her dilemma.  Mad Hatter suggested they keep her cake in the freezer until next year when it would be more useful---but maybe more stale.  He also suggested that instead, an alternative would be to send the cake to Mock Turtle who was a very cooperative turtle and maybe he could study the strategy and help Alice.Alice was wondering how long this would take.  Friday’s and weekends were not the best days for the young and popular Mock Turtle to learn stuff and Mock Turtle was more a soccer kind of turtle and not a croquet kind of turtle. Alice watched the sun set on another day beyond the field across the stream thinking and trying to be positive.     To be continued…maybe."},

The boxes sat patiently in a cold warehouse among mice and dust and other strange boxes for approximately two years. The lower class boxes sat less patiently in a hot metal shed with heat and humidity and freezing temperatures through the same number of seasons. I think now there are only 50 boxes left to open and with contents that require sighing or lamenting. Let's see, one box contains a 2 foot blue silk bat with real bat teeth that can hang from the ceiling!  (Now there is a conversation starter.)  Another box is filled with old faded photos of people I don't even know!   There is the small blue suitcase of baby clothes that I was saving for my daughter who does not want or need them.  Maybe they will be appropriate if and when my son has a baby.  There is nothing more depressing than admitting that most of your memories are only of value to you and your husband. The things that you save will eventually be burned, thrown away, or given away when you finally shuffle off this mortal coil.  And your children will be swearing under their breath at the work that will entail.After two days of  such work and late in the afternoon of the second day, my husband asked if I wanted to go for a \"sunset paddle.\" This is really his code for \"Do you want to sit with me while I go out and fish.\"  He got the bait bucket and I got the lifejackets and paddles and off we went to the dock to put the canoe in the water.This was a big mistake on my part in spite of the serene picture above because the air was deathly still and the humidity was high and the heat was still in the air and I was miserable. I also forgot to take water and I was thirsty.  There is nothing worse than a crabby woman in a canoe.We passed the 'Gossiping Gang of Geese' that camp on the sandbar near the mouth of the river.I turned to the cool side of the sky away from the setting sun and caught a photo that almost made me pretend that the evening was getting cooler and that a breeze was coming up.But I was wrong.  It was a sizzling hot evening and even the surface of the water seemed to be sizzling. This was the surface of the water's true color, no tweaking.We  were glad to see the sun descend behind the peninsula of land as we paddled back to the dock.  (Caught only one reasonable sized perch.)    It was still hot, but we pretended that this was a cool evening sojourn."},

He is a good example for his family.East and West at Every Turn I think Sky was originally from a southern state in the U.S. and she tends to blog and comment with a Southern drawl and gracious charm. She is now married to an East Indian American man who creates the most beautiful gardens for her in the beautiful northwest and she takes pictures to make us all envious. Of course, Seattle is a great place to grow stuff anyway. She posts text that is a reminder for me about poets and authors I have long forgotten. She aways sends uplifting comments to my blog as well.The Daily Warrior Tammy is the perky 'Katie Courac' on my blog list. She makes me believe that no matter what happens life is good and worth living and to just go for it. Hey, even her pedicure’s are perky! She faces unique personal challenges and makes champagne from the stale grapes she sometimes gets. I am so totally amazed at her inner strength that when I get down I feel I should slap myself. Her sweet new grandson is the light of her life and in her newer entries she has become very creative with some text/photo combo entries called Haigu which I am hoping to try myself -- someday. (They are somewhat like a jigsaw puzzle and cannot be done lightly. Tammy does them so well it is a little intimidating.)Idiot Out Wandering Around Scott was fiddling around with his blog format recently and finding himself personally, so recently he has not done much posting. I also started reading him through other blogs and comments on my house blog as he was in the process of building his house. I think he was more hands-on in his house project than we were.Stepping Stones of Truth Val lives in Dorset, England and posts the most envious photos of gardens she visits. She has a special love of Japanese gardens. Her home is like a lovely English cottage---only larger---with beautiful flowers. She knows how to appreciate the good things in life, and dares to pretend she can sail. Sometimes when reading her blog, I think I am visiting Agatha Christie's blog or that pair of gardeners in Rosemary and Thyme on Public Television. What fun.Glenda in the Land of Oz  Glenda is political and liberal and sometimes even funny in spite of that. She has a rich history in her life. You don’t want to get on her dark side. She will post you nude with a duck head at a moments notice ! (Just see some of her photos.) She generously comments on my blog from time to time. She, like me, is a peace-nik and so unhappy with the way things seem to be going in the world today, but she is also pro-active about it.Daring to Write.  Wenda is a writer and a teacher of writing. The title of her blog is what got my attention. She is one of the many bloggers I look to as I study writing and try to improve my own. She teaches writing in Canada. I enjoy reading her well-crafted vignettes of life. She can be hard on herself which helps me to be easier on myself.  Currently her blog is a diary of how to get healthier.Ask-the-painting-contractor-chickie I cannot remember how I found Carina…through the Blogger dashboard (?).  Who could pass up a blog with this title? Her blog is new and different and funky. I mean, how many painting-contractor-chickies do YOU know? She sometimes posts about one of her jobs which may require acrobatics or a good sense of ethics. (Also I am hoping for some free advice when I try that glazing technique over the ‘butter yellow’ room...)  She also posts about her dogs which obviously are her other non-painting life.  Carina has gone the way of the 'lost' bloggers...easy come easy go.Beyond the Fields We Know  Kerrdelune is another blogger with many readers. She touches my soul with her photos of nature which reveal her graphics artist background and Buddhist leanings. Her photos show such peace and beauty. Her text is poetic and philosophical. Reading her blog is a nice reward at the end of a busy day. Her style is what I need to work toward when I snap pictures. Aye, there’s the rub---no snapping!!Driftwood Inspirations  Chancy is 75 years young. Her blog like mine tends to be all over the place, but she is a much better writer and a lovely poet. She is insightful on many levels. She is 'slowblog' so go there when you have time to digest thoughts. No fastblogging there. She also is very generous when she comments on my blog.And last but not least is my blog-child. I like to take credit for giving birth to this blog, but as parents know we cannot take credit for anything our progeny produce. I commented favorably about the writing of a blogger on Robert Brady’s blog wondering why she didn’t have a blog if her own. Thus I inspired Maya’s Granny to begin her own blog. She lives on the side of a mountain in Alaska, is a grandmother to a beautiful little girl, has an interesting relationship with bears and I am just beginning to learn about the rest of her rich tapestry of life.There are dozens more blogs that I read on occasion and have yet to add to my blogroll.  Too many blogs and too little time.  It amazes me after two years of this blogging thing that I look upon my blogroll the same way I would any people in my neighborhood - with homage here to the late  Fred Rogers  - my favorite neighbor.  Some I see everyday and some our paths cross only on occasion.  I think the most amazing part is their loyalty. A few come and go, but so many still post comments to their blogfriends even after they have long given up blogging on their own."},
{"title": "Honor Blogroll -Part II", "date": "Saturday, July 22, 2006", "text": "A study published today said the average blogger is a 14-year-old blogging about her cat. Haven't gotten to her blog yet...but here is the second group of my regular reads below:Old Horsetail Snake      Hoss has an extremely popular blog and is known as an 'elderblogger'. He posts frequently and there is always a little contest to see who can post their comment on the day's blog-entry first. He tells ‘sullied’ little stories, posts funny, if somewhat irreverent, cartoons and ends with a his version of the definition for his word of the day. Once I was going to respond with a blog comment, but being number 24 or 34 or whatever, I decided instead to do a demographic review on the people who commented on his blog. I found that most of his readers are young and most are female. I am sure he is grinning all the time because of that. He is a sweetie. (By the way, this Honor blog roll thing was Hoss's idea.)Just ask Judy I  don’t get out to Judy’s place as much as I used to. She also is high up in the popularity of the blogosphere and that is how I first found her. She is the Yin to Hoss's Yang. (or vice versa?)Thoroughly Modern Millie     Millie is a very well-known 80-year-old who gives us all joy when we see that life goes on in a such a wonderful way as we age. She is a snowbird and blogs about that transition each season. She also blogs about the past and these posts are usually romantically touching. (She has a son that markets her blog as if he were her agent and posts videos of her struggles to open things---that doesn’t sound funny, but it is.)Written, Inc     Carmi is a journalist in Canada. I don’t get to his blog as much as I would like. I was most taken by his unique digital photos. While looking at common everyday things he frames them as different and odd and striking. It is not the traditional digital diarrhea of pretty photos that we all insist on posting. Sometimes he posts a question with them which stimulates quite a few comments. He also is one of the few current father bloggers that I have on my list.Honeystrain     Honeystrainin is her mid-30s and an irreverent mom. Good place to go when you need a pause and an good laugh. Her sardonic take on our culture as seen through the eyes of someone younger. She also makes and sells pretty cards that seem oddly gentle in juxataposition to her writing.Self Winding    I found this blog while blog-surfing.  The banner caught my eye.  It was so peaceful.     Anna gives me an art fix and a British blog-ring-thing that only happens when a blog is written by a true Brit. Her blogs require some deep thinking sometimes --- can't just breeze through those posts. She also likes gardening. I don’t think I have ever commented on her blog, so she doesn’t know I read it, I am sure. She started her blog back in 2002 and one of these days I will really read it!Time Goes By      Ah yes, Ronni, who doesn’t suffer fools lightly and has no patience with those who do not respect the 'elderly'. Her blog is also famous and read by many of us older bloggers since her primary theme is the ageing process as well as society's take on elders. She just moved from New York City to rural Maine which shows that even elderbloggers can bend and not break. It has been interesting to watch her start to breathe more slowly in the new space.long-toothed hinterland dweller     Jude is the hinterland dweller that takes me through the exotic (to me on the other side of the earth) backyard in Australia. She is also an elderblogger. It is nice to have someone who blogs about strange fruit and strange bugs and stranger animals. I love to visit Australia vicariously this way. We have gardening in common and a love of the great outdoors. (Here blog may be ending...or re-starting...?)Earth Home Garden I don’t comment on this blog often but I do visit often to stop by and view the beauties of nature. The outdoor photography with artistic tweaking is why I visit Jim’s place. I don't think he can take a bad photograph or he certainly does not post them. He and his wife live in a cabin in the woods in California. They seem to do fine without a car and consciously live a simple life. They could be aging hippies for all I know.Well, that is the summation of the middle group.  The rest are still to come."},

{"title": "My Blog Honor Roll--Part 1", "date": "Monday, July 17, 2006", "text": "When I first discovered blogging, I viewed it primarily as a way to swim the creative waters and as a way to detail a journal of my days. I have started a number of journals/diaries in my past, only to abandon them shortly thereafter. When I discovered that I could include pictures to my blog it only added a wonderful new dimension in testing those creative waters. After a while my blog became interactive. I commented on others blogs and they commented on mine. My personality is such that I like to intereact with a broad range of people. Variety is the spice of life and has been my mantra in food, music, entertainment and blogreading. (My husband often jokes that he doesn't understand why I have stayed married to him for so long, if that is the way I feel.) In blogging, as others tweaked my perspective and motivation in a whole new way, my addiction was complete. I also am intrigued by the voyeuristic aspect of visiting people and their lives so virtually.Egoiste commented on my very first post and now has disappeared into the black pixels of the blogosphere. This probably says a great deal when it comes to blogging and bloggers. We are an ephemeral bunch, and perhaps not at all what we appear to be and maybe, instead, more so what we want to appear to be. When I first started this blog I viewed it as something that might be of interest to any geeky grandchild that I might have. But, to my surprise, although I got less personal as I got more public, along the way I made many pixelated friends.The two-year anniversary of this blog falls on August 22 and I feel that I really should comment on this approaching milestone in some way. Sticking with something like this for two years should be of some significance---at least for me. (Maybe it shows that I at least have tenacity if no writing talent.) So, I have decided to honor my blogroll, the list of my motivators, which has grown in length as I have grown in courage. I have to list them now, because if the list grows longer, I will not be able to accomplish such a task in the future. This will be a three-part series where each blogger gets their little time and space. ( Ah, I've got you now, don't I? Your dying to see what I say about you. But if I hurt anyone's feelings--get over it--you shouldn't be blogging if you are that sensitive!)PART ITomorrow is Another Day -- middle-angel, who lives in Japan, was my first. (Tee hee, sorry about that). She has the following text in her blog description: “As a libran, I put a high value on balance in everything. Pacifist, optimist. middle-aged, married.” I misread this during my early blog reading days. I mis-read the same way I mis-type. I thought she had written “As a librarian” and was wondering what a Japanese librarian would be like, so I started reading her blog. I find she does more sophisticated work than that and that is why her English is so outstanding. She is my gentle and slow day person. She helps me re-enter the Asian simple, retrospective and peaceful mode. She posts pictures of really delicious looking food. Sometimes she talks about her grown daughter, and her husband is a wonderful potter as well.My World and Welcome to It --Peruby, who lives in Ohio, is an everywoman. She is a single mom with a beautiful teenage daughter and various pets. Yes, for her, this is the best of times and the worst of times. She has also discovered digital photography and provides a pictorial review of her rural life in Ohio in between making sure the public schools have their PC systems working. She always sympathizes with me when I am down. We don’t really have a lot in common but we are somehow always on the same wave length.Living the Scientific Life -- Hedwig the Owl aka GrrlScientist is a very special young woman. She is pretty, very smart, outspoken, and has overcome tremendous challenges in her personal life. I think a Blogger comment helped me discover her blog. She is currently looking for a job in the field of science/working with birds and is a WONDERFUL journal-type blog writer. I am totally amazed that someone hasn’t gobbled her up yet—either by marriage or by work. It will happen someday I know, no grass grows under her feet. We share travel and the love of the South Pacific and Asia, but I cannot keep up with her passion for birds. She has a crazy sense of humor as well. I sort of feel 'motherly' when connecting with her.   She has built up a hugh fan base in the blog community.Pure Land Mountain -- Just go to Robert Brady’s well-known blog on Pure Land Mountain and you will know why I visit there often and why he is so famous. He doesn’t need the ‘interesting’ younger photo of himself to attract readers. He is a poet and a philosopher. He paints pictures and feelings and funny events all with just words. He is insightful and inspiring and makes most blog writers jealous. (His brother is a terrific writer also, but is not linked on my blogroll--I have to stop somewhere---don't I?)Full Fathom Five -- I think I  remember how I found Mary Fowler at Full Fathom Five. She is a New Englander and part of all that that entails--spare of words but clear of thought. She has a love of boats and a new, energetic white dog. I stumbled on her husband’s blog where he was talking about sails and I thought I might learn something to share with my sailor husband. Then I discovered the blog of his wife who teaches English to Asian students and in a focused way is working on self-improvment.White Noise -- I started sharing blog comments with mannababies when she was pregnant with her third and building a house. This is a woman who can never have too much to do. She is a devoted and talented mom and yet still has time to blog, take very artistic photos, and eat the good food she cooks. Her life currently revolves around those lovely children. She has no time to sleep, unfortunately. She reminds me of myself juggling all those balls years ago. We do have coffee and chocolate in common. Her life is always moving, new houses, new jobs!Roomination – I think I found Ginga through Hoss (who is honored in the blog to come). She knits and I don’t. She does have a youthful sense of humor that brightens the day. She may actually live within driving distance of my new house.At  The Cerebral Outpost   Carol has wonderful patience as she doesn’t post often and each post has been carefully edited and written and is a very good read as a result. She has that ‘wry’ sense of humor, and when she leaves considerate comments on your blog, you may actually think you were old friends at some time. She was recently married and shared that special event with her readers. The first blog I read of her’s was so flat-out funny about a large crawfish, a cat and a treadmill…yep, she is worth visiting.Loose Leaf: Notes from a Writer's Journal    Colleen, on the other hand, is a prolific blogger, a published writer, and a featured person on NPR. She is fearless and her philosophy is \"Things I would not tell anyone, I tell the public.\" She lives in a small town of artists and active bloggers in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia. While our daily lives are not all that similar, there are threads of philosophy in her blog that I can always relate to. I also frequently find little details in our historic lives that we have in common as well.  Her place in her community reflects a strong citizenship.Well, that is the first batch of virtual friends who have allowed me to visit.   More to come."},

(Don't worry, I have a small wine cooler in the new kitchen and will slowly add that.) Actually, I think I will start a spreadsheet which will be more useful to me. If I get that going I can share.Therefore,  since I do like this 'working with words thing' and posting digital photos,  I have started a new blog about the Great Outdoors which is the other room of my new house.Welcome to my unfinished yard."},

I have thrown away, given away, and sold more things than most people in the world own.As I unpack, I find I still have hundreds of boxes of items that I have not seen since I packed them and stored them over three years ago.One of the first boxes I came across was labeled for the master bedroom. Inside, among other items, were three silk clutch purses: red, purple and gray. There was also a black clutch purse with a faux turquoise stone on the clasp. Then there was a delicate white and pink beaded purse that I 'think' I wore to a high school prom. The thing about these purses is that I may have never used them more than once each. I am not a person who goes to formal affairs very often...certainly not after college. I don't know anyone who uses clutch purses anywhere.Well, should I throw them away or turn them in for the office white elephant sale? I threw them into an empty box, and then, almost immediately, scooped them up again and put them in a smaller box. Why? Just in case I have a granddaughter someday.

I must have followed a comment on someone else's blog. Comments are usually good hints at an interesting blog. While she doesn't write much in her second (3rd 4th?) language, I love the ability to visit her view of rural Brazil via my computer. She is/was a journalist and now posts photos of her life there in the countryside and photos about her family history. She has the most beautiful children as frequently happens in places like Brazil. It must be the sunshine or the food. Recently she has started to share her family photos from generations back.Bill's Stuff I discovered Bill when he routinely commented on my house blog. He was/is/wants to go through a similar process. He also writes about other stuff like cooking, washing dishes, his family and we seem to be on the same wave length politically. He works with computers or software or something in the technology field and most recently he has been overecoming a physical challenge.

I do have 13 this time and snub my nose at superstition.)1) Watching the Cavuto show on Fox which I never watch but did this time because I was too lazy to change the channel. Ann Coulter was channeling demons with the 'Culture of Terrorism' speech that she said the Democrats are spreading. Boy after that I really need a Margherita. (Personally I think she needs more s*x.)2) Walking home in the sun from work and smelling the freshly washed plants and the chocolate earth renews my soul. I am not meant to spend large amounts of time indoors.3) At my wedding there were only about 20 people and none of them were blood relatives or any type of family relation to either my husband or myself. The youngest was 11 and the oldest was 80.4)  The lady who is doing my house blessing has gotten her chickens in...a bunch of different types.5)  I have started a draft entry for my two year blog.  It is getting complicated.6) Because I live in an apartment above another apartment I cannot exercise in the early morning when I am metabolically ready...exercising in the late afternoon after work is hard for me. I am skipping a lot of afternoons.7) The first piece of furniture/equipment that is going into the new house this week is the new elliptical machine. I think(?) we have our priorities straight.8) My daughter is going through a rough time and I don't know quite how to help her although I am full of advice. But right now I am biting my tongue.9)  I always wonder what it is about families that face tragedy and heal together  versus families that fall apart.10) My sweet niece that lost her mother (my middle sister) when she was 13 just graduated from high school. I wish I was more a part of her life.11) A pair of woodpeckers live in the woods outside our new house. Guess we won't cut down all those dead trees right away. They get really noisy when they are together. I can't tell if they are squabbling or just getting life straightened out.12) Why are carpenters so hot? I mean there is something really sexy about a well-shaped guy sawing a board. The smell of freshly sawed wood is also an aphrodisiac.13) Final county permit approved today. Now tomorrow is supposed to be the occupancy permit. I did the Lilliput dance around my office and got people to shake my hand!"},
{"title": "Being Stubborn Is Not a Virtue", "date": "Tuesday, June 27, 2006", "text": "I have been spending every weekend running errands for the housebuilding, or socializing with my grandson and his family, or trying to get laundry done (the washer is available -- now it's not -- now it is -- dance). Therefore, trying to get a haircut has not been crossed off the list of things I have to do. Each day I have looked witchier than usual when I get ready for work. I have gone through various routines of hair combs, pins, hair ties, etc. to alleviate the situation. I am not into much appearance maintenance stuff as it really is a losing battle, but sometimes one has to make the commitment to develop a put-together look to avoid being confused with someone homeless.Finally, this morning at work, in frustration while untangling the hair on my neck which was caught in my necklace, I called a hair salon that is about a 20 minute drive from me and asked if I could get a haircut that evening. They didn't know the name of the person I requested but said they could get me in at 4:00 with someone else.I had a meeting at work until 4:00 but told people at the meeting I would be leaving at 3:30. It was a survey meeting and they were working through the various tedious questions with my colleague and I. With only three questions left and my eye on the clock, I excused myself and hurried back to my office to get my stuff.What on earth was I thinking? I repeat, WHAT WAS I THINKING! We have been on the weather channel all day. Just getting across the street through the flood caused by the rain should have caused me to pause. The ambulance racing up the hill should have caused pause. The beginning of rush hour should have caused a pause.I was completely soaked by the time I reached the car in front of the apartment building. I tossed in the umbrella and other items and squeezed myself (like wringing a wet washcloth) behind the steering wheel. While I started the car I glanced at the clock radio---4:15!! What? I suddenly realized that the clock on the wall in our meeting room was over 30 minutes behind. I called the shop and said I would be late and was on my way, and could they still take me? (Of course, what other idiot plans for a hair cut in a monsoon?)Well, with brilliance slightly short-circuited by rain, I decided to take a shorter route off the main highway. It was definitely an over the river and through the woods trip. Only, I couldn't get over the river as the bridge was flooded and a cop car was turning everyone away. Driving carefully back through another suburb and squinting through the wall of gray rain I saw all of the swales at the sides of the road were becoming rivers. Cars that passed were spraying waves of water on each side.A normal person would have turned back as it was already 4:45 and I was no where near the mall with the hair shop. As a matter of fact, I wasn't sure where I was.Damn it, I am getting this haircut.  I am not going back.Through luck and tenacity I made it to the mall by 5:00, but to my surprise (I did say the brain was short-circuiting, didn't I?) all sheltered parking was taken   I waded through more water and with the posture and possible smell of a damp dog finally entered the shop. They could still take me, but the stylist had gone for coffee. No duh, I was almost an hour and a half late. I sat damp, limp, and cold thumbing through glossy magazines of those rich New York models who would look good even with a bucket of cold water thrown in their faces.Finally, the stylist arrived and to shorten this tedious blahog...I got a nice cut and was able to join bumper to bumper traffic getting back home by 7:00. I am still a stubborn old bitch, but now a much better looking one."},
{"title": "Wanting Answers Already", "date": "Friday, June 23, 2006", "text": "This work week has been unnaturally long and demanding.  I am not a bureaucrat and trying to fake it is killing me.  I came from the world of education where there was a goal, a product, a reward.  Bureaucrats work for visibility, power and god knows what else!  Oh, yes, sometimes a little money.  They also lie to your face.  I hate working with people like that.  Do they think I won't figure it out?  I have a graduate degree!  I am NOT an idiot.  Maybe a little old and a little more passive, but not dumb.So, I am going to string together my rants and flex my gray matter as therapy from the doldrums I am in so that I have a clean slate for the weekend.1)  Children push your buttons and don't even know they have that power.  My son who lives 15 minutes from me and works 10 minutes from me, can manage to see me only once every ten weeks or so and never responds to my emails or phone calls---which actually have become pretty sparce on my part. I don't ask the wrong questions and he doesn't hate us; it is just a personality thing with him.  I hate it and maybe I will kill him someday, if I stop loving him.2)  Energy and crazy ideas.  I don't have them anymore.  I dream but the body and mind ain't as willing as it used to be and that is why I am so thankful I have children.  They rope me into lots of stuff.  Grandchildren are even better.3)  My husband still has energy and crazy ideas.  So, I accept that this is not an aging thing...maybe a menopause thing?  Sorry guys.   But I do have to rally the energy to put the brakes on him sometimes.4)  Global warming has me scared.  I work with people who really understand its power.  I used to work with another group of people 20 years ago who predicted this mess.  I hate that people are so complacent about this.5)  I have to believe that what goes around comes around.  This administration must reap the rewards of its efforts someday along with the rest of us.6)  I am once again living in a room of partially packed boxes.  I have been here before.  I think when I add it all up, the moves for myself, my children, and my mother-in law, the sum is at the very least 20 household moves.  I can pat myself on the back for my resilience if nothing else.7)   Hubby is down at the house today washing the oyster racks and unpacking a few things.  Last night was a killer lightning storm which kept us awake for hours, so he wanted to see how the drainage on the property was going. 8) And this just in...for more years than I care to count I have bitten my fingernails.  I stopped (no effort on my part) several months ago right after the Hilton Head trip.  What gives?9) Gee, its Friday already.  There is a light behind that gray cloud.Post Script:  Saw \"Prarie Home Companion\" last night.  It provides the warm fuzzies you would expect, has outstanding low-keyed acting on the part of everyone, and HOSS would love the bad jokes sequence---all about P*****s, T and A's and bathroom humor.  The other jokes were better, but this movie does have something for everyone.  Sort of like an Our Town without the puritanical bent.  (It helps if you are a Garrison Keillor fan, which I have been for years.)"},

It took me almost another hour, but once I was down to a few tangles the resolution was fast and easy.  I had to be really slow and patient, though, because the necklace wanted to dance itself back into a tango of knots at every time I sighed with frustration and accidentally shuddered.  I think it was dancing because of the results of our late meeting with the doctor (proctologist urologist---both sound pretty dismal) last night.  I wore the necklace to work today.  It was in celebration of the 94% cure (NOT remission) rate that the doctor promised my husband.  These are odds that everyone would wish for.  We are going ahead with the 'seed' therapy which has the least side effects and the one day down time.  The only drawback (well not the only but the big drawback) and unusual restriction is that he cannot hold his grandson for any length of time for 60-90 days.  I will not write about the process in detail (unless someone needs information for their own journey down this path and lets me know).  I am sure there will be some set backs, but we are optimistic because we have a ton of stuff to do in our long lives ahead."},

{"title": "Whitie in the Suburbs", "date": "Thursday, June 15, 2006", "text": "Most handy homeowners have a favorite little one-stop store that they visit on the weekends in the spring. In small towns it is a local hardware store. In larger cities in my area it is usually the one-stop Lowes or the Home Depot. In spring these places are crowded with experts and innocents shoulder to shoulder all in search of something to fix or remodel or enhance on their house or in their yard.We live rather close to one of the most successful Home Depots in a very affluent home area. Just trying to get a parking place can cause a small altercation. That is why I should not have been surprised at what happened outside my local Home Depot last Saturday.As usual, I was into elaborate talking mode accompanied by elaborate hand waving mode to explain the type of item we should be looking for as my husband and I descended the stairs from the parking lot to the main entrance. Suddenly, mid-way down the stairs, he placed his hand on the front of my shoulder to stop me from taking the next step. He was looking at the small crowd of people at the bottom of the stairs in front of the primary entrance to the store.As I focused on the crowd I began to see that this was not a normal milling of people. There was one large man who looked about 40, at least 6'4\", his head towering above all the others and standing in an aggressive stance while two smaller men behind him were pulling on his faded red t-shirt and attempting to hold him back. The man was somewhat attractive and maybe Arabic or Asian Indian descent. He reminded me a little of Vincent D'Onofrio, the detective on Law and Order, Criminal Intent. He was that good looking, but like D'Onofrio there was something a little creepy about him. Anyway, on the other side of the small circle of the dozen on so people were two much smaller men their faces twisted and arguing back. They also looked middle-eastern or Asian, but were clearly older with gray hair...maybe in their late 50's and short in stature. In between this pushing and shoving and shouting were two Home Depot employees with the traditional red aprons trying to keep the peace. One was a heavy-set black man working very hard to calm down the Vincent-look-alike. The black man would no sooner get the 'V-O' look alike back to the edge of the circle and seemingly calm and then the guy would rise up like a big bear and head for the two men again. This went on for at least five minutes. The big guy was relentless and I thought he might be drunk or on something, even though he seemed pretty coordinated.Finally, when 'V-O' got on his high horse one final time, the black man lost his patience and gave up the polite and calming approach and started talking loud and using his chest to bump the man back. I got the feeling that he had dealt with this in another life, maybe the military. He seemed very controlled and confident and began ordering the guy to get off the property. This level of confrontation seemed to freeze the crowd momentarily.I also had lost my patience and ignoring the mess, hurried down the stairs and just around the circle into the doorway hoping that hubby was behind me. As I looked through the automatic glass door, I was surprised to see a line of shocked people inside the door with their purchases and full shopping carts waiting to leave. What a mess!Well, my husband and I hurried on into the store and headed back to the aisle to get going. We had a long day of errands ahead of us, and this idiot was not going to slow us down anymore. He was gone by the time we made it through the checkout a short time later. All the white suburbanites were pretty much in shock that such a thing could happen in their precious little neighborhood.  I ws just very irritated and thankful that no blood had been spilled."},
{"title": "String Theory?", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2006", "text": "Sometimes I find that my life is running in a theme. Or perhaps not. Perhaps I just see things with a different skew depending on events.I spent about an hour trying to untangle this silver necklace above. It is one of those long single strand necklaces---reminded me of the beads we wore back in the 'hippy' days. I bought it at a kiosk about a month ago and placed it carefully in a jewlery bag. When I took it out to wear it for the first time this past week I discovered that it had been impatient to get out and had tied itself in knots.  This first hour of trying to untie knots has taken much patience and I have made about 15% progress. So, if I devote a good part of my life to this task, I may actually wear this someday. It is a test of patience.I went down to the house we are building yesterday and there were lots of loose ends that I wish I could tie up. We had taken the 1,000 pieces of hardware for our masterbedroom closet and were eager to at least begin this task of installation. Unfortunately, we soon realized that there was still too much builders' junk in there to even begin to start an installation. There are lots of other little things still as well. My towel bars are too wide for the small bathrooms with little wall space and I don't know if the builder can return them...are they going to be an ebay entanglement?  There are about 4 new holes in the walls as if they were looking for something---maybe something tangled behind the sheetrock?  Another test of patience.And last and certainly not least, my husband's medical report that I had blogged about a while back did not come back benign. It is not an aggressive thing and he is a good candidate for the least invasive procedure (sort of like gardening where they plant seeds (!)) but it is still an entanglement from which we wish to extricate ourselves as soon as possible as well as another test of patience that we have to get through. I am not the type of blogger who feels better blogging about this stuff, so you will not read all the details from here. You all have enough entanglements and tests of patience in your own lives.Well, I shall disentangle myself from this chair and get another cup of coffee before I start my well-deserved weekend that I have so patiently been waiting for."},

{"title": "Are YOU Prepared?", "date": "Friday, June 02, 2006", "text": "I received a ‘guide’ in the mail yesterday. It was titled “Home Guide to Emergency Preparedness.” Photo above is of the first page. Nothing says preparedness like a cartoon of politically correct people with smiles on their faces. They had everyone represented including the ‘media-geek’, but they forgot the disabled (unless the elder-person represents both.) My first reaction to this mailing was remembering, (chagrin, chagrin,) how the teachers of my youth taught us to cover our heads under our desks if there was a nuclear attack. I am glad to see that preparedness has come so far.Anyway, since everything in the recent news has been about the feds cutting local terrorist prevention funding and that most local agencies are pretty much saying it is going to be up to the individual to save themselves in an emergency…i.e. “Don’t call us because we will be very busy writing our press releases.” I was pretty interested in how I should proceed to save my butt if the need arose.So I continued to peruse this missive. The second page consisted of ‘Bioterrorism frequently asked questions.’ After defining bioterrorism the answer to the burning question “What can we do?’ was “Stay alert and stay calm because this helps government agencies control the situation and protect you.” What? Then they went on to describe methods of dispersal and resulting symptoms of a number of biological agents. That was really fun reading, but not much help.There was a list of useful phone numbers, most of which I am guessing would not be answered during an emergency, but nice to post on the side of the refrigerator for false reassurance purposes. There was a whole page on smallpox (which I was vaccinated against in my twenties when I headed overseas…wonder if that still is effective?).Then the page on “Preparing Your Home for an Emergency” was finally getting to specifics. They suggested that we store a 3-5 day supply of food, water, vitamins, medicine, etc., planning on one gallon of water per person per day.And, at last, the best part. Shelter in Place-SIP. If you are a federal employee you hear and test for this several times a year in your office building. This SIP was written for someone who owns and lives in a single-family house. The safest place in my apartment is the bathroom--see this shoebox room below. There is no way to turn off the huge vent fan in this room as that is the only return vent and run by the building itself. I can barely find room to brush my teeth each morning. Storing 3-5 days of supplies in this room would mean we would have to use some one else’s bathroom in this building for the duration. (Yes, I was standing on the toilet when I took this picture.)And then the very best part was this diagram above of an evacuation plan for my building…I live in such a sophisticated high tech society. Anyway if you come for a visit, I will post this evacuation plan by the door so that you can get out safely."},
{"title": "The Small Story", "date": "Wednesday, May 31, 2006", "text": "I have probably explained this habit of mine before, but I will tell about my relationship (addiction) with Amaryllis plants.Over the years I would receive one as a gift and being the frugal person and lover of plants that I am, I would see if I could keep the bulb alive for the next year. I knew that the bulb would only bloom once and then spend its months restoring itself with just the lovely large leaves. I would cut the dead blossom (sometimes removing the pollen while it bloomed so that the blossom would last longer) and then keep the plant watered and in sun inside my house until the weather permitted me to move the pot outside. I would continue to nurture the plant outside until September when I would stop watering and move it into a dry area where it would not get the rain. Once the leaves started to yellow and wilt -- usually before the really cold nights -- I would cut the leaves, make sure the soil was dry and then pack the plant away into a dark place in my basement until the next season.I got into the habit of forcing the amaryllis to bloom in February when nothing else was going to provide me such beauty except leggy pontsettias after the winter holidays and before the spring blooms began. Over time I had collected and forced each year about 25 of these bulbs. They lined the space along the windows in my family room. And I probably looked a little silly hauling all the pots outside each year and back inside in the fall. I gave most of them away when we sold the house and had to move into the rental house.With each additional move I got rid of a few more.Three weeks ago when I was cleaning this tiny apartment I moved a small bench to vacuum near the kitchen wall. There was a black garbage bag with something heavy inside. I assumed it was some boat or fishing gear that my hubby had tucked away. Well, I am sure you are way ahead of me and realize it was one of the amaryllis plants. It happened to be my largest that has multiple bulbs in one pot that I have not had time to separate.I brought it out and saw that it had not even begun to send up any shoots even though it was months behind schedule. I was sure that it was dead and not just dormant, but I watered it anyway and placed it next to our kitchen window. Well, as you can see, in three short weeks, it has rewarded me tremendously!There is some lesson in this about patience or unrequited love or something and if I was more energetic some haiku or poem that I should create...but I am just happy to be so lucky!"},
{"title": "Weekend Walk in the Woods", "date": "Monday, May 29, 2006", "text": "I am sure that I will end up naming a number of posts like this with the same name, since this is what I do in the spring---walk in the woods. We drove to the mountains in West Virginia to see how long we could make spring last. Weather here in the city is already in the 80's and climbing.My husband found a trail called Devil's Stairsteps and the forestry map had described it as 'strenuous' which immediately made me NOT want to take it. But just like a dog on a leash I went along, and, of course, we ended up hiking about 5 miles total before we got back to the car. It was mid-day before we reached the trail and so we unfortunately started our hike just as the weather was getting warm and spent a good part walking in the warmest part of day. The drifting clouds that covered the sun intermittently were most welcome. It was just an afternoon hike due to the late start---otherwise hubby would have dragged me several more miles.  His motto is: \"Never leave a side trail unexplored.\"OK, get your coffee or tea or cold lemonade, and put your feet up, because I will take you along with no sweat on your part. You can click on the images to better see what I saw.All the trees were golden or emerald green except for a lovely rose colored ash in one of the valleys below. Birds were unusually loud and territorial for mid-day. We saw several cuckoos, a few grosbeaks and a lovely rust-colored thrasher all flitting and singing. Well, the thrasher was sort of clucking in the ground at our feet trying to avoid the hikers walking from both directions on the trail--- it was a little like rush hour at times. Mountain laurel were just starting to open and a good part of the trail was bordered with them which I tried to show in the photos above.We took a small side trail hoping for a rock out-cropping so that we could look out across the ravine.  There appeared to be a break in the canopy of heavy trees and that is where we came upon two lady-slipper plants---related to the orchid.  They were large and had white moths at the base of the flowers--maybe pollinating them. I was glad they were well away from the trail so that people wouldn't step on them or pick them. These are a rare find for me.The blue-eyed grass was in bloom and reminded me that I want to get some plants of this to place near the house in one of the landscape beds. I had these at my last house.  I caught a visiting bee when I snapped this photo!Two lovely mating butterflies danced back and forth across the path and here is one of them caught in mid-air over the trail.And, of course, much wild geranium was sprinkling its pink petals along the paths.And finally, a screen saver for your PC. I didn't resize this, so if you can get it open, it is all yours as a spring gift from me.  It was not 'photoshopped' but just a natural dark background from the forest.

{"title": "Omens", "date": "Friday, May 26, 2006", "text": "Omen is a short but powerful word, filled with shadow and potent possibility. When I ‘Googled’ the word to see the scope of definitions, it at first appeared to portend only disasters or disturbances. Then, as I read more definitions, omen could also represent a coming miracle or profitable event. In some explanations it was a visible sign, usually in nature, but the ancient Romans believed that a word spoken by chance and perhaps overheard by the gods was an also omen.Omen only means something if one is observational and superstitious. I am not generally superstitious because that means giving away power to something else, which I am not willing to do. Yet, I do try to be more observant of life’s energies around me. I try to take some time to focus on being in the moment as I rush from task to task during my work days and days off. I try to consciously tune into my instinctual ear and eye to prevent the smothering by artificial noise and visual demands of life. My husband is a much better observer of his surroundings than I am. I actually think that being in the woods and hunting and fishing have honed this skill in him. He is quicker to react to an emergency or pre-emergency sign and thinks more clearly than I. Like a chess player he will see the three moves ahead while I am still trying to assimilate the here and now. Therefore, while it may or may not be an omen, he is the first to see, evaluate and take action if needed.Two events that I have seen recently have been bouncing around in my head, and that is what brought me to thinking about omens. When we started building on our property on the river for our retirement home, within a year, a large and lovely oak tree that sheltered our dock near the water’s edge, died. It was lovely and healthy and except for a very large burl at its base, there was no sign of stress. It died in September even before it could put on the lovely colored cloak of semi-death that appears in the fall. When I studied the tree after its death, I saw signs of termites all around the base of the trunk. So the process had been ongoing. I have been told that an oak burl, if harvested, is very valuable for furniture and woodworking. Thus, there is beauty somewhere in this death. This oak was much older than I, yet too young to die. It had seen many mornings, days, and nights on this land. It had fed and sheltered the wildlife and provided a place for children to climb and view the water. Did it die because of grief when we bulldozed its brothers and sisters? Was it our noise and chatter which we added to a formerly quieter place? Is it an omen? What does it mean? Maybe it was just its time, but why can’t I get it out of my head?A second series of events has also been tickling my brain. When we traveled to Hawaii this past winter, the first to greet us on our hotel deck was a lovely red cardinal. He studied us carefully each day. I assumed that tourists had fed the birds and he was just checking out a possible pantry raid. When we arrived at Hilton Head last month, the very first thing I saw as I looked out across the balcony patio was a scarlet cardinal in the top of the tree looking back at me. There is nothing really unusual here, because cardinals are pretty common birds. Finally, last week when we were talking in our empty garage at the new house, a cardinal landed on the ground and peeked under the half open garage door. He saw us, but didn’t fly away. He did a little dance back and forth and then would look up at us and cock his head. It really seemed as though he was welcoming us to the woods. My husband and I knew he was trying to communicate in some way. His behavior wasn’t really that of a wild bird. But, then again, maybe he was checking out a possible new pantry and he wasn’t all that wild."},

{"title": "Life Story # 4:  One Fateful Night in 1983", "date": "Monday, May 15, 2006", "text": "It seemed that we had actually become settled in our new place on the side of the mountain just off of Kaliurang Road in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. After several hectic weeks of looking for hired help to do laundry by hand since we had no washing machine, and hiring a cook since food had to be purchased at the market on a daily basis, water had to be purified, vegetables had to be sanitized, etc., I finally was able to start tutoring my daughter in her second grade lessons. There was a small mission school but it only had classes up to the first grade. I hired a jaga malam (night watchman) who actually babysat my youngest son during the mornings when I was tutoring.We had gotten used to the crowded dirt roads, the unusual smells, and astonished reactions to our white skin. We were even beginning to sleep through the blare of the Imam’s call to prayer through an electronic loudspeaker just outside our upstairs louvered bedroom window at sunrise each morning. During the daytime, Kaliurang Road was busy with dusty traffic heading up and down the mountain, but at sunset the area suddenly became quieter and all you could hear was the infrequent bicycle bell and the rhythmic call of the street vendors with their wheeled carts.Our two-story house, while built of concrete, was oddly shaped with stairs of inconsistent height, the occasional rejections of small pieces of cement from the high ceilings above and a small patio in the back with an orchid covered wall which was also another house’s patio wall. It probably would not pass code in the United States, but for Indonesia it was considered a small palace with its extensive terrazzo front porch, terrazzo floors throughout and electrical pump for our well water.I remember one peaceful morning while my daughter was working on a school project, I headed upstairs above the servants’ side of the house to talk to our babu cuci (laundress) about something. She was in a small sheltered alcove on the roof hanging clothes. I had never been up to this area which also housed our drinking water in a large cement catchment. The view looking over the chest- high wall above the red-tiled rooftops was so freeing in its vastness. In the distance I could see the perfect cone shape of Mt. Merapi with its little cloud of volcanic smoke blowing away in a feathery wisp. (I think I have a photo of this somewhere that maybe I can add here.)A few nights after this I was shaken roughly awake from a deep sleep by my husband. “Get C. (our son)”, he cried. “I will get Y (our daughter). Hurry! Hurry!”  He threw back the covers and jumped out of bed.My brain was foggy and I moved slower than I should have while trying to absorb the anxious tone of my husband’s voice.“Wha…What is it?”  I sat up in bed.“Just hurry!  We have to get outside.  There is an earthquake.”I got up from the low platform bed and ran to my son’s room and scooped him into my arms. I didn’t feel anything unusual as I moved across the floor, but as we descended the stairs I saw out of the corner of my eye the aquarium water slopping in dramatic waves out of the sides of the aquarium onto the floor.We rushed to the street. Only a few others were outside standing in the dirt road. We waited in quiet shock anticipating the worst. There was a small tremor that swayed the bamboo fence in the front of the yard and then nothing for a very long time. There was no noise in the neighborhood to indicate anyone else had noticed that the earth had shaken her shoulders.Our crazy concrete palace was still standing and nothing had fallen from the ceiling as we carefully made our way back inside. We eventually fell asleep and awoke the next day with the memories seeming like a dream.If you are following the news recently you will understand that we could have been going through much worse with Mt. Merapi eruptions."},

On this napkin I have written in pencil the following words in the following format:\"TucumsehALEX THE GREATBest Sea captain in British Navy in 1800's            World's leaders saw interesting time + place\"I know that this had something to do with a blog I was thinking of writing a few weeks ago, but I cannot grasp even a glimmer of a clue when searching the old gray matter inside my skull. According to a recent scientific experiment that I particpated in, too much sand and sun does fry the brain.I woke up at my regular time this morning (5:30 AM). We had driven back yesterday (9.5 hours) and stopped by the new house on the way to see the past two weeks of work. There was just enough daylight as we arrived about 5:30. By the time we reached the apartment it was 9:30. I unpacked the necessary stuff, had a dish of ice cream for dinner and fell into bed with the necessary exhaustion for a good night's sleep.The drive was particularly long because we were without children and grandchildren (they has left earlier in the week). Even so, the car was still busting with stuff. We had added leftover groceries and my husband had moved some of the stuff that had been tied under the overhead canoe into the back storage area of the car.We got into the city around 8:00 PM and offloaded the bicycles and rack at the old rental house where we continue to store stuff with the good graces of our former landlady. We didn't unpack the rest and will do that today. I sit here in the apartment surrounded by suitcases and carry bags and dread picking up the two weeks of mail waiting for me at the Post Office.Today we head down to my daughter's house and unload all of the baby stuff. They (being jetsetters that they are) are flying down to Miami for a long weekend to visit some friends they haven't seen in two years. They are bringing Xman and Grandma and Grandpa think they are crazy and being spendthrifts, but such is life.Like the car, my head is also stuffed with bittersweet memories of the trip. Life goes by so fast and everyone has so much to do. There are so many obligations and responsibilities. I am always preparing for life's change in my mind it seems that it tends to interfer with the enjoyment of the present.I have a number of themes and ideas that I would like to write as a blog, but will probably forget everything in rush of today's errands. It is a good thing that blogs do not have editors!"},

So I get to blog in peace, and wonder how people can stay in bed so long when the weather is gorgous!I tried to call my son twice yesterday to see if he was driving down. I had my phone off in the evening when he returned the call. He has an old Honda, so I am concerned about his making the trip. I got a garbled message from him when I checked my voice mail before bedtime. He said something about being on his way and probably spending the night in a motel. This is so like him, getting a late start and then wasting what little money he has in a motel!  So, now it looks like we will see him sometime this morning, but I don't know when. Waiting for another call so I can give the gate guard his license number to let him into the HT (Hoity-Toity) compound.My son-in-law is flying out of here today to go to a business meeting in Denver, so the condo will not be anymore crowded. My daughter and Xman are flying out on Monday and we are staying through until next Friday. I don't know how long my son is staying during this week. We spent Tuesday morning on a bike ride to Pinkney Island which is a bird preserve.  It is a large island and really only accessible by bike, although the very first time we were here my husband and I spent an entire day trying to walk it and were able to cover only part.  There are a number of man-made lakes and other bird habitat, so you are able to get closer to all of those exotic water birds.  I took a ton of pictures that last time I was here, but with an older camera.  I still need a telephoto to get the best shots.It was Xman's first real bike trip and other than falling asleep on the way in and the way out and getting shaken like a milkshake on the rocky roads, he seemed to enjoy himself.  On the way back to the car he was getting tired of riding and started to cry.  Because of the bouncing his voice was wavering and he couldn't decide whether he wanted to cry or just making his voice do funny sounds.He is genetically predisposed to hate the out-of-doors.  The expression on his face when we first introduced him to grass at Easter for an egg hunt was priceless.  He actually shuddered!  Then when we introduced him to sand and finally ocean waves on this trip, he again had strong misgivings.  But, as of yesterday, all of this is now behind him and he actually walks into the gentle waves, even though the water is a little cold still.If I forgot to mention he is walking and almost running.  He is into everyting and as a result my husband has had to scale down his great outdoors adventures.  I think he is looking forward to Xman's departure just a little so that he can do the canoeing and fishing he  wants with his son or I.  I am looking forward to less 'catch me if you can' and 'oopsie, don't cry' times.Well, hubby is up and others should finally be dragging themselves out of bed.  Off to my second cup of coffee and to reading all of your blogs."},

What luxury! My laptop is totally USB and there is no such thing here. (They actually have two PCs in a room at the workout area for those folks who absolutely must check out the stock market in between workouts and massages, or in between a sauna and a pedicure.) I don't really fit here, because I am a little too Puritanical with my money and a little too close to a fixed income.We are at Hilton Head which is hoitey toitey, yes, but also relaxing and fun. Almost everyone vacationing here is a set of grandparents with children and pre-schoolers of the children. The scenes are disgustingly like the postcards and condo ads.We have been spending much of our time at the beach and at the pool teaching Xman about sand-walking, seagull chasing, and blowing bubbles in the kiddie pool. I have been taking lots of family pictures just like every boring grandparent that you meet.We drove to Savannah for my daughter's birthday dinner last night and spent a LOT of money, but I was trying to reward her for being such a good mother. It took almost an hour to get there and she seemed to have had a wonderful time. We did a little walking around the waterfront and the town squares with the big trees and historic statues. It is very Southern and slow and gentile. Think \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil\" with fewer exotic characters.Hubby and daughter and son-in-law have headed for the driving range this morning before an afternoon storm and I am baby-sitting watching my Xman learn about sliding doors, reading a book to himself and playing a music machine. He is very good at entertaining himself when his tummy is full.We are going shopping this afternoon, which is definitely not a hubby thing, but definitely a daughter/husband thing. Thus far it has been a good and not too stressful vacation...not like those where everyone is trying to please everyone else and in general having a miserable time!It is hard for me to believe that sometime in the future I will have free time like this for as far out as the eye can see. I have lots of things that I want to do, but it still a little intimidating. It is almost as if I MUST enjoy myself in retirement and that is a big order. I think subconsciously I may thing I will fail---if one can fail at retirement?"},

We also plan on biking and are trying to take 4 bikes, and my husband and son-in-law need to pack tennis and golf gear and my husband has his canoe and fishing gear!! We must also have food and drinks in the car as we will be driving almost the whole day. Later this morning the others get to add the baby gear which is an apartment of stuff in itself.We packed board games and rain gear and...oh well crammin' the stuff in.All I can say it we better darn well have fun!

Besides, I don't think my brain holds 13 things at one time, nor would I be willing to do this every Thursday! But today I have a bunch of random thoughts and thought that they would make a good Thursday post.   I changed to a spring purse today and realize everytime I do this, I am carrying more stuff than I need...maybe. It is 'old lady' stuff and would never fit into a model's pencil slim purse. I need a compact magnifying tool for reading menus under candle light, a small container of Aleve (which I have yet to use) just in case I get pain during the movie or whatever after sitting for so long, a compact umbrella, four sets of keys (my car(s), my apartment, my daughters apartment, my office,) plus a key ring with all those stupid barcode cards that you scan when you shop at a particular store. Then all the other stuff like wallet, checkbook, just enough make-up, brush, tissue, a container for all credit cards, business cards, train cards, breath mints. OK ENOUGH about the contents of a lady's purse.I got these in the mail yesterday and didn't have time to look at them until tonight.  Hedwig has her bird books and I have my house books. I will start on them when I am finished with this blog and I am so excited I may not pour a glass of wine first. (Who do I think I am kidding?)   Ronnie received a lot of birthday wishes and one contained a funny video (staged or real--hard to tell) about a little old lady with a cane trying to cross at an intersection while a sportscar driver at the stopsign keeps honking to get her to move faster. Finally in anger and frustation, she hits the front fender of the car with her large bag and she continues to slowly cross;  the drivers air bag goes off sending white powder into the air with a surprised driver watching her continue to cross the street at her pace. (Some of you have probably seen this humorous video.) BUT have you heard this news which I saw on our network news last night?! This is no longer funny for those of us who know that aging bodies DO belie what we think we can do! To say nothing of the importance of SLOWING DOWN WORLD.Why does the builder's brother always call my husband before he calls me? A little intimidated by an intelligent woman with a mind of her own, perhaps? Or is my husband more easygoing and willing to cave when difficult decisions have to be made?My son seems to have gotten back together with his old and primary girlfriend. This is a big deal to his parents if not much significance to bloggers everywhere. She came to Xman's birthday and I tried to be as casual as I could when talking to her.   Looking forward to our vacation at the beach the end of April and first week of May. This is a vacation with our kids who will overlap somewhat but not be there at the same time. This is the first time we have done something like this...hope it works.   I wonder how many folks were \"taken aback\" by the reptile photos in the previous post?  Peruby let me know she had misgivings.  While I do not love snakes I am fascinated by them, as I am by all living things.    SEE I made it to eight...more than half way there.  Does this mean I have half the brain of the 13 Thursday  bloggers?"},

She stayed with friends in Virginia (near 'Scooter' L's house) so you know it was in a nicer neighborhood than our apartment could provide. But, she did spend two whole days with us and we had fun catching up and gossiping. We drove down to the house and saw the finished retaining walls. I think they look a little scary and I am totally amazed that the county does not require a fence on that last wall. I am planning on planting a lot of ornamental grass for soft landings everywhere. I also think a gate might be needed. Of course, we had to look at the baby oysters and determine how they were doing. This is our second crop and should be harvestable this winter. Wind was blowing like crazy and pretty cold.We then took her on a two mile hike into a nearby beach. Wind wasn't blowing behind the dunes and the weather was a perfect spring day for this long walk. We interrupted reptiles trying to thaw in the sun and actually they totally ignored us.I should save the photo of the swamp below for another blog post as it certainly lends itself to some type of comment on life, but I wanted to share it now.  It kind of makes me dizzy just looking at it."},

I can't remember if I commented on this. (I HATE this forgetfulness that took the place of wherever I lost those hormones.) Anyway, my daughter is decorating, bought four little baseball costumes, is making baseball cupcakes...the whole nine yards. I am certain she spent well over $200 for this event. But I also went a little crazy with the gifts when I got into the baby store, so I cannot point the finger. I keep telling myself I am going to be a responsible grandmother, and then I see this cute outfit or that mind-expanding toy and end up with an armful of stuff.Hubby is flying in from Korea at 1:00 and should be in unusual form for the event. I just have to keep him awake until I get him back here at the apartment after the cake and frosting distribution. My baby sister (my last remaining sister) flew in yesterday to see some friends and we are getting together tomorrow for a trip to the new house site and some bonding time and then we are going to an art museum on Monday.

I guess I do not need to worry about tending a garden this spring.Below I share with you some of the fever of spring and I hope it is contageous.I am big on fungus and drive my husband crazy when I stop and take fungus pictures. I think I like them because they hold still and you can get a good picture. The tree above was covered.This fungus is particularly lovely and my favorite picture of the day.This is the tree in full and you can see it was covered with fungus.I think this is an anemone buttercup but am open to any botanical corrections.We saw only two of these trees pictured above blooming in the depth of the forest under some pretty large oaks and beech trees. I have no idea what they are. Can anyone help? They didn't look like a dogwood and it is too early for dogwood blossoms. The flowers were about the size of a quarter and the tree was very sparce and not too tall. I couldn't detect a fragrance.Here are some lovely Scylla and to think that I used to buy these bulbs by the dozens and plant them under my trees at the old house. Here at my feet there was a small field of them for free and in several shades of blue.Well, enough fever.  I will go get something cold to drink."},

Warblers were taking up the lyrical medley, cardinals then hit the high notes, and blue jays added the percussive rhythm.   Organic smells from the freshly excavated earth in the front yard mixed oddly with the greenness of the spring air.   Water across the bridge from the boat reflected only a gray glassy surface broken suddenly by a rarely seen speeding river otter who emerged for a few seconds to exhale and inhale, and then twisting snake-like, darted beneath the surface of the water and into a large pipe under the road.The open window upstairs framed a perfect view of the finger of water that joined the river to the west."},
{"title": "Another Milestone?  What Number is That Now?", "date": "Saturday, March 25, 2006", "text": "Another milestone?  Pretty soon my backyard will be full of them.A week from this coming Monday is my husband's last day at work. He is retiring after 38 some years doing the science that he so loves. He has been talking about retirement for years and each year he got closer to naming a date and finally this past winter he put a number on the deadline. Work at his office has become more and more about process and bureaucracy and less and less about science and making things happen for people, so he knows it is the right time.He has actually helped create a couple of millionaires in his field of interest this past few years. (He was the one that helped guide their research and provided the handholding for their partnerships and worked them through the maze of government regulations and processes. I remember the hours on the phone, that few government bureaucrats would have devoted.) And a few decades ago we would have been envious of their millionaire status, but interestingly today, as we look back on our lives, we are just happy for them and he looks on it as one of his accomplishments. This is another milestone for us in maturity.My husband has had a few shock moments still where he is amazed that he is actually retiring. Like most men and a few women, his image and self-worth is all tied up in his career and the job description. So, this transition will be somewhat painful. He is trying to line up a few consulting jobs and he will be back to the same office working half-time as a contractor this summer. He is smart in doing this in stages, although he says he is continuing with a contract just to keep me company until I retire in a year or two.He also got a scare last week with his prostate test and it looks like he may have prostate cancer. This is naturally a scare at a time when he was hoping to adjust to a new way of living. We have a few acquaintances that also are fighting this battle. If a man lives long enough, this gland seems to want to fail. My Dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer about ten years ago and they decided to do nothing about it. He is still alive and doing very well for someone 92! We have a close friend that was diagnosed with this about 6 years ago and kept telling us he was preparing to die. He went through some painful surgery and chemotherapy, but he is still here and looks great, if still a bit of a hypochondriac.I am worried, naturally, but more about the types of treatment and what they may do to my husband. I am not worried about him dying. Maybe I am very naive. We will know more in the coming weeks after he visits the specialist.It is sort of strange, because as we got closer to finishing and enjoying this new house I was feeling guilty. Guilty that we are so blessed and wondering if somehow we were going to get our share of pain soon."},
{"title": "The special lunch", "date": "Friday, March 24, 2006", "text": "We met at noon downtown near the hotels and restaurants. I was the first to get there. The weather was cold but the wind was gentle. Sidewalks were busy with all the city people trying to squeeze in a lunch. Several well dressed gay guys were hanging out near the bike rack. Then I saw my son all dressed in black with a blue undershirt. He looked very handsome, but then I am related to him so may be prejudiced somewhat. He looked a little tired but he kissed me and gave me a big hug. We chatted for a while about his work which was going reasonably well. His management is manipulative and insecure and at least he sees through that. He likes his work and his band seems to be getting some play dates at least. He is carrying too much debt with his condo which he insisted on purchasing in the hot part of the city, and that concerns me. We don’t have the money to help him out.My daughter had called earlier to tell me that Xman was sick and she wasn’t going into work and therefore not joining us for lunch. Then she called back and decided he wasn’t all that sick and so she brought him. She was her high energy confident self and Xman was a little under the weather and spent most of the lunch chewing on cheerios and watching us.We ate in a little hole-in-the-wall bar down under the street because all the main restaurants had long lines of people waiting as they had just escaped from conference meetings. The lunch was quick but not rushed and the food was OK. I just sat and watched all of my favorite people interacting. My son and daughter are now adults talking about adult things; they were not teasing or taunting as they had done just a few years earlier. Time changes everything somewhat.I have been super busy this week and don't even have time to think of something to post.  I have been in meetings of one kind or another all week long and will look so forward to heading home this afternoon.Actually I am also looking forward to noon today.  I have a meeting downtown near where my daughter works, and she and I have planned meeting for lunch.  To make the lunch even more appetizing I finally got my son to call me back two nights ago(by using his best friend as a go between!) and he is going to join us also!This is such a precious little lunch as I am old enough to know the real value of time with those you love!"},
{"title": "Stop the World I Want to Get Off", "date": "Thursday, March 16, 2006", "text": "I am on a rant today.  What set me off was a traffic light, a new traffic light that was installed to allow pedestrians to cross safely on a very busy road outside my office (cubicle if you really want the picture-perfect version.) This section of the road is very busy with buses, cars, and pedestrians leaving several high rise office buildings to cross to the small shopping center that has restaurants, a nail place, a hair place, a coffee shop, a cleaners, a drug store, a bank and a supermarket, just the kind of place that busy people might want to get to during their mid-day escapes from the office. Using the crosswalk was a dangerous game and several people had actually been hit by cars.There never was a light until last year when they put up a caution signal light and a sign that said “Pedestrian Crossing.” On occasion a motorcycle cop would hide behind the shopping center sign to catch cars that didn’t slow and let pedestrians cross.This didn’t work. There were still close calls, several even I experienced. The trouble was partially that pedestrians would not check the light down the way for the major intersection and they would cross whenever they felt like it, forcing a car to stop for them and then miss the green light at the big intersection. Part of it was the drivers on the opposite side of the road that were racing up the hill and just wanted to get by while you waited in the MIDDLE of the street.Well, early this week we got a real light, a push button to cross, a ticking timing bell, and a voice that says you can now cross. Well, people are still crossing without the light, drivers are still trying to beat the light change, and I almost was hit by a stupid middle-aged white guy at lunch!I have way too many things to worry about more than crossing the street! There is mad cow disease to my south forcing me to give up hamburgers indefinitely, as well as PCBs and mercury making me question both my salmon consumption AND my Omega 3 capsules,I have to worry about my identity being stolen on the Internet to say nothing of my concern hoping that my employer doesn’t find my blog. I am worried that I will not get any Social Security when I retire. I am worried that the stock market will collapse under this crazy administration spending which has no regard for the country and I will have to work until Hell freezes over.Even though my new retirement house sits about 20 feet above the water level, I have been told by scientists that the water is rising and the icecaps are melting. I also have to worry about Lyme’s disease (which I already contracted once) as we attempt to clear out all of the deadwood in the area near the new house in order to avoid any fire hazards from the increased lightning due to global climate change.I am worried about my daughter’s storm door to the front of her house which leads to a VERY busy and dangerous street and which is only seconds away if Xman hits the storm door just right while running.I am worried that my son will never have a social life since he works nights and he will never meet the right girl, I will never be allowed to enjoy his children, and he may end up depressed and a recluse. (HE NEVER ANSWERS MY CALLS OR EMAIL.)I am worried…OK, I can go on and on and on. Now I know why I have trouble sleeping nights. It is time for my Yoga tape. Breath in…breath out…Sorry, but remember this blog is my therapist sometimes."},
{"title": "Finishing the meme—job #2 and #3", "date": "Wednesday, March 15, 2006", "text": "I was tasked to list four of my jobs in a meme a while ago.  I listed #1 here. Being the anal-retentive that I am, I am doing them in chronological order; and, since I have to go into the WAAAY back machine for that, the process is a little painful.#2:  Job number two for me was the second oldest 'profession' in the world, babysitting. This is where a stressed and deluded parent hires a young, innocent, naïve, and poor girl, and pays her slave wages to watch human animals that behave like wildcats (I like the graphic on this site as it conveys the true nature of the beast)--- or like Tigger on speed.There is something about that sweet, blue-eyed child that waves to you from across the neighborhood street that changes him/her totally into another personality when they know that Mommy and Daddy are out playing for the evening. They have entered the next dimension. They seem to sense that you do not know where anything is, do not know what all of the rules are and have no qualms about loosing your dignity at any time during the evening.The greater danger in this job is that you may gain some self-confidence (actually I became addicted to having a little cash on hand) and you take on greater and larger responsibilities. One of my ‘clients’ was a family that had six children. They were age 2 up to age 9. Remember I lived in a farming community where large families were an asset. Those evenings with 6 kids were such a blur in my mind. I remember it vaguely like a terrifying roller coaster ride. I was petrified the entire time and so glad when the evening was over and I didn’t have to call an ambulance---not for them---for me. Needless to say, I was the only babysitter the parents could get!#3: My third job was a step up. I think I increased my wages to about $1.50 an hour and babysitting only paid $.50 and this third job also paid my Social Security, which as we know today is a real benefit.(!) This job required the following skill set: abilty to lift heavy weights, balance things, be speedy, have an excellent memory, ability to hear in a noisy environment, and no aversion to putting fingers in half eaten food, AND the ability to avoid dirty old men---particularly the boss. You guessed it, waitressing in a small-town diner.I hated that job because the boss always wanted to get me into the kitchen where he could tell me a dirty joke. That was when I realized that I don’t find dirty jokes funny. If my parents knew what he was like they wouldn’t have allowed me to work there that summer. But I needed the money to save for college and they were glad I had some small income. Fortunately he kept his hands to himself. I was such a schmuck in those days.Well, next blog will be job #4 and the last of the this meme.(Addendum:  When I was 11 my mother gave me another sister and when I was twelve I got another brother...therefore, since I clearly had inside experience, I was pretty much in demand during my teen years.)"},

Xman and I played a little ball, played a few musical instruments, stacked some foam blocks, dropped some plastic blocks down the giraffe's neck and raced a truck, but spent most of the time exploring areas of the house that he is not allowed to explore! He does know what ‘no’ means, but it requires physical re-direction to get him off of the track. He also is now the age where he is not afraid to protest/wail when re-directed.I discovered when it was my job to feed him that, unlike many of us, dinner is not necessarily the favorite part of his day. He is intrigued by the way the belt connects and disconnects on his high chair, and he likes to chase the cheerios across the tray, but he is only mildly interested in the colorful puree in the plastic spoon. I have learned that if you keep up a quick and steady pattern of moving the spoon into the mouth as soon as it opens, you can cram about six to ten spoonfuls down before he is finished. I have to watch carefully on the timing of this, as he begins the head swaying (i.e. Stevie Wonder) and arm flailing which leads, of course, to blobs of food on the walls, the floor, him and me.After the meal he gets to play a little longer while I clean up his mess and then attempt to eat a quick sandwich for dinner. (This sandwich eating is interrupted numerous times.)Then it is bath time--his. Anyone who has bathed an 11-month-old will shudder involuntarily when they think of their experience. Trying to get him undressed, away from the floor heater, the bottle of baby soap on the edge of the tub, the toilet and my watch which rests on the edge of the counter all while I sit on my knees in this tiny bathroom is the first challenge. Then I realized that I should have started the tub water in the beginning, so I had to keep him entertained with “Ducky” while I tried to fill the tub. I filled it just a hair too warm (it felt COLD to me) because he wouldn’t sit until I had added more cold water and it was then tepid like a tea cup that had been left out for a (long) while.Finally, he sits and plays with toys while I try to soap and rinse him. That is when he discovers the pink bar of soap on the tray above his head and stands precariously on tip toes while reaching for it. He knocks it into the tub and then sits back down to retrieve it. It slides under his leg, and I sneakily remove it from behind him and put it back up into the soap dish. I am so pleased that I have pulled one over on him and then I discover why it was so easy. While looking for the soap he has discovered that little bobbing appendage between his legs. He tries to grab it and playing with it occupies his time for another five minutes.Finally it is time to drain the tub and dry him off. I grab the warm wet mass and wrap him in a towel without getting me too wet. I actually am able to hold him and stand up from a kneeling position at the same time, Yay!Then we head into the bedroom where an attempt is made to dry him completely. This is like trying to wipe a doll while it is in the spin cycle of your dryer. I then apply lotion and diaper cream. If you have not greased a squirming baby and then tried to diaper and dress him, you have not faced one of life’s most interesting challenges. Each appendage is flailing and swinging like the legs of beetle on its back. And each of those appendages is slicker than butter on a pre-basted turkey—except this analogy has gaps because the turkey isn’t moving, at least MY turkeys don't move.In what seems an endless series of almosts as I grab and lose one arm and then one leg, he is finally in the diaper and in the pajamas and the hair is combed (sort of)We read a story together about colors, but he is more interested in turning the pages—back and forth and back and forth. After ten minutes, I admit defeat realizing we are never getting to the end of this book much less read it in any chronological order. I put it aside and grab the bottle.He attacks his bedtime bottle like a drunken sailor and when finished he immediately goes to sleep with the finality of a light switch being turned off--- no guilt, no regrets, just down until the next day's adventure.Then, I headed for that glass of wine."},

This was followed by an amaryllis. My last gift is the fragrant and fragile looking Lily-of-the-Valley. I love all three plants, but being the garderner that I am, when I looked at the catalog and saw what she paid...she paid way too much. As some of you may know, amaryllis are easy to propagate and grow. The LTV is a little plant that takes off if planted in a moist and shady wooded area. The orchid was the only exotic one and as Hoss said, I will probably kill it. In spite of the cost, they have been a bright addition to my kitchen table."},

His song was full of bird passion. He was clearly looking for that someone special, calling in that cavalier way that identifies the single male. Those clear notes against the increasing murmur of the morning city noises told me that spring was on its way! Hurray!"},

It is impossible to get through life without scars and this is the farewell to winter.This is a photo from the recent Las Vegas trip where I took a brief hike with friends in the desert on the last day.  The person in the foreground is 85-years-old and such an inspiration to someone just a few months away from 60!At the boatyard, this little skiff hidden in the vines and weeds seemed to be calling to me.  \"Spring is almost here, let me out, let me out!\""},

I know that no one out there is interested because we all have our problems but….sigh.I did blog briefly about this a while back.  I had lost my program budget last year and yet still had to play nice with the people who had a budget in the partnership part of the program.  Well, the good news is that I got my budget back, but the warning “Be careful what you wish for” has new meaning for me.I submitted an annual operating plan AOP (bureaucratic speak for ‘What are you going to do if we give you some money and how will you measure your accomplishments in concrete terms?’) in November.  I never got any feedback on that AOP and yet 60 days later I was notified that I got the budget I requested.  Now, I don’t think I am crazy when I say that I logically assumed the activities and goals in my AOP were what I was going to work on implementing.  Right? As the past three months have transpired, I have been thwarted at every level in doing this.  How?  1) 50% of what I do has been assigned and TAKEN OVER by someone else.  She is very smooth about consulting me, but she has been given permission by the money people to run the show and she has reduced my role to baby steps.  2) 20% of what I do (outreach) has been put on hold until we are ‘ready’ to move forward.  We are not going to be ready in this area any time soon as anal retentiveness is this groups claim to fame.  3)  20% more of what I do is being continued because it involves international relationships, but I have been told that the leadership has no, zero, zilch, nada interest in pursuing this part of the program any more.  4) 10% of what I do is based my own creative efforts and with the approval of my immediate supervisor.  This is what I have been filling my days with, along with participating more fully in professional projects of my colleagues.I will not be fired if I don’t get anything done in my AOP nor will I be reprimanded as my boss can find many ways to use the money.  I won’t get a raise or any rewards, though.  Why did they give me this budget?  I think it was all political to show that they play nice with all the divisions.  This group is big on showing TEAM efforts.  It would have taken real guts to tell me to go suck an egg.Even though I have been around the block a few times, it does make me feel as if I have lost any competence I may have had.  It makes me feel as if any past work I did was not really worthwhile or significant.  I intellectually know this cannot be the case, because I have been evaluated well and even gotten an award two years ago.  But this is a really crappy way to move toward retirement."},

{"title": "Busy Sunday", "date": "Thursday, February 23, 2006", "text": "I forgot to mention how busy I was on Sunday afternoon. Daughter, Hubby and Son-in-Law worked on locks for the kitchen cabinets and hung a flat screen TV in the basement. I got to play \"Catch me if you can!\"There is some kind of meme going around, with one of the questions being your first four jobs. Well, no one tagged me, but I thought I would tell you about my First Job:Colorado summers, while lasting less than three months, were really wonderful in late 1958. The air that raced across the spring snow melt of the Rocky Mountains before crossing our farm at the foothills was crisp and fresh. People would have laughed at you if you had asked about air-conditioning. What for? The ten days of hot weather each year? Most Coloradoans didn't even know what air-conditioning was, including me. Those that knew about it were too Puritanical to consider it anything but a sin. In 1958 the skies were blue and the mountains a crisply dark blue/gray (none of that crappy pollution that hangs on the front range these days). Working outdoors was great.I had just moved to a small farm the fall before and had just finished my first year in the new Junior High School. I was skinny, flat-chested, and pretty smart. I was also an obedient daughter and knew that I had to comply when my father gave me my first summer job. I 'think' he paid me, but since I can't remember an amount, probably not. My family was not into that remuneration thing and money was scarce anyway. It was just assumed you would work in the summer around the house. After all, you were free all day,... duh!Dad had planted a crop of wheat, ...wait, maybe it was corn, or ... (?) well I WAS only 12 so who knows what the heck he was growing. Anyway, we were under the old system of irrigation ditches. The ditches were about 2 feet deep and three feet wide.  The ditch ran through the center of town and then was diverted by a canal system to whichever farmer ordered it. Our farm was just outside of town. We actually had what were called water rights that came with the land, and therefore, got a subscription of so many gallons through the summer months. (Water rights in the West are a whole book these days.) If anyone tried to steal the water, it became evident fairly soon because Colorado is very dry and you can pretty well determine where the water goes and where it is not going. My Dad's biggest problem was the \"city\" kids that played in the ditch in town and caused a back up and overflow into the main street when they filled the ditch with their toys and other stuff. When the water got too low, we knew we had to 'ride the ditch' and find out what was blocking the water. My Dad actually had a full-time construction job, so farming was a second career. These were the good old days.Now to my job. That summer Dad explained that I was responsible to run the dams. Irrigation dams are exactly what they sound like. They are a rubber (or heavy canvas) sheet attached to a heavy wood bar across the top. You set up a new dam in the dry part of the ditch beyond where the water had been soaking. You place the wooden beam across the top of the ditch and the rubber sheet carefully across the bottom of the ditch using a shovel to cover every edge with soil to block the water flow. After everything is packed in place you go to the dam that is currently stopping the water and release it.This sounds easy, but it means you get down on your knees in the muddy water and remove the packed soil and then jerking and dragging pull up the heavy dam and place it to the side further up the dry part of the ditch. Since I weighed around 60-70 pounds, this probably looked really funny to an outsider. The water then flows and fills the new part of the ditch. You wait until it reaches the edge of the dry field and then you make sure that all the little valleys in rows between the crop lines are clear and that the water is making it all the way to the end of the acreage. This can take a long time.  I remember one-inch cracks in the soil that went all the way to the devil's penthouse apartment as water disappeared for what seemed forever in a noisy waterfall before finally filling and continuing on down the field. When all looked good, I got about an hour break.I ran to the farmhouse, washed off my feet, got something cold to drink, set a timer, and plopped down in front of the TV and watched \"General Hospital\" or \"Dark Shadows\" which were THE soap operas for kids my age those days. Once the timer went off I had to go back out and do the process all over again. The water stopped flowing about dinner time and started all over again the next day. This went on for a week.I hated it because it tied me down, but I also liked it because of the way it interacted with nature. Water making insects scurry for cover, encouraging the birds, and capturing catfish in the ditch.  I also loved just being in the great outdoors away from Mom's boring house chores. I was a Tomboy and really liked doing stuff outside. My First Job."},
{"title": "Strange Food", "date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2006", "text": "I sometimes think I could live very well on another planet. There are many ways in which I do not understand my species. There are a number of reasons why my personality is much more stable when I am alone in the woods facing wild plants and animals. This following example is one reason I am confused these days:Our office has a kitchen with a refrigerator, a sink and a microwave oven. Staff use the refrigerator to keep their breakfast and lunch food and the refrigerator is also used when we are planning a party for some reason or another. Fairly traditional stuff, right?When I first came to work here I got a key to the kitchen. Yes, we keep it locked. When I asked why, I was told that food frequently disappeared, and so several years ago, they requested from the landlord that we get a lock.Guess what? Food still disappears on a regular basis. There is no pattern. It doesn’t always happen overnight so we can’t blame the guards. It happens within the morning hours…sometimes. People will discover their lunch is gone. Sometimes just part of their lunch is missing! I have found my lunch missing a few times.  Once before a staff birthday party all of the strawberries, whipped cream, and shortcake that were brought in that morning had disappeared by early afternoon.I used to think it was that weird Hindu man that spent his work hours developing a religious web site instead of doing the job he was hired to do. Well, he was fired several years ago and the food continues to disappear!The kitchen is used by at least 20 staff, so it would be hard to find out if it is any one of them. The kitchen is also around a corner and down the hall, so it is not easy to watch. One of my colleagues said that it was probably a kleptomania problem since all of us are paid well enough to afford food. I had never thought of this. It is creepy thinking that one of the people I work with has a psychological problem like this. Most of these people are professionals and there is a broad salary range. Bizarre.I am tempted to buy this, but probably won’t.   It would end up being a joke instead of a solution to the problem.Counting the days, months and years until retirement.(By the way did you see that Kimmie and Sasha?  Wow.   You go girls!)"},

My daughter had been on a three-day business trip and my son-in-law had been in charge of Xman during that time.  His parents came down and spelled him over the weekend but had to return mid-afternoon on Sunday.  We agreed to give him a baby break for the Superbowl and planned to arrive early Sunday afternoon.  I could baby-sit while he and my hubby watched the game.  My daughter was due to fly in around 5:30 PM and hoped to be home near the kick-off time.Well, my son-in-law also invited one of his best friends with wife and 6-month-old baby girl.  He also invited a friend from work with his wife and their 8-month-old baby boy.  Are you getting the picture?  No?  Let me paint it a little more clearly.The living room of this house is about 12 feet by 15 feet.  It has one of those large modular furniture units that fit in a corner with a matching lounge unit against an opposite wall.  The TV is one of those 4 foot high projection units taking up a large part of another corner near the fireplace.  There is a cage (moveable play pen that I bought in desperation to save my grandson from untimely death by falling down stairs) that takes up about 40% of the remaining floor space in the living room.Ok, here we go.  Eight adults and three babies; two of the babies are mobile; Xman is not only mobile these days, he is fast as a snake and just as hard to grab.Half filled beer bottles get placed randomly on the floor near the furniture and grabbed by other people as crawling infants head that way.  The bottles were placed elsewhere just as randomly.  I don’t think anyone knew that they hadn’t drunk out of the same bottle all evening!  What little that could be seen of the game was interspersed with son-in-law dashing back and forth from the kitchen with snacks from the oven and other food and drinks.  (Frozen taquitos only hit the kitchen floor once, but that was before going in the oven, so they could still be served.) The two other young fathers spent part of their time changing diapers and part marking statistics on a paper chart to see who got ‘points’ or not.  These guys had worked out a point schedule for who guessed whether the first toss would be heads or tails, who guessed when the first beer commercial would air, which team got the first foul, etc.  The three young mothers were socializing amid the babble and comparing notes on feeding habits and diaper size and bowel movements (of the babies) while mixing baby food.  The noise level was pretty high and only increased when the little girl angel began shrieking like a jungle rooster and then grinning at the decibel level she had achieved.  I swear she broke a beer bottle at one point.Before we left our apartment in the early afternoon, I had asked my husband if we could possible come back to the apartment at half time instead of staying until the end.  He was concerned that he needed ‘bonding’ time with his son-in-law and wanted to stay until the final score.  Well, he was more than ready to head home at the half-time as was I!"},

{"title": "The Secret of My Success", "date": "Wednesday, February 01, 2006", "text": "I am so lucky and not for the reasons that one might think.  Yes, I am building a nice custom house, and yes, I can afford it, if I work a few years longer than I want to before retiring. I am fortunate that I am able to build within an hour or so of where my two children live, although some might think this is not a fortunate thing. I have been able to afford a choice piece of land, although this nest egg came about by having lived overseas for years in free housing that had intermittent electricity and water and no security (another life story) and lots of isolation—one must make sacrifices.So, why do I think I am lucky? I am about 75% through the building of this house and my husband has not killed me. That’s why. I have not been the easiest person to live with while sharing the process of building a house. Lord knows I am not an easy person to live with, anyway. Put me under time stress and financial stress and I can become a freakish witch. I get short-tempered, demanding, and loud. (Don’t I sound like someone you want to live with?)For example, at a recent visit to the electrical showroom, I said to my husband, “You pick out the fixture for the foyer because you really are into that and I will look for the lighting over the kitchen island.” We go our separate ways in this large showroom with heat from 1,000s of watts beating down on us and alarm rising in our hearts from visualizing so many choices. In ten minutes, hubby returns with a suggestion of a copper fixture. I roll my eyes. “Copper?” I ask incredulously and not necessarily lowering my voice. “What are you thinking? We don’t have any copper at all in the house anywhere. Get something that fits with the house! You know, European, Old World or traditional.” He wanders off in another direction with the patience of Job and probably having no idea what he is looking for.He returns with another suggestion which I completely reject since it would look nice in a ranch bunk-house but not a house-house. Finally, the third selection he points out is close enough to fly and we go over it and then select a different finish. Any other guy would have headed off for the football game long before this time and said, “You pick it! I clearly can’t find anything that you like.  Besides, I don’t know anything about this stuff!”Now multiply this scenario by the 100s and you get the idea.I am also very lucky because my husband does not have a lot of definite opinions on color, style or décor. He stops me from going down a path of no return, yet is patient bringing me back from burnout, and still remains so easygoing. I am SO particular about STUFF. And because I am particular I can work myself into a panic trying to make sure I got the exact color or item from 1,000s of choices. I have a reasonable sense of style, but am not a decorator.Well, enough about hubby, and no, I do not let him read my blog. and, yes, I guess I will tell him how much I appreciate him when he gets home tonight before I go into another house tirade."},

{"title": "Familiarity Breeds Contempt", "date": "Wednesday, January 25, 2006", "text": "According to Bartlebys , the phrase 'familiarity breeds contempt’ means: “The better we know people, the more likely we are to find fault with them.” It seems the quote originally came from Mark Twain. “Familiarity breeds contempt. How accurate that is. The reason we hold truth in such respect is because we have so little opportunity to get familiar with it.” (I love Mark Twain!)So, why am I writing on this subject? Well, pull up a chair and I will elaborate. I got an email from my sister last week. Dee wanted to know when a certain art exhibit was going to be in my town and how hard it would be to get in and see it. She makes 6 figures and flying halfway across country is not an expensive proposition for her. She is not a rich snob, but when she wants something she goes for it. But there was also something else in her email. She currently has my middle brother and his wife as ‘guests’ at her house and she said she was going crazy and she wanted to warn me about planning for their visit out my way. Was she getting a little too familiar? Getting a little contempt thing going?Here is the back story about my siblings. About a decade ago my middle brother, whom we shall call Lem, was unmarried and in his 40’s. Lem and my sister were the best of camping and hiking buddies at that time. Dee was married but her husband was on travel 80% of the time. These two siblings of mine worked together on house repair projects, went on skiing trips and camping adventures and prepared massive feasts with original recipes for all the local relatives. It seemed to me that they spent most weekends together.At 51 Lem married, for the first time in his life, a lovely woman who had been married once before. This gal whom we will call Annie originally came over from Europe as a teenager and was a teacher at my brother's school. She is very outgoing, high energy, and tends to ‘get involved’ in your activities. She is a ‘do-gooder’ liberal who is now retired and she is the one who organized the recent 4-month volunteer adventure with my brother in Madagascar that I mentioned in a prior blog. As part of this travel adventure, they had rented out their house in Colorado for 12 months. While they have many travels and activities planned for the next 6 months, they have to stay with my sister and also my other youngest brother for at least 3.5 of the weeks this winter (along with crashing at other homes). They are hoping to also come out and visit us during their house rental hiatus in the Spring (should I be concerned?). I welcomed them with open arms, even though we will be between a tiny apartment and a newly finished house.According to Dee’s recent email, she is ready to kill them (note she is not planning on killing herself). Dee is a strong but normal liberal--whatever in hell that is--I guess I just want you to know she isn't into wife-swapping or Bible burning.  She pretty much has her big house to herself and except for the demands of her job, she doesn’t find a need to make many compromises in her life. She has no biological children making demands on her time. She is a nice person.Much to the total surprise of my whole Democratic family, my brother Lem morphed into a conservative somewhere along the way. He is a strange conservative. He is not religious, non-militaristic, living off of a teacher’s retirement salary. I guess this bothers all of us because we wonder how in late life he married to a do-gooder liberal. He writes a conservative blog, not read by anyone, but it gets him access to the state Capital.  My brother-in-law says that Lem really hasn't thought this stuff through because he is a contradiction.I guess I wonder if the real problem lies with the fact that my brother, who used to be my sister’s best friend, is now a married person; or if it is the fact that he is a conservative; or is it the fact that Annie keeps getting involved in everyone’s business; or is it just that familiarity does breed contempt?  You can have your relatives for guests for short periods of time and as Ben Franklin said, “Guests, like fish, begin to smell after three days.”I get along with everybody in my family (she types smugly)…but then I live thousands of miles away!  Maybe that is the secret to good family relations among siblings. How long should I let them stay?"},

{"title": "Don't Drink at Work, No Matter  How Stressed You Get", "date": "Wednesday, January 18, 2006", "text": "I had one of those steadily busy days at work. Trying to catch up on email, then met with a colleague for some information on a database, then went to a demo by a vendor in the main conference room. I also had scheduled another meeting about 20 miles across the county at 1:00 PM and was planning on leaving work at 12:30 to get there in plenty of time, since I wasn't sure exactly where the meeting was.12:30 at my desk I get a phone call from the front office.\"Freight called and said they have something for you and you have to sign.\"My mind is blank as I don't remember expecting any shipment.The caller asks if they can transfer the call from the security guard down in freight and I say fine.Ok, while waiting for the return call I will give you some background. I work in a very large building in the city. This building has commercial employees and federal employees. Among the federal employees are people who are responsible for regulatory actions. I say this to let you know that any area that houses regulators is a \"hot\" site and gets top security especially after 911 and the Oklahoma bombing. Please note that I am NOT saying the building is anymore secure than your house, it just has top security procedures and staff in place to make SOMEONEs feel it is protected.The phone rings again. I answer.  A man with a thick accent tells me he has a package which I must sign for.\"You want me to come down to the loading dock?\"\"No, no.  Just got to floor 4 and go to the freight elevator there.\"\"The fourth floor?\"\"Yes.  Go down by the printing press.\"I have no idea where this is, but I do know that there is a publications office somewhere in the building---must be the fourth floor.\"Ok\" I reply and hang up.I go to the fourth floor which happens to have some offices of people I know. I ask the secretary there where the printing press is and get a blank look. I then ask about the freight elevator. She walks me there. There is NO ONE there. Just an empty hallway and NO printing press.I ask her if by any chance the 3rd floor has a printing press and she says \"maybe.\" She actually gets on the freight elevator with me, after a wait of ten minutes. I am watching the clock tick away. I get off and sure enough there is a large piece of equipment that could very well be a printing press on the inside wall. There is a large open office with desks and some people at the other side of the press. I go toward one of the staffers and ask about freight deliveries that need signatures. He says I need to go to the loading dock several floors down!I tell the secretary to go back to her office. Today is VERY COLD and WINDY so my trip back to the freight elevator and down to the loading dock is not pleasant and this freight elevator moves at a snails pace.I enter the freight elevator with two rather grubby but pleasant bears (men) whose complaints about the sound of the elevator and concern about the last time it was maintained do not help my mood. I get to the windy loading dock and a uniformed female security guard sits in a glass booth inside the archway of the dock. I ask her about a delivery.She looks at me and points to a box on the nearby chair. She then walks over to the X-ray machine and asks if I recognize the contents of the package. Chemicals?I look at the X-ray and saw what appeared to be two bottles. The light goes on in my head. I remember my daughter telling me she had given me a Christmas gift of three months to a wine club and was sending it to my place of work since I wouldn't be home to sign. I told the security guard it was wine.She looks at me and smiles. \"I will have to call my boss to see if you can take this package.\" (You know what, I am so tired I don't even react.)She makes the call to the BOSS and then says I can only take the package if I take it directly to my car. I am SOOOOO late for this meeting that I realize I will be running to my car in a very short time.\"Can I take the package upstairs to get my coat and papers,\" I ask.You readers know the answer. Of course not, those regulatory officials in my building are so on the edge they will mug me and drink both bottles before they check out for the day. We can't have alcohol anywhere near federal employees...and can you blame them? Really?I have to ride the groaning elevator all the way back up, get my coat and papers, ride back down to the dock, get the package, walk all the way around the building through the garbage and around the huge parking garage, carrying this stupid box until I reach the street and can head for my car.  All with a wind chill to die for.Any ideas about to handle this the next two months? And no, I did not open any of the bottles before my afternoon meeting, but I will definitely have a glass now and make an entry on my neglected wine blog...if I am sober enough."},
{"title": "What It Is All About--The Genetic Scream", "date": "Tuesday, January 17, 2006", "text": "Why do most of us fall in love with our grandchildren? I know some grandmothers and grandfathers find the whole experience dreadful, but for most of us, it is exactly like the first time we fell in love. We can't think straight. That face, that smell, that memory keeps creeping into our daily activities, even when we are far from the little ones. That inability not to let some sweet anecdote creep into our conversation with others is everpresent. That syrupy way we bring out each new photo or screensaver whenever we get a chance. I mean we are totally smitten. We have lost control!I am sure that it has something to do with that genetic scream...those subtle pheromones, the strangely familiar smile, the way the child handles frustration...something that reminds us of ourselves...something that reminds us of our children.Add to this the knowledge we have of time and how it flies over and above and beyond us with a fury. We have reached the age where we know what is important and what is not. We know that real pain is deep inside us and not that little superficial wound that will be forgotten shortly. We know how to savor the moments.We also probably view this as a fresh start at the end of our lives. After all, we made all the mistakes with our own children, now we can go through this passage more perfectly (we hope). We will not be judged (Ok, maybe a little by the parents---but face it, they are novices.)  We can actually freely interact and push the boundaries with this new life. We know where the edge of the envelope is. We know what will imprint and what will not.Also, we have that great motivation.  We want to be remembered.  We want eternity.  Just like that \"Fame\" song, we deep down inside want to live forever. Most of us are not going to be great writers, painters, leaders, inventors. But we hope to live forever through our children and their children in some way.I find this new passage in my life more intense than I expected.  I wish I wasn't so busy!"},

{"title": "Small Talk 2", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2006", "text": "I had a former blog entry with this same title and it was about somebody who does mostly small talk.In the musical, Music Man,   the main character provided a quote that seems to fit with the philosophy of my blog site.  See below:Harold Hill: Oh, my dear little librarian. You pile up enough tomorrows, and you'll find you are left with nothing but a lot of empty yesterdays. I don't know about you, but I'd like to make today worth remembering.In addition to this there is a little gossip song sung by the townsfolk about ‘small talk.’ Or because it is a small town more like gossip.Pick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a littleCheep cheep cheep, talk a lot, pick a little morePick a little, talk a little, pick a little, talk a littleCheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheephttp://www.guntheranderson.com/v/data/pickalit.htmI am not a fan of small talk as I have said before in this blog.  Yet, I am married to the National Award Master of Small Talk. It is his life’s blood. He cannot get on the elevator at this apartment or at work at 6:30 A.M. without starting a conversation with whomever is on the elevator with him (If no on is there I am the target.). It makes no difference if the person has or does not have coffee in his/her hand. They only need to keep their eyes open long enough to make eye contact with him. He will start a conversation on anything including the WEATHER. I, on the other hand, can sit on a plane for three hours and not have a clue about where the person sitting next to me lives or what he/she does for a living.Yesterday, the husband half of the new couple that moved in across the hall a week ago was knocking at our door. (I didn’t even know the girl across the hall had moved out!) He had talked to my husband on the elevator and wanted to know if he could listen to our bathroom fan. Sure, I get that kind of request every day(!). He is Chinese American and had a very thick accent, so it took me a while to even believe that I understood his request. It seems that his fan is so noisy he can’t sleep. But, since our fan is just as loud as his, it looks as though he will have to do something else for his problem.It’s not that I don’t like people…I mean, my god, I blog. I respond to blogs. I like to read about others everyday lives. I also am a big people watcher and find sitting at an airport that I am torn from reading my book by eavesdropping on nearby conversations or studying the people that got off the last plane. BUT, I am not a lover of small talk, especially if I will never build a relationship with the person over time. I guess that is why I like email more than a phone call. I can talk on my terms, at my length and listen to the response when I am ready. During pioneer days I would have been the perfect quiet knitter, sitting and humming near the fireplace.Yet, this is why I am so totally out of it most of the time. I am the one who would attend a meeting at a large company and find to my surprise they are downsizing, while everyone around me is sweating bullets before the boss even walks in the room. I am the one who finds out they are changing the parking fees the day they are changed.I mean, I CAN make small talk with the best of them. But the back of my mind is racing ahead thinking about the day’s upcoming schedule, or when I should leave the cocktail party and head back to my hotel room and unwind, or thinking to myself if I really want to wait in this line much longer while the stranger in front of me talks about his three-year-old’s cold.Thankfully I am married to the SMALL TALKER or all small talkers. He is the one who finds out the names of all the people on our floor and what most of them do. He is the one who finds out how many cars were broken into last week and how many were actually stolen in our apartment parking lot. He finds out who at work got inseminated without getting married before she shows. He is the one who got my son his first job because he made small talk with someone who was on a committee meeting that he attended as a fill-in for someone else.Of course, he is also charming. He has those bold blue eyes that fascinate people. You trust people with blue eyes. I on the other hand am just a normal hazel nut. Hardly the charmer. More the inquisitive-get-to-the-point type.So what is my point? I don’t know. I guess just that small talk is important and marrying somebody opposite from you can have its advantages."},

It was a good idea, this walking thing, as fresh air, people walking dogs, geese making noise as they skid across the winter water and picture taking are all therapeutic. The angle of the winter sun (at last breaking through the clouds) painted warmth into the dormant forest to give us a little hope of spring...someday...not soon.Ok, look closely at the photo above.  Guess who has the childlike enthusiasm in my family?  Certainly not stodgy old me.And of course, America ain't Italy, but it does have its lovers."},
{"title": "The Silver Lining", "date": "Sunday, January 08, 2006", "text": "I feel like the sun is finally peaking out behind the clouds. There is a breeze bringing the fresh air to my brain. My eyes are beginning to see through the fog. I actually think I am going to live once again like a normal person. There is a good side to life.During the time (12 days) that I have been sick, I dragged myself through work and through weekends and holidays. I am the kind of person that shuts down when I first get sick. In the beginning, I don't attempt to force myself through the day, but instead make tea and curl up on a bed or couch and stop moving and take Vitamin C. I don't take medication right away. After about two days of this, I start to get angry if I am not feeling better. I like to think I am in control of my body. So I get up and force myself to go through each day regardless of how I feel, trying to pretend that I am not sick. This used to work when I was younger.The last few days, I was living on wine and popcorn and chocolate. That has to be good for the immune system, right? I actually tried to eat healthy at first, but nothing tasted good.Unfortunately, as I am getting older, my metabolism is changing. I don't seem to be able to control the \"getting well\" process as I used to. I totally loose my patience and get crabby with hubby and angry with myself. I hate the gray days, and I hate being cooped up in this apartment and I tend to see all the bad things about life. If a young Latino girl is selling flowers on the corner at the stop light, I get depressed about her life and wish I was a millionaire so I could send her to English classes and then to college. If the bathtub gets stopped up (as it did this weekend with all my \"luxurious\" hair) I get immediately frustrated---as if I will never be able to take a bath again.If I am watching football (which I did a lot of this weekend and I am not a football fan) I realize what a stupid shallow game it is at which society throws so much money. Why aren't we rewarding the teachers, the pro bono lawyers, the policemen and soldiers, the nurses in the same way?Ok, enough ranting, as I said, today is finally going to be a good day. I actually feel that the germs are all dead, Dead, DEAD! I can actually think about seeing my grandson again and holding him...wait a minute, isn't that how this all started?"},

I don't feel bad all over anymore, just wake up coughing and sniffling every two to three hours. Now I know how Manababies feels. Ugh! Only I don't have any cooing and giggling to greet me awake. Just a 'harumph' from my hubby which makes me move into the living area trying to sleep on one of the two loveseats in this apartment. I jury rig a \"bed\" by removing all the back cushions from the love seat and then moving the ottoman to the bottom side as an extension. Fortunately the apartment is warm enough that just a throw is all I need for a cover. Besides when you are coughing your head off, you generate a lot of body heat.Hubby has an excellent immune system and doesn't seem to catch any of these little devil organisms. I am popping Vitamin C and drinking expectorant, but this is like crossing a sludge river very slowly--sorry for the imagery.I am feeling so guilty about my exercise routine. I didn't exercise much in Hawaii (hiking doesn't really count--no aerobics or weight lifting there--OK, I don't appreciate what you are thinking), and then when I got back, there were the holidays and somewhat fortunately the cold to keep me from eating too much. Still, no real exercise.Today I am home because I am leaving in 45 minutes to meet with my builder's interior designer/real estate saleswoman. She called me to ask if she could help with any interior selections and we worked out a mutual time to go to the flooring place to pick out the wood and tiles. (Actually the builder's show home and other sales in his subdivision are moving slowly due to the housing dip and I think she is bored, bored, bored.)So this afternoon I will add something to the house building blog. Due to wet weather, exterior stuff going VERY slowly. Interior pretty much on schedule.Well, I am starting to feel a little better as I finish this blog...maybe the computer screen has irradiated the germs!"},
{"title": "Hawaii 2006--Part II", "date": "Monday, January 02, 2006", "text": "The Rare and the Not So RareThese next Hawaiian photos were all taken on Kauai during our real vacation. The geological wonder that you see below is called the “grand canyon” of Hawaii. The story goes that Mark Twain named it the Grand Canyon of the Pacific and yet never saw it! A good writer can describe anything when hearing it through another’s words, I guess.We did quite a bit of hiking and were rewarded by far too many photos to post here. I actually ran out of memory and next time, maybe, I’ll take another chip. (While at our hotel we ran into a 40-something couple who were there celebrating the tenth anniversary of their second marriage. We were sitting with them in one of the four(!) hot tubs so we kind of had to talk. Anyway, all of the activities that this couple had done during their stay on Kauai were “awesome.” The guy had taken 500 photos and had to go out and buy another chip. He figured he would have 700 photos when he got home. But that “would be awesome.” Tabor was planning on only 300 photos for this trip and it was awesome enough for me, especially when going through all those .jpg files when I got home.)One of our early hikes was a trail around the Kalalau valley. My daughter later told me that when she went on her honeymoon there, ‘they’ told her to only hike a mile in because couples were being kidnapped in the jungle. Wish I had heard this, because we hiked about 2.5 in and then 2.5 back out. Guess they didn’t want our old tough meat. This view in the photo below is the Kalalau lookout on Kauai at the very beginning of the hike. Takes your breath away even in the photo, doesn’t it? The hike goes completely around the upper ridge and we did half of it before running out of both time and energy.This photo below was taken at the beginning of one of our horticultural tours. This gentleman’s great grandfather or grandfather(?) was the first and only doctor on the island of Kauai in the early days. He gave us our tour of one of the large botanical gardens. He wasn’t great on the botany part but pretty good on the Hawaiian folklore.The photo below contains two Brighamia insignis plants. We were told that this plant is very rare and indigenous to the island of Kauai. It grows along coastal areas and gets three to 8 feet high and has fragrant yellow flowers…such a strange and cool-looking growth. Flowers are in the photo below and did smell gently exotic.What follows is a photo of our breakfast nook in the hotel just below the TV. We usually eat breakfast of fruit and yogurt and granola that we get at the local stands or grocery stores. Then we pack fruit, cookies and maybe beef jerky or cheese for lunch. Dinner we eat at a really nice restaurant to pat ourselves on the back for saving money all day. Actually we can’t eat all that food that we would have if we ate out three times a day!We took the big splurge this trip and went on a helicopter tour over the island. While this is expensive, it is well worth the money. We went up with two other couples that appeared to be our age. When we sat at the benches at the outside porch near the airfield and were putting on our life jackets (a little orange fanny pack), the other folks greeted us and introduced themselves with the following speech from one of the men:“Hi, looks like we are going up together.  We are from Utah.  Where are you from?”We answer.“Well my wife and my two friends are from Utah. This is our second trip to Hawaii. My friend’s wife over there is the sister of our state Senator.”OK, wheels are now turning and hubby was the first to win the booby prize.“Your friend is the sister of um…Orrin Hatch?”“Yep.  She is Senator Hatch’s sister.”Since we didn’t jump up and down with excitement or grin from ear to ear, they probably figured out we were two of those damned liberal heathen democrats. Senator Hatch’s sister is a very sweet, reserved, and attractive woman, in case you want to know.We flew into the major dormant volcanic crater on the island of Kauai and were VERY lucky since all the low hanging clouds and rain were not there as usual. The pilot was actually able to fly us into the crater which has collapsed on one side.We also flew over the set of falls that were used in Jurassic park.  Recognizable, no?Below is a view of the Pali on the Northeast side of the island of Kauai. This coastline has beaches accessible only by some pretty intense hiking or by boat in the summer. During the winter months the beaches completely disappear under the tremendous and dangerous surf.These two photos show the well marked but somewhat dangerous trails which we hiked. If the roots didn’t get you, the slippery mud did. Of course, we are now older and we were amazed that the younger folks were doing this in sandles(?). Even a few guys had toddlers on their backs in backpacks. There was so much salt spray I didn’t chance getting a photo of the surf we hiked down to with my digital camera.Well, time to put away the suitcases and re-enter the world of reality. (Yes, Hag, once I get unpacked in my new house I will have to find the ‘turtles.’Aloha nui loa.First there was the lecture from Xman to keep us up to speed and then there was the race to save the food. This pretty much summed up most of the Christmas Day."},
{"title": "May You Take Next Year One Day at a Time", "date": "Saturday, December 31, 2005", "text": "Hawaii long ago lost the Polynesian Aloha that we are told is there in brochures and photos. It is a friendly but sterile place to holiday in the South Pacific. It has become the common place of beaches, surfing, shopping and fancy hotels, not much different from other vacation spots. The natural beauty of the islands is the only remnant of the original place and this is hanging on by a thread. The island of Maui retains a little of the 1960's hippie time and is the only island where you can listen to real Hawaiian music on the radio station.Our two week trip to the island of Hawaii renewed many memories as it does each time we visit. But this time, I actually tried to get Polynesia to creep back into my old soul and with a little effort it did even though we were jetsetting. We were on Oahu three days, Kauai one day, Maui one day, Hawaii (The Big Island) two days, and then our vacation actually started and we were back on Kauai for 8 whole days. This vacation was also a little different from many we have taken due to a personality change in my husband. Hubby is the kind of person who thinks vacation days should begin at 6:00 AM and go through to 10:00 PM filled to the brim with activities---it probably has something to do with getting your money's worth, but he is also the kind of person who lives life at a the 110% blowout level. This time we actually slept in until 8:00 AM most mornings and were in bed before 10:00 PM. What a REAL vacation.Ok, close your eyes and think warm ocean breezes and rustling coconut palms above your head with a gentle bubbly wave caressing the beach at your feet. Smell the plumeria blossoms in the lei on your shoulders. Maybe you can even think about my newly discovered cocktail, a Kaffir Lime Drop, just for the fun of it. (Remember I have got this thing for kaffir lime trees. I was even was able to find one in one of the botanical gardens and took the photo below. I like to think that the fruit is a lot like me() bumpy on the outside, but filled with fresh zest on the inside.)HAWAII PART IWe arrived in mid-afternoon after the 'red-eye' flight. Bofore hubby's meetings started we took a drive to the Nuuanu Pali Lookout on the island of Oahu. This is a short drive from Honolulu to the other side of the island. There is a parking lot, then a short walk to the overlook that can be seen in the lower left of the picture. This is the view from the lookout . Pali is an Hawaiian word meaning cliffs. Well, it was certainly breathtaking and always brings back the memories. On some days this view has a strong ocean breeze blowing you over back into the parking lot. A Colorado mountain girl loves her mountain views.We left the lookout and decide to get away from the crowds and hike down the abandoned paved road nearby on the back of the mountain side. Glad our timing didn't coincide with this 'little' rockfall above.This view above is from our Oahu hotel room balcony. Why a picture of an ongoing construction sight you may ask? It was taken for reasons of nostalgia and a painful realization. This site was once the location of the Tahitian Lanai Restaurant where my husband proposed to me late one night after his red-eye flight from Florida and where we had our little wedding reception the day we were married many years ago. We are now really old, having out-lived the buildings in our memories. Geeese!When I first arrived in Honolulu, many years ago during a week of job hunting, I stayed at the YWCA located on one floor of a high rise across from this park - which is part of the Fort DeRussy military R&R site. At the time I was there, Fort DeRussy was filled with soldiers from Viet Nam on R&R. I don't like to think about that. In the background in this photo are the aging YUPPIES doing some kind of tai chi or something in the park. Silly looking, I think. I have never been a group participation type person.This is a view back to our hotel area from the Ala Wai Yacht harbor in Honolulu. I also lived here on a boat, a unique catamaran, for several months during graduate school. (Another life story.) The harbor has not changed much although the water doesn't look as clean as it used to.I shopped at the Ala Moana Shopping Center the following afternoon. This is a paradise if you love to shop. It combines all the high end stores from the mainland U.S. with some of the Asian stores. I noticed that most of the woman sales clerks (which are at least partially Asian) dye their beautiful black hair a red-brown color - which is NOT flattering. My favorite Asian store was gone unfortunately.Well, our next stop was Maui for just one day.  Above a lovely view of a sunrise from our hotel on Maui.Next stop for a day and a half was on Hawaii or as it is also called, the Big Island. On the left side in this photo above, if you look closely, you will see four people. One is a photographer, another is a woman in a long white muu muu with a Bible in her hand and the other two people are a couple getting married (or renewing their vows). I accidentally encountered this ceremony walking along the beach from my hotel. I was trying to get photos of the several large turtles coming to the surface in the water. But the turtles were relating to the ceremony in some Kharmic way, and I sensed my photo was not going to happen. So, no cool photos of turtles, but I bought several wooden and glass ones to add to my collection.While on the big island we visited an acquaintance that knew a small company that raises shrimp and seahorses. We were introduced to an energetic young couple trying to start a very interesting business. The first photo is at a rock quarry with native tiny red shrimp that can just barely be seen. These are those little red shrimp that you can purchase in those 'environmental' water globes that are sold. The globe is balanced with plant life and the shrimp seems to live forever in them. The seahorses are not indigenous to Hawaii and therefore sold only on the mainland U.S. They actually have to be habituated to people so that they don't get stressed out and die and that is why they are gently handled before being sold.I will post part two of my Hawaiian adventure in few days."},

{"title": "My Hawaiian Bird Journal", "date": "Monday, December 26, 2005", "text": "Our trip in Hawaii included several hikes along the coast or over the high ridges of those jewel-purple mountains. There were many bird sightings. I wasn’t able to get pictures of all the elegant and rare birds we saw because I don’t have a telephoto on my camera (maybe this is next year’s Christmas present?). I did get some photos of the closer, more common or less shy birds.In honor of Hedwig (and all other bird and nature lovers) here are my bird photos. I also did some research on the Internet so that I can pretend I know what I am talking about. Most of the photos were taken on Kauai, the Garden Island, where more than 80 species of birds are present but some of the photos may be on other islands…I didn’t make sure to mark where pictures were taken.The state of Hawaii includes 6 major islands as well as other small ones. Therefore, this island ecology creates unique birdlife because of its isolation. According to several books and the Internet, 32 species of alien (introduced) birds, are now known to breed on Kauai where we spent most of our time. Many species have evolved in their own leisurely fashion to some 78 bird species unique to the islands in Hawaii. Resident species remain permanently in Hawaii; visiting birds regularly come to Hawaii for only part of each year crossing that vast Pacific ocean.When Polynesians first settled in Hawaii roughly 2,000 years ago (Kirch 1982) they also brought some of their favorite bird and plant species. One bird species brought by the early Polynesians still survives in Hawaii, the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus), ancestor of the domestic chicken. The Hawaiians called it moa, not related to the flightless bird in New Zealand also called moa. The Hurricane Iniki forced chicken farms to release even more domestic chickens in 1992. The island of Kauai has very few or no introduced mongoose (depending on who you talk to or what you read) and therefore, these newly released chickens seem to have proliferated more successfully on this island. Mongoose were introduced to take care of the growing rat population in the sugar cane fields, but some idiot didn’t know that mongoose are diurnal (day feeders) and rats are nocturnal (night feeders), so birds and bird eggs got a double hit. At least jungle fowl keep the insects down and make sure you don't sleep too late on the mornings of your vacation---but probably to the detriment of the island ecology overall. These chickens are EVERYWHERE!The first photo above is the view from our hotel balcony showing the jungle fowl cleaning the lawn of bugs and the other photo was taken in a parking lot near a hiking trail. In every instance children absolutely loved the chickens.Another introduced species is the Brazilian Cardinal (Paroaria coronata). The islands also have smaller numbers of the red cardinal that we know. This fellow visited a rooftop seen from a side of our hotel balcony every morning because someone threw bread to that area!! The second photo is another cardinal in a plumeria tree below our balcony.Then of course, even more adventurers landed on the islands after that first group of Polynesians. According to Robert L. Pyle of the Bishop museum (Hawaii) “16 species of birds (resident-native) have become extinct since Captain Cook's visit; 35 or more species (subfossils, probably native residents) were extinct before Captain Cook's visit; and about 150 species are alien introductions not established. Adding these to the 272 species here now constitutes about 475 species of birds known to have occurred in Hawaii.”Affecting more change were more animals being bought by Polynesians and others, animals such as pigs, dogs, cats, rats, cattle and the mongoose (which I mentioned above). This changed the fragile ecosystems, endangering many native bird populations. Most devastating of all was the destruction and loss of natural habitat when lands were converted to agriculture (sugar cane first and now other crops such as coffee and pineapple) or development (they are continuing to “pave paradise to make a parking lot.”) Today, 30 bird species are considered endangered, and one is threatened. Hawaii is noted for having large numbers of rare and endangered plant and animal species.One of my favorite birds, not a native and hardly endangered, is the Perkutut. My love for this bird comes from memories of its’ sweet gentle song which I heard each day when I lived thereas a young student. I had arrived on Oahu with little money, plans to go to graduate school, and knowledge of no one on the island (another life story someday). Each day this little bird woke me with his lovely song. This is also known as the Zebra dove, the Indonesian common name is “perkutut”, and its scientific name is Geopelia striata. It is among the smallest of the terrestrial doves, probably introduced from Asia. It is shy, and while ranging widely to look for food or escape harassment, it is not migratory and can be found everywhere in the Hawaiian islands. His head an neck are a gentle sky blue.I can’t tell if this is a Golden plover below or the lesser plover—but I am inclined to think is is the lesser plover, but I am not a bird expert. We saw a number of these on the beach, they were shy and it was hard to get a good picture. The Golden plover migrates all the way from Alaska, maybe the lesser plover does also (?), I don't know.The next photos were taken at a wildlife refuge. The interesting excavations that you see in the first photo are little bird homes we saw on the side of the hill as we walked out to the lighthouse at the Kilauea National Wildlife refuge on Kauai. If you look click on that photo and look closely at the center top hole, you can see the park service has inserted some support to help with bird home development--or maybe the building inspector was out and required more roof support? (Sorry that should go on my building blog.) These tunnels are the home of Shearwaters (see photo of sign) which nest in burrows in the soft soil of this Kilauea Point overlooking the ocean (sorry no photo of the actual bird). My husband said he can remember hearing these birds moan and groan at night when he was camping in Hawaii years ago. Great frigatebirds, brown boobies, red-tailed and white-tailed tropicbirds, and Laysan albatrosses can be seen from this point as well, but I didn’t get good pictures—just the white dots in the distance. Some of them swooped dramatically overhead catching the air currents against the side of the hill . I also tried for those photos in vain. We also saw Green sea turtles and distant humpback whales in the water.Next is this ‘evolved Canadian goose’ which was really fun for me to see. They were much rarer when I lived in Hawaii many years ago and I never saw one. The Nene (pronounced \"nay-nay\") is a land bird and a variety of goose. Because of the rough lava terrain the bird has evolved from a traditional goose by transforming its webbed feet into a claw-like shape and modifying its wing structure for shorter flights. Hunting and wild animals all but destroyed the species until they were protected by law and a restoration project was established in 1949. This is Hawaii’s state bird and is thought to be a descendant of some ancient Canadian goose that got off track, in the late 1700s. According to some research I did on the Internet, 25,000 Nene were thought to inhabit the Big Island, but by the 1950s the population had dropped to an estimated 30 birds ( I lived there in the late 60s). We talked to the ranger who said there are thousands now, but a web site states that it is estimated about 300 Nene currently survive on the Big Island, 200 on Maui, and possibly 160 on Kauai. This little family in the photo has two new ones to add to the population.The Hawaiian stilt Himantopus mexicanus knudseni called Ae`o in Hawaiian is a subspecies of the North American stilt. This stilt differs from the North American stilt in size and color by having more black on its face and neck, and a longer bill, tarsus, and tail. It is estimated there is a stable population of 1,200 to 1,600 birds with Maui and Oahu accounting for 60-70% of them. This photo was taken during a private self-directed garden tour that we took. There are several large botanical gardens on Kauai. The tours are not inexpensive, but the money goes to preservation of plant and animals and habitat.The photo below is of the ‘Alae ‘Ula or Hawaiian Gallinule (Gallinula chloropus sandvicensis). They call this a subspecies of the common moorhen. I found this fun story about this bird in the Hawaiian culture. \"It was in the days before fire was known to the people, and the gallinule took pity on them. Flying to the home of the gods (the volcanos), he stole a blazing brand and brought it back to earth. During his flight the gallinule's formerly white forehead was scorched by the volcanos' fires -- thus its name \"alae\" signifying a burnt forehead. Today all gallinules bear a red frontal shield on their heads.\" The bird builds its nest in water vegitation laying 6 to 13 eggs. This bird is fairly secretive and I felt lucky to get a picture of this group with their young fowl on edge of this dam in the garden. You will have to click on picture to see the fuzzy young one on the left hand side.I also saw one of the Hawaiian short-eared owls (Pueo) sitting on a utility line as we sped by in our rental car to the hotel, but it was impossible to get a photo. We also saw the Apapane and the Iiwi which are pretty in color (red or green), but very fast in darting about, so again, no pictures. Maybe I’ll have pictures if there is a next time. Below is a photo of their favorite tree with their red honey filled flowers up in the high misty hills of Hawaii.Next post on the plants we saw."},

By that,  I mean beginning about 20 years ago.I had small children then and these holidays came with much responsibility. I would spend the months preceding December 25th baking cookies and freezing them for later decoration. I would be making unique and quality crafted tree decorations for the church sale (one Christmas I made felt Mrs. Santas in White, Black and Asian mode even!) I hand wrote notes on about 75 Christmas cards and got them out in the mail before I got my first card from anyone! I mean it was genius.I would get the cookies thawed and decorated and take a package to each of my neighbors going door to door.I would decorate my house from rafter to front door. I gathered my own greens from my yard and wove in ribbons and decorations...I REALLY did.I would have my gifts shopped for and mailed in plenty of time to beat the long lines at the Post Office.So, I had quite a system going.

We had a 5 hour lay-over in San Francisco. Years earlier if this had happened we would have just suffered it out at the airport, but we are now older and with more discretionary income, so we took a taxi into town for a dinner at the harbor. We ate king crab, which is not that salty dried stuff you get on the East Coast. It actually tastes more like crab and your face and fingers smell fully of your gluttony when you are done. They gave us bibs with good reason. I washed very carefully knowing I would be sitting next to strangers on the long plane ride over the Pacific.I have visited San Francisco before and knew the temperatures would be mild and the culture very liberal. The mild climate meant that there were homeless or drifters in the parks, all in very good humor doing street dancing and singing and dressed most colorfully. It seems everyone in California has a talent of some kind.We encountered a 'farmers market' down near the docks. This was a little different than most farmer's markets you might be used to, because San Francisco's customers are relatively well-educated and upscale in income. So we saw stalls with fresh oysters and sushi, exotic flowers, homemade soaps and perfumed oils, unusual sauces and syrups (One sauce was a cherry jelly with chile peppers in it!), and this fruit (?) below that I had never seen before.   We bought some dried pluots (I can't remember how you spell this but it is a cross between an apricot and plum, I think. Ours were a deep burgandy red, not like the picture on the webpage linked above.) These were very tangy in their sweetness and they lasted as great snacks through a good part of our Hawaii trip. (We didn't think we had to report them to USDA upon landing in Hawaii because they only asked about \"fresh\" fruit. Anyway, if they had had bugs we ate them!)I took some photos of the lovely sailboats, one of one of the many yacht harbors and of course, the smelly, noisy seals airing their armpits as they do---see the fellow in the upper middle.As you can see, they also do Christmas in San Francisco. After our early dinner we headed back to the airport and on to Honolulu...next entry on my journey."},

{"title": "It all depends on what  IT really IS", "date": "Wednesday, November 30, 2005", "text": "By my way of thinking (and occasionally I do think before I blog) we live in a culture where the look of everything is more important than the core reality and function of the thing itself.For instance, we are told that we should exercise and eat well for good health. Yet anyone who does this and still looks chunky is not regarded as healthy by the general observer, even though their health may be better than the skinny person standing next to them who exercises rarely and eats a quick donut and coffee for breakfast. It is all about the superficial look. Not the color of the skin and the healthy glow of the hair.We envy that designer bag that is an ugly color and doesn't hold stuff very efficiently, but costs lots of money and sends the message that we are rich (and also stupid with our richness). It's not about what the bag does, but the message it sends.We buy fruit in the grocery store that no longer tastes like freshly picked fruit with the juice of its season, but tastes like cardboard fruit. BUT the appearance of the fruit is perfect in color (maybe enhanced) and certainly perfect in shape. We don't tolerate any blemishes on those perfect orbs, while sacrificing freshness. It is about how it looks, not what it is.We idolize athletes that win games and break records, yet they are running on steroids and metal pins and pain killers and braces. They are not exactly their original selves anymore.We worship entertainment icons that are usually more plastic and toxic botoxed than real---especially the women. Their talent alone is not enough to hold our interest and our honor for their hard work. They must NEVER show their real age. We are amazed that pregnant celebrities are back in shape days after giving birth while real mothers actually look like the mothers they are--which is the real parent? (Watch British television for a refreshing change in making older people the primary characters in the television stories. They appear with their weight problems, faded teeth and all and BBC casts the younger people who actually look like the real girl or boy next door!)And finally, the McMansions that we build are not to shelter our loved ones. They are hugh cavernous entities with specialized rooms that may never be used or never even furnished. It is not about the function of our dwellings anymore. A house is not a home.(By the way, talking about reality vs image, did anybody see that terrible lip synching job Mariah Carey did at the Lions vs. Atlanta Falcons football game halftime?  It all depends on what singing really is, I guess.)"},
{"title": "Mixed Thanksgiving", "date": "Sunday, November 27, 2005", "text": "I think most families find the holidays very mixed, at best. Relationships with relatives and in-laws are not perfect and so we try to be on our best behavior to make the holiday perfect. On top of that, we may see people we haven't seen in a year or more and want this time with them to be filled with the best of sharing while trying to run around and do all the other tasks at hand.As I look back over my holidays while growing up, there were days with tears, days with resentment, days with fullness of feelings to the point of exhaustion. Most of my holidays were good, a few excellent, and a few (especially during my teens and twenties) filled with foot-in-mouth disease and anger.Last week's Thanksgiving was at my daughter's. She invited the parents-in-law and my son (whom as you know I don't see often enough). The main attraction, besides football, was Xman, of course. He was on his best behavior, while being exhausted before the evening hours. My son was very affectionate to us, and both my husband and I were a little surprised at this since he is 25 and also a bit of a withdrawn person. I thought this over and think it was because he has not seen us in a little over a month, and he saw the change that age brings with time. I remember not seeing my parents for two years and flying home and feeling so shocked at the airport to see how old they had gotten while I was busy living my rich life. When you see someone weekly you don't notice these changes in them.I had to cook only the sweet potato casserole and the sausage stuffing casserole. Everything else was done by my daughter! So that made the work insignificant on my part.Another strange thing about this Thanksgiving was a call to my brother in Colorado to touch base with that side of the family. My sister and her family were there. My other brother and his wife are in Madagascar on a volunteer research project and not in attendance this year for the first time. My father has moved in with my brother in Colorado since the death of my mother this past spring, so this was the first Thanksgiving for them without my mother. I and my family played pass the phone to talk to all, except for my Dad. He wouldn't come to the phone saying he was too busy eating. I know that he wouldn't come because his hearing is so bad these days that phone conversations are very difficult for him, and this embarrasses him. He has always hated the phone, even when his hearing was fine. He will talk to my sister when she calls from Denver mid-day to check on him, but he is very comfortable with her and her voice. I am wondering if this means I may not speak to my father again before he dies...he is 91. They are talking about trying to get him out this spring to us when our new house is done. But, I know enough about life and its tweaks and turns, and that this visit may not happen.As you can see, it was a very different Thanksgiving for me this year."},

Those of you who read my posting \" Life Story #2\" may be interested in something that we received yesterday in the mail. A distant relative of my husband's was going through her mother's things and came across the letter and enclosed photo above that was taken in front of Morro Castle. The letter was written by my mother-in-law regarding the infamous Cuba trip and now at least gives me a dated reference.This photo above is just a little different than the one I posted, isn't it? The letter went on to say that Castro's two sisters who fought by his side were also at the hotel. She also wrote about the stories the Cubans told of Batista's cruelty and the details (if true--30,000 people tortured) which are just as awful as the details from Abu Graib and from Saddam's despotic rule. She wrote about a story she was told of 3 million dollars stashed in a graveyard as the revolution came down and an urn of Batista's that was filled with human eyeballs!

It was wrapped in pretty Japanese paper covering a box and then the plastic wrap which is shown and another layer of plastic covering over the actual tray of sweets.(and later...)Ok, the outside is sweet and as gelatinous smooth as it looks,  The inside is powdery and grainy, exactly like the texture of a well-cooked egg yolk.

But she has been writing about ageing for many months now and if you are younger than 50 (including you 20-somethings) and you read blogs of those 'older' you should read her most recent post linked above. It has some great insight both from Ronnie and her other bloggers about blogging relationships.I challenge those of you under 50 (or older) to post about blog friendship---not about those you know personally in your life, but about blog friends (any age) that you have made and why you think these friendships work for you at your time in life.  Leave me a comment or link to your blog, so I can read this.The blog friends that are my age inspire me, because we share common ideas, experiences and problems. I love the way we pat each other on the back and support each other as if we were old friends. I connect with those who have similar hobbies (gardening and photography, for instance) and look forward to exploring these more in-depth when I retire. I see similar challenges in our lives and this helps me focus on the big picture.My blog friends that are younger add so much to my life, since I agree with Ronnie in that we wouldn’t have such an in-depth exchanges of ideas if we were sitting together at a dinner party or luncheon. Their cell phone, children, good-looking passersby, whatever, would be a distraction and interruption. I get to give unsolicited advice (a bad habit of mine) but I also get great perspective from them, energetic ideas, and they help me remember the challenges I faced when I was their age.Blog mates that are older than me help me see what lies ahead and help me prepare for the next part of my life. They prove that while some parts of the body may be presenting new challenges, that old brain and personality can still shine through when we are not distracted by appearances. They also remind me about how healthy humor is.And finally the bloggers that I connect with that live in other countries add a tremendous new kaleidoscopic beauty to the exchange of ideas and experiences over blogdom. I get to re-visit those areas of the world I have previously seen or see these places through different eyes. I also get to take a new trip to an area of the globe and have tea in the back garden with the blogger.I guess what I love about blogging friendships the most is the opportunity to exhange ideas with the whole smorgasbord of the world. (And I love the Internet so that I can look up \"kaleidoscopic\" and \"smorgasbord\" since my poor typing can mask my terrible spelling for only so long.)"},

While I had worked in the past as a waitress, this was my first retail experience in a store working behind the register. It was a little stressful since over $100,000 crossed my register each week, and they regularly sent fake customers through the line to see how you were doing and to see if you caught one of them hiding jewelry in a winter coat pocket or some other little test. My supervisor was an attractive, petite woman a little over 60 years in age. She dressed very well, and I kept wondering why she worked there. I am now guessing her job was due to a divorce or sudden change in finances in her life. I remember her telling me that she was counting the days until she could retire. And then she wryly added, “This is kind of stupid, because my life is short enough, why do I want to wish part of it to go by faster?”Driving down to the house the other day, my husband repeated one of his mantras…something like: “I don’t want to winterize the boat just yet; I’d like to squeeze in another outing before that. I only have 20 more years of this before I am too old to get out anymore.” This statement always takes me back, because I have no idea what he is picturing in his mind twenty years from now. I also find this kind of thinking very depressing. So, I don’t even go there. I just like to live each day as fully as I can…John Lennons “Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.” approach is fine with me.Last Saturday night at my daughter’s house my son actually showed up for dinner. We hadn’t seen him in weeks. He had another cold and was low in energy. I told him he should sleep in this coming Sunday and should have slept in on Saturday so that he could repair his health instead of ‘jamming’ all day with his band. (He works nights.) He looked at me and said, “I have 52 weekends and I am not giving up anyone of them!”Well, I have to take the garbage to the apartment shoot. I am going to count the steps there and magically will that number to be the amount of millions I will win when I buy a lottery ticket this weekend which should help me extend my life."},

This is a big meeting where a huge number of scientists in lots of disciplines from Norway come to meet and exchange ideas with scientists in the U.S. At the cocktail party last night hubby was talking to one of the high level administrators who asked him, \"If there was only one day to spend in D.C. what should I see?\" The answer that hubby gave him, surprised the visitor. Hubby didn’t recommend the Air and Space Museum or the Museum of Natural History or any of the popular art galleries.Hubby said: \"Washington D.C. has much to see and it would be hard to see it all in one day. But, I would recommend the following: The Roosevelt Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial and the Lincoln Memorial. Read the words carved in granite at each of these memorials, because they reflect the important ideas on which this country was founded. These ideas are what America is really about, and we will get back on that track someday.\"Needless to say, this well-traveled Norwegian was surprised and impressed by my husband’s suggestion.  I hope he follows up.My favorite is the Roosevelt Memorial. Most people miss it because it is located at the West Basin Drive which is usually only frequented by tourists during the cherry blossom festival. This memorial covers a good amount of space with four outdoor 'rooms' or 'retreats' built from walls made of red South Dakota granite. It is a very peaceful and quiet place and creates an atmosphere where one can ponder the meanings of the words. It makes me smile to note that all of these words were written before I was born.For those of you who cannot visit D.C. the quotes from FDR are too many to post but here are a few from each room  (comments in parens after some quotes are, of course, my two cents):ROOM ONE\"No Country, however rich, can afford the waste of its human resources. Demoralization caused by vast unemployment is our greatest extravagance. Morally, it is the greatest menace to our social order.\" Second Fireside Chat on Government and Modern Capitalism, Washington, D.C., September 30, 1934. (Those who are against funding work shelters for illegal immigrants need especially to read this!)ROOM TWO\"I never forget that I live in a house owned by all the American people and that I have been given their trust.\" Fireside Chat on Economic Conditions, Washington, D.C., April 14, 1938. (Can you imagine GWB saying this instead of “I have a mandate.”?)ROOM THREE\"We have faith that future generations will know that here, in the middle of the twentieth century, there came a time when men of good will found a way to unite, and produce, and fight to destroy the forces of ignorance, and intolerance, and slavery, and war.\" Address to White House Correspondents' Association, Washington, D.C., February 12, 1943\"They (who) seek to establish systems of government based on the regimentation of all human beings by a handful of individual rulers call this a new order. It is not new and it is not order.\" Address to the Annual Dinner for White House Correspondents' Association, Washington, D.C., March 15, 1941.ROOM FOUR\"More than an end to war, we want an end to the beginnings of all wars.\" Undelivered Address prepared for Jefferson Day to be delivered April 13, 1945.Where are the descendants of Roosevelt when you need them?"},

We have never taken any wine tours or tastings and decided to hit three of the local places.Between picking up the small outboard motor, and then having to find a grocery store to triple wrap the motor in heavy duty garbage bags because of the gas fumes (which oddly enough did not bother my husband, just my daughter and I) we ended up with a late day start. You would not believe how strange we looked by the side of a country road wrapping something the size of a small child in garbage bags. I am amazed that no one called Homeland Security and that we were not pulled over later. Several cars drove by as the drivers gave us odd glances.The local wineries we visited are small places that have not yet developed a reputation. The character and flavor of the wines were as unpredictable as the weather. Sometimes we were cold and sometimes warm. The wines were sometimes fair and sometimes pretty mediocre, but we were having fun, so didn't really care. Everyone was patient and let me stop and take a few photos which I posted above."},

If and when I cool down, I may blog about it. But today I need to write about something lighter.)Like d-e-a-t-h.I was reading “WIRED” magazine, which because of its scope, one would think is primarily for geeks. “WIRED delivers the intelligence readers need on the topics that matter most: Technology and innovation. Science and medicine. Business and global politics. Arts and culture. The best new products and more.”  I mean, it does contain color pictures of Ashlee Simpson and Lindsey Lohan, BUT they are carrying Ipods or Blackberries or something like that. ANYWAY, I ramble. The article that caught my eye in the latest issue was about death. Actually not death, but what happens after death. The new technologies that have been developed are changing the way we die. I am not talking about cryopresevation. That is Old Hat.The New Hat is getting cremated and becoming jewelry. I mean if the old man didn’t buy you something nice when he was alive, he can make up for it when he dies! A company called Life gem will turn your dear ones remains into something you can wear around your neck, or over your heart, or well, you know. Certainly more practical than sitting on a mantel in a jar which you have to dust!If that seems too crass for your tastes, how about reincarnation? Sort of. You can return to earth as a tree. A group of enterprising young men are working on inserting your DNA into a live tree DNA and making magic happen. I think I would like to return as a giant sequoia or a giant banyan tree to shelter all the little critters. I do forsee issues if those that live on after you are not good plant people. I mean maybe the niece that hated you pours hot coffee on your trunk every morning. Of course, if your dog pees on you, that might be good. If you decide to be a fruit tree, would your relatives feel comfortable eating the fruit? This requires some thought.And finally for the real nature lovers who read this blog, you can have a truly ecological burial. Promessa says they have been working on this process for years. They have been studying composting and cultivation. And you will be returned as “a valuable contribution to the living earth.”Well, I couldn’t stop with just this information. I did some more Googling and found that you can give away rubber memorial bracelets at the funeral as well.  (Everyone else seems to be into this rubber bracelet thing).Enough food for thought?  I feel better already."},
{"title": "Life Story #3", "date": "Saturday, October 22, 2005", "text": "As I promised (threatened) a while back I would tell you how my first lengthy trip to Yap became dangerous.First, let me tell you a little about the island and its culture when I visited there about 35 years ago---geeze am I THAT old? Anyway, the island of Yap is part of a group of loosely federated islands in the South Pacific. During the time I was there the islands were part of a Commonwealth and under the protection of the United States. They used our mail system, our judicial systems, our airlines, etc. Their primary product was copra which is dried coconut and used to make coconut oil. They also had smidgen of tourism, mostly SCUBA divers. Since that time some of the islands groups of Micronesia have gone ‘independent’ or to other forms of affiliation with the U.S. You can go here  if you want more about that sort of thing.When we lived in Micronesia the people held some resentment toward Americans, they probably still do. There was the feeling that America was trying to be a ‘parent’ to full grown children. This resentment varied in intensity from island to island as the people were slightly different in culture and very different in language. Back in the 1970s there was only one small hotel in each of the district centers; the roads were unpaved coral fill and rutted from the increase of automobiles on the islands; there were no food stores as we know them--maybe a bread bakery; and only an open market with a small variety of vegetables being sold. The expatriates that lived on the islands imported their exotic foods from Guam. This might have added to the island resentment.Our project involved accompanying a marine biologist to the island of Yap to implement a reef survey. The growth of interest in Yap, primarily as a transit port, brought about interest in building a larger airport on the island. The island, while small, had a shallow reef area near one end that could be filled and paved for jet traffic. Yes, I know, today that sounds like using your backyard for a bathroom. But, at that time, people did not understand the rareness of these ecosystems and the importance of protecting a society’s culture. The islands were viewed as possible resources by the U.S.Our marine biologist was a 6’2” good looking hunk from the University of Hawaii. He could have been a lead in a movie. He was charming and smart. My husband, I and Leading Man landed on the island and went to the village of Colonia. We checked into the tiny hotel, changed clothes, got our snorkel gear and procured a dusty and sad-looking rental jeep. We headed out to the other side of the island to look at the reef. I was along for the ride, since I know nothing about airport engineering, marine biology or anthropology. It took us some effort to find the place as we got lost in a few villages along the way and had to ask for directions. Clearly we were a rare site as most of the locals stared at us. I have no idea if they knew why we were there or not. My husband and I were fairly new to the islands and realized later that we would have been much better off taking an elder with us on this jaunt.We had to park the jeep on the other side of a small village of about 6 grass huts and cut around the jungle to the coastal side. It was a lovely open coast and you could see the reef extend for a long way out to the ocean. We didn’t really need the snorkel gear because the water was so shallow for such a long way. I can’t remember what notes and photos Leading Man took because I was poking along the deeper side of the reef, which has always been a love of mine. After a little over an hour, our researcher was ready and we headed back to the jeep. As we crossed through the jungle and approached the grass huts a native in traditional thong and with a 6 foot fishing spear in his hand started talking loudly to us. His eyes were red and his gate with a little unsteady. We realized he was probably drunk and hurried to the jeep to avoid any confrontation. Another native approached him and appeared to be trying to calm him down. We didn’t know what they were saying, but the body language was clear. A third man joined them.We got in the open jeep, hubby in the back seat and me in the front next to Leading Man. Unfortunately we had to back up to turn into the open area leading to the rutted road. This gave the angry native time to catch up to us. As Leading Man stopped backing and turned the wheels, the man with the spear ended up within arms-length of my side of the jeep. He continued the lecturing and was working himself up into a good anger finally talking in a broken-English. He was mad we were there and clearly felt as if we had trespassed in his living room. Leading Man talked to him in English and tried apologetically to get him to calm down. Within seconds of this exchange Leading Man was reading the native’s body language expertly and managed to place his hands over the keys in the jeep ignition just as the native lunged for them across my knees. My heart was in my throat as this angry character was inches from my face. The native got the rental’s logo key chain, but not the keys, thank goodness. The situation immediately escalated and Leading Man gunned the jeep as we spun sand and headed to the road at full speed. I looked back as we hit the road and saw the native throwing his spear and missing the back of the jeep by only a few feet. Whew!Talk about needing a drink when we got back to Colonia!"},

He is a PhD researcher who is dedicated and hard working. He is also very quiet in personality. He is small in stature but has a gentleness about him that makes you think of the old fashioned word \"gentleman.\" His wife is a veterinarian and tall and statuesque. They have one of the sweetest little guys for a son. Actually, since we had dinner with them almost five years ago, this little guy is no longer a baby, but probably a schooler. I have never seen such a transformation in this quiet researcher. He actually smiles and gets excited about this son of his. Here is the news...they are still working on fixing the damage to their home from the devastating hurricane season in Florida last year. He has now lost his job. It is not clear what the issue was, because he had a 9 million dollar investor ready to put forward some research money a few years ago. Jobs for researchers at private institutions are tenuous at best. He worked there for almost 10 years. He now has a job at a local community college and is working about 50 hours a week for about $200 take home each week! This is not enough bad luck for them it appears. His wife's partner in their verterinary business has left the state after embezzling everything. The wife is being forced to sell her business to pay the remaining debt! I am sick to the pit of my stomach and keep trying to think of ways to help. I wish I had won the lottery this week.Then a few days ago L., who is the cleaning woman who works in my office, came to me with the good news that after 10 years of work and thousands of dollars in paper processing (some of which I have helped her with over time), her daughter is going to get a 6-month visa to visit the U.S. L. has not seen her daughter since she left El Salvador when her daughter was only 4 or 5. The girl is now 18! L. is so excited about this and plans to save and send her to a private school to learn English and then to college here. Such enterprising and hard working parents this young woman has. Well, with the good always comes the bad it seems. The daughter has been living with her grandmother all this time. The grandmother has all of her children here in the U.S. A few days ago (probably due to the stress of her grandchild leaving) the grandmother appears to have had a stroke and is now in the hospital. The young girl is, of course, begging her mother to let her stay in El Salvador longer so that she can take care of her grandmother. And L. is so sad that she cannot take time from work to go see her mother in the hospital. Again I wish I had won the lottery.And you think you have problems.  Sorry, better blogging next time."},
{"title": "The Reward", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2005", "text": "I made a deal with hubby that if he helped vacuum and make the bed while I cleaned the kitchen, I would reward him with a canoe trip. I tell you, one would think I had promised an afternoon of wanton sex. He was on that vacuum cleaner like a snail on lettuce and zooming around our apartment. We were spanking clean in no time and took off down one of our nearby rivers by noon. The photo above is deceptive. There were some strong gusts at times almost blowing the canoe into the weeds. We had to keep our paddles in the water much of the time, but when we were going downwind, it was a most rewarding day.Due to bird migration, many of the birds were gathering and endlessly chattering. They roosted in the trees and also on the grasses in the marsh. They were mostly redwing blackbirds shown in the first photo. They would fly overhead in the hundreds (thousands?) exploding like a fireworks display in circles or at other times undulating like a rollercoaster wave of fish schooling. We also saw a red tail hawk (I think) fly over our canoe and as you can see, I also caught an airplane. I actually didn't see the plane when I took the photo. We saw ducks, and of course, high above us, noisy geese honking.This last photo was taken as we got to the dock and were unloading the gear. It is a man and his two dogs, looking like they were having a wonderful time. Unfortunately, I think he was hunting birds since we had heard shotgun fire a little earlier in the day.. The dogs were wet -- probably from retrieving. But it was picturesque anyway and the dogs were clearly in heaven.  When the \"youngins\" were childless, they rarely spent any time at the big house. We would see them every few months. But remember I said that when your kids have kids, they sometimes become your new best friends...so don't move too far away. Here they are crammed into the small living room of the apartment. But they ARE precious."},
{"title": "Pay Your Rent!", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2005", "text": "Living in an apartment building requires some moments of compromise.  One has to accept the fact that meatloaf smells at ten in the morning can be jarring.  Popcorn smells from across the hall at 10:00 in the evening require tremendous self-control as you sit watching television just before you head to bed.  You have to accept the fact that you should not try to carry a huge basket of dirty laundry out into the hallway without checking the status of the one washer and dryer available on your floor.And finally, you must be patient with the next door neighbor whose phone ringer is set a little shrill and which seems to ring off the wall day after day.  Just because she has more friends than you is not a reason to hate her.At the end of September there were a number of yellow forms taped to the inside windows of the entry way to the foyers of the various apartment buildings.  When I went to read them, I noticed that they were eviction notices.  A few weeks later, furniture and personal belongings were placed near the street for some of these evictions.I understand that the landlord has to meet expenses and canÂt provide free housing for people, but why are they not evicting all the tenants that don't pay?  For instance, we have a tenant that lives above us.  A noisy tenant.  They (he/she) seem(s) to be moving furniture at the end of every day, are always jumping and running around, and really disturbing when eating since they eat just above our dining table.  They are pretty quiet in the daytime, but keep very late hours.  I have called the business office about this tenant months ago---and they said they would get right on it.  Well, the noise continues.  How do I know the tenant isn't paying?  One reason is that they sneak in and out instead of using the elevator.  I have never seen them.  Second reason, is that there is no apartment above our apartment.  This is the space beneath the roof of the building.   They must be very small in order to live in that three foot high space.  I want them out of here!  Dump all their nuts out on the street like they do with everyone else!"},

We both needed winter coats so went to a nearby outlet mall that had lots of choices. We brought along Xman to provide comment as well.Daughter was trying on a black wool coat and was looking in front of a full length mirror that was across the aisle from all the coats. When she went back to get another coat, I picked up Xman from the stroller and took him in front of the mirror to entertain him. I looked at him in the mirror and noticed something odd, but thought maybe it was just my old age vision. I called my daughter over and told her to look at Xman's face in the mirror and she noticed it too.His chubby round baby face looked oval and definately less chubby in the mirror. That was when we realized that we both looked so much thinner in these new winter styles than last year. We just needed to bring this mirror home with us. Sneaky store."},

I also purchased those lovely small eggplants that are always better when purchased at the Korean market for some reason.  They get sliced and pealed and then fried lightly in a corn oil with sesame oil and I make a sauce of soy, water, sugar, sesame seeds, and kaffir lime leaves chopped which I pour over the eggplant.This is dinner with a nice white wine.

{"title": "Sex in the city", "date": "Friday, October 07, 2005", "text": "It was a long late afternoon after work on Thursday that we had dedicated to food shopping. We went to the Korean Supermarket first. We hadn’t been there in months and bought such luxuries as curry mixes, kefir lime leaves and rambutan.  Then we headed to the local little market closer to the apartment that still is grandfathered to sell wine with their food in this Puritanical state. Upon our return to the apartment we had a dozen bags to haul up to the fifth floor, and we used my former MIL’s carry basket on wheels which I store in the trunk of the car—we are now officially old people as a result of this.We put all the good new food away and then decided to walk to the nearby Chinese restaurant for dinner even though astonishingly angry gray clouds were racing across the sky above. If you remember this is one of the best Chinese restaurants I have ever eaten in and it is in WALKING distance of where I now live. After our delicious meal (mine Ginger, chicken and scallions and hubby something really unhealthy and fried) we asked for a doggy box and carried the leftovers back to the apartment.Upon approaching the building from across the parking lot we heard an alarm bell. When we reached the back door of the lobby the alarm was clearly a fire alarm and we saw about 20 people standing in the driveway outside the front door of the lobby. (We had seen two police cars parked there when we arrived to take up groceries earlier and ignored them.)After talking to our apartment neighbors out the front, the result of all this activity was 1) a domestic dispute (thus the police cars) and 2) someone on the first floor baking bread and then burning it and setting off the fire alarm. The possible fire is a real issue among those who have lived here since last year, because an elderly couple died last year due to a fire in another building on this complex. Still, there are a lot more than 20 people that live in our building, so, some folks were willing to chance being fried, I guess.It was an interesting watching my husband operate as we headed through the lobby and to the outside at the front of the building. My hubby immediately chatted up the two chickies that live on our floor. One a blue-eyed blonde from Ohio and one a Philipino Hawaiian from Hawaii. They are both law students at one of the nearby colleges and really sweet girls. He now knows at least 12 people that live in our building and I must admit that I know no one. I smile and chat briefly on the elevator, but never to the point of actually getting to know names and lives. Good thing I married him or I would be the loneliest person on the planet.Anyway, all the tired, dirty and equipment laden firefighters from the TWO engines that showed up let us back in after about 30 minutes as they returned to the street—(No, not one of them looked like the guys on those calendars, and that was a disappointment on my part. God gives hubby the chickies and I get dumpy men and women in baggy gear.)Living in the city is pretty interesting sometimes for some of us."},

{"title": "Waiter, There's a Blattella in My Soup!", "date": "Thursday, September 29, 2005", "text": "Can you trigger a bad experience by talking about a similar bad experience?  Well, maybe so.Hubby was explaining his difficulty in finding healthy food while at a rural meeting in South Carolina recently. The hotel restaurant was not appealing and expensive so his team headed for a local popular restaurant in the town. He looked through the menu and found out that everything on it was fried. I mean, he likes fried food but that is the problem. Finally his eyes settled on the following entrée - “Grilled chicken breast with roasted red potatoes and garden fresh zucchini.” This had to be healthy, right? So he ordered it. Guess what arrived. He got a grilled chicken breast, yep. Only thing is that it was covered about a half-inch thick with some kind of glutinous white gravy. He looked at the roast potatoes and they were first BATTER fried and then roasted and of course, you have guessed that the zucchini was also batter covered and fried. So much for a healthy meal.Now, he was telling me this story as we pulled into a mall to eat after our builders meeting. The mall appeared to be only a few years old and had the traditional chain restaurants. I was craving a margarita and so we selected the chain On the Border. (Now, just so I don’t get sued, we have eaten at this same chain in a different location and found the food quite respectable along with the other services.) This time was a little different.I ordered my margerita and the waitress asked if I wanted a “large or small.” This should have been my first clue, as I don’t usually frequent places that ask this question. When she told me how large the large was, my old-age judgment kicked in (along with my husband’s dirty look) and I ordered the small.The drink arrived along with our order. I sipped the drink and it seemed a little bland and lemonadey – (this isn’t a word, so I don’t know how to spell it.) I am a picky, picky person about my margeritas and years ago realized the only place to get a good tasting kicker drink such as this is in Mexico, so I sighed and accepted that fact. Then the waitress started pulling the grilled steak and onions off the hot platter that she brought. She asked if I wanted onions and I said, “Yes.” (of course.) My husband also had onions with the entrée he ordered. We soon discovered that these onions had been left too long on the shelf or were picked green or something as they were chewy and dry! Ick. When the manager with the bleached teeth smile came by our table, we mentioned that he needed a new produce supplier as the onions were pretty much inedible. He apologized but didn’t give me the impression he gave a flipping you know what.I continued to nurse my drink finding it blander and blander when the waitress brought another margerita. I looked up in surprise and clarified with her that I had not ordered a second drink.“I know.”  She said.  “The bartender accidentally made two, so instead of letting it go to waste, I decided to bring it.”Oh, I thought. I put the first drink aside and sipped the second. It actually had essence of tequila and I said to my hubby. “You know what? I think the idiot bartender forgot the tequila in the first drink and sent out this second drink so I wouldn’t complain.”We continued through the rubbery onions, acceptable steak, and less-bland drink when something caught the corner of my eye. It was a Blattella germanica moving down the wall and toward the table. I am so very familiar with these having lived for years in the tropics. As this little brown nugget proceeded to cross the table toward me I put down my fork and napkin and immediately moved to the waiting bench near the front door of the restaurant, explaining the situation to hubby. I didn’t return.When hubby called for the bill he elaborated on why I had left, and wouldn’t you know it? They didn’t offer us anything - not a free meal, a % off our bill, a free dessert, nothing. We could have been obnoxious and not paid the bill and let all the customers in the restaurant know the type of place they were eating in, but we aren’t that type. We just won’t eat at that chain again in any new areas!The moral is don’t tell bad restaurant stories before you eat out."},

I didn't watch her old show on TV and the few times that a friend gave me an old copy of her expensive magazine, I never found much in it that I had time to try or could afford to try. She was always a little too D.A.R. stuffy for my tastes. The smile was polite but cold and she never looked real, even in gardening boots.I was talking to a co-worker (a hippie-guy) about coffee the other day. I said that I read somewhere that French press coffee was supposed to be the best way to make coffee and I had found that true after testing it myself. I even found it better than espresso coffees I would buy at the restaurants in Italy. He laughed and said that I must agree with Martha Stewart, because he saw her 'coffee' show. But he explained that she always has to make things more complicated than necessary. She boiled her water and added her coffee but instead of letting it sit for 3 minutes she insisted that you had to stir it for 4 minutes---stirring coffee for 4 minutes is not the way I want to start my morning!Well, I have started to watch her new afternoon show on The Learning Channel (not The Apprentice TV show which I hear is bombing.). She comes on at 6:00 when I am cooking dinner and it is a nice distraction. I cannot tell you how she has changed or how her real self has burst through or maybe prison has made her go a little crazy! She had P-Diddy on as one guest and was making \"wraps\" like dough wraps, wrapping paper, and of course, she even got down a little with him and his music. It was the funniest show! She was very comfortable, witty and kept things totally unawkward, even when P-Diddy held his dough wrap and stuffed it exactly as if it was a joint saying \"I know how to do this!\"On another show the guest was Marcia Cross from desperate Housewives who plays a Martha Stewart type character. Well, Marcia clearly doesn't know how to cook and is really the opposite of the character she plays and making scrambled eggs with Martha Stewart was a such comedy of errors that kept the audience laughing.Stewart comes across as that perfect witty hostess. She appears to be very knowledgeable about things that have nothing to do with being a hostess with the mostess and therefore, can appear with characters such as David Spade who appeared dressed just like her.Of course, she still hypes each and every one of her K-Mart products with give aways and also advertises her evening show The Apprentice-Martha Stewart during the banter. Her TV studio is huge with lots of kitchen gear. In her personality change, she clearly hasn't lost her drive to make money."},

After several hours of running between the laundry rooms on the floors we got clothes folded and back into numerous laundry baskets and containers.Then we headed out to the large home store and she looked for faucets for the new sink and shower in her basement (which is still just a dark concrete room).  She was lucky and found something almost immediately.  We did some more looking and then treated ourselves to a pumpkin spice drink at Starbucks.  We headed home to a dinner that hubby  prepared from freshly caught fish and harvested oysters.  Yum. Then some great ice cream and we watched the DVD Cold Mountain.Slept in this morning as did Xman.  Hubby prepared a breakfast of pecan pancakes (Yes, I do cook and you are right, I don't deserve him.)  He packed for his week-long trip to New York and we headed out for shopping at the wine, make-up, blinds and Pier 1 Imports stores.  I got the pillow below as my \"inspiration\" for developing the colors in my master bedroom.  I have long wanted a sunset and/or fall color scheme and this pillow seems to represent that."},
{"title": "Saturday Musings", "date": "Saturday, September 24, 2005", "text": "Got up early this morning as my hubby had an \"interview\" with a plastic surgeon. Hubby has decided that he does not want to retire cold turkey and his office is not amenable to letting him retire and come back part-time. So he is looking at CEO-ing a project headed up by an M.D. with friends with money. I would someday like to be in the position where I have so much money that I NEED to invest it somewhere--not have to FIND money to invest somewhere.Years ago Bill Cosby's TV show joke was that the black upper class TV family on his show were not rich \"because they all went to work for their money. Rich people have money work for them!\"Anyway, we took him to breakfast at a nice chain restaurant nearby that has huge and fairly well-prepared breakfasts and talked \"turkey.\"  (Must have poultry on the mind today.)  Actually it was some other animal, but I am trying to stay somewhat anonymous on this site. The doctor is in his forties, tall and attractive and did I say he was a face surgeon? (Yes, ladies, I am thinking what you are thinking.)Well, this all is in the very earliest stages since it requires a very long process to get this thing up and running. So, this meeting was just a get-to-know-you first-date type of meeting. The two of them went off fishing and I am sitting in the apartment waiting for my sweet daughter and little one so that I can help them do laundry. (Remember her stupid idea to gut and remodel the basement shortly after Xman was born?)Once that gets done, which should take at least a couple of hours, our day is free. Maybe we will do something cool? (Remind me to tell you about my daughter's most recent plans for an Italy trip.  This also needs some tweaking in the planning.)"},
{"title": "Life Story #2", "date": "Wednesday, September 21, 2005", "text": "One of the joys of living a long time is that you have a lot of life stories to carry you through the years.  The story that goes with this picture above is not mine.  It is my husband's, and since he doesn't blog (he can barely use the computer), I get to tell it.  This picture was taken in Cuba sometime in 1959 or maybe early 1960.  Those of you that know your history realize that this was the year that Fidel Castro took over the Cuban islands driving out Batista in the Cuban revolution. The picture is of my husband with his mother and father in front of a fort somewhere on one of the islands.  Here is the story of how they got to Cuba and what happened after they got there.My husband's family lived in Florida at this time.  They went to one of those fun beach parties which had some contests with prizes.  Since my father-in-law was in real estate this was probably a company party.  One of the contests was a 'limbo' contest.  I am not going into details about limbo (look it up.)  Anyway, hubby was very limber and youthful then as you can tell from his body build in the photo above and he WON the contest.  The prizes were a bottle of Cuban rum, and even more significant, a trip to Cuba.His parents were certainly surprised when he ran up to them with this good news.  As soon as they could they made their arrangements for this trip and flew to Cuba.  Their hotel was one of those beautiful hotels with marble everywhere.  They were certainly confused to see collections of rifles in the marble urns at the entrance to the hotel, though.  They were also surprised to see so many revolutionary soldiers in the streets and so many weapons being carried about.  But the hotel staff greeted them warmly and acted normally and checked them into their room.  This  put them at ease.  While they were in the lobby they saw Castro and Che, et al.  When they asked the desk clerk about the all the activity he told them about a new government in Cuba.  They spent one day in Havana and the next day left for Isle of Pines.After checking into the hotel at the Isle of Pines, they went down to the dining room at the dinner hour.  They were very surprised to see that the tables in the dining room had been arranged into one long table for Castro and his \"generals\" and one tiny table in the corner for them!  Of course, they were a little uncomfortable as they crossed the room in front of Castro and his contingent and proceeded to be seated.  Then to their surprise Castro waved his arms to the waiters and insisted that the American tourists join him at the head of his table! My husband's father (and my husband also) are gregarious and friendly people.  So the evening was filled with lots of drinking and laughter; and god, I wish I had been there.  Hubby said Castro was a very interesting and good host.My husband had persuaded his parents to arrange a fishing trip for him...the love he has clearly had since birth.  The next day my husband awoke early for his fishing trip and as he headed out, pole in hand, toward the dock to meet with his fishing guide, a jeep with Che Guevera in it passed him and stopped.  Che asked where hubby was going and hubby explained.  \"Get in.\" said Che.  Hubby didn't hesitate since there was a man standing through the open roof of the jeep with some impressive weapon in his hand.  The jeep proceeded to the dock, but since Che and his buddies were also going fishing, they insisted that hubby join them on their boat instead.  Their boat was much, much nicer anyway.  Never one to pass up an opportunity, the twelve-year-old boy jumped in their boat and spent the entire day out fishing.  They didn't return until well after dark.When hubby got back to the hotel he found his dad drunk at the bar and both mad and terrified at not knowing where his son had gone for the day since the fishing guide was still there. The next day they returned to Havana for one final day of sightseeeing before heading back to Florida.  Imagine their surprise upon checking into their hotel in Havana when they found it was the headquarters for Fidel and his 'army.'  Fidel was meeting with his generals there that night! Hubby's parents had arranged for a trip to the local tourist nightclub (I really think it was called the Tropicana) for a floor show that evening.  They had reservations for a very good table center front stage.  Things got a little creepy when after being seated, the couples at the tables on either side of them were replaced by men who certainly looked like revolutionaries.  That night they were starting to be glad the vacation was coming to an end.The next day at the airport before departure they were separated for a security check and hubby said his mother indicated she had NEVER been searched as fully as she had that day.  They made it safely back to Florida and only years later realized how close they had been to history.Fun trip, huh?"},
{"title": "Salt and Peppa!!", "date": "Tuesday, September 20, 2005", "text": "I had been pretty depressed about the prejudice that became so obvious in Katrina's aftermath. I am one of those stubborn liberals that refuse to believe anyone could be so stupid, afraid and heartless as to ignore or deny someone help based on their background. When I read some of the accounts I ended up feeling guilty as if these were my brothers and sisters (i.e. Barbara Bush's comments) reflecting me and my beliefs.Well, shortly after that we went to a free jazz concert that was part of our community's revitalization efforts and also a last minute support for the Katrina revitalization.There were some wonderful jazz groups such as Marcus Johnson who kept me moving. The headliner was Winton Marsalas. The night was perfect, warm and sexy, the moon was almost full and smile-beaming to the beat in the sky. We ended up standing on the third floor of the parking garage as we could see the stage better, had a wonderful breeze, excellent sound and could people-watch the audience on the space below us.I noticed that it was a very diverse audience of thousands of people. The majority of our community is black, some poor, but not as poor as New Orlean's citizens. I saw black and white faces in about equal numbers, young and old, children and grandparents and dogs. Everyone was in a gentle and friendly mood. A 50-something black man adopted my husband and proceeded to spend a good part of the time befriending him. Yes, he was three sheets to the wind (the black man), but he wasn't obnoxious. My husband who is a non-drinker was the perfect gentlemen to this.Even the people who were visiting from Israel and standing behind us talking about how they really didn't like jazz finally drifted away and we enjoyed a langourous enjoyment of \"Down by the Riverside.\"I left that concert thinking that this is what America is supposed to be about. Accepting our differences and finding that common ground, in this case jazz, baby, jazz, and sharing our love of it. I went to bed completely exhausted about 9:00 PM and was in deepest slumber by 9:15---didn't even hear hubby sneak into bed after Monday night football.  Now it is 1:30 and I am wide awake.  Same thing happened last night!  I can't quite put my finger on the reason I have been having sleep problems lately.  My life is morphing so much now, that I am sure this has something to do with it.  I am a grandmother for the first time, I am approaching retirement, I am building a house, I am apartment living in the city for the first time in decades...all of this is changing and challenging me.  But, this restlessness occurs mostly on the week nights, so the insomnia probably relates more to job stress than anything else.  As I wrote a while back, my work program is morphing also.  I spent late yesterday in a meeting with others (one pompous ass that should retire ASAP, two gung-ho young technical writers and PR types, and one career woman about my age) meeting to plan how to meld my program's public image with another new progam web-wise.  We must have one consistent approach.  They have the budget now, so I have to be realistic about the direction of things.  But, it takes tremendous patience not to scream when they spend hours discussing the aspects of the subject area...since they are each learning about it for the first time.  I know the history, I know the customers, I know the accomplishments, I know the issues.  But, I have to let them try to figure out how to prioritize because I can't take my marbles and go home.  I have no marbles.  (Marbles being money...not brains although sometimes I think that is open for discussion as well.)They recognize that I have decades of work in this subject area and at least five years of work with this particular department.  It is just that they come with a political/policy agenda and I come with an education/research agenda.  So, we have different goals and approaches.  You can't really teach an old dog new tricks.  You can just update their act and add it to yours.Tomorrow I have a stupid two-day training class for three hours each in a general apsect of my subject area.  I only signed up because I was making an effort to learn new tricks, but I am sure I will come from this not having learned much new.  Make me wrong, please. Feeling a little grouchy like this 'bear' in the woods."},

I think he is wrong and am asking for a kitchen designer, because a refrigerator is a VERY important appliance that is used daily and I want to be able to use the one I picked.  We went to one of those large everything and then-some stores to look at all the kitchen appliances.  As we left, we found some celadon green dinnerware that we decided to buy, since we do not have a complete set of dishes at this time what with the recent move and all. This store is at least 30 minutes from where we live and, of course, when we got home we found 5 plates, one bowl and one cup broken.  I called the store and they at least said we did not have to bring back the whole heavy box; they just wanted the broken items, please.  With gas prices what they are our dish set just went up another $3.00!  While at the store we also were looking at CD players since our old player seems to be ignoring the CDs when we try to play them.  This is a somewhat fruitless task with everyone moving to digital stream technology.  We couldn't find anything simple and decided to try out a CD cleaner disk instead.  I'll let you know if it works.  I've got a feeling that there is more to this than a dirty disc player."},

I have contacted a few friends in that area and their homes survived; but they are frantically working on rebuilding research labs or classrooms and libraries.  I have contributed as best I can, and need to back off from the images and stories for now.  Interestingly, the thoughts still permeate my life.  Most recently in the form of food.  Last night we harvested and ate these. As we relished these freshly harvest oysters, we also thought about how the oyster industry in the Gulf area along with all the seafood (caught and farmed) had been devastated.  How some of the shrimpers lost their homes and are now living on their boats and have nothing to harvest.Then today as I live on liquids and find food constantly tugging at my thoughts and food smells driving me bananas (see even my descriptors are edible!), I chastise myself in that I can have nutritious liquids and I am not thirsty like the hurricane survivors nor will I ever be as hungry as they must have been.  My concern for the procedures of the medical appointment early tomorrow is nothing like the fear they must have tried to control."},

Life Story #1", "date": "Monday, September 12, 2005", "text": "I had just finished putting together a little photo album about my two weeks with my grandson.  As I was  moving some of the photo albums I have in my bookshelf, these two fell to the floor.   Boy do they bring back the memories.  I think the guy with the GREAT thighs and totally sweet personality was called Lazarus, if I remember correctly.  He was an elder selected as our guide and was helping my husband and I get some drinking coconuts since we had gotten thirsty while touring an area for an environmental study on a possible reef airport. (The reef won, thank goodness! That story involved an angry native and a spear and danger...another blog for another time.)  The second photo is me standing next to probably a million dollars--that will never happen again.  These giant doughnut shapped stones are money on the island of Yap.  They represent a family's wealth.  They come in all sizes, but this one has to be worth a LOT!  Nice memories of a long time ago.    I lost my font, has anyone seen my font?Starting tomorrow I get to drink 3 ounces of sodium benzoate and as many tons of clear liquids as I like.  Yes, it is that time again where I let some gastroenterologist  satisfy their prurient interests and hopefully tell me that my inside is as sexy as my outside on Wednesday.

So, being the strong supporter of freedom of speech I sent the URL to my home email.  (If I get fired tomorrow, you will know why!)  Anyway, here it is.  I just got back from a FEMA Detainment Camp  Before you read this, keep reminding yourself that you are in the United States of America and that these 'refugees' are not people captured in I-r-a-q.

If you can't open, let me know and I will post the text.  I had barely made it inside the apartment door and the phone was ringing. Dropping my mail on the chair I checked caller ID. It’s my mom, of course. She has been reading news on that damn Internet, I realized.“Hi, Mom.”“What are you doing home so early?  It’s not even five.”“I put in almost nine hours, Mom.  Besides, I work for the government.  Five-week vacations, long lunch hours, you know.”“You should be working more.  Get on that fast track.  Take on more than you can handle easily.”“Mom, what in the hell are you talking about?” I said this, knowing full well where this conversation was leading. I also had been reading the news over lunch.“Haven’t you seen the news about stress?  Stress is good for you.  Stress prevents breast cancer, for god’s sake!  Did you call your Ex today about the payments?”“Mom, I love talking to you.  But I need to unwind before I start dinner.”“Tension is good. Stress is good. You do not ‘need’ to unwind. You need to get a second job. Maybe that way you could meet someone nice and get married again.”“I have to say goodbye now, Mom.  Thanks for the healthy dose of stress.”  I hung up gently and headed for the wine rack.I was going to write something about curdled breast milk and cancer and stress, but kept my wits about me.

The newscaster (spokesman) joined him and said, \"Well today, folks, we are here to help you plan an outdoor dinner for the Labor Day holiday. I am sure some of you are planning on smoking some stuff over the holiday.\" He really said that. Didn't even blink. I am sure his studio folks were falling off their chairs.

{"title": "Can There Be Too Much Togetherness?", "date": "Saturday, September 03, 2005", "text": "I get to reading blogs on an early Saturday and come across some stories about spouses and their disagreements that make me wonder how the people can still be together. But, having said that, there are days when I wonder how my hubby and I are going to work out this 24/7 retirement thing.Right now he travels about 30% of the time. So, even though we go to work together, there are times when I have that precious, marvelous, restorative alone time that I so need.When he is home we do most things together except for work time. We are not a glued-at-the-hip couple, but we do enjoy each others company and like similar activities and adventures. The hurdle that I see coming in the time ahead is my hubby's addiction to water activities and fishing. I mean, if he could, he would take out his canoe or boat every single day until he died to make sure he has found every fishing hole, every school of fish, every bird feeding group, etc. He even jokes that if he gets too old and has to be taken care of by others, that he wants me to put him in the canoe with his best fishing pole (like I would know out of the dozen he has!) and just push the canoe offshore into the ocean. I tell him that even though I love him, I am NOT going to jail for him.Well, the problem is that he does not have a real fishing buddy other than I. His  friends and colleagues are all busy with their lives. And even though we have the rare dinner together, they are not giving up their free time for fishing. And I can take fishing or leave it...usually leave it. We 'fight' over our weekend time. I like to run errands, work on crafts, take pictures, houseplan, watch chick flicks, blog, garden. He likes to fish. And on the days that have crappy weather he likes to fish even more. So I hope when we move into the new area there are fishing addicts and boating addicts to feed his needs.I realized a few years ago and re-realize it every year that some (many?) women frequently give up our fun times to babysit while hubby golfs (my daughter), to go on long outdoor fishing vacations with husband (my sister) or to go boating on rare free times (me) to keep those we love happy. Then as we get older and the children fire us and maybe hubby slows down, we realize that we have put that whole creative self-pleasuring side of ourselves on a shelf somewhere. See that picture of that high school girl or college graduate? Who were we anyway? When was the last time we focused for so long on something we loved that we forgot the time?  We need to be more like men."},
{"title": "Going Back in Time", "date": "Thursday, September 01, 2005", "text": "For a total of 10 days over a three week period, I was the daytime caregiver of my little guy. Ten things I learned as a new grandmother in charge of daycare:1) Your daughter (son?) will remind you of yourself at times in her approach to things and at other times you will wonder where she gets such crazy ideas.2) “Quality time” for working parents consists of two hours in the evening which also includes changing out of office clothes, sorting the mail, cooking dinner and watching some stupid reality show that has been TIVOed. If you don’t know what TIVO is, you are better off than the rest of the world because you actually have a life. The kid does get some eye contact time, some belly time and usually a diaper change in all of this. Morning quality time, while more peaceful, rarely lasts more than a few minutes before everyone is off and running to greet their day.3) When taking a baby for the daily stroll you actually think about things like the breezes in the leaves, happy dogs with wagging tails, the sounds of the suburbs and approaching fall colors.4) Don’t expect to get any lengthy sleep while you are there overnight. Especially if parents are trying to get baby to drop night feedings.5) Most Daddies are not intuitive about babies and it is sometimes funny to watch the discombobulation. 6) The strangest songs will come back into your memory when you are talking to the baby and you will actually sing them to him…at least partly, if you can remember most of the words.7) Bath time:  Babies are slippery as hell when wet!8) There is nothing more addictive than ANY drug imaginable as having a little guy (gal) curl up tight in your arms, look you straight in the eye, and then drift off to blissful sleep.9) Baby smell is certainly the next addiction…didn’t want to shower when I got back home!10) You will lose weight ( a little). Lifting baby up and down, getting up and down from the floor, pushing a stroller, going up and down the stairs dozens of times each day and forgetting to eat all contribute to this.  Watching the news this week, the discouraging images were so familiar to me.  In the late 1970’s upon returning from living in the South Pacific, Hubby and I excitedly purchased our first real home as a married couple in southern Texas.  The house was located in a small and lovely suburb surrounded by shady live oak and sweet gum trees covered with Spanish moss and bordering lush green lawns.  The house was a three bedroom, two bathroom ranch in excellent condition.  We owned about a half acre.  The back yard also had a garage-size greenhouse that kept all my tropical plants protected through the short winters of southern Texas.  The former owner was a landscape addict and the yard was spectacular; we even won an award one year from the local garden club.  Across the street was a slow moving bayou that my husband explored in his canoe on weekends.  My daughter was almost four at the time and my son was about 8 months old.  I was still nursing him, which later became a blessing.Hurricanes were common in the summer months in this area of Texas but none ever reached our area.  In 1979, Tropical Storm Claudette moved in from the gulf and while we expected lots of rain and flooded lawns, we knew it would move on as these tropical storms always did.  But Claudette was contradictory and decided to stay awhile.  She moved up to Alvin, Texas and then proceeded to sit there like a drunken sailor sucking up moisture from the Gulf and dumping it on our heads.  42 inches of rain fell in 24 hours.  According to Wikipedia:  “Claudette was a long-lived (August 15 - August 29) but fairly weak storm that spent almost its entire life as a tropical depression. Claudette formed in the mid-Atlantic east of the Windward Islands. It had two spells as a tropical storm; the first was a brief one east of Puerto Rico. The storm passed directly over the island just after weakening, where it killed one person from flooding. The depression moved casually through the Greater Antilles and moved into the Gulf of Mexico. Claudette restrengthened into a tropical storm south of Sabine, Texas and made landfall near Port Arthur, killing one person from floods. Damages from flooding in Texas were enormous, totaling $400 million dollars. Claudette was one of the costliest storms on record that never reached hurricane intensity.”After hours and hours of gray rain, fear was starting to set in.  By early evening I could hear the water gurgling beneath the bathtub in the children’s bathroom.  It was a strange and unsettling sound.  In the dusk, I tried to see where the level of the bayou was in the neighbor’s backyard across the street, but the rain was so heavy I couldn’t make out anything but gray water against the window.  Uneasy, we put the kids to bed and then headed to bed ourselves.  The numbing sound of rain continued throughout the night.  We slept on and off, and in the morning, woke up to about six inches of water in the bedroom!  We hurriedly packed some clothes, got the kids dressed and talked about what to do next.I remember getting my daughter her breakfast before we left.  The water had come up another 8 inches by that time.  I put her on the kitchen table and fixed her cereal.  Although the electricity was out, the milk was still cold from the fridge.  She was fascinated with the swimming pool that had previously been our home.  While eating she suddenly squealed in delight.  When I looked up, she giggled.  “Mom, look, there’s a fish under the table!”  In verification, there was a small 4 inch fish swimming around the legs of our kitchen table as if it was his own small wooden reef.The water continued to rise, and we eventually had to leave our home by that reliable old canoe.  As we paddled down our street I noticed that the waters were teaming with balls of fire ants climbing over each other in order to avoid drowning.  We had to be careful not to brush up against those lovely live oaks and sweet gums branches, as they, too, were covered in fire ants and harbored their share of poisonous and non-poisonous snakes as well.  We paddled out to the nearby freeway and then hubby returned to pick up our neighbors.  Eventually a school bus took all of us to the local elementary school.  While the rains stopped, the water continued to rise for another day.  We got over 3 feet of water in our house.  When we realized that it would be days before we could get back home, friends took us in.  After several weeks of living with them, we accepted that we had to find some place to rent for the longer term and fortunately we had the limited resources to do that.  I remember thinking that although I had lost the inside of my house and most of my belongings, I was so thankful we were alive and uninjured.We returned to a neighborhood of refuse-covered lawns.  People were trying to determine what could be salvaged and what had to be thrown out among their treasures.  I still have in my mind the nightmare images of soaked furniture, buckled oak flooring, and days and days of doing laundry when the electricity was finally restored.  My neighbor’s dryer worked and my washer worked and we ran them non-stop together for days.  You have to wash EVERYTHING you ever owned that is washable.  We probably thought we were washing the flood away.We retrieved the chest freezer from the neighbor's swimming pool where it had floated out of our garage. All of our food was lost, of course.Months passed before we could get a contractor to help us rebuild.  We gutted the house ourselves in the interim.  The fireplace had not been pushed off its base and we did not have a can of diesel oil on a counter to tip and spread everywhere as one of our neighbors had experienced.I ended up having to wean my son earlier than I wanted, because we had to shop for cars (both of ours floated away) and handle tons of insurance paperwork and loan paperwork.  (This was the flood, by the way, that gave Texan, Dan Rather, his first big newsbreak and helped move him forward as a major news anchor.)As I see these people in the Gulf who are so thankful just to be alive, I know that months from now when they will have to accept they have a long road ahead after the initial shock wears off.  They will need the help of the charities more than ever and the support of their relatives and friends to help them see the light at the end of the tunnel.  As my blog emphasizes, you get through these things One Day at a Time."},

{"title": "I'm Baaack", "date": "Saturday, August 20, 2005", "text": "I am here, just for the weekend--pay some bills and catch up on laundry. I return to my daughter's house Sunday night and stay until Friday night. I actually feel like I am on vacation there, since I don't do anything but play with the baby and help with some light housekeeping. I am actually getting quite a bit of reading done!But now for the days prior to visiting x-man---our anniversary trip. After a drive of five hours, we checked into the park lodge which was quite nice and at a $60-a-night special rate, a good savings. On the Saturday afternoon of our arrival, the lodge was busy with the activities of a summer festival. There were lots of people in the huge swimming pool, kids on the rock climbing wall, and some bungie jumpy thing. Inside a newly built shelter at the foot of the hill behind the lodge there were arts and crafts tables with of all kinds of things for sale. People were sitting at picnic tables eating food, dogs lay at their feet and children were running in and out. It was sort of like a family get-together. A wonderful Celtic music group of four was singing and playing for the crowd. We liked their music so much we bought the CD, \"Wolf Creek Session - Between Two Shores.\" We also bought some honey made from the tulip poplar tree. In the early evening we took a very short walk around the grounds of the lodge which has several easy trails. We came upon this deer grazing in the high grass. It clearly had some health problem, as he did not try to avoid us and had terrible mange.The next morning we headed out to one of our favorite areas in West Virginia, Dolly Sods. This is a misnomer based on the name of the Dahle family which owned the area. This German family raised cattle on the high rolling hills before it became a nature park on one side and a private hunting area on the other. It is a unique ecosystem in that the climate is much like that of Canada with places as high as 4,000 feet. Weather is quickly changeable at that height and so you have to be aware when camping or hiking. This place has special memories for my husband and I as we have been hiking and camping here when the children were younger.We selected one of many trails...all of which are fairly level at the end of the road. Our trail which was a combination of several numbered trails ended up being 4.5 miles in and 4.5 miles out. I know this, as my husband is enamoured of his gadget GPS. This is the trail head labeled Bear Rocks Trail #522, which we didn't exactly follow. We stopped and talked to some young campers that had just come out and they provided us with a map they used and recommended a good day hike. We were passed by three horseback riders and their little beagle as we reached the trees at the end of the picture above. But that was really the only people we saw the whole time.We were surprised that the park provided snacks this late in the season. There were two types of blueberries. The blue ones were the sweetest, but the darker blue berries had a pungent flavor like fine wine. We felt very healthy eating them and were sorry that the horseman missed this stop.Once we cleared the first set of trees the trail becomes less clear as the tall grasses cover our footprints. Thus the value of the GPS so at least we can get back to where we have been.That square thing on hubby's head is the GPS---he likes to wear it that way. He always was a fashion maven. We still have to make it over the next knoll in the distance before we can justify a rest.At the top of that hill it was so lovely and ended up being a perfect spot to take a break. The breeze was gentle and the weather had not yet heated up by mid-morning, although the afternoon of our return was quite hot. We were high on the hills and the breeze was so welcome as were the clouds that drifted between us and the sun.We came to various steel posts at times, some with directions and some just posts to indicate the trail. But it took careful observation to make sure we did not get lost on some other footpath. This area is so open and beautiful that one can hike for days.The terrain changes from rolling hills to marsh/bog valleys that support the blueberries and cranberries. It can get quite muddy, so you have to wear good hiking shoes, which we did. We spotted the footprints in the mud below. Seemed to be too big for a mink or martin and probably not a raccoon. Where is Daniel Boone when you need him?Finally--the crest of the ridge and  our reward is the view.  Time for lunch, a break and we head back out."},

{"title": "Tokyo After Midnight", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2005", "text": "Many many (many) years ago ( probably before you were born) my husband and I spent some time in Japan on business. We spent several days in Tokyo and being the young adventurers that we were, we stayed out late and visited hotel bars, etc. It amazed us that in such a large city at 2:00 A.M. one would see a few drunken men in business suits stumbling down the street, but never see any scuzzy or threatening people. We never felt in danger at any time, as we might have in a large American city during that time. We weren't even concerned if we got a little lost in trying to find our way back to our hotel. I haven't been out late in Tokyo recently, so don't know if that culture has changed. I think the lower crime rate there has to do with the homogeneity of the population.In reading my latest issue of Newsweek, I came across this article. The photo itself is certainly compelling. I cannot imagine how any mother could send a six-year-old across a city by him or herself on a public train. There would be so many what-ifs in my mind that I just would NOT send my kid to school until I lived closer. It seems that this is a somewhat common thing in Japan.Five years ago in the spring of the year I took a day's walk down this lovely road below. Enjoying the spring weather and the company of others. It was one of those perfect days when the breeze was just right, the walk was not challenging and the natural beauty was everywhere. The end of the road led to a grassy knoll and this view of the ocean.The grassy knoll was probably the home of the enemy. The enemy gave no sound and was never seen. 24 hours later I found a tick on my thigh and 48 hours after that I got sick.  In three days I had the bulls-eye on my leg and my neck glands were sore and swollen. Yep, Lymes disease. Fortunately, we caught it in time because I had the textbook symptoms. But I went to a seminar a few months later on Lymes and was told that I could get it again in another bite with or without the symptoms showing up. That was reassuring."},
{"title": "Work It Baby!!!", "date": "Wednesday, August 10, 2005", "text": "I have been sluffing off. I used to be so good about exercising 30 minutes most mornings and 60 minutes on the weekends. This came about because of some back difficulties that I had about 8 years ago. I went into therapy and then, being the type A person that I am, I decided to bump it up a notch when the insurance company stopped paying for the therapy. I got DVDs, video tapes, weights, benches, etc. and WORKED it baby... My back pain completely went away! It was such a good reward after a year of debilitating pain, that I committed myself to never returning to the slug mode I had been in. I had been spiraling into a depression (and since I had never been depressed in my life it was both fascinating and frightening).My posture has benefitted and even a dance teacher noticed. I also lost a 'little' weight and my clothes fit better, which was also a reward since I could justify buying some new clothes. So exercise became my mantra.Well, this final move to the apartment (maybe it is just the aging process as well) has changed my exercise routine. There is not so much room ( I HATE PUBLIC GYMS) and I can't be as aggressive in exercising since my husband is usually still sleeping. These excuses are preventing me from exercising as much and as regularly as I used to. Oh well. Oh hell."},
{"title": "Remember that baby a few weeks ago?", "date": "Tuesday, August 09, 2005", "text": "This from CNN today.I am so glad that people don't grow this fast!I am learning to live like many Americans live in the city.This apartment has only one washer and one dryer on each floor, and while I can usethe laundry room on other floors, the thought of carrying a basketful of laundry, the keys to the laundry room, the money card for the machines and all the cleaning supplies into the elevator and out only to find that the machine on that floor is busy, has convinced me that it would be easier to use the appliances on my floor.The laundry room is just across from the kitchen door to the hallway, so I can easily check to see if the laundry room is busy and then run like a crazy person pulling sheets off the bed, towels outs of the bathroom and small rugs from the floor. In addition, I have learned to set the kitchen timer so that I will be reminded when to pull the stuff out of the washer and into the dryer, etc. (Don't want anyone to steal my clothes or throw them on the floor in anger because I am busy drinking wine and blogging!)  This whole process is a big change from the luxury of having my own washer and dryer.   I no longer have the luxury of doing a small load of delicates.  All loads cost the same--$1.50--so I tend to clump stuff together that I hadn't previously.  Doing hand laundry and hanging unmentionables in this small apartment could be disastrous.  (At least I bought a bunch of new underwear a year or so ago!)But, I am still better off than my daughter. In her intelligence to bite off more than she can chew (much like manababies methinks) she has decided to gut and remodel her basement. This decision occurred when her baby was less than two months old. What this means is that she had the 'guy' come in and gut the basement--take out all of the bathroom fixtures down there and the new washer and dryer she had purchased a few months ago. The 'guy' is not licensed, but has done some work for them that they liked and so now she or her husband have to go to the permit office to get the permission to do this so that they can be sure the plumbing is done correctly. Therefore, weeks later she is still without a laundry room and is running next door to do her laundry (wonder how long the neighbors will be friends?)I am so glad there is a hole in my lot!  Counting the months."},

{"title": "Holding on to junk", "date": "Monday, August 01, 2005", "text": "I got a kick out of reading manababies struggle to simplify  her life while preparing for a move and the sale of her house.   She was writing about how old things (that are totally worthless) have memories attached that make you want to save them, instead of tossing them out. Manababies memory was attached to a piece of clothing -- a pair of old boxer shorts.This is amusing to me because my daughter went to an O.A.R. concert the other night with our young cousin.  While at the concert she remembered an incident when she was a pre-teen. One of the OAR singers stayed at our house with my son as a ten-year-old many years ago. He accidentally left his boxer shorts. Boxer shorts were all the rage then for 12-year-old girls, which my daughter was.  So she put them aside hoping Marc would never ask for them, which he didn't and she decided to keep them.    She would have been too embarrassed to go into the boys/men's department and buy male underwear of course.Well, as one would expect, she no longer has these shorts--nor post pregnancy could she fit into them if she did-- but her cousin, who is a very young twenty-something, was most impressed when she learned this at the concert and wished that my daughter had saved the shorts. One person's treasure is frequently another person's junk and that is probably one of the primary things that keeps E-bay going strong."},

I have a baby shower coming up and while I ordered stuff from the new mother's registry on-line, I really want to add some personal items myself. Any unique ideas from you new mothers?Then I will go to the wine store and stock up for the next few weeks.

At the end of the conversation she got around to why she had really called. She needed a babysitter for Saturday night so that she and hubby could take the cousin who is now her daycare person to a concert as a break.

{"title": "Who has the Stomach for It?", "date": "Tuesday, July 26, 2005", "text": "(Finally got a chance to post this during a late lunch.)I Don’t Have the Stomach for it Anymore      A few weeks ago I was surfing television looking for something to distract me and help wind down the day.  I came across “Into the West” on TNT.  This short series was produced by Steven Spielburg which certainly lends some cache in terms of credibility and entertainment.  So, even though the series has started the week before, I was intrigued and decided to watch Chapter 3 and Chapter 4.  Beginning credits were attractive and set a gentle western scene.  Everything is filmed in gentle sepia tones creating a historic mood.  Costumes and props are clearly made to look authentic.  The actors themselves are well cast and in some instances represent actual historic characters.  The actors’ faces, for the most part, are not common to television viewers and so the character is allowed to come through.  The history of the development of the western territories is told following the lives of two families.       OK, enough background.  Why didn’t I finish watching Chapter 4?  I frequently stop watching a movie, TV Show, sports game when I think it is getting late and I need to go to bed, old grandmother fart that I am.  It drives my husband nuts that I can get up in the middle of a show and head to bed without wondering how the episode ends.  (Of course most of television is so derivative that there is no time lost pondering the ending on my part and I’d rather get to my book.)  But, this is not the reason I didn’t watch the finish of this show.  I turned off the set because I was crying so hard, I just couldn’t watch any more.  The blatent violence and loss of innocent elderly and children just kicked me in the gut, and, Spielburg makes it all so real…the fact that is was real history…just couldn’t do it.  It was a beautiful and tragic story of our history.  I really wanted to watch it all, but I couldn’t.     I don’t know if this has to do with aging or just the years of images that have been burned in my mind, or 9/11, but I don’t have the stomach to watch such violence—even in the news anymore.  I was watching BBC last night, because they actually report the news (not just the stories about beautiful white girls that are missing or pedophiles gone amok) and they were showing the genocide and starvation happening in Darfur.  I looked for 10, maybe 15 seconds, and I had to change the channel.  I could not bear it.  Switch to “Friends” or “Everybody Loves Raymond” as something totally mindless to cleanse the palate.     It just seems that my nerves are raw and fringed these days or there is too much reality on TV.  Psychologists say that “Violent programs on television lead to aggressive behavior by children and teenagers who watch those programs.  I wonder what it leads to in baby boomers such as myself?"},

I am blogging first thing.My daughter called last night to see if I wanted to do something with her and our cousin on Sunday.  So that removes half the weekend.  My daughter is a sweetie and gets people to do stuff for her that amazes me.  She had to go back to work on July 5.  Her future babysitting arrangement can't take place until September.  So she got her mother-in-law in to drive down from three states away to babysit for the last two weeks; she is paying to fly in a distant cousin of ours from Michigan (\"Studying nursing and knows how to give a baby CPR.\")for the next two weeks; and then I take over for the first week and the last week of August.

{"title": "Hooters", "date": "Saturday, July 09, 2005", "text": "There is news this morning that the Panda couple at the National Zoo appear to be future parents...at long last.  These huge animals will have a baby that weighs about 4 ounces and is the size is a little larger than a golf ball.  The zoo keepers said that after the birth, they were going to leave the first-time mom and baby alone and let nature take its course rather than try to guide the nursing process.This started me thinking about 'nature taking it's course.'  If I was living in the wild, had never had a baby, had never seen a mother and baby and gave birth to my first child, would I naturally know how to nurse?  Society intellectualizes the process of nursing.  We don't like to think of ourselves as biological animals and we certainly like to think of breasts as sexual organs and not feeding organs. We hide the nursing process, by making mothers go into dark corners or cover their bodies as much as possible when they nurse in public.  My daughter purchased two \"hooter hiders\" so she can live a somewhat normal life and feed her baby boy when among friends or in public. Having lived for years on a tropical island where natives went topless and where nursing was the same as eating, I grew very comfortable with this biological function of ours.  There were stories where years ago missionaries came to the islands to convert the 'heathen' natives and one of the processes was to cover the top of the women with blouses and shirts since boobies had something to do with sin.  The story goes that this lasted a short while as the women (those nursing) soon cut holes in the shirts at exactly the most useful place so they could feed their babies easily.Today I am off to my grandson's baptism...a process that comforts some in the family and which has a little bit of an unsettling effect on others."},

This past week two of my bloggers (both ‘young folk’) seem to be dealing with serious crises in their lives.  I know the details of one but the other has dropped off the blogosphere.  In Blogdom, you really get to know some folks pretty intimately.  You cannot read their eyes and their smiles, but I am realizing that it is not fun when you can’t take someone out to coffee, hold their hand, bring them a cold bottle of wine, or just let them know you are there for them and will pick up the mail and feed the pet!  Please keep good thoughts, prayers, some good Chi going for these two Blogger friends of mine!  As much as I hate to admit it, something happens as your reach the ‘Golden Years’ in terms of getting a good night’s sleep.  I have always been a light sleeper, but every few nights I am rewarded.  I actually do not  wake up every two hours and drift back to sleep…instead, I actually SLEEEEP deeply through the night.  Well, last night was one of those wonderful nights until 1:30 AM when the phone rang.    This was the first call we have gotten in the apartment bedroom, so it took hubby a short while to think about where the phone was and then answer it, but not before he said ominously…Uh Oh.  (He was thinking it was our son with a problem of some kind.  You can tell the teen years have left their scars.)   Well, as you can guess from the title of this blog, it was a wrong number.  I couldn’t get back to sleep for hours!  I actually think that wrong numbers after midnight ought to have a fine attached to them!"},

Being the exacting soul that I am, I keep thinking of putting on the brakes for a minute when they say this.  This is not my 'dream home.' A 'dream home' means to me that I could have everything I would want with no compromises. I am a perfectionist and I could have it exactly  the way that I wanted it, if it was a 'dream home.'  Instead this home will be my retirement home and filled with lots of compromises...liveable compromises...but compromises just the same due to geography and money limitations.  This doesn't mean that I am not excited about all the possibilities ahead.  It just means that I am a realist and will always be holding my breath for the next surprise compromise.Jim Blandings :  “It's a conspiracy, I tell you. The minute you start they put you on the  all-American sucker list. You start out to build a home and wind up in  the poorhouse. And if it can happen to me, what about the guys who  aren't making $15,000 a year? The ones who want a home of their own.  It's a conspiracy, I tell you - -against every boy and girl who were ever in love.”"},

{"title": "Our First Free Day in a LONG Time.", "date": "Sunday, July 03, 2005", "text": "We have only a few boxes and things to sort. so we took the day off and went out in the boat. Hubby has waited 25 years to own such a boat, and we really don't get out in it often enough. Of course, you can save years for a boat and then every year it costs money to run and maintain. I posted a traditional picture of the osprey and the little cove that we disappeared into to eat our store-bought lunch of ham sandwiches and chips. (I still have enough trouble finding things in the apartment kitchen! The only thing I have lost so far is one of my re-chargeable batteries for my digital camera)The day was gently overcast in the A.M. with temps in the low 80's. Perfect for boating. Winds were at least 15--so we stayed out of the Bay and in the river. We would have liked to take some friends, but the apartment move made it a last minute decision.It is still an effort to get out in the boat, since all the boat gear and coolers have to be stored at the old house, which is a mile away. Landlady was very generous and let us keep the keys to the garage door.Today is the last of the unpacking--where to put and/or store dozens of lighbulbs, cleaning supplies and sorting out two of the three tool boxes we own. I even got my roots dyed (which were starting to look like a really bad hair day), and I cut hubby's hair. I have cut my husband's hair since we first got married and lived overseas and found it hard to get a barber. I think he has been to a real barber less then 10 times since we were married.And I have added some photos to the housebuilding blog.Now off to run a few errands. Can't seem to get into the laundry room on a Saturday. Something I will have to adjust to while we live here.A quiet cove for a nice lunch.An osprey which we inadvertantly disturbed as we passed the boat marker."},
{"title": "Moving is a nightmare.  But I knew that.", "date": "Monday, June 27, 2005", "text": "I do not have internet or cable at the apartment, but I can write this in MSWord on my PC and then paste when I get to work tomorrow.  It is late Sunday night after dinner at the absolutely BEST Chinese restaurant—and I have eaten in a lot of them.  It is only a block from my new apartment!  I am surrounded by boxes, boxes, boxes and some furniture that needs to be reassembled.  But the bed is done and made.     Of course, the day we moved the high hits 91 degrees with a relative humidity varying between 39% and 66%!  I guess we either got this type of weather or rain.  Thank goodness ( or God or the Gods) we did not get rain.  We hired William – an ex-husband of a friend.  He was recommended as hard working and strong, but not the brightest bulb in the room—so says the X-wife.  Well, he did just fine and seemed bright enough.  Then Hubby drove by the Duron paint store (this is another blog) and picked up a 38-year-old from El Salvador (Alessandro), who spoke no English, but was also very hard-working.  My husband speaks a reasonable amount of Spanish.  My son and his friend, both strong, also showed up. With Hubby’s back surgery and all the strain and pushing he has been doing these past weeks, he was smart and didn’t do any lifting.     We were going to try and make both the trip to the apartment and the trip to the storage in one rental truck load.  But this proved to be too ambitious and we ended up having to make two loads.  We even threw away two wooden chairs and some other stuff along the way.     The first trip to the apartment, they didn’t have the pads in the elevator as promised,  Hubby went to get that arranged while the rest of us started unloading boxes unto the dolly.  On one of the trips, as we were waiting for the elevator, a middle box started buzzing like an angry bee or a bomb waiting to go off.  Alessandro looked at me a little startled.  I smiled and shrugged my shoulders not having a clue what the noise could be.  When we got to the apartment I tore open the box to get the irritating noise to stop.  It was this !!  I’m sure when Allesandro saw it, he thought it was something else.       I had wisely made a floor plan on graph paper of all of the furniture so that they could place boxes in the middle of the room and the furniture in the correct area.  Even with this good planning, after everyone left, I realized that we would have to move the computer desk next to the TV or the cable guy would make me run all the cable across the room.  Which, like dominoes, meant we had to move some boxes to clear a path to move the smaller book case to the former desk area so that the light switch and thermostat are not covered, which in turn meant moving the large bookcase into the small bookcase place, etc., etc.     Since this is neither my permanent nor long term home, I only care about efficiency not aesthetics in getting the furniture in place.  I do still have a little feng shui thing going each time I move.  It IS sort of in my soul and I don’t consciously think about it, but I can sense an uncomfortable feeling when things are placed incorrectly and try to move them.     Well, enough for tonight.  I am going to sleep the sleep of a baby boy grandchild."},

{"title": "Movin on.", "date": "Friday, June 17, 2005", "text": "My son says he takes off his shoes in his new condo to protect the freshly re-finished floors.  I take off my shoes also!We are moving.  Took 5 loads of boxes to the storage unit.  We now have 7 shelves full of stuff in the 10X15 foot unit.  We have also taken a small load or two to the rental apartment.  I now have to inventory furniture and decide what can fit in the apartment, what can fit in storage, what is able to be stored in the non-climate controlled shed and what goes to Goodwill tomorrow.First, I have to pour another glass of wine!Moving from this rental house will mean leaving behind some familiar nightly noises.  I won’t call them sounds because they really are noise.  We live exactly one house away from two gas stations (Yes, they are side by side.).  At approximately 4:00 A.M. several times a week, at least one of the stations is getting its underground tanks filled.  This means the sound of a large truck backing with its warning beep going off.  This is followed by very loud clanking, which I think must be the tank covers being removed and set on the concrete beside the hoses.  Sometimes I can even smell the fumes as they drift over to my house!     We also sleep only two blocks from the fire station.  Their alarm and the sirens from their trucks are usually heard at least one night a week heading to the nearby freeway or into the neighborhood.       The local hospital is about six blocks on the other side of us and their sirens can also be heard frequently.     In addition to all of this noise, we get the rush hour evening and morning traffic sounds as we are two blocks from a MAJOR intersection.     The apartment we are moving to will have some of these sounds, but I am hoping with less intensity and frequency.  I think the traffic outside the bedroom window will be the worst.  But we are on the fifth (top) floor of the complex with large trees outside the window, so I am hoping that will be a buffer.     And, when we move to our retirement house in the ‘Four-Acre-Woods” and on the water, I am hoping that the primary noise will that of birds, insects and wind.  (Of course, across the water there is a guy who has equipment to install docks!)     I am adaptable for the most part to changes in my environment.  When we lived in Indonesia, our bedroom, which had jalousied (slatted) windows, was directly behind the local Mosque.  The rooftop speaker faced our bedroom window and at sunrise every morning the call to prayer came in loud and clear.  After a few weeks we slept through it!     I do think that noise does cause stress on our physical well-being even if we adjust and adapt.  A few weeks ago, Newsweek published a lengthy section on hearing loss.  The article included a statement that hearing loss in the twenty-thirty something generation may be greater as they get older because of the wide-spread and lengthy use of earphones for listening to music.  While they addressed volume that also said this has an adverse effect on our hearing since it screens out background noises and wider range noises.  I am hoping they are incorrect.     My son, who is an audio engineer, once said that audio engineers have a working-life-span of about 20 years, because after that time their hearing is not as discerning and they have to move into management or do something else.  It is interesting that the technologies (visual and computer) for sounds cannot replace an engineer’s biological ears totally.     I have not discussed at all the use of sound for control of people.  NPR did a program on that use by the Israeli Military…ugh."},

For instance, on May 24 I sent in an address change card to the Post Office and marked that I wanted mail delivered to my new address starting June 24.  Those of you smiling know exactly what happened.  The person at the post office stopped delivering mail on May 24!  My husband told me I was too efficient.  I just want some lead time.  So it took me an entire week to get my mail back...it will be interesting to see if it stops coming on June 24.  We will be out of the house, but still checking the mail until the end of the month.We also have to get out of here because I started buying nice linens and towels (all my stuff is 20 years old) and my boss gave me a Pack and Play and needless to say, things are filling up here again after my clean out.

What actually happened is that another department has now taken on the mission from the department that funded me. While I have spent the last few months kissing butt, spending hours finding ways to assist, working on committees and using higher ups to encourage continued funding, I think I need to accept that my retirement years are going to fizzle out like cold water on a sparkler. \"They\" are re-inventing the wheel and I had hoped that my years of experience would save them some time and mistakes...but they want to do this on their own. (This department has the reputation of being controlling and secretive even among their own staff.)I realized it this week when I was pretty much eliminated totally from a big push for a press release on something that we have worked on for years before this new department took control. I was 'accidentally' left off the list for meetings and while told the announcement would be on my website, I now find that because I was out at a doctor's appointment today, they were going to put the link up (tomorrow) on their department's website. When I emailed between doc visits I was generously told I could link to their page!In an email earlier this week \"they\" emphasized that they would need lots of help in distributing packets, setting up panels, etc. at various venues and when I volunteered to do ANYTHING they needed, I was pretty much ignored and sent a schedule via email if I wanted to attend.This doesn't mean I will lose my job, just that I have a few years of boring activities to fill before I retire. (I actually could BS my time and no one would probably get concerned.) Unfortunately, I need to be doing something useful and intellectually demanding...so...that is the challenge for my future. Fortunately, my boss likes me and is on my side.If I was younger, this would be a devastating blow to my ego and career.

They are an addiction for me.  I never travel without one or two in my backpack.  I keep one in my purse to read while waiting for people.  I have the hardest time weeding my book collections each time we move.       I grew up with a mother who read to us each night.  We were not well off in terms of money, so sometimes she had to read adult books to us for entertainment.  I am sure that she cleaned them up as she read them to us, we as children would never know.  I remember a time when I was about six and we were in transitional living status while my dad was changing jobs.  We were in this cute little house in a small mountain town with very little to keep us (me and my brother and sister) entertained.  On the shelf were some books that the prior owner/renter had left behind.  One was a western about a cowboy named Red Ryder.  My Iinternet research found at least one book written by S.S. Stevens that has Red Ryder in the title.  Well, each night my mother would read us a chapter from this book before bedtime.  I am not a big fan of westerns and I actually cannot remember the story at all today, but at the time we sat on the floor glued to her knees to get every word.     Yesterday, my daughter called half laughing and half crying.  She said her newborn son was just like his father.  When I asked her to explain, she said that every time she picked up one of the many childrens books that she had in the baby room and started to read to him, he would cry.  She tried reading while looking at him, while looking at the book, with expression, without expression,  soto voce, etc.  Each time he would crinkle his face up and cry.  She could sing to him, listen to all kinds of music with him, dance with him, and all of these activities brought him joy…but the open book thing he did not like.  Her husband does not read so that is why she compared the baby to him. “What are we going to do, mom?”   I answered that we would keep on trying and just wait until he can start to understand words, focus on pictures, etc.  Her response was, “I want you to come down to the house this weekend and try to read to him.  I want to see what he will do.”     I just couldn’t help laughing.  What a joy he is going to be."},

Urban Dictionary actually has the definition of this phenomenon where your blog can cost you your job!  Poor Heather B. Armstrong. Bloggers talk about their family and work relationships, this personal stuff goes out to the Web where potentially millions can read it and then it will be archived somewhere forever...it will be baaack to haunt them someday.  It is amazing what people will share with the world, myself included.This parallels another phenomenon.  Celebraties willing to share intimate details of their lives with their fans and virtual strangers.  I remember an interview Oprah had with Sting's wife where she talked about them trying Tantric sex to strengthen their marriage.  I mean get a grip!.  You are telling all of these strangers in Oprah's audience about your married sex life.   And she is not the only celebrity.

Does it reflect something else in the culture that we need to share this stuff with people we don't know and says something about our inability to communicate with people we do know?

What is shown is the wall between the dining room and the bedroom--I think the bedroom was a sunroom porch at one time. There are three open window frames and some weird gauze curtains for privacy.  Clearly the prior owner didn't know how to sew or they would have hemmed the curtains.  They even put some elaborate valance in navy blue on the dining room side!  Something really heavy and totally inappropriate for the space.

{"title": "What makes life so great is NOTHING stays the same", "date": "Wednesday, May 18, 2005", "text": "It is an interesting time in my life and the lives of my children.  About two to three years ago when my son was too busy with college and friends and my daughter was too busy with a weekend social life and her husband, my husband and I made a conscious decision that we had to go forward with our lives.  We would have to fill our weekends with our own interests and hobbies because our children were busy with their lives and could not fill ours.  We knew that we would have to settle for seeing them every few months, even though they lived very close.     Therefore, on weekends our project was to find a quiet country place to which we could retire.  It had to be on the water for my husband’s comfort.  I only needed a view…mountain, stream, valley…didn’t make a huge difference to me.  Waterfront property on the other hand is very, very, very expensive…even if found in remote areas of the East Coast.  So it took many weekends to find something.  With some compromise we found a narrow, very expensive lot and decided that this would be our retirement home.  It was a little more than an hour from where our children might be living, but we wouldn’t get to see them much anyway with their busy social lives.     Well, here is my warning to all of you who have very social children in their early twenties.  When they reach their mid-twenties to late twenties, they suddenly need you.  They need your expertise on financial matters; your free time for babysitting; your  weekends for socializing when their spouse is gone and baby is the only company.  And, perhaps most interesting, your male child will suddenly want your opinion on furniture, wall colors, floor refinishing, and kitchen cabinets!  It seems as if my entire life has changed its focus in a matter of weeks.       My weekend—THIS weekend—I am probably going to be keeping my daughter company shopping for something…don’t know what the errand is yet.  I have also learned that I will be helping my son paint his condo as well as check out a furniture module he wants to purchase.  I sat with my son just now discussing a “da Vinci theme” with warm colors.  We were learning how to pick and match and discussing whether a natural floor stain would look better rather than a walnut stain after he refinishes his condo floors.  My free time on the weekend is gone.  And, of course, since I love them both and want to spend time with them, I will find another way to get my errands done.  I know that this ability to spend time with each of them can change in the blink of an eye.     By the way, you would have to know my son to realize how outstandingly strange this is to be discussing ‘da Vinci decorating themes”."},
{"title": "Brittany Spears Look-Alikes", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2005", "text": "I have often felt that our culture is in demise in terms of art and style. The one commodity that we export in surplus to the global economy is our entertainment industry. They gobble it up in spite of the fact that it has become mediocre and thus lacks uniqueness, lacks depth, lacks introspection, lacks surprise, lacks insight and of course lacks truth.I do firmly believe this. We will eventually find much greater art emerging from India, Afghanistan, and wherever else it is encouraged to flourish and wherever money does not drive it to death.And even though I believe all of the above is true, we still have those cultures that are in love with our culture. They are fascinated with us.I was reminded of this today when I got on the elevator with two young Asian girls. They were in their 20's and dressed casually as girls dress in this country. Yet something about their body language, their smiles, told me they were visiting foreigners to our campus. The real give away was evident as I turned to face the mirrored elevator door.   I clearly saw them check out my new shoes and slacks and evaluate my clothing style. Only girls this age from another country would be checking American styles this closely. I am too old for our American girls to care what I wear."},
{"title": "God is Truth", "date": "Saturday, May 14, 2005", "text": "Well, I learned my lesson a few days ago and am composing this blog in MSWord…instead of online.  I did several blogs which disappeared into thin air with a Blogger response something like…’Houston, we have a problem, we know it, we are working on it, we won’t get back to you on it…so try again later.”  I was so irritated having spent so much time on the blogs.  Then I saw that most of my posts to other sites also never made it…although I got no such error message!  It is sort of like being in parallel worlds, but we don’t know when the lines converge.     I was reading on of manababies blogs regarding her relationships with close and distant relatives and the death of her grandfather.  I have had so many of the same feelings.  I am the one blood relative of my immediate family (now that my younger sister passed away) that lives on the East Coast, all the rest of them live in Colorado.  They have gone through various stages of their relationships with each other.  I have missed it all being out here living my life.  I miss that, and while I have tried to keep my children close to them through expensive plane visits over the years and picture exchanges, etc., it is not the same thing as living within driving distance.  I often wonder what I have missed and how my feelings for them would be different if we shared more of our lives.     I do know that the death of my sister a few years back really brought us all much closer together.  It was the big neon sign on the wall that said ‘Time is passing…How are you living out YOUR life?’  We started emailing more often and trying to make plans together.  Then the recent death of my mother brought my sister and I much closer as we went through the process of obituaries, dinners, etc.   I began to realize that my sister is a very unspiritual person.  She gets irritated by religious myth and really irritated by people who practice religion on holidays and family funerals only.  She got into a little spat with my sister-in-law who was raised as a Catholic but doesn’t attend church anymore and hasn’t for decades.  My sister-in-law at the last minute wanted to have us ‘light a candle’ for mom at a church in downtown Denver.  She clearly wanted us to go with her.  I am pretty anti-Catholic…but only for myself.  What others believe, what ‘myth’ they follow, that is their choice.  Clearly my sister felt this was very hypocritical of my sister-in-law and said she was going to stay home and finish the obituary for the newspaper.  This was not a word fight—just subtle tension one notices under the service.  I saw my sister-in-law’s request a little differently.  I didn’t see it as my sister-in-law trying to take control of stuff or being hypocritical, just maybe a calling deep inside her from a prior Catholic life to do something symbolic.  I went with her and actually felt it might be good for me in some spiritual way.  Unfortunately it was Sunday with back to back masses and so we sat through a mass and didn’t get to light a candle as we had to leave early.  (The sermon was on the ‘dictatorial relativism’ that was pervading our society…the priest was clearly talking to all the liberals such as I at the service.)     My brother (the conservative one) was with Mom when she died.  She passed in a matter of an hour or so, he and Dad were the only ones there.  He says that she squeezed his hand and looked up at him, briefly and smiled just be fore she died.  I am assuming that she actually did that, as I don’t think he would be trying to make it easy for us.  Mom was cremated at her request.  We had a small viewing at the funeral home for immediate family but no funeral or memorial service.  The big family dinner was mostly people looking at pictures and reminiscing.  It was not a formal sit-down but a buffet at my brother’s home.  There was no real opportunity for words to be spoken in memory of my mother.  Clearly some of the old Italian relatives there were confused about the informality of it all.  My dad was probably relieved as he hates ceremony of any kind. I wished there had been an opportunity which forced me to say something…but I am getting more Buddhist and realize that the center of me is at peace and what surrounds me and what decisions are made outside do not need to be fought over.  Not in this instance anyway.  My mom knows I loved her, my family saw me give six weeks to her care and they know I loved her, I spent many hours with her, so I am at peace and do not need symbolism to solidify it. On the other hand, if we would have had a funeral Mass, I could have dealt with that process also.  The priest would have called my views here dictatorial relativism…nope, it is truth.  An as Ghandi said, God is truth."},
{"title": "Man and the Center of the Universe", "date": "Thursday, May 12, 2005", "text": "I am currently reading \"Ismael: An adventure of the mind and spirit\" by Daniel Quinn. It was featured in book stores back in 1992 when I bought it and I am just now getting around to reading it after finding it on the bottom of a book shelf. (Amazing what packing your household belongings will unearth.)The story premise is sophisticated, but the dialogue between the two characters and the character development is not, so I am a little disappointed. The theme appears to be all about Man seeing himself as the Center of the Universe and the problem with that premise.Along these lines, I attended a lecture today by a scientist from the Smithsonian Institution who works with dingoflagellates and other small stuff in the marine environment. His research is all about the algae that causes algal blooms (i.e. red tides, etc.) in the bays and oceans. This research has uncovered through the years new knowledge that what was once thought as cellular parts of an algal organism is in reality a parasite that later emerges (Alien style) and takes over the algal organism. The speaker showed an actual video on this process and it does emerge exactly like the Alien did from the human gut!! (This is, of course, an oversimplification of his decades of research, as he has discovered lots more interesting stuff...but my point and I do have a point...)Ok, what is my point here? Well, one of the questions from the audience was 'how can we use this information on algal parasites to control the growth of the \"bad\" algal blooms' and this question was coupled with another question about the new research on non-indigenous oysters also being introduced to the Chesapeake Bay for much of the same reason--control of algal growth. This scientist, in spite of his love of research and desire to culture the parasites and watch them interact with the algae, made a clear and important point. This control approach was all about treating the symptoms of the disease in our oceans and not preventing the disease.And I guess my statement here is that mankind causes much of the earth's problems and then spends much intellectual effort trying to control the universe to fix these problems which he alone has caused. All he has to do is stop causing the problem in the first place.(For those of you not into science, we need to control the agriculture runoff, cattle allowed to wade into streams, building and development inland, toilet flushing, car driving, global warming etc. and the algal problem in our oceans will diminish greatly. Of course, this does mean some economic sacrifice on our part--duh.)The Bible says that man was put in dominion over the plants and the animals. I don't think so. They seem to get the rhythm of life without our interference. We are the ones that keep screwing up!OK.  Enough blogging.  Just glad to get access back after days."},

{"title": "The Constant Traveler", "date": "Monday, May 02, 2005", "text": "Full Fathom Five's recent post was about travel.  She was looking back sort of freeze-framing her life before her travel to England to visit a sister.  She was reviewing all the negatives and positives about travel.  I have traveled so much in my lifetime and to many different countries, sometimes for a short business trip or vacation, sometimes for a longer stay (a month) and sometimes to live (years).  In each instance there was some negative and some positive experiences.  Even today I will still get a little concerned about missing the flight, getting a seat, finding my destination when I arrive.  But if I have traveled within a few months, this concern is very small and at the back of my mind.       If it has been almost a year or longer since I traveled, my concerns do have a tendency to grow.  If I travel with my husband, the concern lessens greatly, because there are two minds on the details.       Travel in some ways is easier and some ways more difficult than it used to be. The new security measures where you have to remove jackets, shoes, handbags is a hassle.  Those of us who are older try to get the shoes and jackets back on speedily - but it is with some effort.  In addition, having to keep a boarding pass and ID out and ready increases greatly the chance that you will drop it or leave it somewhere.  (Several times I have actually put the damn things in my mouth in order to put on shoes or jacket.  This is something the security people just love to see, as you can imagine.)     The easier part of travel has to do with the technology.  I actually made my recent reservation to visit my family after my mother's death by talking to a computer at United via telephone.  I was able to get a ticket and give it my membership number and VISA, etc. without much problem!  When I arrived at the airport passengers now check in at an electronic kiosk and don't get to a human being unless you have to check bags (as some of you now know).  The only other time you talk to an airline person before boarding is if you need to get a seat assignment or if someone frisks you.  I envision a future where we deal with NO staff until the stewardess appears at our seat.     The travel process changes so often that I am amazed people seem to get through it as easily as they do.     My boss just returned from a conference in Belgium.  She was delayed by weather to New York and missed her international flight along with a number of other people and had to stay overnight in a nearby hotel.  She told me about an Arabic woman (elderly) that traveled from Florida and was heading back to her home in Saudi Arabia.  She spoke no English.  A young man from Africa took sympathy with her, seeing her struggling with the flight changes and the lack of Delta Airlines support, and actually got her bags at another area, rechecked them and her into another flight and sat with her until she could board, before he headed off for a hotel since his flight was also delayed!  I guess this little story shows that in spite of the technology, human citizenship is still an important element.     Travel is always an \"Alice in Wonderland\" experience.  The stress either makes you grow or shrink.  Remember that!"},

You can read about parental death and talk to others about their experiences, but it is just like getting married or having children.

I have lots of rough spots.I sat down at the computer this morning after getting Hubby off to Hawaii and decided to surf some blogs on the net.

It is thick with lots of ads as well as articles (although most of the articles are about stuff you can buy). When I was in Junior High we had a project where we got our favorite magazine (mine was probably Seventeen) and we were told to paste paper over all the advertisements. It was a good illustration of the huge percentage that any magzine devotes to ads and the very little bit of information articles for the money you spend. But, I digress.My daughter makes lots of money ( I am guessing about $9o,000 or $100,000 when you add  bonuses.  She has only been working about four years! Her husband makes a little more.) Those golden handcuffs are hard to give up. She is planning on going back to work in three months, but I already see the pain in her eyes when this is brought lightly into the conversation. We live in an area where a standard three bedroom house is about $400,000. There is lots of pressure to work. I wish that I was going to be living nearby as this would make the decision easier, but I am not.In the May issue of Real Simple it is fortuitous (maybe) that there was an article titled \"What's a Mother to do?\" It covers the debate over whether a woman should return to work or stay at home after the birth of a child. They interview four women with their grown daughters and each have chosen different paths.  I find this article so interesting because it really touches a sensitive cord with me.  I stayed at home with both children until the youngest was ten. I was not rich, but I was also NOT poor. I didn't have to work. We didn't eat out, go to movies, and I only had two outfits for church. But these were not sacrifices in my mind.The sacrifices for me were falling behind in my career and never really making the better salary, spending time without adults for endless days which is really hard, missing out on a creative side of my self that I had to shelve and the long hours - working seven days a week. The good stuff was knowing my children were being raised by someone who would die for them, someone who was close to their gene pool and therefore understood them, and getting to see all that wonderful special stuff that children show as they reach each new challenge.There are no good choices. The magazine article seems to make it appear that there is no wrong way. But I think that oversimplifies. There is really no right way either. Whichever road you choose, you make important and long-term sacrifices.  And the idiocy in this debate is that most women do not have a choice!"},

He was born at 8:23 PM on April 5 after 9 hours of labor. (Obstetrician said due date was April 10 and it would not be born on time, so they set a date for induction on April 20. Even with all this new science doctors are still just making educated guesses.) My son, the baby's uncle, has nicknamed the little guy Xman and since the parents don't seem to mind, that is what he will be for a while. I cannot begin to describe all the feelings going through me. Watching my hulking son hold his tiny nephew was priceless.It IS just like riding a bike. All the baby stuff comes flooding back and I feel very comfortable going into grandma mode for my first one.

They were discharged from the hospital around noon and when we got to their home at 4:30 PM all three were out like hibernating bears. The baby fell asleep in my arms and I held him for at least 2 and half hours, just couldn't put him down.I think the new daddy is in the most shock. He had no idea that this would involve so many details in life and so much lack of sleep. But he is so much in love with this new person, he has no complaints. My daughter, on the other hand, seems a little more laid back. She is working hard on breast feeding, and when I remember the ups and downs I had with that, I can empathize. Fortunately, it all worked out and I was able to breast feed both of them for almost a year.Today hubby is back at work full time for the first time since his operation. I think he got a burst of energy from holding his grandson.We are going for a drive this afternoon to me with our builder and look at the draft of the adjusted plans. Things are going slower than we hoped and I will blog why on my house building blog.In between all of the above and my work I am driving around the city looking for a condo or coop with my son. He did bid on one condo in a nice young area of town, but lost out to someone who bid 30% over the selling price with an added escalation clause. Is this real estate market ride ever going to end?Well, this weekend, I hope to get some of my own stuff done."},
{"title": "Pre Mother's Day Celebration", "date": "Saturday, April 02, 2005", "text": "Today is the day my very pregnant daughter has set aside for some activity with me as a mother’s day thing. She will be a new mother herself on the actual Mother’s Day.   She is showing up about noon and bringing a 'light' lunch. Then we are off to some secret activity. Weather is miserable and it has been pouring rain on and off all night and should continue throughout the day. I hope this does not interfere with our plans. Actually, just getting to spend most of the day one on one with her is worth all the gold in the world to me. Spending time with those you love where you can focus on each others ideas and plans is so rare in a busy life and I know as her life gets busier, it will be much rarer.We (Hubby, son and I) have been looking at condos to purchase since we have to move out of our rental house in a few months. My son is pretty stressed as he wants his own place, and at his age really does need his space. We are giving him his 'wedding money' and then loaning him another $10k and I think it will result in him buying a one bedroom for just himself. Real estate here is outrageous and without our help, he would find it very difficult to purchase anything.  His job now seems stable and he has paid off all of his debt except for some of his low interest student loans. He is almost 27 and certainly does need breathing room. He works the night shift and seems stressed about not meeting any 'smart' girls with this schedule. He indicated to H. that he doesn't have too many years left to meet the right girl at his age and living in a better (echo generation) neighborhood would help.  (I wish I knew why his old girlfriend broke up with him.  They made a really good couple.)In addition, since I have to work in this area much longer before my retirement, Hubby and I are stressing about whether buying a condo for ourselves or just continuing renting an apartment is the best solution. Since I will only be up here two to three nights a week, renting a place seems such a waste of money. We can commute if all else fails, but I would have to work less hours in the day since the commute is 1 1/2 hours each way. Buying a condo is a big financial commitment for that time period and means we will be pretty poor which I am saving even more towards retirement. Then I would spend the rest of each week in our new home. H. is going back and forth about just exactly when he would retire...he has a much more flexible financial situation. And all of this has to come to a head by JULY! H. and son are looking at more places this weekend.     I met with a downtown realtor this week and son and I looked at two places.  They were both supposed to be two bedroom.  One was one of these brand new ‘New York style’ loft condos.  It had granite and stainless steel kitchen, pedestal sinks, sliding etched glass doors between the rooms, and big windows looking outside.  Sounds great doesn’t it.  Well, it was way outside out price range (over $460K) and really awful for living while nice for showing.  The size of the whole condo was only 800 square feet the second bedroom had no privacy and the closet was the size of small broom closet.  The bathrooms while new had no cabinets or even floor space for storage cabinets.  The dining area was a sitting area and food prep area all in one.  And the windows looked out over a car repair lot and run down industrial area!  So much for the styles in New York!  The second place was in an older building, cheaper in price, but much more charming, about 1200 square feet.  The kitchen was a disaster with really old appliances, and there was absolutely no place to park anywhere near the building which would be a crisis for my son a 2:00 AM.     I so look forward to the time when my life is once again in a rut."},

She lives on the other side of the continent from me. Her father owns a decent amount of rental income property in California in addition to getting a salary from his job, so money is not an issue in this girl's life...although her father can be somewhat miserly.Anyway, I send her emails and cards and see her on some holidays. She rarely responds to these including not sending thank you notes even though she likes us and is sweet to us when we briefly get together face to face over rare holidays.This morning I got an email from her (actually from Urbanoutfitters registry) telling me what she would like for her upcoming birthday. (SHE REGISTERED for her birthday?) Then she sent a follow-up email, after months of not hearing from her, telling me a little about what is happening in her life and then joking about her upcoming birthday.I will certainly send her a birthday gift, but I am concerned about the parental guidance she needs in this...should I scold her about not communicating for long periods of time?...should I remind her that I didn't get a thank you for the Christmas gift and have no idea if she liked it? I have never wanted to be one of those sanctimonious aunts...but the girl has a somewhat absent father in terms of providing her social guidance...he is also busy dating someone else right now. And I know how distracting that can be to the male animal."},
{"title": "Resurrect the Weekend", "date": "Saturday, March 26, 2005", "text": "My daughter called at work and said that her in-laws were driving in from out-of-state on Sunday and wanted to get together with all of us for early dinner or late lunch. She suggested that we try to find a place near where we live incase H. gets too tired and has to head home to rest his neck, which I thought was a good idea.I suggeted Eggspectations or Macaroni Grill which are downtown and five minutes from the house. Niether is very special but they are close, food is good, service is excellent and prices are fine. Well her husband nixed that because they are not \"fancy\" enough. After talking to my daughter we determined that there are NO 'fancy' restaurants where we live so we will have to go at least 30 minutes away for a fancier restaurant. This resulted in her spending a lot more time on the phone trying to get last minute reservations so that we would not have to stand in line which H. can't do for long periods of time.I asked why it had to be a \"fancy\" restaurant since her husband's parents are regular folk and not inclined to spend large sums of money. \"Mom, it's Easter weekend...and J. wants to go someplace nice with his parents.\"OK, so it doesn't make any sense to me what Easter has to do with fancy restaurants and why sacrifice on his good Catholic part so that my H. can be comfortable is not a Christian gesture. I am not mad, just another reason why I will probably never get back into this religion thing. I keep hitting these brick walls with the very devout.  It ends being what you think you should do, or how you look doing it, and not about what you are doing and why.  I realize that all religious people are not like this, but I keep running into the shallow ones.It's a BIG picture thing with me.  God, if he is there, is sooo much larger than the sum of the parts of this universe.  If we just tried to be more God-like or like we think he/she is then life would make more sense.H. who is way off his sleep schedule now since he slept in until 10:30 this morning, came to bed after watching some TV movie at about 11:30 tonight. Then he got back up twenty minutes later because he thought he heard some voices arguing in the street...well, guess who is now sleeping ever so deeply and who after being woken twice can't get back to sleep?I got up and heated some milk. This is more a ritualistic habit since I don't really find it helps me sleep better So, I guess I will either make crank phone calls or blog. This blogging should be full of errors since I left my glasses on my nightstand rather than grub around for them and wake him up. Thank goodness for the enlarge text feature on windows.I am sitting in the computer room surrounded by a half dozen boxes packed with books and office supplies and photo stuff. I have a dried flower arrangement on the shelf in front of me that I need to donate to the office. It is too nice to throw away. I bought it to decorate my office in my prior job. I had this really large office with lots of room for desk, credenza, bookshelves. When I accepted this new job at another agency five years ago, I got a promotion, but I also am in a tiny tiny cubicle. I get a window, but this cubicle is really the size of a closet and it is constantly a mess since I can't organize papers from projects or get stuff filed fast enough.H. also got a bunch of nice plants that will get donated since there are no places for plants in this rental house.My son has already moved his extensive audio equipment and two computers to a friends basement where they are working on his music. So, at least this room looks like we are making progress. Now only the bedroom, bathroom living room, dining room, kitchen and basement to go. Boy is this going to be fun!My son is not too thrilled about us living with him in a condo for quite a while longer. It just can't be helped. But he needs his privacy and I did tell him he could go off on his own at any time. But, he knows that it is in his best interest to go in on co-ownership of this condo. He cannot afford anything in this crazy real estate market on his own. I keep reading articles that say the real estate market is leveling off, or going to crash or still going to climb for years ahead due to demand. Clearly none of the 'experts' have a clue.Well, guess I will head back to bed and try to sleep. I have my cleaning friend coming at 9:30 this morning...so can't make a mistake of sleeping in."},

He still is not supposed to drive while on the drugs. (I think that he will be able to drive this weekend though.) The therapist DIDN'T schedule any therapy sessions! He said hubby was in such good shape and had such great flexibility that it would be a waste of time to try to improve in a 'clinical' atmosphere. So, he gave him some exercises to do once a day at home for a while and then every other day. He said that hubby had the best recovery he had every seen in a patient! Needless to say hubby is on cloud 9. He is also already on the phone to his office starting work via phone.H. said something strange on the drive to the therapist. He said that he hadn't really realized how complicated a marriage relationship was and how important it was to share your life with the right person. (See, staying home for two weeks to wait on him hand and foot rang a bell somewhere ;-). He had been feeling very vulnerable and was so dependent on my thinking for day to day decisions in addition to just providing daily care for him.I guess we women have felt the 'vulnerable' mode more often by virtue of the barriers to our gender. I also think women are more willing to compromise and sacrifice in an immediate time and worry about the ramifications down the road. We want the problems worked out. That is probably why we get stuck in bad marriages as we think if just compromise a little longer it will work itself out."},

I have been making him walk two to three miles every morning and then maybe another mile in the P.M. Actually 'making' is not the word; 'Motivating\" is the better word, because he really wants to get out and stretch and test his strength. He is still napping mornings and evenings between the walks. Today I let him sleep in until 9:00 after which he got up on his own, showered, shaved and then ate my breakfast of cut oranges, biscuits and honey, bacon and hot tea--not exactly traditional, but I was trying to use up stuff.Late this P.M. he is listening to Bocelli and snoozing on the couch...not really napping. I am making fish fillets, tarragon beans and fried potatoes with garlic for dinner. We will probably have ice cream for dessert. I am sipping a Chardonnay (which those of you who visit my wine blog know is not my favorite...will rate this one later.) This is starting to sound like a restaurant menu blog.Anyway, I spent the day packing bookshelves in the basement, doing laundry, and working on the Paintshop Pro 9 version for which I have a 60 day free download. Maybe I will buy the upgrade...haven't decided. I'll upload one of the many photos I was working on for your perusal.Hubby and I did take a short walk this P.M. just before the first thunderstorm in months came briefly through. It left some lovely sunshine patterns and sky colors before the gray sunset. It was nice hearing thunder after the long winter. Birds are just absolutely crazy singing with mating passion and establishing territory. Hubby heard one lovely piercing song that we didn't recognize as it was lower down in a tree behind a house. But, it did perk his interest.Well, buzzer has gone off...so must set out food."},

{"title": "Who Are the People in Your Neighborhood?", "date": "Wednesday, March 16, 2005", "text": "We currently rent a small house just off a very busy intersection and a few blocks from a huge magnet school. (A 'magnet\" school is a school that is placed in a poor neighborhood and offers a very specialized science, math, arts or other program to attract students from other parts of the city, and theoretically to officer a better education to inner city kids...I don't think it works, but that is another blog.)I took my husband for a walk near a lake and on the way back drove into the nearby gas station to get some gas. About 40 students were congregated near the bus stop on the corner. They were about 70% black, 25% Latino, and 5% white from my quick survey. Everyone was dressed in large hanging black clothes, as if they belonged to the same private school or club. They all looked in their early teens. They were loud, active and truly enjoying the beginning of spring and those flowing hormones. I proceeded to fill up my car.Suddenly 5 or six of the black boys ran through the gas station, laughing and looking back. Some of the other kids called out to them. There was no aura of danger or anger...just noisy kids. Then a police car came around the corner and drove into the gas station and parked just in front of my car. Another large police officer appeared from the bus station corner walking behind the kids with a flak jacket on. The kids were like a large anemone...they instantly shrunk into little black mounds and watched quietly for their bus.I finished getting gas, and squeezed past the police car and out onto the busy road. As I turned the corner past where the bus stop was, I had to make a wide right turn as three more police cars were parked with lights flashing in that lane of the busy street.I couldn't see anything happening or even any police talking to the kids. I am guessing that it was gang related and that the police are on alert that time of the day in the spring...who knows. I have always lived in a middle-class white neighborhood (except for when I lived in various countries overseas) and so I am totally ignorant of this stuff! I do know that my son who is a BIG 26-year-old guy, never goes to the fast food places past this bus stop between 3:00 and 4:00 in the afternoon because of all the kids hanging out after school.I was never afraid during this incident...just curious.  They look like nice normal kids to me.  But, maybe they have issues."},

What with hubby on strong meds I guess only one of us can safely feel no pain at this time. Maybe I should change the name to Weakly Wino. What do you think?I have been spending lots of time upstairs sitting or laying in bed next to hubby. He is doing very well, but since he has the personality and energy level of the Energizer Bunny, I can see that he is not anywhere near his usual self yet. He moves stiffly and if he sits up for more than 10 or fifteen minutes the pain starts to increase. Yet he will walk around the room for 10 minutes at a time when he can.Friends and co-workers have sent flowers and plants and they are now taking up so much space, my son knocked one of them over yesterday. The flowers really boost hubby's spirits though.Talking him into his second shower this morning took some effort. He is so frustrated in that the pain medication and the tranquilizer cut down on muscle spasms. When I asked him how he was feeling yesterday, he joked, \"Just great...I can't swallow, I can't pee and I can't shit. Other than that I am fine.\" He doesn't swear, so I knew the drugs were working.I am trying to keep busy doing short projects around the hosue so that I can keep checking on him. I don't want him moving around unless I am there to keep an eye on his progress. These drugs are really strong.I am calling the doctor tomorrow on what we can do this coming week to get him up and going.

I refuse to lose. Months before the 9/11 tragedy, one of my younger sisters emailed me that she had skin cancer. They couldn't find the original mole but it had moved into her lymph glands in her legs. This bad news was followed by the attacks in New York.That winter I began having back problems. It seemed that some days I was in so much pain, I didn't want to get out of bed. I began to understand what depression truly was and felt myself spiraling downward.All of this happening over just  a few months began to wear on me, but I got angry. I went out to visit my sister and tried to send her optimistic thoughts and also started an intense exercise program to get my back in shape. I was told that I had just a touch of arthritis and there was nothing that could be done. Well, my back returned to much less pain but my sister died that summer.We sold our house the following spring and it was a very traumatic time as the buyer was a smart real estate woman who kept claiming more and more from us until finally we had to go to a lawyer to get the whole thing to stop. She got the house and we got peace of mind--for a while.We moved into a rental house that flooded three times that summer---the wettest in history on the East Coast. After much midnight mopping and the loss of some of our \"worldly\" possessions, we broke the lease and moved once again into another little house. Things calmed down... for a while.This past fall my mother got ill and this winter, as you readers know, she began to die. Upon my return from putting her in hospice we learned that my husband had stenosis of the spine and needed surgery on four of his vertebrae. The surgery is this morning.Our landlady cannot renew our lease, and so, in four months we have to find a new temporary place to live incurring all the costs and time of packing and moving once again! Probably buying a condo with our son and absorbing all the costs that entails...working longer and not being able to retire as early.Last night as I lay in bed, I began to think of all these stresses. It seems my life had been so calm and normal before. Maybe this is now normal life and I lived in some pathetic dream time before. I don't know, but I am still fighting.

But I also find that I am attracted to the young married guitar player, the five brothers who work in geekdom, the young owl, mom's with babies and teenagers...all of which keep me linked to the people in my real life that I love.Then, because I have traveled so much in my life I am always intrigued by those who live around the world and are able to blog in English...so that I can maybe show that Americans are indeed more complex than the sum of their parts.Blogging is certainly going to change the world in so many ways.

{"title": "The Megapode Bird", "date": "Thursday, February 24, 2005", "text": "(Link to a website is in the post title) This fellow weighs a little less than a pound and is not a beautiful bird to look at. He/she looks like a brown ugly chicken. He is VERY VERY shy and although we lived there for years I only caught shadowy glimpses of them. If I remember correctly, their sound is that of a very cautious chicken clucking a warning. I would try to follow that sound as I crossed one of the islands. Because they were so hard to observe, I was always fascinated with them.They have heavy thick legs which they use to build nests on the ground. These nest are quite large and if you come on one, it looks like a pile of compost in the middle of the island. Thus the strong legs. The chicks don't have an 'egg-tooth' and use the strong legs to kick out of the shell. The heat from the next is what allows the eggs to incubate and then hatch. Thus, sometimes they are called the incubator bird.Since their nests are at ground level, they are subject to all kinds of predation and exposure. Therefore, they are really endangered. When I lived there, which was decades ago, their habitat was under pressure. I hate to think what has happened over the years and now with this television show... Maybe when I retire I can do some kind of volunteer effort to help the cause of protecting them.As commented, electricity and running water are 'givens' in this civilized world of ours. I remember coming back from living in Palau (as well as another overseas place) and facing the loss of electricity after a snowstorm or a hurricane or whatevaaa. My neighbor who lived in a lovely LARGE colonial house on the hill behind us would call within minutes of finding herself without one of the 'givens.'\"Do you have electricity?\"\"How long have you been without electricity?\"\"Did you call the utility company?\"\"When do you think we will get it back?\"I can remember thinking that there are people who live without electricity for much longer than 30 minutes or three days or whatever crisis hits the U.S. I remember thinking what spoiled brats Americans are...what failures at coping. What a little princess I have living next door. She really needed to be in a condo in the city, but she and her children wanted to go to a certain school and she had to live in a large house surrounded by acres filled with such scary things as deer, fox, ground hogs, etc.Since my hubby and I loved camping it took us no time to get the fireplace going for warmth or cooking and a lantern or candles for light or brushing our teeth on the back deck since our septic pump didn't work  and then we went back to what we were doing.I will admit that now that I have lived with the 'givens' for a couple of decades, the hurricane two years ago that left us without power for 5 days, WAS a challenge. But it was mostly the challenge of having to wait to get stuff. Long lines and traffic problems without lights.For my owl friend I will blog next about megapode...not a a parrot but cool none-the-less."},

We are not Survivor fans, (the show sometimes reminds me of all the pain I went through in Junior High School.)But, this season we made a special point to watch because we had lived in Palau for about seven years back in the late 60's early 70's. The beach where they brought the new survivors was a beach that my daughter had run naked on for many an afternoon...of course she was only two at the time. It is a lovely long beach and we would dig for small clams for soup before we headed home.  It was an easy beach to swim or snorkel from as well.There are many beaches of all shapes and sizes on the islands and if we saw a boat at a beach that we were heading for (on a very rare day), we just turned and went somewhere else. As newlyweds my husband and I could camp overnight and spend most of the day naked on the island. Yep, it was idyllic. Of course, back at our apartment in the town of KOROR we could go for most of the day without electricity or running water. Just depended on generators working and the guy who turned on the water spicket not being drunk.We lived there before the traffic lights, the television station, etc. So, the only entertainment was a Japanese drive-in movie which showed mostly kung-fu stuff, playing Stratego with other expatriots at the resort hotel or boating. We had a motor boat and a catamaran. Both got lots of use. Maybe, I'll get lucky and go back there some day."},

Then as time passed, I had to leave for a trip.  My hubby (with the help of my daughter, as he would have NEVER done this years ago) took me to Boston for the weekend as a surprise for Valentine's Day.  Only we went this past weekend instead of Valentine's weekend.  I had never been to Boston, but it certainly is a city that is easy to love.  And I say this after braving the 20 to 30 degree weather and blasting winds each day!  Very easy city to get around in and the food at Little Italy is the best food I have eaten in quite a while-excellent wines as well. One of the waiters introduced me to an Italian rose (not the cloying sweet type) and as soon as I find the notes on it, I will research for my wine blog.We took in a comedy improve show, saw Blue Man Group, went to Harvard and the Fogg museum (which was my homage to Gilmore Girls-yes I am an addict)and even went to an IMAX show and stopped and shopped in Chinatown at a local store.  We also walked and walked and walked to see as much of the Freedom trail as we could with the nasty weather. I'll post a few pics for those who have not been there."},

{"title": "Coming of Age Stuff", "date": "Wednesday, February 16, 2005", "text": "Had a lengthy talk with my son this afternoon after I got home from work.  He works for a large network and handles the evening audio work for some of their programs  a lucky entry level job he got.  He is starting to discover all the sneaky stuff, the insecurity of higher ups, etc in a high pressure industry.  Seems that a little scandal with one of the program stars as well as another promotional event that went awry has given him the job jitters.  His job is probably still pretty secure, but he has seen people get disciplined for a failure that was not due to their work and it bothers him that the executives don't want to move beyond placing blame...i.e. finding out what happened and trying to prevent it from happening again.Some of the executive's friends complained about the sound of the promotional program and all the clues lead to the locale and the distributing network--not the original audio engineer who my son thinks is one of the best in the business.  Fortunately my guy is smart enough to realize all the crap that people put themselves through to make themselves feel safe and important.  But it doesn't help the bottom line which is to produce an excellent product and to back up good talent.  He would make an excellent head of the department---hope he lasts that long.I have always worked for the public and while never being able to make bonuses or a large salary, I do have job security.  That is the trade off.  The office politics crap still exists though, if on a smaller and less tense scale.  Welome to the real world.Actually the story on this Amaryllis plant is more interesting, since superMANA commented.  I once would buy an amaryllis bulb every year.  Then I would put them outside in the spring after blooming and kept them slightly watered and fertilized and then bring them in to go dormant in the fall.  In a few years I had dozens of bulblets alongside the bigger bulbs and soon I had about 3 dozen plants blooming each January through March.  They would be standing in front of my french doors like wooden soldiers.  When I moved to this rental house I knew I had to get a grip.  So I donated my babies to the library white elephant sale for $5.00 each.  They were huge bulbs and did make some money for the library.  Now I am down to five plants--three with potential to bloom. The fifth plant is a  Scadoxus multiflorus  from South Africa that I bought at the Phildelphia Flower show three years ago and which I have managed to keep going and blooming each spring by treating it the same way.  It is an exciting flower and I will take a picture of it when it blooms.  Right now it is sitting in the pot looking dead (and surrounded by three --count em---three new babies!)."},

I kept coming upon entries where people were sick and snuffling and aching and coughing, etc.  So, naturally, I caught it!  This is the second day I have been home with a sore throat and some sneezing.  Not really sick enough to stay home, but not well enough to really go to work since I don't sleep well at night.  On top of this my husband has received some bad health news.  His neck ache which he has had on and off for years, is now diagnosed as stenosis of the spine.  Which means he has to have spine surgery in March.  Without the surgery he is probably going to get worse with an increased numbing of his lower body --- everything below his shoulders --- and eventual paralysis.  He has been in excellent health his entire life, so he is not taking this well.  He also fears hospitals about 400% more than the average male.The good news is that the surgery is 97% successful in patients.  These are the kinds of percentages that doctors do not throw around carelessly.  So, I am comfortable with this news --- at least as comfortable as anyone can be with such serious news.  Good thing that there is the Family Sick Leave Act.  Between my husband and my daughters birth in April, I will be back in nursing mode in no time."},

While talking to Mom (who rarely got stuff straight when she was younger) Mom said that my sister had bought her a vibrator over the Internet because her bottom was so sore and now she really felt good when she used it.  (Oh, the images, I am sure you can imagine.)  I choked back the laughter until my Sis got on the phone and then chastised her about getting carried away with shopping for mom.  Of course, she explained that the 'vibrator' was a chair pad which the nurse had suggested would improve her circulation in the area where she sat for such long periods of time.\r\rI am still putting in my vote for the 'other' vibrator when I get to be 84!I am married to an intellectual scientist.

It is about a foot high, so we spent most of the P.M. sorting and filing and destroying. \r\rThis afternoon I spent hours trying to figure out my new Sony minicam which I got for Christmas.  Took some movies at Christmas at mom and dad's.  Trying to discern how to download the files from the digital tape.  How to edit them.  Cannot get them to write to a DVD  although I have a DVD writer on this HP!!!  Made a CD and captured the files as MPEG to the PC but the quality is terrible.  Edited one short movie with titles and it plays OK but when I sent it to my email the resolution disappeared totally.  Does anyone out there know the secret to this?\r\rThis is such a headache, I may just stick to a still camera.  I thought that I could record to a DVD disk and watch it in high quality on the TV.

{"title": "Passing Time", "date": "Saturday, January 22, 2005", "text": "The psychology books are all full of insights and analysis of what one goes through when helping or seeing our parents make that passage into and through death.  We all handle it differently based on our relationship with our parents as well as our relationship with ourselves.  Do we feel anxious about the passage of time or are we resolute in accepting it?\r\rI really want to study the Eastern religions such as Buddhism more because they are more in tune with the now and not so much the past or the future.  This thinking also reminds me of Heraclitus (at least I think it was him) who said you never step into the same river twice.  The NOW is so precious and so perfect that we must drink it fully and not worry about what follows.  I guess it is sort of being willing to relinquish control and just ride the wave, enjoy the cold, taste the wine.\r\rMy conservative brother would sit on the couch and say he was 'enjoying' this process.  He found it 'fascinating.'  Yet, when I talked about this with my sister, she and I both agree that his clinical approach, his cold analysis is how he deals with everything in life.  He can watch the person walk in their shoes, but he will never be able to see himself in their shoes.Tried to submit new blog, but something was not working at this end.  Maybe too much snow on the lines?\r\rI made it home in the early evening yesterday.  The flight was delayed by an hour and a half...never found out why.

It was a nice change, but expensive on the free miles!\r\rMaking a French white bean and ham soup today to counter the cold weather.  Son is getting home this afternoon to shovel the driveway and hubby is returning from a trip also this P.M.

I have changed the bedding one last time.  I am checking prescriptions, supplies,etc. to make sure that we have enough stuff for at least another week or so.\r\rMy brother is going to be with her on Thursday when I leave and through Friday.  I hope that his wife comes with him--she is semi-retired.  Then my sister will  be here on the weekend.  Mom is now in a little pain from her tush beginning to get a rash.  She moans and groans in her sleep.  This is the hard part of caring for someone, keeping their skin from breaking down.\r\rShe is in the wheelchair for more moves.  It works much better,  but the trade-off is that her legs will now get weaker.\r\rI get ot head back east--weather here today was high 60's and sunny.  Back east looks miserable.  Windy, cold and snowy.  UGH!This is the beginning of my last week before I head back home and try to repair what control I have lost over my job.  I feel relief to be coming to an end of my responsibilities, I feel guilt because although my mother gets weaker each day, the more difficult role is going to have to fall to my siblings.  I am anxious knowing that I will soon be back this way for a funeral.  I am angry at myself for not being stronger in all of this.  I live the farthest away and this transistion is going to be the easiest for me, since I don't see my mother more often than once a year.\r\rToday may be the day we have to transition to using the wheel-chair to get back and forth to the bathroom.  Her legs work most of the time, but sometimes she cannot move them and she almost collapses.  I stand close behind her and am ready to grab her if needed.  She is somewhat heavy, so I honestly don't know if I could do anything except slow her collapse.\r\rLast week my Dad was talking about the doctor's diagnosis being inaccurate.  I think he thought she was going to die in a matter of weeks and now that she has lasted almost two months, he was keeping some hope.  But this week he is seeing her get weaker.  She now is getting pain in her side as well.  I am giving her over the counter pain pills as the nurse said we could start with the small stuff.\r\rMy sister wants me to handle any funeral research.  I did this with my youngest sister when she died, but I had her husband to work with.  Now I have to try to call the funeral homes nearby and get information all on my own.  Mom has already said she wants to be cremated and she doesn't want a funeral at the cemetery.  That leaves decisions on a memorial service.  While she has lived in this small town for decades, most of her friends have preceded her in death.  So, I don't know who the memorial service would be for except family.  I think that two of her sisters that are living are too old to travel to the service as well.\r\rOf course in the back of my mind is that in a short time (hopefully years) I will be doing something like this for my dad.  \r\rWhen does the upside of living start again?"},

This is America and I am not surprised the Bush got re-elected now.  \r\rSports figures make way too much money and frequently don't deliver.\r\rElderly people have very specific routines and usually for very good reasons, but it will take a few mistakes to figure this out.\r\rMy parents are very frugal.  They can bend a penny sideways and that is why after years of mostly social security, they are financially secure.\r\rPeople in small towns fit the stereotype of friendliness with strangers.  They are very nice and courteous.  They ask how your holiday was, make eye contact and actually seem to like people contact.\r\rWhen taking care of an older weak person, you think that you are spending a lot of time sitting and eldersitting.  Yeah, right, just try and watch a movie or read a book!\r\rIt doesn't take too many days to begin to appreciate having that second cup of coffee and not having to rush out the door.\r\rBrothers and sisters (at least mine) are worth twice their weight in gold.

Lots of good sausage, egg pasta, salad, garlic bread, gorgonzola polenta and even chicken!  Ice cream for those who had room for dessert.\r\rMy sister-in-law helped dye my hair while the rest of the family watched the Green Bay/Vikings game.  It was interesting having her help as we have not had a chance to get to know each other well.  So there are some good things that come out of bad things.\r\rThen since one of my brother's old laptops that I was using as a dial-up access quit on me, my brother gave me his Apple laptop and set up a dial-up even though this is wireless.  Since his OS is more up-to-date, I can now blog from the farmhouse!\r\rWe also had a meeting on Friday and over pizza and lots of beer and wine everyone felt it was best that Mom and Dad still stay here at the farmhouse after I head back in two weeks.  They are going to rotate on two and three day shifts staying with them.  My one brother who can take the least time off, will stay on weekends.  The other two will stay throughout the week.  We are also hiring a student nurse for 4 hours twice a week to help with the transition times.  It will be complicated, but I think Mom will hold up so much better in her own house.\r\rWe are all anticpating her going into a coma in the coming weeks.  She is awake the whole time they are here, but when they leave she falls asleep immediately.  She gets weaker and weaker.  I have put some wrapped chocolates near her chair as she loves these.  Today she took one and started to unwrap it and then fell asleep.  She awoke a few minutes later and then continued to unwrap and fell asleep again.  I finally took it from her and unwrapped it and gave it to her.  She was releaved.\r\rI can only hope that my passage goes with at least some dignity and little railing and writhing!"},
{"title": "Snowy Winter Day", "date": "Thursday, January 06, 2005", "text": "Even though we have about 6 inches of snow, Dad still goes out for the warm lunch at the Center.  I hope I have the same fearlessness and driving skills at 90.  Considering that I don't feel that confident her in my fifties, I don't know that I will in a few decades.\r\rToday is the 5th of January.  I hope to post all the previous blogs I have put on this computer and today's blog up tomorrow.  There is a wireless coffee shop downtown, and if the roads are a little better, I will head out that way and sneak some time from the caretaking.  I have gone through the routine enough that I have a good idea of how long I can leave them.  Dad may sleep through Mom's call--but if I get her set before I leave, then I should be OK.\r\rWhen you are helping someone with the hospice process it is hard work.  But it is even more difficult if the person in hospice is close to you.  If I did not have my two brothers and one sister, this job would take an even greater toll on my physical and mental health.   It is the breaks that they give me and the ability to talk to someone else who has a vested interest in the outcome of this process that are my fresh air.\r\rThey are each pretty different in their approach to this challenge.  The brother closest in age to me is probably the most conservative in his approach.  He talks about it very little and only in the most practical and business-like terms.  He isn't big on hands-on care and prefers to talk mom to the bathroom or the dinner table from across the room.  He tends to approach her as if she is a stroke victim and just needs verbal reminders as a form of therapy. Since his retirement he is big on cooking and regularly brings lots of food for us.  His wife is from Europe and a very nurturing person.  She views my mother as her mother in some ways since she has lost both of her parents and does not have immediate relatives her or in Europe except for her two sons from a prior marriage. It would be so easy to put more of this burden on her, but I am trying very hard to avoid that.  She has been a good balance for my brother who might have turned into a stuffy old professor type without her enthusiasm and daring.  She has gotten on my other siblings nerves because she gets involved and forces us to make firm decisions and move forward.  She is also manipulative in a sweet way and that makes my sister angry.\r\rMy 'baby' brother is also more hands-off (the nature of most males) but his upbeat personality and joking nature are a real upper for my mother.  He is the one who immediately repairs something around the house or outside if you mention it as a problem.  He has a small construction company and works about 7.5 days a week.  Both here at the farm and now more frequently on a duplex rental unit he has purchased as security for his retirement.  Yesterday he came to move the outside mailbox which now sits behind a semi-permanent puddle of ice on the north side of a tall fence.  Now it is closer to the driveway gate so my Dad doesn't ice skate to pick up the mail.\r\rMy younger sister is very hands-on and also continually buying things for them.  She and her husband are attorneys with only one grown step-son, so money is readily available to them.  Still, I know people who have money and are not generous at all.  (The husband of my late sister comes to mind.)  My sister had taken Mom through her first battle with cancer and so she has dealt with the ugliness of this process.  I truly think that we have given Mom her dignity by being as practical and nonchalant as possible with her accidents.  She bemoans her weakness but not in any long term way that brings us down.\r\rWe are all getting together for dinner this coming Thursday (6th) and talk about making permanent plans in moving my parents when I leave and head back home on the 21st. This meeting was motivated by my sister-in-law...so the siblings are a little miffed.\r\rMom needs someone with her all the time.  If she falls, Dad cannot lift her.  If she doesn't get bathroom care, her hygiene falls by the wayside.\r\rWell, enough about the sibs.  I am making a spaghetti Sunday dinner which has always been a tradition with my parents.  Although, I am not cooking the traditional fried chicken...just the pasta, garlic bread, green beans with garlic and a nice green salad. I have been home (at my parents house) since December 16.  As most people know going back into the house where you lived as a teenager brings up a whole marketbasket of feelings.  Decades have past and nothing has really changed.  I am sleeping in my brothers' bedroom.  My old room has a bed that fits like a hammock and my back can't take that so I have chosen their bedroom.  The bedspreads have changed, but wall color, drapes and carpeting are the same.  Midwestern farmer types do not spend money freely.  Our high school graduation pictures still sit on the dresser.  Strangely shaped bottles from college binges also line up like souvenir soldiers.\r\rThere are old school papers in the closet, cheap toys that my kids used to play with when they visited and books of all types and sizes.\r\rMom and Dad and I have started to work out a routine.  I think that Dad is relieved to be handing over most of the caretaker duties to me.  He can actually leave the house for longer periods of time.  His day usually consists of turning up the two heaters and maybe starting a fire in the wood stove at 6:00.  He still chops his own wood at 90!  Then I get up and make coffee and we sort of start our day together over the morning news and some chit chat.  At 7:00 I get Mom up and get everyone breakfast.  They have been relying primarily on cold cereal, but seem pleased to have me fix oatmeal, pancakes or eggs every once in a while.  Depending on whether a nurse's aide is coming I will get Mom dressed in a clean new nightgown and new socks and comb her hair.  If we are expecting company such as over the holidays, I will get out the makeup so she looks more lively.  (We had over fifteen for Christmas from California, Colorado and Maryland--I think it was one of the best holidays in memory in spite of the circumstances.)\r\rThen Dad gets the newspaper, turns down the heaters and either he or I empty Mom's potty chair by the bed.  He does dishes and then gets cleaned up mid-morning to head for the senior center downtown where he serves the lunch and coffee, eats his lunch, does the dishes and then brings home Mom's lunch.  The senior center used to be their primary social activity and the big warm daily meal when they went together.  Now, Dad waits on the 70 to 80 somethings that eat down there! On Fridays he heads out to visit his friend for the afternoon.\r\rThe first week was an emotional swinging ride for me.  I kept the day busy with chores, organizing and cleaning this old house.  But as nightfall came I would realize why I was here and find myself choking back the tears or crying myself to sleep.\r\rMom has lost bladder and is losing bowel control and her legs are weak.  We make it together to the bathroom 4 to 5 times a day.  I have to hold her nightgown over her shoulders so that she can concentrate on sitting on the commode.  I also have to wipe her rear end as she can't do it as well as it needs to be done.  We have nurses assistants come in about 4 times a week from the hospice program to help bathe her, cut her nails, brush her dentures and/or set her hair.  A nurse is now coming in weekly to monitor her life signs.  Every other week we get a chaplain although neither of my parents are religious, they do enjoy this visit.  She needs the care of a two-year-old, but every single person that comes in loves her as they find her so upbeat and friendly, unlike many of their patients, I am sure.  She will stutter over her words as she gets tired and then laugh and tell them she speaks a 'foreign' language or that she speaks three languages at the same time. \r\rThis is a bit of a conflict for me, because she was a really stubborn and set-in-her-ways mother when I was growing up and even when I became an adult.  I could never please her with whatever gift I brought or whatever idea I had.  So, I guess my first blessing in this process is that she is mellowing out.\r\rSome days she realizes that she has a terminal illness and other days she acts as though I am here to just help get her back on her feet. \r\rWe have tried working on leg exercises to strengthen her a little.  The hospice program does not support that kind of therapy.  They do nothing that would prolong her dying.  She does sleep about 80% of the time.  I fill that time with checking emails via modem and my brothers computer, working on the quilt for my daughter, reading, watching TV and some exercising.  The next blog I will talk about the siblings.I am sitting here in a charming little coffee house on main street of this tiny farming town.  I can't imagine how they make any money, but the waitress is cleaning off all the tables, so they must have had some lunch customers.  When I get out into the rural west, I am reminded of how people struggle from day to day to make ends meet.  When on the east coast the upper middle class is so evident, that I tend to forget about the rest of the world.\r\rThere is one woman about my age sitting at a table reading a book and sipping coffee...must be retired.\r\rI left Dad with Mom and I am sure he is sleeping by now.  He has had a long day.\r\rI have to go out to K-mart after this entry and get some stuff.  He was trying to give me directions, but I think I will just drive out to the nearby city and see if I can find it...because the directions were really confusing.\r\rI have written a couple of blogs at home and will post them following this."},

I have this delicious looking Godiva catalog...and was looking through the pretty pictures when I come across their insert:\r\r\"Complimentary Sampling and In-Store Theatre Events at Your Godiva boutique.\" The 'events' listed include \"Peanut Butter-Dessert Cups\" on 11/17 and the \"Candy Cane Bark\" on 12/12. Who writes this stuff?\rWent to her concert last night. Pretty much sold out. The old broad can still bring them in. Her opening act was \"The Village People' which I had thought were all gone or dead or something. Honestly. They were buff and energized and had the kind of music the audience could appreciate.\r\rMy son was kidding me about seeing all the transvestites and actually I thought that would be fun if there were some. But this audience was all over the place in age, and while there were gay guys, no transvestites that I could see. There were many old folks from suburbia--which is probably a little bit of a disappointment to her, since it shows her the reality of her age and how normal people her age really look.\r\rAnyway, the only tickets I could get were up and away. I decided that I am too old to be sitting so far from the main stage. My eyesight just isn't good enough and of course, my memory is going so I forgot to bring binocs.\r\rShe didn't sing some of my favorites from the older days... she is probably sick of them, but she still has great pipes and a good bod and wonderful costumes.

She left behind a husband and two children.  The kids are now teenagers.  They live on the other side of the continent from me and I have been able to visit almost yearly due to business trips.  But due to my budget demise, I can no longer travel out that way.\r\rThey do get back into Colorado to visit the rest of the family once maybe twice a year, usually over the holidays.\r\rWhen we recently went to visit them in California my husband realized that a close cousin of his actually lived just up the road from them.  So we ALL went out to dinner together one night.  We thought it would be good to get them together since my sister had passed recently.  My brother-in-law while well known in his town is pretty much a quiet, stay at-home guy.  He never emails us or calls.\r\rWell, today I just got the Christmas card from my husband's cousins with following quote buried in the rest of the news (D is my brother-in-law):\r\r\"Saw D  and his lady friend .  I know her from dance class... smalltown.  They seem to be quite an item.\"\r\rWhat a surprise!  I knew that some day he would get involved with someone else.  He has quite a bit of money, so is a good 'catch.'  I have mixed feelings about this and wonder how the kids feel, but I also am curious as hell about her...!  I wonder if the rest of the family knows....  Interesting the gossip one gets in a Christmas card."},

She has a mass on her liver that is rapidly growing, she has kidneys that are failing and she is anemic so they think she is bleeding somewhere internally, although interminable tests cannot find where! What will eventually kill her and when, doctors don't know and if there is a God he is not talking.\r\rI talked to my mom yesterday afternoon after they had given her two pints of blood. She was so chipper, talking so fast, and really upbeat. She can be a real curmudgeon so this was a blessing. My brothers and sisters far away are arranging the details of hospice care in one of their homes. I asked how I could help (other than fly out which I will do in the coming weeks) and they wanted me to look into the funeral arrangements. They are lost when it comes to this. I took the bull by the horns and did this for my sisters untimely death in California a number of years ago. It helped keep me busy and they always saw me as the bossy one ( come on, I'm not that bad) and so they were glad that I took over.\r\rI will do so again this time.  Get it in order and then run it by my Dad and everyone for the final say so.\r\rI am sad but not depressed. My mother and I are close--but we have had our up days and our down days. I am not a favorite child. Unfortunately, she lost the favorite child to cancer. In addition, since I live so far from them, the space has brought about a different relationship than that which she has with my two other brothers and sisters. It is OK. Ten years ago there would have been lots of second thoughts and anger and guilt. But no more. As Buddha says, \" What we think, we become.\"\r\rEach time we meet with death and help someone we love through that passage, I know that we grow in wisdom. I just hope that I can be wise instead of stupid in this trial."},

She  has told me that the mass on my mother's liver is indeed growing fast and they are going to put her in hospice.  They put her in the hospital this weekend.  The medical staff  never explored this mass due to her age --87--and her weakening kidneys and told us to hope for the best--that was back in September.\r\rNow it appears that we are in the goodbye stage of this. \r\rMy cheat is this...I just can't call my sister back right now.

During his comments he went off message several times and seemed to almost go into a subtle politcal rant. At one time he said that television stations were asking for certain information before they would broadcast his travel show. The questions were about what was to be shown from the country...i.e. would there be artwork or sculptures that showed private parts of the human body? If so, they would then decline showing the program. He gave a gentle but determined smile and looked deeply into the camera and said something to the effect that the Europeans have long gotten over this shame of the human body and that this art was so important for all to see, etc. etc.\r\rI just sat in my chair trying to figure out what century I had dropped into?

{"title": "Notes on the wedding.", "date": "Monday, November 29, 2004", "text": "Since middle-angel asked, I will tell a little about the precious wedding ceremony. It took place in a small Lutheran church in Philadelphia. Very simple ceremony with men in tuxedos and bridesmaids in deep carmine dresses with lovely beading across the front in a V-shape. Bride was tall, blonde and had the next door look that nice girls have. She had the loveliest veil with small crystal beads sewn randomly and sparsely across the netting. She twinkled like starlight with each movement. They had a violinist, organist and a soloist. It was very nice.\r\rReception was in the Sheet Metal workers building at Penns Landing Caterers. This is a very dynamic building built by various sheetmetal workers groups. It has metal ceilings and walls and yet is very elegant (with candlelight reflecting off all the metal) and has a huge stage where the band played most of the night. (One of the singers in the band just happened to be my son-in-law's brother as well!) So my husband and I danced as best we might finding polka, salsa, mambo and foxtrot beats in many of the more modern tunes that suited the crowd of young people. We also attempted club dancing which must have given the younger crowd a good laugh. But we are no longer shy at our age, knowing that life goes on and doesn't wait for you to feel competent at anything.\r\rJoined my  daughter and her husband and his parents for Sunday Brunch at Creperie Beau Monde which I highly recommend if you are ever in the Philadelphia area. The crepes are made with buckwheat flour and yet are so light and amazing. There are dozens of fillings both savory and sweet, and the price is not high. The decor is sage green with gold leaf patterned wall paper. They even had a nice fire going for us on the rainy fall morning.\rThere is a tradition at many American (and probably Western European) weddings where a small coin is placed beneath the cup or plate at each of the reception tables. If you get the coin, you get to take home the flower centerpiece. My son-in-law got the coin and since my daughter was a matron of honor and had a lovely nosegay as well as a nice floral bouquet for being part of the wedding party (son-in-law was also a groomsman) they let us take home this floral arrangement. So lovely!! Don't you think?"},

{"title": "The Lost weekend", "date": "Tuesday, November 23, 2004", "text": "Daughter and I spent the early Saturday afternoon shopping for maternity clothes (which are awfully choking expensive if you care about cut) and a few holiday gifts.  She still has a darling figure with just a little tummy showing at 4.5 months along.  Then we ate at a nice Vietnamese restaurant called Green Papaya before heading for the movie.\r\r “What the Bleep…” was certainly different than many documentaries.  The movie tries to tie together quantum physics theory with man’s concept of God…among other things.  That alone stirs controversy.  While it presents some interesting and beautiful ideas it is done with elementary school graphics and junior high school explanations of science.  The dumbing down for the movie audience leaves one with lots of basic questions about what the movie hoped to accomplish.  It is worth seeing if you have a philosophical bent and it has motivated me to do some research in some of the areas they were discussing.\rAfter we got out of the movie we headed to Borders’ Books for some browsing and then went back to my house and had a little slumber party.  The baby was being very active so I got to feel it kicking and stretching.  What wonderful memories it brought back!  Later we watched “Finding Nemo” on cable which I had never seen.  It is so beautiful and really somewhat scientifically accurate regarding ornamental fish.  I’d like to get the CD.     <>\r\rOn Sunday we slept in and then, like the good mother that I am, I made her a bacon and pancake breakfast.  We headed downtown and did some window shopping while waiting for my husband to call.  He got in around 1:00.  My daughter had mentioned that she had had boxes of put-together furniture in her dining room for over a month.  They needed to go upstairs to her baby room/guest room and her husband hadn’t been able to get a buddy to help move the heavy stuff.  (This is no surprise as he rarely does any physical labor around the house…yard work is also tough on him.  He is able to golf and go to football games on the weekends though.  I am not totally critical here.  He does work very hard at his job and earns a nice fat salary, but he tends then to want weekends totally free for fun as a result.  He was currently at a football game and so wouldn’t be back until late that evening.)  I asked my hubby if he was too tired to do some furniture moving and he was more than amenable if it was something for his little girl.  So we spent the afternoon putting together a wooden bed, and unpacking several other boxes of furniture, and moving out the entire dining room so we could lay out her new rug.  Whew!  Got that done and then has some salsa and chips while we watched the Ravens win over Dallas.  We had lived in Texas years ago, so we are Cowboys fans and the loss was a little bit of a downer.  After that she had Tivo’d “Lost” which I had missed last week and so I got to see that and am now caught up for this coming week. “Lost” is one of those TV series that you really can’t miss or you are somewhat clueless for the following episode.  Then about 6:30 she headed out for a recruiting dinner for her company and her husband showed up and the three of us went out to a local Italian restaurant for a nice catch-up dinner.  We talked some politics, some baby and some about his parents, whom he had seen over the weekend.  His last grandmother is having lots of health problems and his parents are going through that time of life we all go through, wondering what to do with Mom or Dad in order to make their remaining life as easy but as safe as possible.  We gave him our advice which he actually seemed to want to hear.  What a long and busy weekend."},

We are going to see What the Bleep do We know. I had actually purchased three tickets to this movie three weeks ago and then my husband got a kidney stone and we spent that night in the emergency room of the hospital. I bought two tickets online yesterday and hopefully with him still in Taiwan, there will be no emergencies.  The movie has managed to stay in theatres just by word of mouth, so should be at least interesting.  Especially this time of the year.\r\rShopping for the holidays has gotten much easier since I no longer shop for my brothers and sisters and their kids are mostly grown and away.  My celebration of Christmas has become more and more a habit.  While I still feel there is a God somewhere out there, I feel less and less it has to do with these mythological celebrations that mankind has invented on this planet.   Why would God be a man?  Why would he manifest himself as a man?  What not appear as the very weakest among us, such as a crippled child or an old woman?   (I mean in the biblical story.)  Why would he ever take sides in a war where his 'creations' destroy each other.  If God is perfect, then there is no place for killing or hatred.\r\rWhile I do not begrudge anyone in their beliefs...after all whatever gets us through the day...I just look deep into my heart and soul and cannot lie to myself.   I have no fear of Satan.  If such an evil power exists, it has no control over me.  I have no fear of death...just fear of pain.  I see myself as a biological animal on this planet.  If my spiritual component exists beyond...great.  I do not fear a punishment for my honesty with myself.  I am willing to use all the tools available to me and do not refuse anyone's prayers.\r\rBut, I know, with little exception, I am responsible for myself and what happens to me.  My husband also feels this way.  My grandchild that is due in April will be raised as a  Catholic...probably the farthest road in life from mine.

When the boss saw her, he waited until her husband left, and then approached her about not being on the job and that he would have to fire her.

His response was that he would ignore everything if she just joined him in his car! .. which of course, she refused.\r\rShe has no witnesses to all of this.  Although she has been telling me for quite a while that this boss has been harassing her.  I guess she is talking to a lawyer--maybe one provided by her union--but she needs a letter from someone else that states this guy is harassing her.  There were no witnesses.  What can she do?

We got to be good friends as I help her with learning English (and she tried to help me with my Spanish) during the times she comes by my cubicle. She also became friends with many of the other people on the floor. After a few months she asked if I knew anyone who needed their house cleaned. I do! Since I have moved into this rental unit I am not nearly so motivated to keep it clean and my 25 year old son moving in pretty much put out any residue of anal retentive cleaning I had left.

So, she has been cleaning my house on a regular basis for a number of months.\r\rIt is great for me and I think good for her.\r\rWell, today, when she didn't come by, I asked our Secretary what was up with L.

But now that my boss is out with surgery, they have gone in for the kill behind our back. I am just very, very sick about this. Her husband works construction as a temp and has no health insurance.

Both are retired although they run a small art studio in Colorado.\r\rI haven't seen this gal in about 10 years. We shared an apartment in Colorado Springs when I was in my first year of teaching right out of college. We taught at different schools, but this was our first real time on our own in a city far away from parents and making real money. We met another friend from somewhere in the South (a beautiful blonde with tremendous poise and charm as only Southern ladies have) and all three of us took snow skiing lessons together. We hung out together on Fridays at the local Mexican restaurant and bar and we had fun on the weekends.   We took off one spring on a five day camping trip...just two girls.  It was great.\r\rSuch fun days, and as I look back I see that I was so very young and naive. I was dating a smartass cadet from the Airforce Academy (actually told me how to dress when I met him at the Academy).

{"title": "Material girl", "date": "Saturday, October 30, 2004", "text": "Over the past year I have become more and more aware of \"U-Store\" units.  They are popping up everywhere--within 2 to 3 miles of each other.  Is this a reflection of all those divorced people who don't want to give up their stuff when they lose their homes?  Is this due to those homeless folks who still can afford a rental unit for the stuff that reflects their life?  I know that some of this storage is for people with hobbies or equipment for their jobs.  Maybe this is a reflection of how many young men and women are now overseas in the \"war\" and storing stuff till they return.  I think most likely it reflects the fact that we have too too too much stuff in our lives and our lives are disrupted too often.  My brother married a few years ago (for the first time in his 50's), and of course, he had a ton of stuff from his home and melded with her home they are now storing a home's worth of furniture.  The problem is that the furniture is depreciating while the cost of storing it is not.\r\rWhen we sold our house and moved into this rental, we used a u-store for a few months until we sold, gave away or threw away a lot of stuff.  Then we cleaned out the rental garage and stored what didn't need climate control in the garage and then put the rest of the stuff in boxes in the basement.  We are now moving into year two of our rental house and haven't even opened these boxes once. \r\rI read a book called \"Simplify Your Life\" by Elaine St. James.  It is one of those Hallmark type books that you read in the bathroom.  One of the author's suggestions to begin uncluttering your life is to pack some items in a box that you haven't used in a long while.  Label the box with the date.  After a year, if you haven't been looking for anything or used anything in the box, throw it away!  Don't open it, just toss it.  It makes a lot of sense to me.  (Actually why not auction it off?)  The u-store manager told me that is what they do when people fall behind on their rent of the storage unit.  He opens the door, lets people look at what is inside, andt hen takes bids.\r\rWhen I move to this new house (if we can ever find a design we can afford) I hope to try to live more Zen.  Open spaces, useful activities, and less catalog purchasing.    Of course today it is more Internet purchasing, since you can buy ANYTHING you want over the net."},

I had a late dinner on the waterfront last night with colleagues and probably drank a little too much wine.\r\rWeather in Seattle was very similar to here actually.  Nice and sunny there with a little rain, but the nights were much colder there.  It was below 40 in the morning and we were in the 50's here before the sun showed its head.\r\rAbout 30 people attended the meeting, all with professional and good things to say about the whole program.  I would love to see those who are prejudiced against government bureaucrats attend just one of these meetings to see how professional and intelligent government workers actually are!  These people are passionate about their research and their programs, but they are also realistic and many are quite inventive in stretching budgets.   But, realism also takes us to the place where we fully understand this program is going to end with a whimper if we have to face another year of cuts.  I  don't want to get into too much detail...but I do feel American citizens will regret not funding this type of program in the future---as they will find with all the cuts in sciences we are getting.  Research and education money creates a citizenry that can think outside the box when it comes to conflict.  (Sort of the opposite side of the brain from the Ann Coulter baseball bat thinking.)\r\rToured the Pike Market on the waterfront and saw the space needle.  It was my first time there.  The flower stalls were wonderful and cheap and the 'tossing of the fish' was fun and very New York I thought.  Saw the first Starbucks--but it only had one small sign to let you know.

The woman we have recently hired for the temporary work ‘drifts’ in between 8:30 and 9:30 each morning and clearly has the energy of a slug.

{"title": "It is pre-determined which candidate I will vote for!", "date": "Wednesday, September 15, 2004", "text": "I cannot deny my destiny....according to an article by Mr. Brooks:\r\r\" Ruling Class War \"(subscription?)\r\r*By DAVID BROOKS*\r\rPublished: September 11, 2004  in the New York Times\r\rThere are two sorts of people in the information-age elite, spreadsheet  people and paragraph people. Spreadsheet people work with numbers, wear  loafers and support Republicans. Paragraph people work with prose, don't  shine their shoes as often as they should and back Democrats.\r\rC.E.O.'s are classic spreadsheet people. According to a sample gathered  by PoliticalMoneyLine in July, the number of C.E.O.'s donating funds to  Bush's campaign is five times the number donating to Kerry's.\r\rProfessors, on the other hand, are classic paragraph people and lean  Democratic. Eleven academics gave to the Kerry campaign for every 1 who  gave to Bush's. Actors like paragraphs, too, albeit short ones. Almost  18 actors gave to Kerry for every 1 who gave to Bush. For self-described  authors, the ratio was about 36 to 1. Among journalists, there were 93  Kerry donors for every Bush donor. For librarians, who must like  Faulknerian, sprawling paragraphs, the ratio of Kerry to Bush donations  was a whopping 223 to 1.\r\rLaura Bush has a lot of work to do in shoring up her base.\r\rData from the Center for Responsive Politics allows us to probe the  emerging class alignments, but the pattern is the same. Number people  and word people are moving apart.\r\rAccountants, whose relationship with numbers verges on the erotic, are  now heavily Republican. Back in the early 1990's, accountants gave  mostly to Democrats, but now they give twice as much to the party of  Lincoln. Similarly, in the early 1990's, bankers gave equally to the two  parties. Now they give mostly to Republicans, though one notices that  employees at big banks, like Citigroup and Bank of America, are more  likely to give to Democrats.\r\rBut lawyers - people who didn't realize that they wanted to be novelists  until their student loan burdens were already too heavy - are shifting  the other way. This year, lawyers gave about $81 million to Democrats  and about $31 million to Republicans.\r\rMedia types are Democratic, of course, but one is dismayed to learn that  two-thirds of employee donations at Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation  went to Democrats. Whatever happened to company loyalty?\r\rIf you look at the big Kerry donors, you realize that the days of the  starving intellectual are over. University of California employees make  up the single biggest block of Kerry donors and Harvard employees are  second, topping folks from Goldman Sachs and others in the supposedly  sell-out/big-money professions.\r\rAcademics have had such an impact on the Democratic donor base because  there is less intellectual diversity in academia than in any other  profession. All but 1 percent of the campaign donations made by  employees of William & Mary College went to Democrats. In the Harvard  crowd, Democrats got 96 percent of the dollars. At M.I.T., it was 94  percent. Yale is a beacon of freethinking by comparison; 8 percent of  its employee donations went to Republicans.\r\rIt should be noted there are some professions that span the  spreadsheet-people/paragraph-people divide. For example, lobbyists give  equally to both parties. (Could it possibly be that lobbyists don't have  principles?) And casino people split their giving, with employees at  Harrah's giving mostly to Democrats and employees at MGM Mirage giving  mostly to Republicans.\r\rWhy have the class alignments shaken out as they have? There are a  couple of theories. First there is the intellectual affiliation theory.  Numerate people take comfort in the false clarity that numbers imply,  and so also admire Bush's speaking style. Paragraph people, meanwhile,  relate to the postmodern, post-Cartesian, deconstructionist,  co-directional ambiguity of Kerry's Iraq policy.\r\rI subscribe, however, to the mondo-neo-Marxist theory of information-age  class conflict. According to this view, people who majored in liberal  arts subjects like English and history naturally loathe people who  majored in econ, business and the other \"hard\" fields. This loathing  turns political in adult life and explains just about everything you  need to know about political conflict today.\r\rIt should be added that not everybody fits predictably into the  political camp indicated by a profession. I myself am thinking of  founding the Class Traitors Association, made up of conservative  writers, liberal accountants and other people so filled with  self-loathing that they ally politically with social and cultural rivals.\r\rClass traitors of the word, Unite!

Some good quotes below:\r\rBlogging: “… never have so many people written so much to be read by so few.” By KATIE HAFNER\r\r\"By Jupiter Research's estimate, only 4 percent of online users read blogs.\"\r\rMs. Quint has grown more understanding of his reasons, if not entirely sympathetic. \"The Web's illusion of immortality is sometimes more attractive than actual cash,\" she said.\r\r\"I was trying to record all thoughts and speculations I deemed interesting,\" he said. \"Sort of creating a digital alter ego. The obsession came from trying to capture as much as possible of the good stuff in my head in as high fidelity as possible.\"\r\rCheck out the article here for more on the above taken from footnotes at this site.\rJust one casual mistake and a lot of information can be lost.  Two Ralph Waldo Emerson collections dating to the 1860s and other out-of-print gems are among the items a team of volunteers found while salvaging thousands of books from the former East St. Louis library that had been abandoned when the library moved.\r\rRead all about it here."},
{"title": "The Class Reunion (we all dread.)", "date": "Wednesday, August 25, 2004", "text": "Talk about your milestones!  I graduated from high school a loooong time ago.  Last month I got invited to my 40th high school reunion.  My class has these once a decade and I have made it to two of them.  It was short notice and I really didn’t want to go since I will have to buy a plane ticket—most of the rest still live within driving distance.  Some of us have died, some of us have cancer, one is getting out of jail, one is a “recovering” alcoholic (the genius of the class), and most of the rest are divorced.  My class size was only 15!!  I guess we were pretty dysfunctional.  It was a small farming community with not much money and I guess this is what you get 4 decades later.\r\rMy best girlfriend (who is normal) and my ex-boyfriend (who is wealthy) from that time called begging me to come.  Clearly when there are so few of us, each addition makes for a better party.\r\rI am just so far away from that time and culture in my life.  I know in my heart I will probably have a good time, but right now I cannot imagine what we will talk about.  The “good old days” were about basketball games and “necking.”  The biggest topic for my generation right now is this divisive election—don’t want to there.\r\rAgenda:  The first night is at a bar with the two old coaches watching a video tape of the game that sent the graduating class to the state basketball tournament.  (A jock fest.)  Then the next night is at a fancy French restaurant…been there and done that.  And the next day is an afternoon picnic at my ex-boyfriend’s fancy house.  It is going to be a long afternoon.\r\rI love photography and this would be an appropriate time for me to bring my digital, so maybe that will help pass the time."},
{"title": "They're having a baby!", "date": "Tuesday, August 24, 2004", "text": "Well, it is still a secret, but my daughter informed us this past weekend, that she and her husband are now pregnant--they have been trying only since April--so they are lucky people. She calls 'it' Spec because that is what is looks like on the sonogram. Talk about your cliché milestone--this is the first grandchild for me and H.\r\rWhen you get old you see very clearly how times have changed. When I was pregnant the sonogram was done only during the last trimester and for very specific reasons. There was some concern it could harm the fetus. Now she is getting them about every two weeks and then once a month! I hope these medical types know what they are doing.\r\rWhile I am very excited, I am also well aware that this is going to bring a whole new dynamic to the family ring. She has agreed to raise the child Catholic and H. and I are not Catholics and actually pretty suspicious of all the mandates and rules surrounding the religion. (Let's hope that the baby is not wheat intolerant! Another Catholic issue.) I know that a decade from now this little one may ask why H. and I don't go to church and particularly why we don't go to Mass. I am not afraid of how or what I will say--I will welcome any honest discussion. But I hope that the others involved will not get all hyper about my response. My daughter D.'s in-laws are really nice people and actually seem relieved that we are not openly anti-Catholic. I guess Catholics have to defend themselves more often these days.\r\rI actually ran Bible school at the local Methodist  Church in the good old days, wanting to expose my children to Christianity so that they can make there own decisions in life. Now my son is an atheist like his father and my daughter believes in God--but doesn't seem to have any clear boundaries on who this God is. Me, I think I am drifting toward Buddhism."},
{"title": "Joiners", "date": "Monday, August 23, 2004", "text": "I was thinking how contradictory it is to say you are not a joiner and then join a blog site...Although joining a blog site is not exactly like joining a club or society. It is virtual in everyway. You can be you or someone else. Others can be themselves or someone else. You can have a conversation with just yourself or others, but you have no control over this. It is not like walking across a room and introducing yourself. Blogging is also not the same as volunteering to be on the committee. Others do not have a vested interest in your presence or lack thereof. Although there still is 'group think.'\r\rThe only time I joined things in the past was because I had children and I had a vested interest in their involvement in the activity. Sometimes I was a leader and sometimes just a workerbee. But I never really felt I belonged in any of it.\r\rNow that I am approaching retirement and will have more free time, I am thinking that I should put energy toward some of the causes that I believe in. We'll see."},
{"title": "So thus the beginning.", "date": "Sunday, August 22, 2004", "text": "Each life has milestones, some of which have become cliches. In this fastpaced society, I now realize that my milestones arrive more slowly and appear to have a mellow aura about them. I am looking forward to that pace. I have always been a hurry-up and correct it later type and probably always well be. But, I am now pushing 60 and enjoying the lack of deadlines and seriousness of my decisions.Actually, it is more my lack of seriousness in approaching decisions these days. I do have many serious decisions to make. When am I going to retire? How am I going to approach the economic decisions for this retirement? How am I going to allocate the remaining hours, days, years of my life?I am in the earliest process of building the (cliche) retirement/dream home. Something I never thought I would be able to do. Something that has come about due to living a little frugally and also due to living overseas almost a decade of my life, where my living expenses were paid by my employer.I am married to a mellow guy who doesn't care much about the house--only that it is comfortable, is engineered for use of natural resources as much as possible, and is near the water so that he can fish! It is all of these.So this site will be about that project as well as my pet peeves, my beliefs and my concerns about the world I live in. Large menu--hope that it can be digested!"}
