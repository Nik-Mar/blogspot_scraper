{"title": "NOT RECOMMENDED: On the Other Side of the Forest", "date": "Tuesday, December 14, 2021", "text": "CONTENT WARNING: This review contains descriptions of anti-Black stereotypes and links to the Jim Crow Museum of Racist Memorabilia at Ferris State University.—On the Other Side of the Forest by Nadine Robert and Gérard DuBois is a Canadian French translation. Arthur and his dad–two brown-furred rabbits–live among fellow anthropomorphic rabbits (and their dog Danton) in a clearing surrounded by a forest. Rumors of scary creatures in the woods abound (“No one ever goes in there!”) but nobody from the village has ever discovered what lies beyond.Arthur’s dad, a curious wheat farmer, has the idea to build a tower so that they can peer over the trees and see the other side of the forest. The rabbits harvest the grain, grind it into flour, and bake bread to barter for stones. They spend their off-hours constructing the rock tower: “It’s very tiring. But a magnificent idea takes a lot of work.” When a storm wrecks their progress, the villagers, now full of bread and interested in the exhausted pair’s endeavor, help finish the job. Suspense builds as Arthur and his dad ascend the finished tower and a new truth about their surroundings is revealed. The first person narration and short, rhythmic sentences pace the story. Illustrations resemble oversized block prints on distressed, vintage-looking paper, and function as oversized rectangular panels with a crisp white border. Bright reds, blues, and yellows pop atop an otherwise muted color palette. Characters’ outfits and activities (hoop trundling, for example) evoke an old-timey atmosphere. Much of the book reads like a story of discovery, with themes of community, ingenuity, and exploration. BUT––this is not true of the complete work. There is one spread of this book that includes racist imagery that distorts and overpowers everything else.In the spread, Arthur’s dad has fallen asleep and Arthur works in the kitchen to help him make bread. The text, told from Arthur’s point of view, reads “To help him, I finish making the dough and I clean the oven.” The art depicts Arthur looking straight ahead, with white teeth, exaggerated white round eyes, and a coal black-colored face, ears, and chest.When I first came upon this page, I thought of a racist image that I had learned about from the Jim Crow Museum’s online database of racist cartoons. Arthur’s appearance after oven-cleaning is positioned as a humorous moment in the story too–this is disturbing! What about having black fur (or skin) is humorous? That the color is temporary–something that is later washed off–also brings up connections to blackface minstrelsy. Once I encountered this page, I could no longer in good conscience enjoy or recommend this book. The charms that I had found in other elements of the book–like the reds, blues, and yellows popping atop the muted color palette–became harder to discern. It isn’t because those colors aren’t vivid, but because craft and context are always intertwined. It takes a great degree of privilege to compartmentalize–to celebrate some elements of a racist work while ignoring the racism. Whiteness often positions this particular type of compartmentalization as “objectivity.” This has the consequence of allowing white people like me to ignore anti-racist critique and believe (even if subconsciously) that our position is neutral, noble, and/or superior. It could not be farther from it!Seeing this title reminded me of conversations around another book: The Bad Mood and the Stick by Daniel Handler and Matthew Forsythe. After the original book cover was released several years ago, Edi Campbell’s writings and the work of other online activists moved the publisher to change the art. I hope that happens here.Some readers might ask, “don’t you care that On the Other Side of the Forest was on the 2021 New York Times/New York Public Library Best Illustrated Children’s Books list?” I do care, but not because I think an award makes a book infallible. I care that a group of people examined this book and either didn’t see the issue at hand or didn’t care enough about it to add a different book to the list instead. I care about the anti-Blackness that this book normalizes, because it is wrong. I care about the readers who have to deal with the consequences of a racist book receiving accolades and showing up in classrooms and libraries. The creators might not have intended for this art to communicate these messages and connections, but intent is irrelevant. The reality is that this image has a racist impact. And whether or not we are conscious of it, we are all taking in messages from our reading and surroundings every day, and these messages direct our thoughts and our behaviors. Kids are receiving these messages too, in ways that are influential to their development and critical to their self-esteem and perception of others.  What messages are sent when the white-dominated children’s literature ecosystem continues to uncritically praise books with racist imagery? --Review by Elisa Gall"},
{"title": "Challenges & Change", "date": "Wednesday, July 29, 2020", "text": "We at Reading While White have been challenged in recent months to keep up with regular posting as we individually navigate the realities of our world today and collectively consider how RWW can move forward in a way that is responsible, responsive to and part of the anti-racist work of Black, Indigenous and People of Color in the children's and young adult literature world. We hope to have more here soon, but in the meantime, we do have a Links Roundup, and some important updates.Lowercase “white”We have decided to begin using lowercase “white,” and realize that we should have made this change earlier. When we started the blog 5 years ago, we decided to capitalize Black, based on arguments such as Lori Tharp's \"The Case for Black with a Capital B.\" We then went a step further to “capitalize White because it forces White people to confront the fact and awkwardness of this invented race. Uncapitalized, it suggested to us that Whiteness doesn't exist as a racial category.” (from our previous FAQs, now updated). It is clear to us now that this needs to change. Some Black scholars have their reasons to capitalize “white” (such as Eve Ewing in “I’m a Black Scholar Who Studies Race. Here’s Why I Capitalize ‘White.’“), and a lot of other racial justice scholars do too; however, we are not either of these groups. We are white library workers and bloggers and we failed to recognize that in making our own decision to capitalize “white,” we were centering the experience of our white readership and ignoring the impact on Black people.  Ryan Douglass explains it clearly in Capitalize the “B” in Black (and not the “w” in white): “A language shift meant to empower Black people does not have to invite the oppressors to the table in order to be legitimate. Period!”  While we don’t pretend that by changing a term, or a capitalization, we are making actionable difference, we do know that changing language can mean a shift in perspective, and learning--it is certainly that for us.  Goodbye to AllieAllie Jane Bruce has sadly decided to leave Reading While White, as she looks forward to throwing her whole self into her upcoming graduate school learning and research. We are so grateful for her energy, insight, and many contributions over the past five years. We will miss her voice and her presence here, but are excited for her to embark on this new journey. Links RoundupFinally, as promised, here are some pieces we’ve been reading and reflecting on recently.  We’re still processing, so stay tuned.   -What's Missing From White Fragility?-White Fragility' is Everywhere.

{"title": "Being a “Person of One’s Time” in 2020", "date": "Sunday, May 31, 2020", "text": "Elisa GallWhile the events of the last several days, weeks, and years are unique to this moment in history, none of this: state violence, White supremacy, racist double standards, White liberal racism...none of this is new. As a White person, I can’t and won’t ever begin to understand the trauma BIPOC have faced and continue to face every day. I can be horrified, devastated, enraged, and justice-focused, and at the end of the day I’m still White. I will always be colluding with racism and benefiting from it. It is my responsibility to work to understand what this means and pay attention to the complexities at play, especially when I am trying to engage in anti-racist action. It is my responsibility to consider how my ignorance and naivety, my expression of feelings, and my behaviors impact BIPOC. (General reminder: STOP posting traumatic videos of anti-Black violence on your timelines.)I can’t write as fast as the world spins, but as I am sitting and processing what’s happening around me, I’m thinking a lot about the community of children’s and young adult literature of which I am a part. Thanks to Dr. Laura M. Jiménez and Betsy Beckert’s research, we have the data from 2019 to show how #kidlit is dominated by White people just like any other White supremacist, capitalist industry. Children’s literature has never been separate from the wider world. Everything there is here. It is all connected.As politicians use racist terms like “thugs” to dehumanize activists and denounce organized action, #kidlit uses terms like “online mobs” to dismiss, silence, and punish expert critique and valid expressions of pain. While White community leaders distort Martin Luther King, Jr.’s legacy and cry for a mythological “peace” that somehow exists without justice, norms of “niceness” and “professionalism” are upheld and defined by majority-White #kidlit gatekeepers who have a vested interest in protecting the status quo. This is all happening in an industry in which BIPOC pain and trauma are routinely commodified, #OwnVoices books (credit Corinne Duyvis) face an uphill path to creation, and racist books filled with straight-up misinformation and stereotypes keep getting published. As Jason Reynolds said last week at School Library Journal’s Day of Dialog: “There is something about the documenting of a thing, that it becomes real. It doesn’t matter if it’s true.” I am thinking of the BIPOC in the children's literature community who fight tirelessly for equity. I am thinking about the #kidlit patterns we see, again, and again, when racism in our industry is challenged. I’m thinking of the children that we serve. And one other thing that I’m thinking about today, as I write this in 2020, is how often discussions of racism in children’s literature turn into a defense of racism with the excuse that the creator is (or was) “a person of one’s time.”What does it mean to be a person of one’s time?Sure, we are all human. We’re all socialized, we carry ignorance, and even when we are given information our actions have the potential to be racist and anti-racist in the same afternoon. We are all people, yes, and of course we each live during a time. Andrew Jackson was a person of his time. So was John Brown (they lived during the same time actually). Laura Ingalls Wilder was a person of her time, and so was Ida B. Wells (of that same time). Marsha P. Johnson lived during the same time as George Wallace. Helen Bannerman lived during the same time as W.E.B. Du Bois. Fred Korematsu lived during the same time as Theodor Seuss Geisel. Charles Lindbergh overlapped with Langston Hughes. Rebecca Nagle, Judy Heumann, Mari Copeny, and Dolores Huerta all live during the same time as Stephen Miller—and us.As long as there has been racism, there have been people fighting racism. Just as there has always been racism in children’s and young adult literature, there have always been people fighting racism in children’s and young adult literature. One look at the Interracial Books for Children Bulletin Archive organized by Dr. Nicole Cooke and her team shows that.To say someone is a person or product of their time isn’t just a weird and sort of obvious thing to say to defend racist writings or actions. It functions as an excuse for the racism (and whatever connected systems of oppression are also being challenged in the moment the defense is elicited). When people use “of one’s time” to defend a writer’s work, they are actually naming, even if subconsciously, that the oppressive status quo of that time period is worth making excuses for. Or at the very least, that they are OK with that racist text or behavior being defended in the context of the discussion, which is happening in the present. An “of one’s time” defense claims some sort of time-space neutrality that just doesn’t exist.To quote Jason Reynolds again—remixing the work of Dr. Ibram X. Kendi—”if you're not being anti-racist, by definition, you are being racist.” EDITOR'S NOTE 6/2/20 5:13PM CST: I want to apologize for citing Ibram X. Kendi above, without crediting Angela Davis, who should be cited for the concept and quote: “In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be antiracist.”  I'm sorry for this intersectionality fail—I erased a Black woman's work. Thank you to Stacy Collins for pointing out this mistake.  BLACK LIVES MATTERI am a White person of 2020. I am learning, and sharing, and doing my best to fight the anti-Blackness and racism that I’m swimming in and that has been part of my life and this country since forever. I’m a person of my time, and if you’re reading this, you are a person of your time too. And this (*looks around*) is where we are. The status quo right now, today, is NOT okay. What each of us does—what we defend, what we stay silent on, what decisions we make, what we pay attention to, how we spend our money, and even what we don’t do—all are choices. Fellow White people, what choices will you make today? You can read our kindred spirits blogs (you should be doing this already, before you read Reading While White) or explore links on this all-ages Anti-Racism Resources padlet developed by Dr. Nicole Cooke. You can purchase titles recommended by the team at We Are Kid Lit (the new list is slated to go live tomorrow). You can evaluate your library’s policies or a favorite curricular text using a critical lens. You can support a local bail fund or a nonprofit like BYP100 or Black Visions Collective.It’s 2020. We are all people of now. Black lives matter and they have always mattered. Full stop. -Elisa Gall"},
{"title": "White Erasure of BIPOC People and Work", "date": "Thursday, May 21, 2020", "text": "A note about the following: I wrote this post several months ago. It was originally scheduled to publish Thursday March 12; we decided not to post it then because the night before, COVID-19 news swept the nation and all attention was focused there.I know that some of our readers, like me, have time and mental space to read this right now; some do not. Our email and DMs are open; please get in touch if there is any support we can provide, and take care.On January 31, we published a Links Roundup post.  While we published it under the group account, I (Allie) organized and posted it, so I’m primarily responsible for the mistakes therein—namely, that in promoting Lee and Low’s writeup of the 2019 Diversity Baseline Survey, I failed to name and credit Dr. Laura M. Jiménez, as well as Betsy Beckert, as co-authors of the survey.  My mistake was part of a pattern in this specific instance (the Guardian also failed to credit Dr. Jiménez and Ms. Beckert for their work on this survey), but it is also part of a larger pattern of White erasure of BIPOC people and work.  So with a healthy dose of humility that comes with recognizing myself as a big part of the problem, and with my (and our) sincere apologies to Dr. Jiménez and Ms. Beckert, that pattern of erasure is the subject of this post.With full credit to the People’s Institute for Survival and Beyond, we here at Reading While White define racism as “Race-based prejudice coupled with access to systemic, structural power.”  It is impossible to exist in the world without having internalized race-based prejudice, and Whiteness necessarily confers a privileged relationship to systemic and structural power upon White people.  Therefore, under this definition, all White people are racist. And all White people working on anti-racist activism necessarily bring their racism into their anti-racist work.It is an inescapable truth that I will bring my own Whiteness and my own racism into anti-racist spaces, and that I will often reproduce racism in those spaces.  I can always work to do better, but part of doing better is accepting and sitting with the inherent contradiction of my being in these spaces at all, trying to do anti-racist work while not denying the fact that I am racist.In a study on how White activists contribute to severe burnout among BIPOC activists, Paul C. Gorski and Noura Erakat identified patterns of White activists “undermining or invalidating the racial justice work of activists of color” and “taking credit for participants’ racial justice work and ideas” as major contributors to BIPOC burnout (among others).  According to Gorski and Erakat, “white activists derived benefits from their involvement in racial justice activism at the expense of activists of color who, in turn, were silenced, undermined, disrespected, and eventually burned out.”Specifically, in Gorski’s and Erakat’s study, BIPOC activists reported that White activists:“appropriate antiracist organizations by usurping power from activists of color”“Need… the spotlight, [which] led some to exploit activists of color either to acquire benefits—leadership positions or speaking invitations, for example—or to win validation from activists of color.”“take credit for ideas they previously dismissed from [BIPOC activists]”“accept benefits, such as credit and recognition, for ideas and work produced by activists of color.” (One interviewee offered, as an example, White Academics “who just want to get their name published with someone who is recognized for doing racial justice.”)“take the work developed by marginalized people and ‘put their name on it.’ [One interviewee] explained, ‘I have white racial justice workers who ... even record me or photograph something I post and use it as if it’s theirs, without giving me credit ... as they coopt it and reappropriate it in a way that is dangerous.’”BIPOC activists in Gorski’s and Erakat’s study described these White-rooted, within-community conditions as more intense and potent than external causes of burnout: “The racism that propelled participants into racial justice movements was reproduced within those movements. For many participants, this was a particularly disappointing and stress-inducing condition because they had entered movements hoping for a reprieve from the racism with which they coped outside their movements….”  It stands to reason that White activists (including us at RWW) have done as much to undermine the anti-racist movement as any external force, and we (White people, including us at RWW) inevitably continue to do so.There are different levels of White erasure of BIPOC work, from just ignoring it to actively appropriating it.  Failing to acknowledge or credit BIPOC people for their work and ideas also erases their very existence and presence in activist spaces, a particularly noxious form of racism.Big names in the White Anti-racist movement necessarily play a role in this problem.  Tim Wise has been rightly criticised for how he dominates, profits from, and moves in general through anti-racist spaces; Leslie Mac, creator of the Ferguson Response Network and much more, wrote: “From Tim Wise to Dixon White - our pain is used for profit. And repeating concepts created by Black folks thru a white lens will always sell.”  While I myself have learned deeply from, and am grateful for, the work of White Fragility author Robin DiAngelo, I recognize that she also benefits from White privilege within the anti-racist movement; the BIPOC people with whom she’s collaborated don’t have nearly the same level of national name-recognition, at least among White people (I saw Dr. DiAngelo present at a conference with Darlene Flynn in 2017; both were excellent, and I’ve been bothered ever since that Robin DiAngelo is a household name among White activists and Flynn is not).We here at Reading While White fall into this category as well.  Although we do not have the same level of mainstream attention nationally as Wise or DiAngelo, we do have a disproportionate degree of clout within the fields of librarianship and children’s literature, given that some of our BIPOC colleagues have done this work for more than twenty years (and we turn five this Fall).  Ironically, given how I subsequently erased her work, Dr. Laura Jiménez pointed this out to me when I interviewed her three years ago: The one thing that frustrates me the most--and I’m glad that Reading While White is doing what it does--is that if I say something about a book, if Debbie or Edi says something, we’re all told that we’re not giving the author a chance.  That they tried. We are not believed. If you look at the traffic RWW get vs the traffic I get or Edi gets, even though we’ve been doing this for longer, you get more, and the only difference is that you’re White. To be honest, part of me resents that.  And, I am glad that there are people willing to amplify our voices. If I write something, and you pick it up, that means so many more people will be willing to hear it. And that is paramount to my work. You get a lot of crap, the same criticism, but at the end of the day, you are heard and you are believed.  Without White voices, our message can’t be heard. We are not believed. It’s good that your team realizes it.I am glad that Dr. Jiménez was honest here, although she was much more generous with us than we deserve, i.e., we do NOT get the same crap; what we get is much smaller, and benign by comparison.  I imagine there are many BIPOC people within the children’s literature field who feel similarly—or more strongly—and for good, valid reasons aren’t inclined to tell us that they feel that way (see: Gorski’s and Erakat’s study about burnout above).You’ve probably heard that Black people—especially women—need to work “twice as hard for half as much” (mainstream White America can thank Scandal for bringing that maxim into our consciousness).  Think about what this means for us as White people: We work half as hard, for twice as much.How does this show up in children’s literature?  For one, the bar to be published is infinitely higher for BIPOC creators; and even if you are published, the level of attention and spotlight from the vast majority of bookstores and libraries is disproportionately higher for White creators.  While perusing my local Barnes & Noble the other night, I was angered by the number of mediocre books by White people, mostly men, prominently on display in the children’s section. There were several that I’d hazard would never have been published, let alone given the best display space, had a Black woman submitted the same text.  This itself is a form of erasure—our insistence upon highlighting the same White men, over and over, causes and allows them to take up space that should belong to BIPOC creators, and by extension, BIPOC readers.SCBWI Minnesota recently quite literally erased—that is, deleted—the work of Dr. Sarah Park Dahlen when she pointed out that the image they’d set as their banner was a stereotypical, racist image (link included with permission). They also erased the voices of many people who’d commented in agreement with Dr. Dahlen.  Deletion of harmful posts is a common form of White erasure; in one fell swoop, the original poster can erase, rather than take ownership of, their mistakes, and can also erase the voices of any BIPOC critiquing racism. In this case, SCBWI Minnesota also decided not to clarify who was responsible for the deletions (link included with permission), thereby erasing their responsibility for that act of erasure and diffusing the blame for this act of racism.  Such deletions gaslight the targets of racism (which compounds the initial racism). As Dr. Ebony Elizabeth Thomas noted in a thread about patterns of White erasure she noticed last year, “oppression justifies its violence and power by arguing that the oppressed's receipts are invalid” (quote included with permission).(A point of clarification here: SCBWI Minnesota later posted screenshots of the deleted content. Another point of clarification: Screenshots that are not transcribed are not accessible to those who use screen readers.)Erasure also shows up in children’s literature when White creators steal ideas from creators of color and present them as their own.  This ranges from the constant entitlement White authors feel to tell BIPOC stories to outright theft and plagiarism. (If you haven’t read Jacqueline Woodson’s Who Can Tell My Story in a while, pause and re-read it now, and also make time for a re-read of Debbie Reese’s An oft-posed question: \"Who can tell your stories?\"—and actually, also read Maya Gonzalez’ My Story, Your Story, Their Story, Who Gets To Tell It before you read any more of my work).  You may also have read David Bowles’ recent, expert pieces on the “harmful, appropriating, inaccurate, trauma-porn melodrama” that is Jeanine Cummins’ American Dirt, or Maya Gonzalez’ careful documentation of how White authors Brook Pessin-Whedbee and Kelly Storck, as well as their publishers (Jessica Kingsley Publishers and Instant Help Books/imprint of New Harbinger Publications, Inc.) plagiarized her work.  Recently, Tangerine Jones wrote about how authors Katherine Alford and Kathy Gunst, plus their publisher Simon and Schuster, coopted and profit from her work—and the White aggression Alford and Gunst brought against her.  White plundering of Native stories and cultural content for profit also echoes the history of colonial invasion.  As Professor Rebecca Tsosie says:Indigenous peoples have property interests, even if they don’t fall within the narrow definitions of Western law.  This was a problem in the sixteenth century when the Doctrine of Discovery was applied as an international doctrine to validate the interests of European sovereigns in claiming property in the lands that were described as the “New World.” They said that indigenous peoples don’t really have property rights, they just kind of roam around on the land, and so it’s okay for Europeans to go and appropriate the land and say that they have title. Now that’s what we don’t want to do with intellectual property rights in the modern era... [P]eople can go and basically steal indigenous songs and stories, and then they can copyright them... the harm’s not merely economic, but it can be a cultural form of harm that could be very devastating.(Many thanks to Dr. Debbie Reese for answering my questions on this subject, and for sending me that link.)  All of the above are examples of the different forms that White appropriation and erasure of BIPOC work can take in the world of literature.[CONTENT WARNING FOR THIS PARAGRAPH - discusses police killings of Black people]But perhaps the most dangerous, destructive aspect of this erasure is the flipside.  If White people leap to take credit and rewards for BIPOC work and ideas—and if we make those White names household staples, while erasing the names and existence of robbed BIPOC people—we also do the reverse, when it comes to blaming BIPOC people for their own murders while simultaneously erasing the White-owned guilt for those murders.  I’m talking to White readers, now. You likely can name a slew of Black people murdered by police: Michael Brown. Eric Garner. Tamir Rice. Philando Castile. Alton Sterling. How many of their killers can you name, off the top of your head? They are: Darren Wilson. Daniel Pantaleo. Timothy Loehmann. Jeronimo Yanez. Howie Lake. Blane Salamoni.  Yes, I had to look up most of those. No, they aren't all White, but their lack of mainstream name recognition still protects a White-dominant police force. None were held legally responsible for killing the above human beings. Why were their victims put on trial, their private lives plundered and exposed, by a White-dominant media and public desperate to find a reason to blame them for their own murders?  Why have we (White people) done our best to malign their names and their legacies, exonerate their killers’, and erase those of women and nonbinary BIPCOC victims?  In the interest of Saying Her Name: Meagan Hockaday. Tanisha Anderson. Mya Hall. Alexia Christian. There are too many more. We should know them.All of the credit for anti-racist gains, none of the blame for racism… this is still the dominant narrative in every sector of the White community, from open bigots with sheets and torches to the wokest of the woke.At the White Privilege Conference in 2017, Darlene Flynn and Robin DiAngelo said that “getting educated just makes White folks better racists.”  BIPOC activists have raised concerns about White anti-racist activism for a long time; I recently re-read the famous excerpt from The Autiobiography of Malcolm X in which he advises “sincere” White people to “...find all other white people they can who feel as they do—and let them form their own all-white groups, to work trying to convert other white people who are thinking and acting so racist.\"  This passage, among many other things, helped inform our thinking when we first launched Reading While White.  I’d remembered the above words perfectly, but had conveniently managed to forget the following:I have these very deep feelings that white people who want to join black organizations are really just taking the escapist way to salve their consciences.  By visibly hovering near us, they are ‘proving’ that they are ‘with us’ … generally whites’ very presence subtly renders the black organization automatically less effective… I know that every time that whites join a black organization, you watch, pretty soon… a black may be up front with a title, but the whites, because of their money, are the real controllers.What can we White people do, to be and do better?  It’s possible to get stuck in guilt, when we reflect on how we can aid and abet racism despite our best intentions.  It’s also tempting, while reflecting on this, to outright disengage from anti-racist efforts; and at times, we White people do need to step back, since our very presence can (as Malcolm X reminds us) automatically render BIPOC-led efforts less effective.  And we should definitely remove ourselves when we’re told that we’re actively harming BIPOC activists.White activists won’t, however, help matters by completely and permanently disengaging from the movement.  We also won’t help by self-flagellating—especially publicly, which puts a lot of pressure on the injured people to provide forgiveness and absolution.  There is no perfect science to knowing when to step up and step back, but we have a responsibility to keep trying to show up when it’s helpful to the movement, and to step back when it’s not.The study I cited above from Gorski and Erakat suggests that White activists can improve by “policing one another around concerns related to credit- and spotlight-grabbing behaviors (such as coopting the ideas of activists of color) so activists of color do not need to expend energy doing so.”  We must hold each other accountable to this, and we must fight the kneejerk defensiveness that so often comes when anyone—fellow White people included—try to hold us accountable. Inviting others to give us direct feedback (and sharing how they can do that easily) is a good first step here, and in that spirit, please always feel free to email us, readingwhilewhite@gmail.com.  We must remember, also, that asking fellow White people to hold us accountable should not be an excuse to ignore or dismiss BIPOC people when they do choose to expend energy to hold us accountable, feedback to which we are not entitled but for which we should be grateful.We can also correct ourselves and each other when we start to subtly usurp and take control of BIPOC-led organizations, as Malcolm X warns is our default.  Making finances, funding, and decision-making processes in organizations transparent, and making transparency the norm, can help; we also must listen and act when BIPOC people voice concerns about White leadership or processes.  Patterns of BIPOC leaving organizations are almost always a signal that something is rotten in the White culture of that organization, and when we notice such patterns, we must self-examine and ask for help and education from our White friends and community.  And above all, when we’re made aware that we’re impeding anti-racist efforts, we must remove ourselves, and commit to change and accountability, before we continue to inflict harm on BIPOC activists and weaken the movement overall.Gorski and Erakat also advise White activists to “prioritize movement goals over their needs for recognition and validation.”  Putting this into practice is easier said than done. Many White people are drawn to anti-racist work entirely for ego- or profit-based reasons; maybe a few are drawn to the work for entirely pure reasons and don’t care about recognition at all.  But most of us fall somewhere in between (I include myself in that group). I need to learn, and practice, checking my ego (and letting others check my ego). We White people need to help each other actually do that work of prioritizing movement goals over egos—and this involves having very clear goals, as well as people we trust to hold us accountable.(A quick N.B.: This language—“prioritize movement goals over your need for recognition and validation”—should never be used as an excuse to give men credit for the work of women and nonbinary people, to give cisgender or heterosexual people credit for LGBTQIA+ work, to give nondisabled people credit for disabled work, or to justify oppression of any other intersecting identity.)We must also work on doing the flipside of all this. In addition to giving full credit to BIPOC people for BIPOC ideas and work, we need to work to take responsibility for White-owned and White-originated mistakes, harm, and damage.  This means making apologies that don’t ring hollow, taking action to correct the damage we’ve done, and working to prevent similar mistakes in the future. This means we openly and eagerly educate fellow White people about our own mistakes, rather than covering them up from each other in an effort to be the best White person in the group.Dr. Jiménez told us, three years ago, that one of the most useful things we can do at Reading While White is to pass the mic.  We have to do a better job of passing that mic, and talk internally often about how we can do better (we’re always open to criticism and suggestions on this subject, as well).  Our White readers can also play a role in this, by making sure that you hear what our BIPOC colleagues have to say when we do pass the mic. Read our kindred spirits, and read them before you read us.  We make it a point to link to BIPOC articles, essays, and blog posts as often as we can—click through those and read them. If it means you have to stop reading us so you can read them, please read them.  Like them more than you like us on social media. Amplify them more than you amplify us. And when they call upon you to take action, listen to them. Don’t wait for us to say “don’t promote books with anthropomorphic monkeys”—believe Edi Campbell when she says it herself.I’m sorry to Dr. Jiménez—I shouldn’t have erased your work.

{"title": "Links Roundup!", "date": "Friday, January 31, 2020", "text": "It’s been a while since we’ve done one of these roundups, but there’s been some big news lately, so here we go!Lee and Low published their 2019 Diversity Baseline Survey.  This is an update to a study they did in 2015, and to sum up their results in one line, they've found that \"There is no discernible change to any of the other racial categories. In other words, the field is just as White today as it was four years ago.\"  If you won’t have time to digest the whole survey until your next 3-day weekend, catch the highlights on Lee and Low’s Twitter thread about the survey. EDITOR'S NOTE (1/31, 9:45 AM EST): We'd like to acknowledge an oversight in our original post – Dr. Laura Jiménez, PhD, led a team at Boston University with graduate student Betsy Beckert that analyzed and aggregated the data for the survey. This is especially galling considering how often BIPOC are uncredited for their work. We apologize for our mistake.Aaaaaaaaand… there’s so much great news from the Youth Media Awards!! This was the first year that all Caldecott recognition went to BIPOC artists, that a Native author won the Sibert Medal, that the winners of the Coretta Scott King Author AND Illustrator Award also received Newbery and Caldecott recognition, that the American Indian Youth Literature Award winners (featuring a truly fabulous set of books) were revealed at the YMAs… the list goes on (add more fun facts in the comments, please!)  Read the complete press release here.  We at Reading While White were glad to see Dig, a novel that wrestles with Whiteness head-on, get Printz recognition, and we highly recommend this article from Public Books about Dig.Amidst the celebrations, we’re trying to make space for criticism of the awards, and to honor the complexities therein.  We recognize that as a White blog with the mission to examine Whiteness in children’s literature, it is almost never appropriate for us to criticize BIPOC work, so we almost never do so.  A rare exception to that rule: We highly recommend this thread about White Bird from Ingrid Conley-Abrams, a school librarian in New York City.  We continue to wrestle with the systems that grant unearned advantage to White people at the expense of BIPOC people in the publishing and library worlds; and, we want to promote authentic Jewish representation in children’s literature.  We have a long way to go on both subjects.What have we missed, here? What are you reading that’s caught your attention, of late?  Leave a comment!"},
{"title": "On Growth & Progress", "date": "Thursday, January 16, 2020", "text": "2020 is here, and I’ve spent some time reflecting on the last decade: ups and downs, lessons learned, triumphs, and challenges. Looking back on my own growth since 2010, a lot of feelings bubble up. There’s joy, for relationships cultivated. There’s gratification, for some progress made and successful activism of which I’ve been a part. There’s also shame and anger at the world and at myself—because ten years ago there was so much I didn’t know I didn’t know. As a result of my ignorance (whether willful or unintentional) I hurt people. I’ve made mistakes for which I am 100% responsible; I’m aware of only some of them. As I exist in the world as a White person and try to engage in anti-racism and other anti-oppression work, this will surely continue. I like to think that I’ve embraced the kind of shame that Nina described on this blog as “instructive if the owner is open to it.”  I can’t deny those feelings, but what I do with them is up to me. As I reflect on all of this, a few throughlines emerge. In the spirit of learning and looking forward to the next ten years (and beyond), I’m sharing them below.Changing Outcomes Over MindsDr. Ibram X. Kendi wrote in How To Be An Anti-Racist,  “An activist produces power and policy change, not mental change.” Dr. Kendi’s examination of history suggests that anti-racist policies can influence changes in perspectives held by people in oppressor groups—but changing someone’s mindset doesn’t often influence policy. It is easy for me to spend a lot of time thinking about changing hearts and minds. Changing minds and changing policies can go hand in hand, but if I am more focused on changing the thoughts of the privileged than I am concerned with anti-racist outcomes, I am centering those from oppressor groups and falling into what Paul Gorski has described as a “racial equity detour.”I don’t think this means I should stop interrupting racism when I see it, or refuse to engage when opportunities for learning and growth arise for myself or others. This is not necessarily an either/or. (Let’s remember binary thinking is rooted in White supremacy culture.) What it does mean is that learning and thinking are not action alone, and it is naive to assume that changing people’s minds will end oppression. Change Requires DiscomfortComfort is not a word I use to describe any big shifts, whether mental, behavioral, or political. As a result of my socialization, a degree of defensiveness and discomfort will always be present when the mirror is held up to me. Owning this is easier said than done, but when I think about how some of my biggest moments of growth have also been some of the most uncomfortable, I get a sense of clarity. Looking back, only through direct communication (and in some instances SERIOUS PRESSURE) from others did I “move” on an issue or change my behavior. It took courage and intentionality for people to tell me that I was wrong or that my thoughts or actions hurt them. Every time I reflect on an uncomfortable moment of progress for myself, I notice that someone cared enough to help me see the need for change. They could have just walked away (and if I had hurt them, they had every right to) but they didn’t, and that means something.Feedback can come in many forms. (We White people need to check our tone policing, especially when it masquerades as White cries for “calling in.”) No matter how the criticism feels, it is a gift. My actions and my responses are my responsibility. It is probably still going to be hard, but that discomfort is where learning happens.I Am Not Entitled to ForgivenessIn So You Want to Talk About Race, Ijeoma Oluo shared this scenario:Say you get drunk in a bar and punch a stranger in the face, spend the night in jail, realize that your life has taken a turn for the worse, get treatment, stop drinking, and dedicate your life to anti-violence work. To the person that you punched that night, you may forever be the person who assaulted them. The person who made them scared to go into bars for a while. The person who made them feel violated. To the people you have helped since, you may always be a hero. The person who made them feel safer in the world.These are both who you are, they are both valid and do not cancel each other out. If you run into the person you punched years later, they may well still be afraid of you, they may react with anger. They will treat you like someone who punched them, because you are. And even if you respond to that anger and fear like someone who abhors violence, because that is also who you are, you have no right to demand that they see you differently.It can be really difficult to know, that as Oluo writes, “to some people [I] will forever be the person who harmed them.” Working to do better and working to earn forgiveness might be connected endeavors, but they are not the same thing. While both are certainly context specific, I believe time spent on the former should be prioritized. It is, after all, that over which I have (and should have) control. Forgiveness may or may not come—but no one is entitled to it. (Privilege is also tied up with forgiveness and how White people have systematically been afforded more chances to “try again,” as Dr. Ruha Benjamin details here.)Change is ConstantThere’s one specific pattern of equity pushback that I’ve noticed in recent years when it comes to change. It looks like this:Once upon a time, I supported X.My mind/actions around X shifted (likely as a result of feedback).I talk about my learning and work for change against X.Person in support of X declares, “You used to support X. Here’s proof! Therefore, you are in no  place to push against it and you are the thing that is oppressive, not X!”This type of pushback is a non-argument and a form of  whataboutism. It is a distraction that makes use of something true (past support of X) and throws in a nonsensical curveball. “You used to love X” does not mean that X is not racist, sexist, ableist, heterosexist, classist, or oppressive in myriad ways. Evidence of past support is just that: evidence of past support. Change alone is neither ethical nor unethical, but purity and perfectionism are ideals in White supremacy culture. Stagnation is never the only option, nor are any people or institutions doomed to be frozen in one place and time forever. History exists, and new histories are created every day. How we acknowledge the past and what we decide to do today are up to us. This last discussion is one I expect to see more of in the #kidlit world well into the 2020s. Change might look like me raving about a book and later retracting that recommendation after listening to critical perspectives from people with insights and identities different than my own. It wouldn’t be the first or last time I deemed a book “excellent” and had my mind changed. (If creators, publishers, or review journals make edits to their work as a result of feedback, this also wouldn’t be new.) It’s worth noting the importance of aiming for transparency in these experiences; if I try to brush a mistake under the rug, the learning stops with me and I am not taking full accountability.Change might look like celebrating the evolution of a book award, even when I once uncritically supported that award as-is. It might look like increased interrogation of norms that have been embedded into my professional networks: conventions like organizations expecting free labor and financial sacrifices to be made by people in their membership without any questions asked; conventions like book criticism’s “Look at each book for what it is, rather than what it is not.” (Vicky Smith has already pointed out the limits of taking some of our field’s esteemed guidelines as a be-all and end-all.)Change might mean embracing ambiguity and challenging interpretations of librarianship’s critical terminology, especially when those interpretations conflict with the profession’s core values. I believe “professionalism” and “intellectual freedom” are important for everyone and I believe it is necessary to question what it means that not everybody has equal power to define these values for the masses—and gatekeep what these values can look like in active, everyday practice. Change might mean a lot of things, only a few of which I’ve shared here. I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that wondering what “2030 Elisa” will think of me right now kind of freaks me out. Still, worrying about that is energy better spent elsewhere, and doing nothing only supports the oppressive status-quo. As I look forward to the next decade, I’m left with hope and resolve, and also with these words recently shared by Edi Campbell: “There’s no ‘woke.’ Only ‘waking’.”"},
{"title": "Newbery, Caldecott and Perspectives on Excellence", "date": "Tuesday, January 7, 2020", "text": "Each year leading up tothe announcement of the Newbery and Caldecott awards, there are discussions of eligible books andattempts to predict the outcomes, while those serving on the committees quietlygo about their work. They are quiet by design: while the award criteria arepublic, the work itself takes place in confidentiality that, regardless ofintent and purpose, is also exclusionary. I understand the desirefor confidentiality during the process, although I don’t think thatconfidentiality needs to extend in perpetuity. I was a member of theAssociation for Library Service to Children (ALSC) board that voted to ease some ofthose rules, making suggestions, nominations and justification statementsaccompanying nominations for post-2016 committees available after 50 years. I’dlove to see future boards go farther; for example, allowing the changes toapply to 2016 and earlier, and expanding the transparency to ballotingresults. My rationale is aboutmore than desire for greater transparency. I’m concerned that the auraof secrecy around the Newbery and Caldecott has led to a cult of mystiquesurrounding the awards, one that promotes the idea that they are somehow biggerthan the work we do in the field of children’s and young adult literature. Infact, they are, simply, part of the work we do, and require the same vigilanceas other forms of critique and evaluation when it comes to awareness of howWhiteness impacts the work we do.The fields of publishingand librarianship and criticism, and those of us in them, are struggling andstriving when it comes to understanding this. We still fail more than we thriveat it. The Myth of SpecialInsightFor me, one example ofour failure is the idea that only those who have served on one of thesecommittees, who have “been there,” can understand the rigor of the awardprocess. The “I have served”argument, intended or not, is an insidious way to silence those who have neverserved on the committees, whether in the context of sitting around a tableconversing socially or weighing in on critical issues in our field. The “I haveserved” argument automatically puts some of us on the inside and some of us onthe outside. It’s essential to consider the implications of that exclusionarystance not only in general, but specifically as it relates to White privilege,given that Newbery and Caldecott committee membership across the years has beenlargely inclusive of White people, while Black, Indigenous and People of Color(BIPOC) are greatly underrepresented. BIPOC individuals haveserved on the Newbery and Caldecott across the years, bringing their own criticalperspectives and experiences, but too often they have been solitary members ofa committee--something slowly, happily, essentially changing. Yet even as ALSCworks toward greater diversity on its award committees, there are barriers thatmay preclude some from serving. Some can impact both BIPOC and White people,including the cost of attending conferences, and employer support for thenecessary time away. There are also barriers that can impact BIPOCdisproportionately, including the critical work they may be doing in othercontexts to push the publishing profession forward when it comes to authenticrepresentation, and in promoting diverse voices and books. (Today, service onan ALSC award committee requires giving such work up, or doing it anonymously,when it comes to eligible books during one’s year of service. Those who serveagree to this, but it’s a requirement that may make some decline theopportunity.)I also find the “I haveserved” (with its implied “and therefore understand while you don’t”) argumentproblematic because, quite simply, I think it’s untrue. Those who have been onthe Newbery and Caldecott committees don’t have membership in a special clubwith a secret password. Nor have we participated in a sacred ritual that givesus shared insight. My experience on Newbery was deeply satisfying. But the onlydeeper insight it gave me was into the dynamic for the year I served,along with a deeper understanding of how the discussion and critique, asintense as it is, is also, inevitably, subjective, shaped by who is part ofit. Subjectivity By AnyOther Name...The rules ofconfidentiality mean the details of how the Newbery and Caldecott committeesarrive at their decision are considered irrelevant in the big picture. And yet,known or not, those details matter. The individual perspectives of eachcommittee member matter. Everyone contributes to the discussion and thedynamic. Everyone contributes to what is—or isn’t—nominated. Everyonecontributes to what is—and isn’t—considered when it comes to individual booksas committee members read and suggest and reread and nominate and discuss theeligible books in light of the Newbery and Caldecott award criteria. Committee members’ workis informed by their individual identities and opinions and insights andexperiences as they participate in a process that is far from empirical,although it sometimes seems as if we’re expected to believe that it is. Theaward criteria they consider to arrive at a decision doesn’t make thedefinition of “most distinguished” a fixed, objective target. Nor does the factthat it’s an effort shared among 15 people working toward numerical consensus.It is a process deeply informed and shaped by who is participating. And whenaward committees have been majority White, there is added danger in not acknowledgingthis subjectivity when it comes to thinking about how we do what we do.I don’t think individualcommittees operate with an agenda regarding what kind of book will or won’twin. But the awards don’t occupy some rarified space in which they aren’tinfluenced by the individual identities and group dynamics of those involved intheir choosing. They are influenced by both. The truth is that eachand every year, a group of different individuals would most likely have chosena different winner. In fact, that’s what Ioften say when talking about the awards to librarians and teachers. I also notethat these awards are two of many “perspectives on excellence,” to quote aphrase I learned from Cooperative Children’s Book Center (CCBC) Director EmeritusGinny Moore Kruse, because there are many children’s and young adult literatureawards, and many wonderful books worthy of acknowledgment each year.Representation MattersThis doesn’t mean eachand every committee hasn’t worked incredibly hard to reach its decision. Thisdoesn’t mean winners aren’t chosen with integrity. But it does mean thatrepresentation matters, in books, and on the committees, and even, perhaps, inwhat is—or isn’t—stated in the award criteria and definitions.ALSC added a statement about“Diversity and ALSC Media Award Evaluation” to all its award and notablecommittee manuals in 2015. Among other things, it states,As individuals servingon committees evaluate materials according to the criteria outlined for theirspecific charge, they should strive to be aware of how their own perspectivesand experiences shape their responses to materials. Every committee memberbrings unique strengths to the table, but every committee member also bringsgaps in knowledge and understanding, and biases.  Committee members arestrongly encouraged to be open to listening and learning as well as sharing asthey consider materials representing diverse experiences both familiar andunfamiliar to them.This statement touches on the ideas of cultural competence and cultural humility withoutnaming them, but I wonder what it would look like to have tenets of culturalcompetence and cultural humility built into the definitions and/or criteria forindividual awards as committee members are asked to consider what it means fora book to be “distinguished.”  (Or, as Hal Schrieve asked, how can the award decenter Whiteness?)How, for example, mightthe Newbery criteria stating “Presentation ofinformation including accuracy, clarity, and organization” be furtherclarified, especially around that thorny concept of “accuracy”? What might beexplicitly asked of both the books and of committee members evaluating a workwhen it comes to an author writing about—and committee members readingabout—experiences beyond those they’ve lived or have close knowledge of? Inwhat way might committee members not just be asked but required to considertheir own cultural identities in relation to the works they are evaluating andthe comments of one another? How might the definitions and criteria for theseawards reflect White privilege in ways I don’t even see?  (I am aware thatALSC may be limited by legal agreements under which the awards were establishedwhen it comes to the “terms,” which is why I’m referring here only to“definitions” and “criteria.”)I have been skirtingaround these ideas, and hesitating on this post, for awhile. I don’t want tosilence or ignore the history or experiences of BIPOC who have served on awardcommittees. I don’t want to ignore or diminish the contributions of anyone whohas served on the committees, which are an incredible commitment of time andeffort. Nor do I want to diminish the honor of being chosen a winner or honorrecipient. But my biggest concernis that I don’t know all the questions to ask, let alone have theanswers.  What I do know is that critical perspectives on how the Newberyand Caldecott are chosen are not the sole purview of those who have served onthe committees.Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "When White Feelings Dominate", "date": "Thursday, November 7, 2019", "text": "In an October 28 article titled “Yes, But… One Librarian’s Thoughts About Doing It Right” in OLA Quarterly (a special issue devoted to Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion), librarian Heather McNeil shares her thoughts and feelings about a variety of subjects related to racism.  Her piece is divided into four sections, titled as follows: “Collection Development”, “Dr. Seuss”, “Debbie Reese”, and “Reading While White.”It is impossible for me to respond to this piece without appearing, to some at least, to be operating from a place of defensiveness; any assertion to the contrary will be met with some incredulity.  Nevertheless, regardless of whether we’re believed, I can honestly say that this piece is not the result of, or meant to be a response to, the criticisms McNeil directs at Reading While White. If you want to read what she says about us, you’re welcome to check out her article, and to agree or disagree with her at your discretion.I am, however, deeply troubled by the blatant disrespect Ms. McNeil directs towards our colleague Dr. Debbie Reese.  McNeil’s language, and the content of her attack on Dr. Reese, are part of a larger pattern of White dismissal of Dr. Reese’s work; I’ve heard many White people disparage Dr. Reese using similar tactics.Before you continue reading the rest of this post, please read Dr. Reese’s response here if you haven’t already.Now, here are my own reactions.1 - Never does McNeil refer to Dr. Reese as “Dr.”  She calls her “Debbie Reese” and “Ms. Reese”, ignoring and erasing the scholarship and qualifications that Dr. Reese brings to her work. She also neglects to name that Dr. Reese is Native (she is tribally enrolled, Nambé Pueblo), thereby dismissing the lens of expertise Dr. Reese brings to her work through her lived experiences as a Native person.2 - McNeil titles the paragraph “Debbie Reese”.  She does not title it “American Indians In Children’s Literature” (the title of Dr. Reese’s blog) or “An Indigenous Critique of Whiteness In Children’s Literature” (the title of Dr. Reese’s Arbuthnot lecture, which McNeil criticizes).  In titling the section “Debbie Reese”, McNeil levels an attack on Dr. Reese as a person, rather than criticizing Dr. Reese’s ideas, words, or actions.I’m speaking to my fellow White people now. If you retain only one thing from this response piece, please let it be this: When you name your BIPOC colleagues without their permission, you are potentially putting them in danger.  The words that seem innocuous to you can become lightning rods for some (like Neo-Nazis and the alt-right) who seek to do real harm to BIPOC people. I am so grateful to the BIPOC people who have educated me about this.3 - McNeil begins the passage about Dr. Reese thusly:“Hoo boy. Opening a can of worms here.”This is, in written form, what many of us have heard countless times in conversations in professional spaces.  Someone says “Debbie Reese” (almost always omitting the “Dr.”) and follows it with a sigh, a chuckle, a groan, or some equivalent of “Hoo boy. Opening a can of worms here.”This is racism in action.  This is the moment when we White people enter into the unspoken agreement that Dr. Reese, as a person, constitutes a Problem--and we agree to unite to contain and constrict this Problem.4 - McNeil then goes on to say:“Believe me, I admire her work.”This is another key component of the unspoken White agreement.  This is the part where we White people cover our bases. We are “the good ones”, so we say something meaningless about how much we support Dr. Reese in theory, before going on to dismiss her in actuality.And therein lies the crux of the issue.  Many of us White people like the idea of supporting Dr. Reese in her work, but balk and withdraw when Dr. Reese doesn’t prioritize our comfort in how she conducts her work.And when the lived reality of fighting racism doesn’t live up to our White expectations and imaginations, that’s when we write articles about our White feelings, and because we’re White, get them published in peer-reviewed, academic journals.-Allie Jane BrucePostscript: Yes, I’m aware that Ms. McNeil can, if she should so choose, point to this post and say “See? Reading While White DOES want me to feel bad.” There’s really no way to counter this self-fulfilling White fragility, so I won’t try, especially since according to her, the damage is already done; we already made her feel bad. Ms. McNeil is free to read this post or not, to feel however she may, and to process those feelings however she may wish.  My only suggestion is that she process these feelings in private and with other White people, so as to not task BIPOC people with still more White-feelings-oriented labor. Ms McNeil: We are ready and happy to have a conversation if you wish to talk; just email us.Ed. 12/11/19 1:45pm: With apologies for the lack of timeliness, I want to highlight this piece by Max Macias.

{"title": "Reviewing While White: Exile from Eden", "date": "Monday, September 30, 2019", "text": "Andrew Smith’s Exile from Eden, the sequel to his award-winning Grasshopper Jungle, had its book birthday last week (September 24, 2019). There is… a lot to unpack with this book, and today I’m going to highlight some of the racism and sexism that abounds in Smith’s latest YA novel. Quotes and page numbers are from the advanced readers copy. Spoilers ahead, if you care about that sort of thing.Before we dig in, some background: At the end of Grasshopper Jungle, protagonist Austin, his best friend/boyfriend Robby, Austin’s girlfriend Shann, and several of their parents move in to a massive underground bunker (aka \"Eden\"). There, they hope they will be safe from the ginormous, horny praying mantises (also sometimes called Unstoppable Soldiers) that have taken over Iowa and also possibly the USA. Austin is unethically nonmonogamous (he is dating Shann while also dating Robby, which Shann knows about but does not consent to) and at the end of Grasshopper Jungle has sex in the bunker with Shann. Exile from Eden is set sixteen years after the end of Grasshopper Jungle and is narrated by their son, Arek.One of the few characters we meet from beyond “Eden” is a twelve-year-old boy. Described as “brown-skinned” with “wild dreadlocks,” his name is Breakfast (edible brown child, much?). He is frequently described, by himself and the narration, as “completely wild” and he is obsessed with the idea of having money. “‘You have to be wild to survive,’ he told Olive. ‘Just look at me, wouldja? There’s no denying I’m wild. Who’s got money? Me. I’ve got money. Wild’” [16].Breakfast (again, the only brown character) spends most of his time naked because he “hates wearing clothes”, and he is constantly “scratching his balls,” spitting, and urinating. He is described as animalistic: “Roaring incoherently like an animal, which was basically what Breakfast was anyway” [107-108]. Also, wait for it: his only companion turns out to be a CHIMPANZEE who doesn’t talk (because, ahem, she’s a CHIMPANZEE) and whom he GENUINELY BELIEVES IS JUST A VERY HAIRY GIRL WHO NEVER TALKS BECAUSE SHE JUST AGREES WITH WHATEVER HE HAS TO SAY. Holy cow. Just let that sink in.The three main human women in Exile from Eden fall neatly into the maiden/mother/crone series of archetypes, existing with few hints at any interior life beyond their relationships to Arek.Arek’s love interest is his only peer, Amelie Sing Brees, a biracial (Chinese and White American) teen girl who is his aunt by partnership (Arek describes his father Austin’s partner Robby as his father as well, and Amelie is Robby’s half-sister). Arek constantly puts her on a pedestal, regularly saying she’s braver than he is, and she simultaneously has no shame about and no knowledge of anything related to Arek’s sexuality. In keeping with the “maiden” trope, which requires sexual purity and vulnerability simultaneously, Amelie is almost sexually assaulted by a rogue ex-soldier (human, not praying mantis). Even this, though, is really about Arek; we learn almost nothing about how Amelie feels and it is a plot point primarily used to further Arek’s emotional development and increase “drama” (*ahem* #menwritingwomen). Arek’s mother Shann is described as an emotional deadweight whose depression is oppressive (“Thirteen was a bad year for me. My mother’s sadness and anger became a stormy ocean inside the hole, drowning me, and I think Robby was only trying to make me happy” [13]) and whose parenting is overly controlling (“‘Why have you never taken me outside like this before?’ I asked. / My father shook his head. ‘Your mother and grandmother would never stand for it.’ / Robby nodded. ‘There will be hell to pay when we get home, Porcupine’” [34-35]). Arek’s grandmother (Shann’s mother) is described as uptight, obsessed with the perpetuation of traditional nuclear familial structures and traditions, and in particular obsessed with circumcising Arek. The symbolism is… rich.Arek’s primary influence seems to be his father Austin, the misogynistic protagonist of Grasshopper Jungle, and unfortunately the two-dimensionality with which he views and treats women seems to be a patriarchal lineage. Unsurprisingly, Austin constantly perpetuates toxic masculinity by both ignoring the women who make up a *literal* 50% of his community and passing that misogyny onto his son. Austin completely ignores Shann as a co-parent, undermining and belittling her role. Likewise, Arek is vaguely aware that his mother’s emotional distance may have been caused by something (gee, I don’t know, maybe the MASSIVE AMOUNT OF UNACKNOWLEDGED TRAUMA she experienced since the finale of Grasshopper Jungle??), but he has no interest in understanding her better.In perpetuating these most basic systems of oppression without using his text to push back against them, Smith makes readers complicit in that oppression and further perpetuates the idea that this representation--inaccurate, harmful, and insulting to his readers--is acceptable. This is not a surprise; we all remember the “keep YA kind” debacle of 2015. Nevertheless, it’s frustrating and disappointing that Smith, his editor at Simon & Schuster (David Gale), and his agent (Michael Bourret) have chosen to yet again ignore both the specific critiques Smith has previously received (it’s been almost exactly four and a half years since “I consider myself completely ignorant to all things woman and female” and the street date of Exile) and the important work of scholars like Edi Campbell and Kyla Wazana Tompkins, who highlight the problematic associations of black children with monkeys and brown children as comestible. When you’re been gifted the tools to do better, it is shameful to fail so greatly.--Kazia Berkley-Cramer"},
{"title": "The Stories White People Tell...and Control", "date": "Friday, September 13, 2019", "text": "We recently received a question: Why are so many picture books (often biographies) written by White authors and then illustrated by a BIPOC artist? And often these stories are labeled as #OwnVoices [credit: Corinne Duyvis] when really it’s a White person telling the story of a racial minority. If the publisher came up with the idea, why not choose a person from that background to both illustrate AND tell the story? If the author came up with the idea, what does this say about White people and our insistence to control the narrative? And ultimately, what is the impact of this pattern of White-authored narratives about BIPOC on child readers?A few of us at RWW thought we’d explore this question, and we are sharing our reflections below.---ALLIE: There is an overabundance of “overcoming pain” narratives in these White-authored, BIPOC-illustrated, non-fiction picture books. I think of what Zetta Elliott termed the “White appetite for Black pathology.”We have decided not to list examples because we do not want any BIPOC illustrators to be dragged into the spotlight against their will, or feel compelled to respond to this piece, or, especially, feel pressured to justify their choices. We ask that our readers--especially White readers--be mindful of this dynamic as well, should you choose to comment or respond to this piece.But the pattern is undeniable--just look for picture book biographies in your library, if you need a starting point. And as a pattern, these books indicate a system that favors White authors telling stories of BIPOC pain, a system in which a BIPOC artist’s role is to illustrate those White author’s words. Giving these books a BIPOC illustrator doesn’t solve the problem of that White appetite for BIPOC pain.SAM: One obvious issue - how much (and what kind of) research has the White author done about this subject? Can we trust this person to tell this story? I think the answer a great majority of the time is a resounding NO, and yet… we still see these books, over and over.ELISA: I think there are so many factors at play, including what you wrote about, Allie, and how White-controlled school curricula can often reinforce and motivate these pain narratives. I’m also thinking about how much nonfiction authorship has traditionally (even if implicitly) meant expertise in a subject area, and how we White people are all too often regarded as an expert on everything--even experiences that are not our own. I would think that the way picture books are acquired has to do with this too. Unless the publisher has the idea outright (as our questioner brought up) it is my understanding that manuscripts are often acquired first, and then the illustrator is assigned later. Assuming that is true (at least most of the time), this would mean publishers are signing White creators’ manuscripts first and then inviting BIPOC creators into the projects. In which case, the White lens is still the one on which the entire project is based. A White author received a book deal about a BIPOC subject - and this could very much mean that a BIPOC author did not. Still, I do not in any way want to devalue the impact of illustration and visual literacy! Reading pictures is as important as reading text--and talented artists have and will continue to share their voices and make their mark in ways that are incredible.ALLIE: Oh, I totally agree. Especially for the youngest kids, who will dive into these books by sitting with and absorbing the pictures long before they can read the words. BIPOC illustrators can imbue their artwork with an authenticity that will speak to young readers in ways that words cannot, and that is invaluable.The term #OwnVoices gives a name and identity to a crucial piece of the puzzle of inequity in children’s literature: the ability and access people from marginalized groups need in order to tell (and publish!) their stories, rather than be crowded out by dominant voices who overwhelm that ability. It is one of many important markers to note and track in books’ subjects and authorship, and at the same time it is a complex issue. Unfortunately, the term can be and has been weaponized by people attempting to police what topics BIPOC can and cannot write about. We do not live in a binary world in which a work is completely “OwnVoices” or “Not OwnVoices.” (For more on this topic, I highly recommend these FAQs by Corinne Duyvis, who originated the #OwnVoices term and hashtag.)So while we might all agree that an #OwnVoices illustrator is a positive… it is not a systemic fix. It feels more like an easy and comfortable halfway-path for the Powers That Be… a way for publishers and marketers to be able to put a book in the “OwnVoices” category (that false binary) without addressing the deeper problems with inequitable representation and the White fixation on BIPOC pain narratives. In short, it’s part of a system that preserves the power White people have to tell BIPOC stories.ELISA: I remember hearing about White male authors negotiating language in their book contracts requesting BIPOC artists--especially women and nonbinary people--be hired to illustrate their manuscripts. This can prevent all-male or all-White projects and can have the impact of increasing the numbers of BIPOC illustrators publishing books. At the same time, I can also see where this might end up assuaging guilt and supporting that “comfortable halfway-path” you describe. If someone is thinking we’re reading too much into this, one challenge might be to look for books where a BIPOC author has written about any nonfiction subject, and a White artist has been hired to illustrate it. Can you think of any? (I can think of only a few.) That it is harder to list the latter and super easy to list the former shows that this pattern is undeniable.Looking at biographies about BIPOC subjects written by White people can also reveal (through the topics and themes that keep emerging: pain narratives, books about athletes and musicians from more than a half-century ago, etc.) where White adult interest lies.  When White creators and publishers control the industry, White people are determining what is interesting, which stories are worthy of exploration, whose stories are being told, and how they are told through text (White-authored books, even biographies about BIPOC subjects, often appear to speak to White readers as a default audience). What topics, themes, or subjects might emerge (or how might these same stories be written differently) if these books were not authored by White people? SAM: I think you’re both right about this pattern being more palatable for the White-dominated publishing world. Think of the White authors who have made a career writing books about BIPOC subjects - I wonder how often one of these authors thinks to themselves, “Hmmm, maybe I should step aside and let an insider tell this story.” Recently I heard a story about a White author being asked what research they did before writing a book centered around a culture that wasn’t their own. The author’s response? That they “probably should have.” (I asked for and was given permission to link to the post in question.) The sheer audacity to not only try to tell the story instead of using one’s privilege to leverage a BIPOC voice, but also to show such flippant disregard for authenticity? That’s a White people thing.ELISA: That’s an all-around yikes and YES. Another thing we White people like to do is pretend that because informational texts are rooted in facts, that they are somehow race-neutral and that the identity of the creator does not matter. (Pretending Whiteness has no meaning is a pretty effective strategy to both ignore and maintain White dominance.) Remember when the Tham Luang cave rescue happened last year in Thailand? I remember listening to voices on Twitter talking about what an awesome children’s book the story would make, but also joking that a White person would probably write and publish it first. Sure enough, that’s what happened. All books contain a point of view--including informational texts. And that’s before we address how many children’s books claiming to be nonfiction actually contain misinformation, stereotypes, or nothing at all about BIPOC (straight up erasure). ALLIE: I also think about the impact on BIPOC illustrators, to have these projects so constant and prevalent. Your job is still to illustrate a White person's words.  And the message implicitly sent to White illustrators: You don't have to deign to illustrate the books that \"those people\" write.These messages are deeply dangerous. The CCBC statistics we’re all so familiar with are highly useful, but statistics alone do not tell the full story, do not encapsulate all the subtle methods by which White people cling to a White-dominant world--in this case, by controlling who gets to tell the story.SAM: So where does this leave us; namely, what can I do as a _____ (fill in the blank: teacher, librarian, caregiver, general kidlit person, etc.) to make sure I de-center the dominant White cishet male gaze in books about marginalized people and groups in as many ways as possible - the writing, the visuals, all the way down to the editing and publishing - in my interactions with the children in my life? How do we (speaking now about the wider kidlit world) make sure we de-center the dominant White cishet male gaze in books about marginalized people and groups in as many ways as possible - again, the writing, the visuals, all the way down to the editing and publishing? Should publishers hire sensitivity readers for nonfiction titles in which the book creators do not share the same identity/identities as the person or groups that the book centers? We in the kidlit community need to consider the ramifications of this pattern.ALLIE: Well, I’m a definite “yes” on that last question, and I know many publishers do indeed hire sensitivity readers for nonfiction as well as fiction (good on them.)I think for me, it comes down to recognizing that this pattern is part of a system of White oppression in children’s literature. That system is nuanced and tricky. It adapts to challenges to its power, and those adaptations aren’t always immediately obvious. We won’t out-smart racism by introducing more binaries (“#OwnVoices Only!!”) into the equation, but we can recognize racist patterns for what they are, and use the tools available to us to fight (e.g. the OwnVoices identifier) against these racist patterns.ELISA: Agree. And I'm pushing myself to remember, always, that although there are a lot of adults in the kidlit ecosystem, it is young readers who are on the receiving end of these patterns once these books are out in the world and into their lives."},
{"title": "Summer Reading", "date": "Monday, June 10, 2019", "text": "It’s almost summer, which means people are starting to plan or make goals for their next few months of reading. If you’re looking for recommendations, look no further than the 2019 Summer Reading List published by the We Are Kid Lit Collective. Formerly known as We’re the People, the We Are Kid Lit Collective was founded by Edi Campbell in 2015. The website explains that the group \"works to create materials and opportunities to recognize the humanity of Indigenous and People of Color (IPOC) in youth literature. Our work is premised upon the principles of social justice, equity, and inclusion and centers IPOC voices in children’s literature in order to identify, challenge and dismantle while supremacy and both internalized and systemic racism. Our intended audience includes educators, librarians, caregivers and young people. We look for ways to improve the literacies of IPOC children, promote books written by and about IPOC, and to encourage gatekeepers to bring a lens of critical literacy to their work.\" The 2019 Summer Reading List was curated by a team of authors, librarians, and scholars: Tad Andracki, Edi Campbell, Laura Jiménez, Sujei Lugo, Lyn Miller-Lachmann, Debbie Reese, and Dr. Sonia Alejandra Rodriguez. Every title was read and vetted by at least two professionals to ensure the books celebrate “diversity, inclusivity, and intersecting identities.” Check out the list and all of the other resources available on the We Are Kid Lit page!What additional books are you looking forward to reading this summer? Please share in the comments. Here are a few titles some of the RWW contributors are excited to read or recommend:Jenna: The only Octavia Butler I’ve read is Kindred, so I’m excited to delve into more of her work, starting with this new edition of Parable of the Sower. My favorite book of the year so far is Natalie Tan’s Book of Luck and Fortune by debut author Roselle Lim so I’ve been recommending that nonstop as a great summer read.Allie: I cannot WAIT to dive into An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States For Young People, by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, Debbie Reese, and Jean Mendoza. For my own recommendation, although this came out a while ago, I want everyone to read Mother of the Sea by Zetta Elliott, a novella that straddles the line between YA and Adult and between realism and magical realism. It’s a powerful work of art and activism. Sam: So, I’m currently in the midst of Ebony Elizabeth Thomas’s The Dark Fantastic: Race and the Imagination from Harry Potter to the Hunger Games, which is required reading for everyone in children’s and young adult literature. I just finished Good Talk: a Memoir in Conversations by Mira Jacob, and it was one of those books that you want to reread the moment you finish it. (The only reason I didn’t do that was because of the size of my to-read pile!) Megan: I’m looking forward to both The Dark Fantastic and the adaptation of  An Indigenous People’s History of the United States . Recent or not-so-recent reads I can’t stop thinking about include The Griefkeeper by Alexandra Villasante (just finished!), Love from A to Z by S.K. Ali, and A Place to Belong by Cynthia Kadohata. The New Kid by Jerry Craft is about the school year but so funny and fearless that there’s never not a good time to read it. Finally, although it’s not by a BIPOC author, I want to also give a shout out to A.S. King’s Dig, which has me thinking a lot about how White writers can address race and racism--something I think this book excels at (and although I wouldn’t say it’s the main point of the story, it’s not not the point, either). Elisa: There are so many good books here! My summer book club is discussing The Dark Fantastic and An Indigenous Peoples’ History of the United States For Young People, so I’ll be reading those too. I’m also looking forward to reading and learning from Eve Ewing’s 1919, a book of poetry spotlighting stories from the Chicago race riot. Another one on my to-read list for August (when it gets released) is Ibram X. Kendi’s How to Be an Antiracist. I recommend everybody take a look at This Place: 150 Years Retold, a comics anthology exploring stories of Indigenous resistance and leadership past, present, and future.Kazia: Like Sam, I just read Good Talk and can’t recommend it enough! I have two nonfiction titles at the top of my (small) TBR pile of books for grownups:The Collected Schizophrenias: Essays by Esmé Weijun Wang and A Bound Woman Is a Dangerous Thing: The Incarceration of African American Women from Harriet Tubman to Sandra Bland by DaMaris B. Hill. Last year I read and loved The Kiss Quotient by Helen Hoang, so this summer I’m also really excited to get my hands on her sophomore romance, The Bride Test!"},
{"title": "Problematic Patterns In White Narratives About BIPOC Critique", "date": "Monday, May 13, 2019", "text": "“Cancel culture,” “Attack,” “Toxic,” “YA Twitter mob,” “McCarthyism,” “Apartheid,” “Online lynch mob,” “New-Age censorship,” “Orwellian,” “Cesspool,” “Public shaming,” “Pile-on culture,” “Thought police,” “Book burners,” “Diversity Stormtroopers,” “Cannibalistic,” “Dangerous people…”The list goes on and on (and on and on).  These are just some of the phrases regularly leveled at BIPOC scholars who utilize anti-racist lenses in their critiques of children’s literature.Who levels these charges? Overwhelmingly, White people: librarians, teachers, book creators, publishing professionals, journalists, bloggers, and more.Today, we examine patterns that crop up time and time again as White people create, disseminate, and escalate racist narratives about BIPOC advocates and criticism in the world of children’s literature.(“We,” today, is Allie and Kazia Berkley-Cramer, our newest RWW member, who you can read more about at the end of this piece. Welcome, Kazia!)THE PATTERNCritique and criticism are an integral part of any literary or artistic community, and the world of children’s literature is no exception. Members of the community--reviewers, creators, librarians, teachers, booksellers, parents, authors and artists themselves--constantly share feedback publicly, whether on Goodreads, blogs, Twitter, or other preferred social media platforms. It’s part of the process. And at least once a year, a children’s or YA book--often a highly anticipated release--is publicly critiqued and the situation quickly escalates. Here is the pattern we’re seeing:As per usual in children’s lit publishing, folks from the community get hold of a galley, egalley, jacket copy, art sample, early copy, etc. of a book.Folks (usually BIPOC) provide critique laying out the precise ways the work reinforces problematic, oppressive ideologies, sometimes asking others to reconsider their initial enthusiasm--sometimes publicly, sometimes privately, sometimes semi-privately. These are often intra-community conversations.White people, especially journalists with mainstream platforms and huge numbers of followers, blow up these discussions--mischaracterizing the nature of criticism, equating critique with attack, ascribing motives that include jealousy, attention-seeking, and downright malice, describing the critical community in ways that depend on racist and sexist stereotypes, crying “censorship” and “book banning” and leaving all nuanced discussions behind.In her recent Arbuthnot lecture, Dr. Debbie Reese commented on the long history of this pattern, which predates social media and the Internet itself, and the media’s framing of these discussions. “Instead of taking children’s literature seriously… and the analysis that we try to do as critics of children’s literature, it got framed as entertainment, and drama. Assaults on freedom of speech. To the [Diversity] Jedi, those mainstream articles were ignoring the criticism that can shape children’s literature, and they were ignoring the audience for all these books. That audience is young people.… For the mainstream media, articles about these books were part of the 24-hour news cycle. They were big news in these 24-hour periods, gone from the next 24-hour cycle. But for the parents, and the teachers, and the librarians that use children’s books, and for the writers and editors and publishers, reviewers and critics who create, promote, and study children’s books, our concerns about books are not a 24-hour news cycle. For those of us who believe in the power of children’s books, we’re in it 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We know children’s books shape the future. For hundreds of years, Whiteness has had its way, but today, we’re using social media to push against Whiteness.” (We highly recommend the entire speech, which you can see here. These remarks, 50:20-52:53.) The media’s framing, with its emphasis on “drama,” ignores the context of these discussions and their place in the long history of the fight for BIPOC representation. It also ignores the real impacts these books have on real people--primarily children.When the overwhelmingly White, mainstream, media report on these “dramas,” they rarely include the voices of the BIPOC scholars whose critiques are under fire. We highly recommend following our Kindred Spirits (list on the right-hand side of the screen) as they lead the field of criticism as well as discussions about criticism. We especially recommend, in addition to viewing Dr. Reese’s Arbuthnot lecture, these Twitter threads by Dr. Ebony Elizabeth Thomas.CYCLICAL WHITE SUPREMACY, HYPOCRISY, AND FRAGILITY AT WORKWhen White folks jump in, leveling charges of censorship and thought policing, responding as if the very existence of criticism with an anti-oppression lens is irrational and unexpected and new, they can literally endanger the lives of critics who have been doing this work for eons. To call criticism a “mob” or similar is to further marginalize already marginalized voices, to irrationalize them and often to equate oppressed groups with oppressors, such as when online voices are referred to as “lynch mobs.” Equating resistance to oppression with oppression itself is a highly effective, long-practiced technique used to weaken that resistance. Framing advocacy for marginalized groups as “violent” also ignores the fact that BIPOC critics run the risk of real violence from White supremacists and other terrorists who wish them bodily harm. The vast majority of us would never send a threat of violence, or wish such a thing on anyone, but when we White people buy into the narrative that BIPOC critics are “overly forceful” or “violent”--even White people who want to support their advocacy work--we are part of this problem.Many times, White journalists (and non-journalists) cite the fact that many of these conversations happen on social media as evidence of the irrationality and ignorance informing it--conveniently disregarding that many of the people engaging and leading these discussions on social media are experts in their fields, with enormous credentials and decades of experience. White professionals frame the BIPOC who participate in criticism, especially women, as ringleaders, out to censor and damage other authors. This framing is rooted in racist and sexist stereotypes, not in facts. And although the presence or absence of scholarly qualifications shouldn’t ever disqualify someone’s lived experience, framing BIPOC critics doing advocacy work as an “angry Twitter mob” railroads over the fact that many of those prominent critics hold PhDs.And when White journalists who employ all of the above techniques insert themselves into conversation about and/or among BIPOC critics and creators, they exploit the intra-community nature of these conversations and discredit the multi-varied expertise, opinions, and experience of Black, Indigenous, and people of color--an especially pernicious and toxic form of racism.As Sam Bloom notes, we as a broad professional community, and White people in particular, need to come to terms with our hypocrisy in discussion criticism--who gets to be a critic, and when? Do we only cite BIPOC criticism when it’s convenient and furthers our viewpoint, or do we genuinely absorb what these scholars say to better form our own opinions? Do we value “professional” reviews over blogging and other social media, thereby prioritizing people who have the privilege of time (and thus also money) to review for journals, either completely for free or very little? While several organizations, including Kirkus and SLJ, have made a particular effort to diversify their staff of reviewers (in the best and broadest sense of the term), those with the time, energy, and connections outside of their “regular” jobs to take on this work are few and far between.And, accusations of censorship are often wielded as clubs to strike down well-reasoned arguments; who gets to wield these clubs? Who gets to say “this is censorship” and have that sentiment believed? Throughout modern US history, the answer is almost always: White people. When BIPOC cite the CCBC statistics as evidence of the censorship of BIPOC voices, do prominent anti-censorship organizations like the NCAC and PEN throw the weight of their institutional support behind them? We’ve yet to see that.Furthermore, whose books are canceled or postponed or celebrated by the establishment? Who bounces back, and how easily? We’ve seen an abundance of White authors and illustrators--Sophie Blackall, Jack Gantos, Daniel Handler, Meg Rosoff, Lane Smith, Raina Telgemeier, Jonah Winter, Nora Raleigh Baskin--win awards, headline book festivals, and publish further titles with ease after BIPOC scholars and critics laid bare the racism in their words, works, and deeds. Indeed, each of these authors had a long list of White protectors ready to go to bat for them, and none of them has had books actually canceled due to a public, critical outcry. This is White privilege at work.Note, too, the pattern of specific anti-Blackness at work here--the protective outcry in defense of Black creators has been strikingly small in comparison to the fervent defense we see time and again of non-Black creators, especially of White creators. We urge anyone who believes Black creators are treated equally in this industry to check both the facts and their privilege.ASKS FOR OUR FELLOW WHITE PEOPLEFellow White people, we ask you to consider how you perpetuate racism in how you talk and write about BIPOC critics. We ask that you evaluate your priorities, consider that books have an impact on their readers, and that impact CAN be harmful. We at Reading While White are White folks committed to learning about, and undoing, our White fragility in the context of how we respond to criticism--we ask you to join us in that commitment.We ask you to consider this: choosing to not buy, not read, not keep, or not lift up books that are not in keeping with values of embracing equity is NOT censorship. Choosing not to provide additional platforms for creators who perpetuate racism and white supremacy is NOT censorship.We ask that, before you level knee-jerk and irresponsible accusations of “censorship”, you consider this: do you believe that critics have the right to criticize? Or does that not fall under your definition of “free speech”? And, in turn, by leveling charges of censorship, who might you be silencing? We ask you to listen and understand critique for exactly what it is: asks for action, asks for better.-Allie Jane Bruce-Kazia Berkley-Cramer is excited to be joining the team at Reading While White! She’s been an avid (but quiet) reader of the blog since its inception, and is honored to be jumping into the fray.

Marcus and Lisa Von Drasek, CuratorsMembersof the Kerlan BoardTheABC of It: Why Children’s Books MatterChildren’sLiterature Research Collections (CLRC Kerlan)AndersonLibrary, University of MinnesotaDear Mr.Marcus and Ms. Von Drasek,We writeto you today to ask for a public response to concerns regarding the erasure ofracism in books and by authors featured in the exhibit, The ABC of It: Why Children’s Books Matter, that was first mounted at TheNew York Public Library in 2013 and brought to the University of Minnesota CLRCwith an accompanying book in February of 2019. Racismin societal institutions is more visible than ever and is being addressed inmuseums, schools, and in the children’s book industry. In this moment, theexhibit that proclaims that “children’s books matter” uses children’s books andwords about those books to tell Indigenous People and People of Color thattheir children’s experiences with anti-Native and racist books do not matter. Beforethe exhibit’s opening events on February 26 and 27, Trisha Speed Shaskan andother children’s book authors questioned Von Drasek on her directive todocents:“Don’tbe political. Do be culturally sensitive. For example Dr. Seuss was aracist. Yes he was, there is certainly a time and a place to discuss this.Comments can be put on post-its on the second floor. Caddie Woodlawn is racist.Yes it is. Again we welcome discussion. This exhibit is through one lens, thereare others.” (Lisa Von Drasek, docent training document)We areastonished that while Von Drasek acknowledged the well-documented histories ofthese books’ racist content, she refused to add new signage. Instead, she addeda display of academic articles in the corner of the second floor. The exhibitopened and was not well-received by many members of the children’s literaturecommunity, particularly because neither the February 26 nor February 27 eventincluded Q&A opportunities to publicly address these concerns with bothLeonard Marcus and Lisa Von Drasek. On March 6, Von Drasek added signage to afew of the exhibits, but their placement and size are insufficient. She alsobegan publishing a series of blog posts addressing the racism in Seuss and CaddieWoodlawn on the UMN Continuum’s Blue Ox Reviewpage, but when they were criticized, they were revised, deleted, andrepublished again, without explanation.Anotherresponse was to announce the “The ABC of It: Whose Story is Being Told? Race, Inclusion, and Representation in Children’s Literature” panel, to be held on May 10.Katie Ishizuka and Ramón Stephens, authors of an article on Seuss, and Dawn Quigley, author of an article on Caddie Woodlawn, were invited to speak on thepanel. When Ishizuka and Stephens learned about the whiteness and whitewashingof the exhibit and hostile responses to those who had spoken out about it, theycommunicated their concerns to Von Drasek in writing and verbally. Von Drasekfailed to address, or even acknowledge, any of their concerns, which reflectedthe collective concerns of their colleagues of color, who have been silenced,ignored, gaslighted, and further marginalized through this process. In protestof the individual and institutional racism occurring around the exhibit, theycanceled their participation in the panel.OnFriday, May 3, the panel was canceled because the fourth panelist, Andrea DavisPinkney, was not able to attend. The web page with that announcement indicatedthat it may be rescheduled.

We will send this letter with signatures to the CBG the following morning.Update 8:15pm 4/25/19: Comments are now closed.]April 23, 2019Rhoda TrooboffChildren’s Book GuildChildrensbookguild@yahoo.comDear Ms. Trooboff:We are members of the children’s book community writing in support of Carole Lindstrom, who was treated in an unacceptable manner at a recent luncheon. We are also writing in support of Dr. Debbie Reese, a respected authority in children’s literature and the representation of American Indians. And we are writing to suggest some changes to your protocol for handling these incidents when they occur.To summarize what happened: Your membership chair, Jacqueline Jules, initiated a conversation with Ms. Lindstrom during the lunch. Ms. Jules wanted to know what Ms. Lindstrom thought of Dr. Reese, and the intentions behind Ms. Jules’s questioning do not appear to be benign.Dr. Reese, who is so respected in the field as to be selected to give the prestigious May Hill Arbuthnot lecture, is frequently criticized by people who do not wish to understand her work, and who do not wish to understand the nuances of cultural representation. She is beloved by people who are committed to writing better books for the children we serve. She is patient, generous with her time, straightforward with her comments, and has made a groundbreaking difference in understanding racism directed at Indigenous people.Ms. Jules’ question itself was inappropriate. Dr. Reese is an industry professional, and it is in bad form to disparage an industry professional at an industry function. Furthermore, when Ms. Lindstrom explained that Dr. Reese is a friend, Ms. Jules should have dropped the subject to respect that statement and the boundary it implied. Ms. Jules did not. Instead, she continued, prompting Ms. Lindstrom to leave the luncheon. Then she initiated unwanted physical contact with Ms. Lindstrom, and then she followed her outside after Ms. Lindstrom had made it clear she wanted no part of the discussion.No one inside the room did anything to end this disturbing treatment or to intervene on behalf of a guest. What’s more, when your organization heard Ms. Lindstrom’s complaint, you shared it with Ms. Jules without first getting Ms. Lindstrom’s consent. And you do not seem to have any sort of policy for your organization on harassment, or any protocol in place for bystanders to intervene and end the harassment. It also confused many people aware of what had transpired that your organization would choose this week to single out Ms. Jules as “Author of the Day,” a choice that seems the opposite of apologetic. [Clarification: The “Author of the Day” designation was created by the Chesapeake Children’s Festival, not by the Children’ Book Guild. The CBG was boosting the promotion.]We, the undersigned, believe the Children’s Book Guild owes Ms. Lindstrom and Dr. Reese apologies, and we believe you would be well-served by creating policies that protect people from harassment of all sorts when they attend your meetings.Sincerely yours,Martha BrockenbroughJulie Foster HedlundIshta MercurioMartha Brockenbrough is the author of many works of fiction and nonfiction for young readers.

{"title": "Seizing the Narrative", "date": "Thursday, April 18, 2019", "text": "On Saturday April 13th I attended the 2019 Arbuthnot Honor Lecture delivered by Dr. Debbie Reese.  It was clarifying and motivating, and  I have since been thinking more about the way the work of Dr. Reese and other BIPOC colleagues is framed within the field of youth literature. In her April 4th column at Kirkus Reviews that looked forward to the lecture, Children’s Editor Vicky Smith provided a much-needed counterpoint to the wave of attacks on “Toxic Twitter” and the marginalizing of bloggers within the youth literature industry.   In it, I see her deliberately using language of active change-making often used to defame women of color and Native women, and instead praising it (emphases added):  “I celebrate the Diversity Jedi who have seized the children’s-literature conversation from those who’ve controlled it and forced it to open up.” “Reese’s is one voice among many that have been raised in sustained, earned rage over the past several years, demanding that the industry do better in its representation of marginalized identities.” “The methods of the Diversity Jedi are often not gentle. I know this from personal experience. But (if you permit the extension of the metaphor) it takes concerted, violent effort to take out the Death Star.” She defends the use of “rage” and “violent effort” to make needed positive change against a force that is in itself violent, as she alludes through her “Death Star” metaphor, and that is an appropriate argument.   But I am also concerned that without understanding why and how these kinds of words have been used to denounce Dr. Reese and BIPOC Diversity Jedi, this argument might play into the hands of those who condemn anger when it comes from a BIPOC community—most frequently women of color and Native women—as a way of shoring up the status quo of White supremacy.We all get angry, but only some of us are allowed to express it “righteously.”  I emailed briefly with Vicky Smith this week regarding her editorial and the issues it brought up for me, and she pointed out: \"I figure if people are mad, it’s a good idea to try to understand why.\"  So I’d like to think about other ways to describe what we are doing when we engage in these critical spaces, and how to recognize what we each bring with us to that space. What others have called “angry” I have understood to be raising one’s voice to be heard because White people are not listening.   What others have condemned as “violent” I see as activism that threatens the status quo, to which the status quo reacts. What others have called “unprofessional” I see as colleagues disrupting an unspoken code of Whiteness that has nothing to do with our work, and in fact prevents us from doing our work by preventing us from questioning.  Here are other words to describe the work of the Dr. Reese and many of the Diversity Jedi:  Inquisitiveness. Seeing something not right—Whiteness’s refusal to admit the stranglehold it has on children’s literature—Dr. Reese asks questions.  She has dedicated her career to it, and her critical analyses are based in questions.  By asking a question, she asks us to engage in a different perspective, which is surely the point of critical analysis, but may not be where Whiteness was trying to keep the conversation. I think this is what is perceived of as “seizing the conversation.”Persistence.  Undoing the hold of White supremacy on our professional discourse and the creative process of writing and illustrating books and media for youth is the work of generations. Racism is persistent, so only by exposing and pressing against it persistently can we make any change.  I think this is what is perceived of as “demanding.”  Intrepidness.  Every time I see Dr. Reese speak, I am amazed at how undaunted she appears.  Not fearless, perhaps, but working with clear sight of the threats facing her.  I think this is what is perceived of as “not gentle.”  What does being gentle with racism get anyone?  I don’t want to suggest that we shouldn’t use the right word, or seek to reclaim the right to “earned rage,” but I do want White people to recognize the work that our BIPOC colleagues do to engage in our common critical spaces, and the rhetorical tactics that are frequently used against them and are designed to elude the White gaze.    It means so much to the future of our field that Dr. Reese was selected to give the 2019 Arbuthnot Lecture, and that the video of this lecture was recorded and archived.   There is much to take away from this talk, and I encourage you to watch the whole thing…even if you already saw it live.   For my own work, the main takeaway was a line of inquiry that Dr. Reese posited about half way through, in regards to what makes an award-winning book.  It’s a segment that typifies what I would call Dr. Reese’s intrepid, persistent inquisitiveness.  She is talking about the fact that there “is no neutrality” in books centered in a nostalgia for colonized Native land (transcription, and errors, my own): “In fact, if you think about it, every children’s book that is set on this continent—that book is set on what used to be Native lands. If we could hold that fact front and center, every time we pick up a children’s book that is set on this continent, how might that change how we view children’s literature? How might that shape that literature as we move into the future? I don’t know—it’s hard to think about it…but I want to think about it.  I think we should think about it.”  These questions from her broke open a haze I have had in my mind in regards to struggling with nostalgia in literature.  I’m thinking about it. Dr. Reese got me thinking again, and I will be forever grateful to her for it, because I have some sense of what she’s staked to enter the conversation and move the narrative.  As have so many colleagues.  Thank you."},
{"title": "An Open Letter to Scales on Censorship and School Library Journal", "date": "Tuesday, April 2, 2019", "text": "Reproduced, with permission from School LibraryJournal © Copyright Library Journals, LLCa wholly owned subsidiary of MSI Information ServicesEach issue of School Library Journal contains a full-page segment entitled Scales on Censorship, where Pat Scales, former chair of the American Library Association’s Intellectual Freedom Committee, answers questions on censorship. Today Sam Bloom responds to one question from the March 2019 piece, which is pictured here but can also be found here or on page 28 of the print copy.Hello! I have read Scales on Censorship for quite a while, and like many others, I have trusted Pat Scales over the years to give well-reasoned responses to challenging questions.However, I was taken aback by one of the responses in the March issue (see photo). In it, Pat Scales answers a question on how to handle “books containing any amount of cultural misrepresentation”; namely, “Where do we librarians draw the line between sensitivity and censorship?”I agree that this is a tough question, one I grapple with on a daily basis. I also agree with Scales’s statement that it’s “our duty to purchase books that accurately portray the ethnicity of the main characters”; to that I’d add any number of intersecting identities (gender, sexuality, etc.). But I take issue with Scales’s qualifier that “to remove or refuse to purchase a book because someone sees a small inaccuracy is censorship.”First of all, let’s talk about the choices book buyers make when deciding how to use their budgets. In terms of deciding not to purchase a book based on cultural inaccuracies, well, I feel like we’ve had this talk before… many, many times before. Librarians make purchasing choices based on a book’s quality every day. Is it censorship to not purchase a book because it gets poor reviews? I’d say no–that’s simply an informed purchasing choice. And how could cultural inaccuracies *not* affect a book’s quality? (Also, if I may go back to Scales’s “small inaccuracy” comment? That inaccuracy may not seem so “small” to someone else. I also encourage Scales to examine the White privilege that allows her to minimize that which could cause pain to someone from a marginalized group by dubbing it “small”. Not to mention that Scales’s phrasing–“someone sees” an issue–subtly deemphasizes that problematic content in books really does exist, it’s not just people “seeing things.”)Now on to the issue of librarians who “remove” books with problematic content. I see this referenced a lot in articles from mainstream press, and as an argument it lacks nuance. I certainly cannot say for sure that no single librarian has pulled a book from the shelves because they found it problematic, but in my experience this isn’t a recurring issue sweeping through libraries nationwide. In my large library system, we have hundreds of copies of Little House on the Prairie and its sequels; we also still have 20 live copies of a book that a publisher actually pulled from publication three years ago! And if you walk into a children’s room anywhere in the country, I wager you will find at least one copy of Ghosts in the collection.Referring librarians to the WNDB resources page is a great call. I want to point out, however, that several of the sites listed by WNDB are curated by the very same “bloggers and library professionals” whose “strong opinions” regarding cultural representation in books leads them to “sometimes use their online space to aggressively influence book-purchasing decisions.” So I guess Scales recommends people read these bloggers *unless* they are critiquing a book, and as long as they conform to her idea of what meets the criteria for “non-aggressive”?  I don't think it's fair or constructive to those of us serving youth to reject the work of these individuals when they are critiquing representation while holding up their work when they are recommending books; both aspects of these bloggers’ work are critical to all of us serving children and teens. Scales’s whole framing of the power dynamics–bloggers are people who “aggressively influence” decision-makers by making problematic books their “target”–stems from a place of White privilege and fragility and fails to acknowledge that some books, and some content within books, in fact constitute acts of aggression against young readers.Furthermore, I am also concerned with the way Scales framed A Fine Dessert within her response. Yes, it received some “excellent reviews,” but as Lee & Low’s Diversity Baseline Survey has shown, the overwhelmingly White/female/cishet world of reviews shouldn’t always be taken at face value. Not to mention that in March 2015, before any internet activity had gained steam in relation to A Fine Dessert, John Lithgow wrote this in his New York Times review: “In a bold and somewhat unsettling choice, they portray a smiling slave woman and her daughter….” Critique of this book was not limited to social media; and the fact that some critique does originate online does not lessen its validity. It is far past time for us to acknowledge and embrace the fact that some of the critical perspectives on books are coming not from review journals but from professionals in our field writing on blogs and elsewhere on social media. Again, let’s recognize our privilege as White people in the profession when we start picking and choosing when and if we are willing to listen to critical voices on social media. I believe we can fold these critical perspectives into our consideration and understanding of specific titles.Here’s what Scales wrote next: “Instead of removing the title because bloggers thought a few pages were problematic, librarians should engage young readers in conversation about the controversy.” This remark feels flippant and dismissive of some scholarly and expert opinions, but I would also caution adults (especially White adults) that this is a conversation that would take a great deal of preparation and education for the adults in question. A poorly handled conversation with young children about slavery could very well reinforce stereotypes.Finally, regarding Vamos a Cuba, Scales wrote that “other Cuban Americans” disagreed with the Cuban American school board member who first recommended the book be pulled from the shelves. Scales then asked, “Whom do you believe?” A shared heritage for any of us does not mean identical experiences or perspectives and so the fact that there was and is disagreement is not and should never be surprising. But this makes it all the more critical to be as informed as possible when making selection decisions when it comes to accuracy and authenticity, and today we are fortunate to have informed critical perspectives from professional sources outside those we have traditionally relied on. “Whom do you believe” is a starting point, not the end point, and there isn't necessarily a “right” or “wrong” answer for any book, but there are “informed” and “uninformed” choices, and it is our responsibility to be as informed as possible in selecting materials according to our local policies and procedures.I don’t believe the two things in Scales’s last sentence should cancel each other out. I am working and listening and opening myself to ways of learning how to be culturally sensitive, *and* I am using my skills from library school (though not every librarian has been to library school, nor do I believe one has to go to library school to be an effective librarian) to understand the importance of reading reviews from journals such as School Library Journal *and* from blogs on our Kindred Spirits list. Which brings me to Scales’s closing thought, about the need to parse “which reviews and online tools to trust.” Questions about cultural authenticity and censorship do not exist in a vacuum, nor are they free of power imbalances and racist, oppressive legacies. I do not accept the binary thinking that says criticism = attack = censorship, and I encourage all White members of the children’s literature community–including myself, my fellow members of Reading While White, and Scales–to examine and question the White privilege we necessarily bring to these discussions. Until that happens, I no longer trust Pat Scales to give advice where censorship intersects with cultural representation.Sincerely,Sam Bloom"},
{"title": "Fighting For Justice: An Interview With the Authors", "date": "Wednesday, February 13, 2019", "text": "Today, in our third and final post in this series, we're so excited to welcome three authors: Stan Yogi of Fred Korematsu Speaks Up; Arisa White of Biddy Mason Speaks Up; and Laura Atkins, co-author and organizer of the Fighting For Justice series, which includes the aforementioned books.  Everyone, thank you so much for joining us.Allie:  Can you share your origin story? How did you get started in this work?Stan:  Thanks, Allie, for letting your readers know about the Fighting for Justice books.  I got involved with the series because of Malcolm Margolin, founding publisher of Heyday. In October 2009, Heyday released Wherever There’s a Fight: How Runaway Slaves, Suffragists, Immigrants, Strikers and Poets Shaped Civil Liberties in California, a book I co-wrote with my friend Elaine Elinson. Several months later, Malcolm asked if I’d be interested in writing a children’s version of Wherever There’s a Fight.  I thought that was a great idea, and I agreed. Our initial vision was to tell the stories of 10 Californians who fought for civil rights. That plan morphed into a series of books, each one focused on a different civil rights activist.Malcolm Margolin, Stan and the book Wherever There’s a Fight.Fred Korematsu’s biography launches the series in part because his story is a keystone to Wherever There’s a Fight. I also feel a personal connection to Fred because my parents, grandparents, uncles and aunts were incarcerated during World War II, just like Fred and his family, because of their ethnicity.  A picture we show in our presentations of Stan’s mother graduating from high school at Manzanar. Stan asks, “Why do you think my mother was sent to a prison camp when she was fifteen years old?”When I was an undergraduate at UCLA in the early 1980s, I heard Fred Korematsu speak.  He impressed me, not only because his story is so dramatic (defying the government’s orders to leave his home, getting arrested,  challenging in the Supreme Court the incarceration of Japanese Americans but losing his case, discovering decades later that the government had lied about the justifications for imprisoning Japanese Americans), but also because he was such a soft-spoken, humble man. He taught me that I can make a difference if I speak out against what I think is wrong and if I stand up for my beliefs.  Ever since then, Fred has been one of my heroes.An image of Fred Korematsu as an older man that we share during presentationsAround the same time that I first heard Fred Korematsu speak, I participated in the movement among Japanese Americans to seek an apology and monetary redress from the U.S. government for Japanese Americans who had been unjustly incarcerated during World War II. My work in the redress campaign nearly 40 years ago has resulted in a lifetime of activism, including working 14 years at the ACLU of Northern California, where I met my Wherever There’s a Fight co-author, Elaine.  Laura: Thanks so much for the invitation to share our stories and feature the series! As Stan and I share when doing school presentations with Fred Korematsu Speaks Up, I was raised in a family of activists. My dad was involved in the Freedom Rides, and both of my parents were part of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley in the 1960s. My mom was an early feminist and a member of a women’s activist singing group, and my stepmother volunteered with the farmworkers’ movement. So I was steeped in a tea of “speaking up” as a young person. That led me to become a young activist myself, starting in middle school — something I also speak to in our school presentations. I was arrested twice in high school as part of the anti-nuclear and anti-Apartheid movements. A slide from our presentation, showing Laura at an anti-nuclear group meeting in middle school, and getting arrested with a group of Berkeley High School students blockading at Lawrence Livermore Labs. Activism has been a core part of my identity for as long as I can remember. So getting to be part of helping to tell civil rights stories from our nation’s history, well, it’s a dream come true. And getting to do this by co-writing with different authors whose lived experience connects to the story being told, well, that’s even more of a dream come true. I’ve been a children’s book editor for around 25 years — as an assistant at Children’s Book Press and Orchard Books, and then an editor at Lee & Low Books — and more recently, offered freelance editorial services to people who are indie-publishing their own books. Working collaboratively fits me perfectly, as I’ve been working with folks on telling their own stories for a very long time. I believe that we are all part of an interconnected world and narrative, and that each of our well-being is based on collective well-being. I see this work as grassroots community-based storytelling, with a lot of voices influencing the telling.Arisa: The black lesbian mother warrior poet Audre Lorde was the first to articulate for me, in her Sister Outsider essays, that the “personal is political.” She is part of the lineage of my social justice work. As well as growing up Rastafarian, two to six years of age, oriented me toward a distrust of government, to be vigilant of white-supremacist conditioning, to question everything. Injustices were close to home. My mother and stepfather gathered friends for food and groundation—talks of politics in the US, Jamaica, and Guyana, back-home nostalgia, about the similarities and disappointments of anti-blackness across the globe. Over the years, I was involved with more “formal” public actions against anti-oppression, often finding a way to incorporate my poetry. Writing and reading poems in support of Mumia Abu-Jamal, safe spaces for women, for the end to the Kosovo War; working with a Zen Buddhist priest to bring poetry writing and meditation to incarcerated youth in Brooklyn, NY. When I went off to graduate school, where I began dating someone in the master’s program for social justice education, we started a series of monthly parties and conversational gatherings for queer people of color. LeftOut was a space for QPOC to form community while existing in predominantly white towns and colleges. With the same partner, I learned some of the language, theory, and pedagogy of anti-oppression work and began to apply that knowledge to my poetic practice, teaching, and self—thinking about the ways our socialization inhibits authentic self-actualization and promotes fear of other, and doing the personal-inner work needed for a radical love ethic necessary for individual and collective change. The ambitious root of each of my poems is this epic desire to repair. Allie: I’m noticing a connection between art and activism, both in your personal stories and in your work--Arisa, you talked about this specifically, in both how you fold your own poetry into your anti-oppression work, and in advocating for others to have access and resources to express themselves via art. Your books are about activists; and, they themselves are a form of activism, both in form and content.  How did you decide to tell these stories in verse, rather than a straightforward narrative? What was the poetry-writing process like when you were working collaboratively?Laura: I came on board initially to work with Stan as a developmental editor, and he had been approaching the book as a more traditional prose biography. I was then asked to pitch as co-author and I suggested the use of the poetic biography alongside what we call insets: sections with photos, drawings, timelines, definitions and questions for the readers. Once Heyday decided they wanted to go in that direction, I took the lead in writing the poems and Stan took the lead in writing and conceptualizing the insets. With the second book, Arisa, as a poet, took the lead on the poems and I swapped roles to leading on the insets. Though I’d say that Arisa and I did more co-writing on both sections, maybe because it was the second book and we had to go further in conceptualizing how to approach telling Biddy Mason’s story. And our editor, Molly Woodward, helped enormously with all of the writing and thinking for both books.First poem and first inset page from Biddy Mason Speaks UpWe had a few motivations for choosing free verse for the biography. We did a focus group with librarian Heidi Bartsch from the West Contra Costa County School District and several of her fourth grade students. She suggested that, while we were aiming at a fourth grade reading level, we write below that as many of her students read below grade level. We liked the  idea of using short lines with lots of space on the page so that struggling readers could more easily decode the book. We also were drawn to the idea of engaging students directly with these people’s stories, using a present tense poetic narrative. Starting the first book with Fred getting a haircut, which was a wonderful suggestion by author Betsy Partridge, meant that all readers could relate to Fred’s experience. Because we all get our hair cut. We’ve also had students share their own poetic approaches to telling stories, and it seems a form that young people can relate to and replicate naturally, in their own voices.First poem and first inset page from Fred Korematsu Speaks UpAllie: I’m struck by Stan’s description of Fred Korematsu as a soft-spoken, humble man. This flies in the face of the common image of changemakers as loud, oppositional combatants of the powers that be. What can we learn from him, about different “modes” of activism? What personal lessons have you all learned in researching and writing about the subjects of your books?Stan:  Fred Korematsu’s life as a civil rights activist taught me two key things.  First, people have different journeys to activism. Fred was initially motivated by love, not Constitutional principles when he defied the government’s orders that all Japanese Americans on the West Coast leave their homes to be imprisoned in camps.  He wanted to remain in Oakland with his girlfriend. But he also understood that the government was violating his rights. After his girlfriend ended their relationship, Fred soldiered on with his lawsuit because he firmly believed that the government was wrong.  In the early 2000s, Fred connected the racism Japanese Americans experienced during World War II with the hatred directed at  Muslims after 9/11. He submitted a “friend of the court” brief to the Supreme Court in solidarity with Muslim men whom the U.S. government had detained without charges or trials.  My initial activism centered on issues that directly impacted me as an Asian American and as a gay man.  But, like Fred Korematsu, I too saw parallels between my experiences and those of others who face discrimination. Recognizing those connections motivated my work with the ACLU in support of immigrants, women, youth, as well as people of color and LGBTQ individuals.I also learned from Fred Korematsu and Biddy Mason that there isn’t just one way to make a difference.  We can’t all deliver rousing speeches before thousands of people like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King or go on hunger strikes like Cesar Chavez.  But individuals can speak out for their beliefs in ways that are organic and meaningful for them. Fred Korematsu liked speaking to students and educating them about the World War II incarceration of Japanese Americans. In doing so, he encouraged them to stand up for justice.  Biddy Mason provided financial help to Los Angeles flood victims and others in need. When Laura and I present to students about Fred Korematsu, we tell them that if they like art, they can create drawings or paintings that depict unfair situations, like people did through artwork that we include in our book. Or if they like music, they can sing protest songs. Or if they like to write like Laura and me, they can compose stories about ways to fight against injustice. Speaking out in ways that fit our personalities and utilize our unique talents not only creates meaning for us but also enables us to sustain our activism over time.  Example of how we include art created by Japanese Americans in Fred Korematsu Speaks UpLaura: I love Stan’s answer and don’t have much to add. Just that I’m inspired as I research the lives of people who persevered even in the face of enormous obstacles — living as an enslaved woman, being unjustly imprisoned by the government. People like Biddy Mason and Fred Korematsu inspire me to keep on standing up and speaking out. I hope that we can change the world for my 11-year-old daughter, and all the young people in the next generation who deserve a world that accepts and embraces all of them, no matter their “race, creed or color” (as Fred Korematsu said in his speech in the courtroom when his criminal conviction was overturned). Arisa: Biddy Mason reminds me of the collective effort that goes into our liberation. You do what you can, where you can. She incited in me a curiosity about plants, their medicinal qualities, and my life became illuminated by the nature around me. There is spirit as there is air, and we must nurture our spirits because it’s a force that has effect. I understood more deeply the politics of care held between black women. Biddy Mason helped me see myself a little bit more wholly. She is a lesson in digging into the silences to find what was not told to us. Example of how we include plant remedies in Biddy Mason Speaks UpAllie: Who do you see engaging in the “politics of care” today? If you were to choose a contemporary activist to highlight in a Fighting For Justice book, who might you choose?Laura: It’s a good question, in part because we are developing the idea for the next Fighting for Justice book, and this may be someone (or more than one person) living today who is an indigenous Californian. This is still very much in early development, so nothing set. I’m especially inspired now by young people who are speaking up: Emma González and all of the young people creating a powerful and inclusive movement to speak out about gun control. Also Greta Thunberg who is taking direct action on climate change, and getting the whole world to pay attention. I’m honored to be working with Regina Evans to develop school presentations on Biddy Mason (Colby College hired Arisa to teach poetry, so she is now based in Maine and will Skype in to visits when she can). Thanks to Arisa’s connection with Regina and her work, we featured her story at the end of Biddy Mason Speaks Up, showing how Regina is a survivor of trafficking herself, and that she has become a modern-day abolitionist using creativity, theater, entrepreneurship, philanthropy and love to support current young people who are survivors of trafficking. She could have a whole book about her and the amazing work that she does to support her community. Feature on Regina Evans at the end of Biddy Mason Speaks Up. You can see a video of the powerful talk she gave at the launch event here.Stan: Thanks, Arisa, for bringing up the politics of care framework. In difficult times like now when so many communities are under attack, it’s important to remember the politics of care—for ourselves and for others. Like Laura, I think there are many inspiring contemporary activists who are speaking out on specific challenges, as well as leaders like Rev. William Barber, who are making connections among different communities and issues. I’m especially impressed by Marielena Hincapié, the Executive Director of the National Immigration Law Center, an organization defending the rights of low-income immigrants. Marielena immigrated as a child from Colombia to Rhode Island. She’s not only generated positive societal changes through her work as a lawyer, advocate, and educator on behalf of immigrants. But she’s also an amazingly kind person who cares deeply about the negative impacts of xenophobic policies on individuals, families and communities. Marielena Hincapié, executive director of National Immigration Law Center speaking outside the Supreme Court after oral arguments on Trump's latest Muslim Ban, photo by Lorie ShaullArisa: There are so many people that it’s hard to pinpoint one person. Who immediately comes to heart is Rev Angel Kyodo Williams, writer, activist, and ordained Zen priest for the spiritually-engaged transformative work she’s doing, reminding us all of the importance of personal accountability for collective change. Choreographer and dancer Amara Tabor Smith, who uses her art to bring healing attention to the mental health of and violence faced by African American women. Scholar, educator, writer and doula, Dr. Alexis Pauline Gumbs is active in illuminating the scholarship and cultural productions of queer black feminists with her academic and community teachings, intergenerational archival projects, and experimental creative writings that embody the intersectionality of queer black women. Rev Angel Kyodo WilliamsAllie: What advice do you have for the generation that’s reading your books and wondering how they, too, can become changemakers?Stan: I echo the advice Fred Korematsu shared when he talked with students: Don’t be afraid to speak out for what you think is right. I add to that: Don’t be discouraged if the changes you seek don’t occur immediately. Big societal shifts take time and the efforts of many people. Change is oftentimes incremental. There may be one step backward before two steps forward. As civil rights activist sang in the 1950s and 1960s, “Keep your eyes on the prize” of your ultimate goal and don’t be disheartened (at least for too long) by setbacks.Arisa: Let your desire to make change be connected to your heart.Laura: Nourish yourself along the way — find the things that feed your soul. I love being in community, so am happiest when working with others with shared values towards change, while also enjoying each others’ company and learning from one another. And remember, we are stronger together (as rad children’s book creator Maya Gonzalez says and expresses beautifully through her art). We can lift each other up. I love sharing information about important children’s books that don’t always get attention in the mainstream publishing world (you can see a bunch of awesome social justice and mostly #ownvoices Bay Area creators at this website). Let’s amplify the good work and support each other along the way. The powerful art of Maya Gonzalez graces the Activist Children’s Book Creators and Activist Books Facebook page.Allie: Thank you all so much for sharing your time, wisdom, and expertise. I and so many others will continue to learn about courage, activism, and speaking up from your answers and your books. I can’t recommend the Fighting For Justice series highly enough; these books should be in every Middle Grade collection and classroom.Illustrator Yutaka Houlette, Laura, editor Molly Woodward, and Stan at the Fred Korematsu Speaks Up launch event.

{"title": "Stepping Up", "date": "Monday, February 11, 2019", "text": "If you haven’t read this account of what happened at Midwinter by April Hathcock, pleasedo, because it’s important. It’s important because it lays bare how, for allthe talk of equity, diversity, and inclusion in our field, we have a long, longway to go.It’s important because it lays bare the work weWhite people have to do in learning how to be allies.And it lays bare how, once again, a person whoexperiences racist trauma, while still traumatized, ALSO has to do the work ofeducating us—of telling us what should have been done, and what needs to bedone.For me, personally, it has also laid bare a gap.While I wasn’t at Midwinter, since reading this I have been asking myself: If Ihad been in that Forum session, would I have been shocked into silence by theattack, or worried about making waves in the moment (so damnably ingrained), orwould I have spoken up? If I had spoken, up, would I have known how to do it ina way that didn’t make things worse for the person being attacked?A few years ago, there was an ongoing chaotic situationin my neighborhood. There was an afternoon when I was home and heard a womanoutside yell “Don’t touch me!” I didn’t think, I didn’t hesitate, I just acted:storming out of the house with words booming out of my mouth,uncharacteristically bold and loud: “Take your hands off her!” The man backedaway.My response in that moment to a woman in dangerwas instinctive. My response to racist attack in the moment, whether in aprofessional setting or on the street, has got to become just as instinctive.And bold. And uncompromising.But it also also needs to be informed, with theintegrity and needs and safety of the person being attacked at the forefront ofmy thinking. So I’m committing myself to better understandingexactly what it takes to do that, in the moment and long term. As an individualmoving through the world, and as a member of the American Library Association,I ask: How can I embody in action the ideals I claim in words, and how should Idemand ALA do the same? At the end of her post, April Hathcock laid outdefinitive steps she wanted to see the organization take, starting with anapology, but moving on to meaningful actions to educate members.  Here is the response of ALA’s Executive Boardto-date:To which I say: This statement of partialownership is a start. Yes, the Executive Board apologized. There’s aproblem, though, in citing past work the ALA has done toward diversity andinclusion, as it does in the final paragraphs, with the “it takes time” caveat.We all know it takes time, none more so than those who have been biding theirtime even as they work for change. There’s a problem in particular when “ittakes time” comes after a statement acknowledging that the organization fellshort in enforcing its own code of conduct. There’s a problem, too, when “it takes time”comes after stating, “The ALA attorney and President-Elect met with April Hathcockin the Council meeting room shortly before Council III to share some nonpublicinformation about events after the incident in question. ALA leaders deeplyregrets any distress this caused; itwas not intent of the attorney or ALA to threaten Ms. Hathcock in any way.” Notintending to cause harm and not causing harm are two very different things. Notintending to cause harm starts with considering the potential harm of anyaction you are considering and making choices that do no harm. In this case, afterthe fact, it requires acknowledgment of why the action taken felt threatening.REFORMA released a statement in responseto what happened at Midwinter, and it underscores the fact that racism is not anew thing at ALA conferences, and that the systemic racism that permeates ourculture also permeates our profession and professional organization. ALA is a member organization. Obviously,individual members are not all in synch regarding their beliefs and values, butthis hasn’t stopped ALA from a statedcommitment to diversity and inclusion, and to committing toapplying a social justice framework to its strategicdirections work. That’s something as amember I’d like to take pride in; I do take pride in it, up to a point. But Iwant my professional organization to dig deeper and work harder to make itsstated ideals a reality. That means not only owning completely when a mistakehas been made, but also calling on all of us who are members--not justBIPOC--to be part of the work. And I need to demand the same thing of myselfthat I’m demanding of ALA, because challenging racism is not the soleresponsibility of BIPOC. It’s the responsibility of White people, too."},
{"title": "Fighting For Justice: Biddy Mason Speaks Up", "date": "Wednesday, February 6, 2019", "text": "Today we welcome Guest Blogger Sarah Jo Zaharako in our second of three posts spotlighting the “Fighting for Justice” series from Heyday Books. The first post was a review of Fred Korematsu Speaks Up.  Fighting for Justice: Biddy Mason Speak UpBy Arisa White and Laura AtkinsIllustrated by Laura FreemanISBN: 9781597144032Click here to purchase.In 1866, Biddy Mason bought a parcel of land on the outskirts of Los Angeles. The purchase provided a legacy for her family and helped Mason become one of the wealthiest people in Los Angeles. She was 48 years old, a midwife and herbalist; a single mother; a formerly enslaved person and a survivor of rape. Mason helped shape the Black community in Los Angeles through philanthropy and community organization. Her story, like so many millions of untold stories, fills a gaping hole in how the American historical narrative is transmitted to young people. Through a smorgasbord of documentation, White and Atkins demonstrate the depth of evidence needed to fully understand the impact of slavery and racism both in a historical context and in modern day society. Painful and violent concepts like enslavement, profiteering, and rape are respectfully approached with age-appropriate clarity, which will prompt meaningful discussion. Chapter three provides an honest look at slavery and genealogy, a topic integral to Mason’s story. The inset explains that slavery was matrilineal, meaning that if a mother was enslaved, her child was enslaved. “Enslaved women could sometimes partner and have children with enslaved men. Masters could also rape enslaved women. Enslaved people did not have a choice about how their bodies were used, since they were seen as property” (p. 21). A supplemental text box defines rape as “When one person forces a sexual act on another person who does not want it or who is unable to give consent” (p. 21). Direct explanations like these encourage questions and link the atrocities of the past with current campaigns for equality and justice. The Fighting for Justice books explain to children why things aren’t fair. They also uplift and empower, proving through their protagonists that ordinary people can speak up. Among many defining attributes, the Fighting for Justice series (Fred Korematsu Speaks Up, 2017) forges a connection between history and present day society. Biddy Mason Speaks Up invites readers to confront White supremacy, and to explore equality and injustice together in a meaningful way. A supplemental section titled “Healing Your Community: From Biddy’s Day to Ours” explores modern day activists and organizations including Black Lives Matter. Here, an inset introduces the work of modern-day abolitionist Regina Evans and describes the prevalent but not widely recognized practice of human trafficking. This reference demolishes the idea that slavery is neatly contained in a single ugly chapter of American history. Throughout the book, readers are encouraged to apply the concepts in each chapter to their own experience through thoughtful prompts like, “What are the barriers that keep you from speaking up?” Such questions promote reflection, a critical practice for mindful readers and thinkers.  When learning is personal, so is it memorable.The focus on Biddy Mason as the protagonist further sets the book apart from the myriad historical texts for middle-grade readers. Publishers have traditionally delegated the portrayal of slavery in America to a relatively small cast of historical figures like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass. In doing so, slavery’s repercussions are given limited scope in the literary world. Mason’s story suggests that she is but one of millions whose experience has been omitted, if not erased, from the American narrative. I found myself asking the question, “Why have I not heard this story?” and contemplating how many more stories I have been denied by a traditional American education.Biddy Mason Speaks Up invites young readers to join a conversation, to reflect, and to make connections. It is powerful in its intimacy and memorable for its honesty. Most of all, the book empowers. The Fighting for Justice series lays a foundation of knowledge and provides the questions that will fuel the change makers of tomorrow. Biddy Mason is intriguing, direct, and impossible to put down.Guest Reviewer Sarah Jo Zaharako works with children in public and school libraries in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Click here to learn more about the publisher and its upcoming releases. Fighting for Justice: Fred Korematsu Speaks UpBy Laura Atkins and Stan YogiIllustrated by Yutaka HouletteISBN: 9781597143684Click here to purchase. “Have you ever spoken up when you saw something that wasn’t right?” This is the first sentence readers encounter in Fighting for Justice: Fred Korematsu Speaks Up. The pages that follow illustrate Korematsu’s life and legacy in a unique and engaging blend of narrative nonfiction and informational, textbook-like pages.Cover of Fred Korematsu Speaks Up.Fred Korematsu was born in 1919 and raised in Oakland, CA. He endured racism and discrimination as a Japanese American and at the same time felt less connected to Japan and Japanese culture than his Issei (first generation) parents. He fell in love with a White woman, and planned for a future with her; but, all hopes and plans were derailed in 1942 when U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Japanese Americans and Japanese immigrants were forced into concentration camps. Korematsu knew that internment was not right and defied the order.He used a fake identity to avoid relocation, but was caught and arrested in May of 1942. At that time, the White woman he loved deserted him. A lawyer with the ACLU approached Korematsu and together they challenged the case and the unconstitutional imprisonment of Japanese Americans. After making bail, Korematsu was taken to Tanforan, and later Topaz, where many of his fellow imprisoned Japanese and Japanese Americans did not support him (some feared the legal fight was causing the community even more trouble). As Korematsu faced hardship, heartbreak, and isolation, his case moved from “one court to the next” until 1944, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the government, saying that internment was legal due to “military necessity.” Korematsu lost.Over time, the war ended and Korematsu moved to Michigan, fell in love, and started a family. It wasn’t until 1982, almost 40 years after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, that the case was reopened after a group of lawyers found proof that the U.S. government lied about the threat posed by Japanese Americans during World War II. This time, Korematsu won the case. Several years later, the U.S. government apologized and committed to paying reparations to survivors of internment, and in 1998, Korematsu was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. For the the rest of his life, Korematsu traveled and spoke about his experiences, encouraging people to speak up and fight injustice wherever and whenever they see it. In the book, visceral details about Korematsu’s life are shared through poems, which are separated into chapters and offer readers the opportunity to consider the events from his perspective. Co-authors Atkins and Yogi employ a direct, intentional voice. For example, the text in one poem reads:What the government calls“Assembly Centers.”Really Prisons.This makes clear the gap between what the U.S. government messaging was and the reality of what was happening. Illustrations, rendered digitally by Yutaka Houlette, start each chapter off by showcasing important moments in Korematsu’s life on each spread’s verso page. In between the chapters are nonfiction pages. A series of definitions, timelines, photographs, poems, artworks, and other primary documents give these pages a museum exhibit-like feel, and interactive questions push readers to recognize and consider what they are thinking and feeling as they read and reflect.Hefty back matter includes a note from Karen Korematsu about her father and information about the Korematsu Institute, including a link to where readers can order a free teaching kit. Materials for young activists are also included: resources for further information, ideas about working together, and tools to take action towards equity.  There are many names (educators, librarians, writers, and more) listed in the acknowledgements, showing that this project was a collaborative one. This book shines in its accessibility and how it bridges the gap between then and now, inviting reflection on the past and motivating change in the present day. It is honest and unique in its balancing of straight-up facts and personal, emotive story (as reflected through the narrative poetry). Today is January 30. It is Fred Korematsu’s birthday and it is also Fred Korematsu Day of Civil Liberties and the Constitution. This book celebrates Korematsu and inspires readers to reflect on what they know and what they can do--and will do--to fight unfairness and to create positive change. Fighting for Justice: Fred Korematsu Speaks Up is highly recommended. -Elisa Gall"},
{"title": "We Are This. We Are More Than This.", "date": "Thursday, January 24, 2019", "text": "The footage that has gone viralover the past week of a group of White high school students and theirinteractions with a Native elder and other Native people at the IndigenousPeople’s March has me thinking about children’s books. Among many other things.As more time passes and people continue to examine and reflect on whathappened, the larger context in which that scene unfolded—the context of ourcountry today, the history we share, and the experiences that we may or may nothave in common based on whether our appearance brings us privilege—can’t beignored. Whatever you see in thatfootage—the shorter version originally released, the longer version—it’s anunsettling scene, one that has elicited many responses online.  We have those in our field, too: Unsettling scenes. Many responses. And theresponses are sometimes as upsetting—and revealing—as the original concernabout racism.I’m also thinking about Nina’s post last week about shame, and the difference between fleeting/embarrassmentshame, and toxic/damaging shame. I’ve been thinking about howfleeting/embarrassment shame can lead to toxic defensiveness.And I’m thinking about the factthat when something horribly racist happens, whether it’s outside the world ofchildren’s and young adult literature, or within it (and we do have ourequivalents), at some point someone always says: “We are more than this. We arebetter than this.” I know I’ve said it, too.But, we also ARE this. And by“we” I mean we as a country, and we in the world of children’s and young adultliterature, and most especially and particularly we well-meaning White peoplewho turn our attention to the good, and the better, because it’s so damn hardto dwell on the worst. That’s privilege right there. And maybe, if we couldagree to acknowledge that privilege, it would be a starting point: A small piece of common ground onwhich we could all stand as we try to address that reality and do the hard workof being better.Because while we are more thanthis: as a country, as a community (whatever that community is), as the fieldof children’s and young adult literature, we cannot let that essential belief,that essential truth, blind us to the reality of toxic racism and privilegethat also exist, and the very real damage they cause.  We cannot ignore that racist depictions of Native people in children’sliterature are both a product of, and perpetuate, the scene that unfolded lastweek in which a crowd of (mostly) White boys didn’t hesitate to do a mock“tomahawk” chop.  We cannot ignore thatracist depictions in children’s books feed a culture in which Blackface is stillacceptable to some, and are part of our lager society in which Black- andbrown-skinned youth and adults are dehumanized every day in myriad ways, frommicro-agressions to violence at the hands of law enforcement.We want and need to feel hopeful.We want to be hopeful. In the work we do, in the country we live in. And thereare many reasons to be: the long history of work of BIPOC to fight againstsystemic racism, to educate allies as well as those less willing to listen. Thelong history of activism within and beyond our field. And so many good hearts.But good hearts and goodintentions without hard, sometimes painful work are just a feel-good startingpoint. Good hearts and good intentionscan still lead to children’s and young adult books with stereotypes, withwhitewashing, with jaw-droppingly insensitive images and scenes.And when they’re called out, lookout. Shame—that fleeting/embarrassment kind—may lead to knee-jerk, angryreactions. The anger may also come from genuine disagreement, or a misplacedsense of entitlement, or even hatred, pure and simple. Regardless, the resultis an inability—or refusal—to try to understand the perspective of a critic whoselived experience can speak with authority to the damage and the pain. This failure in a field where imagination is currency never fails to astonishme. And maybe it brings us back to shame again. It doesn’t feel good to hurtsomeone. Anger is sometimes a reaction to the tension of owning/not wanting toown that pain.And we are so beyond the point ofneeding to get over that. Instead of lashing out, we need to be quiet andlisten; we need to hear what others have to say and we need to listen to ourown thoughts, especially when they’re troubling us. It’s hard. It’suncomfortable. It’s essential. We who are in positions ofprivilege we may not have asked for, but cannot deny exist—that is to say,we White people—have to listen more than we speak; we have to be willing toengage in difficult conversations and self-reflection, not defensivepositioning. Not if we expect to be believed when we say we are more than this.Not if we expect to be believed when we say that we know that privilege needsto be dismantled.I want those kids in that videoto learn, and to understand. Because regardless of who started what and when,what that scene reveals is that privilege and entitlement are weapons theywield. I don’t know if they understand or care that they’re weapons that causedamage, but we all need them to understand it.I hold the same hopes for thefield of children’s and young adult literature: I want us to learn andunderstand, too. There is amazing work being done in our field. Amazing books.Amazing criticism. And we need both. Because we are every great book by BIPOCand every great effort to publish and promote those books, and so many otherwonderful books by authors and illustrators from every background, and we arealso every painful, damaging stereotype and hurtful image, in our past and inour present.Have you read Debbie Reese's American Indians in Children's Literature (AICL)?(Debbie also provides a great list of other Native activiststo follow on Twitter, to support our listening and learning about concerns both within andbeyond our field.)Do you know about Indigo'sBookshelf--Native, Latinx, queer, and disabled young adults writing withknowledge and passion about books they read?Do you visit the sites of the\"Kindred Spirits\" we list here on our blog?Let's commit—or recommit—to reading, and listening, and learning from thevoices of those whose lived experiences can educate those of us trying to workwith good hearts and good intentions. Yes, we are this. And yes, we are more than this."},
{"title": "What About Shame?", "date": "Thursday, January 17, 2019", "text": "This is a post in Reading While White’s end-of-year retrospective series.This year, I’ve heard a lot of mulling over how to handle “problematic classics” when reading them with children, or using an equity or de-colonizing lens while weeding library collections.   This is hardly a new topic; but this year I heard a new question:“What about the the parent who wants to read one of these classics with their child; what about their shame?” I heard this question twice, on different occasions, enough to pique my interest, because I hadn’t heard it before. The context and phrasing was slightly different each time, but the use of the word “shame,” and the centering of this particular type of shame, was the same.   In one case we were discussing a small library’s obligation to stock classics; in the other, the appropriateness of offering alternative reads in response to a requested classic.   And the gist was a librarians’ discomfort at making a White parent feel discomfort by drawing attention to the racism in a classic children’s book. So what about shame?  It’s critical to take a moment to understand that there are different kinds of shame.  A layperson’s tour reminds us that while painful, much shame is fleeting: an embarrassment at seeing one’s self differently, exposed, in front of others. This kind of shame can be instructive if the owner is open to it, or it can be dismissed. Shame can also be toxic, when it is chronically experienced through childhood, leading to damaging feelings of inferiority. Self-esteem and resilience are crucial coping mechanisms for shame.A clear provocation for children’s shame are dehumanizing stereotypes, including those we find in children’s books.  We know that no book is perfect, and that time shapes our understandings of our own humanity.  So why should we expect classic children’s books not to be complicated, or difficult?  Yes, they are books with widely recognized merit or popularity; but we know we are likely to find racism in older children’s books, so we should expect to find them in our “beloved” classics, and expect that for some readers this will be unacceptable.  Not to do so is to imply that some people’s shame is acceptable shame. This is what we do when we excuse a book as being “a product of its time,” or insist that we can separate out the “bad parts” and enjoy the rest without perpetuating racism.  Racial slurs and stereotypes in classics that are not recognized or called out become dismissable, and therefore the shame that many readers take from them, acceptable. This is what I find so intriguing about the question “What about their shame?”  That question suggests that we should accept the shame that we know many BIPOC children experience when reading racist classics, because the shame of the parent embarrassed at having the racism called out is unacceptable.   There is a false equivalency at holding these two very different types of shame in comparison to each other, and also a fallacy that they are somehow in competition. So, since we seem to have a hard time with it, what about the shame of a parent who can’t find a beloved-yet-racist classic at their small library branch?  I certainly hope that the library would obtain it for them, if, at the end of the day, it is indeed what they want. But librarians know never to take a request at face value. There’s always more under the first question, right? Why do most parents or caregivers ask for a classic?  It is most likely that 1) they remember reading it, fondly; or, 2) it showed up on a recommended list.   Underneath either of those motivations is a desire for the caregiver to do the best for their child, either by creating for them an experience as powerful and positive as they themselves remember, or by following up on the advice of an expert. Those are important, relevant, and valuable motivations.  And either of them can be addressed with a variety of recommended books, including the one they first asked for. By listening to the caregiver, we can help them unpack what they are looking for, and supply them with ample and informed possibilities, so that they can make an informed selection for their child.  In fact, being informed is one critical element for managing potential shame, for either child or caregiver.  It this is indeed our concern--people’s shame, and building resilience to it (for everyone will experience it, and might as well in their public library as anywhere else)--then we need to focus on building broad, diverse, and evolving library collections and reading recommendations that provide for all children to develop self-esteem, rather than focussing on accepting one person’s shame over another’s."},
{"title": "What To Look For In Data About Diversity In Publishing?", "date": "Tuesday, January 15, 2019", "text": "Today, Reading While White is pleased to welcome guest blogger Amy Koester for a discussion of the 2017 CCBC statistics. This post is part of our end-of-year retrospective series.The beginning of a new calendar year is rife with end-of-year summaries, top ten lists, and other pieces meant to help us put the work and output of the previous year into context. This holds true for diversity in publishing, too, with the anticipated release of CCBC data on children’s books written by and about BIPOC in 2018. As we prepare to consider these newest statistics, we can take some time to consider changes we’ve seen over the course of previous years’ CCBC numbers as well some other pieces of data that can help us to see whether the publishing ecosystem is diversifying.What do the CCBC stats tell us?Before anything else, it’s important to recognize that the CCBC does not receive every single book published for children in a given year--so the stats they share represent data about a significant sampling of children’s books, not the full roster of what's published. People looking at this data should keep this in mind throughout any perusal and analysis of the data. One must understand what sampling the data sets represent in order to truly learn anything from them. (For some additional context, the CCBC gives this further clarification about what materials they receive and are counted in their data: most of the trade books published in the United States, some series and formula non-fiction books, and some books from Canadian publishers who distribute in the U.S.) That said, the CCBC data is the most comprehensive data set available about books published for children in a given year, and so this data is our closest proxy to all of publishing for children.When I’m looking at CCBC stats, I usually use 2015 as my starting place--that’s the first full year for which We Need Diverse Books was in existence, and it’s also the year we got the first set of data about diversity in the publishing field (more on that below). If 2015 could be considered a year in which diversity across the children’s publishing ecosystem became a high profile priority, how do current practices compare? Until the 2018 CCBC data is available, we’ve got the 2017 numbers for comparison.Books Created by BIPOCComparing BIPOC-created books in 2015 and 2017, we see (in order of greatest to least gross increase in titles):There were 98 more Asian American-created books in 2017 than in 2015; Asian American-created books for youth increased 56% from 2015 to 2017, from 176 titles to 274There were 56 more Latinx-created books in 2017 than in 2015; Latinx-created books for youth increased 93% from 2015 to 2017, from 60 titles to 116 titlesThere were 19 more First Nations-created books in 2017 than in 2015; First Nations-created books for youth increased 100% from 2015 to 2017, from 19 titles to 38There were 14 more Black-created books in 2017 than in 2015; Black-created books for youth increased 13% from 2015 to 2017, from 108 titles to 122Across all BIPOC-created books, this is a net increase of 52%, or 187 more titles in 2017 than were created in 2015.What questions do these data about BIPOC-created books raise? Questions for further consideration and research include:How many individual BIPOC authors and illustrators are there in a year of publishing? That is to say, how many BIPOC authors are given opportunity to publish, and similarly how many BIPOC illustrators? How many of the books by Black creators in any given recent year are by Jason Reynolds, for example? If a small handful of BIPOC creators publish multiple books, that implies that the overall number of BIPOC creators is not as large as even these relatively dismal data suggest. (And the goal is not to simply increase the number of creators at the expense of individuals creating multiple books; rather, we should look beyond the idea of more books by BIPOC and think more of supporting more careers for BIPOC creators.)What would an ideal distribution of BIPOC creators even look like? What should be our metrics for achieving greater equity in creation of books for youth? Despite the fact that there was a 100% increase in titles by First Nations creators between 2015 and 2017, there were still only 38 such titles counted in 2017--which amounts to a measly 1% of all counted books created in that year. Data can look impressive--the number of First Nations creators doubled, after all!--while still identifying systemic issues.Books About BIPOCComparing books about BIPOC characters and experiences in 2015 and 2017, we see (in order of greatest to least comparative disparity to U.S. population):Books about Latinx characters and experiences increased 154%, from 85 to 216 titles, from 2015 to 2017, and represented 5.84% of books for youth in 2017 (This is compared to 17.6% of the American population being Hispanic, according to 2017 data)Books about Black characters and experiences increased 26% from 2015 to 2017, from 270 to 340 titles, and represented 9.19% of books for youth in 2017 (This is compared to 13.9% of the American population being Black or African American, according to 2017 data)Books about First Nations characters and experiences increased 71% from 2015 to 2017, from 42 to 72 titles, and represented 1.95% of books for youth in 2017 (This is compared to 2.1% of the American population being American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander, according to 2017 data)Books about Asian-American characters and experiences increased 174% from 2015 to 2017, from 113 to 310 titles, and represented 8.38% of books for youth in 2017 (This is compared to 6.3% of the American population being Asian, according to 2017 data)In total, 25% of all books published for children and counted by the CCBC in 2017 were about BIPOC characters or experiences; this is compared to 15% of all titles in 2015. Across all books about BIPOC characters in experiences, this is a net increase of 84%, or 428 more titles in 2017 than were published in 2015.It’s imperative to remember two other things in considering these CCBC data:Comparing representation of BIPOC in children’s books to representation across United States population demographics does not imply that if and when literary representation meets population demographics, diversity will be “achieved”--rather, considering the abysmally underrepresented status of Latinx, First Nations, and Black people in children’s books now, the population benchmarks provide a framework for measuring progress, not for determining success.These CCBC data tell us only the number of books by and about BIPOC in a given year--they do not speak to the accuracy or integrity of the books and the stories they tell. Dr. Debbie Reese makes this point in her expansion of Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop’s metaphor of books as windows, mirrors, and sliding glass doors: that many of these mirrors may distort the appearance of BIPOC like “fun house mirrors.” We do well to keep in mind that numerical increases in representation among creators and story characters is not necessarily reflective of better representation.What questions do these data about books about BIPOC raise? These questions are areas in need of further consideration and exploration:What are we to make of the reality that while both the number of books by BIPOC and the number of books about BIPOC have increased, the number of books about has grown more significantly? This is to say, what are we to make of the reality that, in all likelihood, a significant proportion of these new books about BIPOC are by White creators who inherently do not have an #ownvoices perspective of the content about which they write? What does it say about the publishing ecosystem that this “diversity trend” seems to prioritize stories about BIPOC, for which there is ever-increasing demand, without necessarily proportionately fostering support and empowerment of BIPOC creators?What does it mean that books about Asian characters and experiences are the only demographic group besides White to have a higher percentage of stories about their experiences than their percentage of the national population? To what degree do stereotypes come into play here, in particular the myth of the “model minority”? Given the trends evident in the CCBC data, it’s worth revisiting this 2015 roundtable conversation that was hosted by Zetta Elliott and featured Sarah Park Dahlen, Shveta Thakrar, Mike Jung, Katie Yamasaki, and Sona Charaipotra.Conversely, what does it mean that the proportion of books about Latinx characters and experiences is particularly mismatched with population data? To what extent do stereotypes and White supremacy factor into the landscape that has resulted in this discrepancy?If we were to break down the about data even further, what would we find in terms of the types of stories being published about BIPOC? For example, what proportion of books about Black characters and experiences are stories of slavery or the civic rights era versus contemporary stories that normalize, not historicize, Black experiences? Similarly, what proportion of books about First Nations characters and experiences take place in modern settings as opposed to historical accounts of First Nations peoples? (To be sure, there’s nothing inherently wrong with historical stories about BIPOC; it is problematic, however, when the majority of stories portray BIPOC as groups relevant only at particular moments in history and/or without presence in today’s increasingly diverse reality.)Considering diversity in the publishing industryThe number of books published by and about BIPOC is only a piece of the larger children’s publishing ecosystem--to truly transform publishing and ensure that great books by and about BIPOC can get into libraries and the hands of kids, representation among publishing professionals is important to consider, too. In 2015, Lee & Low conducted a Diversity Baseline study to capture demographic data about those employed in the publishing industry at that time. It’s interesting data to look at, and it’ll be the basis for comparison when, later this year, they’ll issue the second survey to capture what the industry looks like four years later. Until we have that comparison data, we’re left with more anecdotal and subjective descriptors of the publishing industry. One such example is this recent article from Publishers Weekly that compiles the stories of how various publishing industry folks got into children’s books--and the folks sharing their stories are overwhelmingly White. Regardless of whether the forthcoming Lee & Low data indicate a publishing landscape dominated by White professionals, articles like this serve to reinforce a narrative of publishing as a White field. That impacts how we think about the larger publishing ecosystem as it relates to diverse books for children.Thinking about publishing as an ecosystem also calls into question the role of librarians and those involved in youth librarianship. What does it say about youth librarianship when we look for changes in publishing--we want to see more and learn more about diversity in children’s literature--but do not necessarily look for changes in our own practice and how we contribute to this landscape? What can and should we, as library practitioners, be doing to demand and support more systemic change?As we head into a new year of publishing, the ALA Midwinter Meeting and all the publishing promotion that happens there, and the anticipation of the second round of data on diversity in publishing from Lee & Low, we should all be intentional about considering the different data we’re seeing and what stories they can tell about whether and how we’re moving the needle toward a more diverse ecosystem of publishing books for young people.-Amy Koester works at Skokie Public Library as the manager of the Learning Experiences Department.

{"title": "The Benefits & Limits of Diversity Audits", "date": "Monday, January 7, 2019", "text": "This is a post in Reading While White’s end-of-year retrospective series.Diversity audits! They’re an analytical look at a library collection through a diversity lens: tracking minority representations vs. majority. This can cover a variety of identity markers, but generally what is talked about most is numbers of BIPOC and White creators/ characters. These audits aren’t totally a new thing, but they’ve gained traction over the last year with Karen Jensen’s posts giving guidelines on how-to (also see her more recent post) and Library Journal’s online course “Equity in Action: Taking Your Diversity and Inclusion Initiatives to the Next Level” delving into the subject. I myself have started doing diversity audits, and it’s something my library is pushing for us to continue. Are diversity audits a step in the right direction of more inclusion and equity within our collections and services? Are they a performative trend with no real impact? Maybe a bit of both? But let’s back up a minute... who am I?Hi! I’m Jenna, the newest contributor to RWW. I live in Chicago and work as a Collection Management Librarian focusing on children’s and teen materials at the Oak Park Public Library. I’m also a yoga instructor and foster kitten caretaker. Like the rest of the RWW team, I am White and working on learning what that means every day. My hope is that my blog posts will encourage you to continue learning along with me (maybe that’s schmaltzy, but it’s true). So let’s get started, shall we? Back to the books!This blog post will not be a how-to guide for diversity audits or an analysis of the audits I did. Rather, I’d like to spend some time ruminating on the bigger picture of diversity audits. What exactly is their purpose, and what is their potential for impact?I began doing diversity audits of my library’s collections at the request of our management team. They heard about other libraries doing it, and it aligns with our aspirations of diversity, inclusion, and equity. The intentions of diversity audits are good. They are following the same idea as CCBC’s Statistics and Lee and Low’s Baseline Survey. By finding a baseline, we have a better idea of where and how to grow. However, good intentions aren’t enough if there isn’t meaningful action and next steps to go along with it.It bears repeating that diversity is not “a trend.” These posts from Jennifer Baker and Ellen Oh are always worth revisiting. If diversity audits are done as a one-off, primarily just so a library or library worker can say they did it, that moves into performative territory. Especially for a White librarian like myself, it’s so important to question why we do things, particularly when in relation to racial diversity. Are we doing these diversity audits because it’s the hot thing to do right now or because we actually care deeply about how we can better our collections? And if the latter, we have to acknowledge the pitfalls of diversity audits and what else needs to be done.Diversity audits don’t represent quality, accuracy, or intersectionality. Just as books about White kids range from high literary fiction to entertaining drivel, so to should books by and about BIPOC. That said, our collections are really only being truly inclusive if the representations shared are accurate. While not every book needs to be or should be heavily themed around the race of the character, for example, depictions should ring true. And any cultural practices that are discussed need to be correct. A diversity audit might tell us that our collection has a good sized number of books with Black characters, but what if they are all historical fiction with male leads and assumed Christianity? Intersectionality is so important so we can provide books about BIPOC kids in various genres with a wide range of themes.Another downfall is that even from the onset, we’re approaching diversity audits from a White-normative standpoint, often looking at the data as White vs. all of BIPOC lumped together. Even when separated into further categories (ex. Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American), they are still so broad. And even the books that get categorized as “diverse” can still have a heavy White influence. Consider interracial romances where more often than not, one of the characters is White. Yes, these are still diverse and valuable, but many count that as a diverse title as opposed to a White title when really, it features both representations.Diversity audits can be really useful, don’t get me wrong. When I did my first couple audits looking at race/ethnicity of author and main character of new titles ordered within a monthlong period for various kids and teen collections, I found it eye-opening. I had thought I was being intentional in my ordering, and while I was to some point, there are so many mid-list titles I was buying that were White, White, White. I’m working on adjusting my ordering practices accordingly, which I think is likely a necessary result of any diversity audits. It’s not just about filling current gaps. It’s looking at our collection practices as a whole.What can librarians do after performing their audits? How can we create goals to be more expansive and inclusive as we move forward? How do we recognize the usefulness of statistics, while also holding onto the importance of the stories and qualitative information behind the numbers? How can we calculate and use data while acknowledging that a quantity over quality mindset is rooted in White supremacy culture?I’m still figuring out these answers myself, but I’ll be starting with adjusting my collection development strategies. I recommend using the diversity audits as a starting point to help make a larger plan of how to expand. I plan on setting up a schedule to regularly perform audits to see how the numbers change as my ordering strategies change. Also, I will continue to seek out accuracy and intersectionality with the help of reviews, especially those from experts of a specific identity such as Debbie Reese’s American Indians in Children's Literature (AICL). For more helpful and recommended resources, check out our “Kindred Spirits” list on the side of blog.Another goal after looking at the audits is not just about looking forward and adjusting ordering, but also looking back, evaluating the current collection, and weeding accordingly. Check out our previous posts here and here. We need to move on from weeding solely based on circulation and take into consideration how stereotypes and bias can shape the stories we provide, prioritizing accuracy and inclusiveness.So go ahead and do your diversity audits. I honestly do recommend it, but see them as one piece of the puzzle towards creating more inclusive collections. Acknowledge what makes them useful as well as what they aren’t telling us. Collections work is always a work in progress, so let’s make that progress actually progressive by continually evaluating the hows and whys and taking a stand for collections that are diverse, inclusive, and equitable.-Jenna Friebel"},
{"title": "Not recommended: It’s Springtime, Mr. Squirrel", "date": "Monday, December 17, 2018", "text": "This is a post in Reading While White’s end-of-year retrospective series.2018 has been a historic year for Native women in U.S. politics. Last month, Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, and Deb Haaland, an enrolled member of the Pueblo of Laguna, became the first-ever Native women elected to U.S. Congress. At the same time, Peggy Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Nation of Ojibwe, was elected Lt. Governor of Minnesota. In the #kidlit world, 2018 has been a stellar year for Native book releases, with several #OwnVoices books by Native creators being published and celebrated, including Traci Sorell winning the Orbis Pictus Honor Award last month for We Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga. In January, another group of AILA Youth Literature Awards was announced and Dr. Debbie Reese was selected to give the 2019 May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture. In June, members of the ALSC Board of Directors addressed longstanding criticism and “inconsistency between Wilder’s legacy and [ALSC’s] core values” when voting to change the name of the Wilder Medal to the Children’s Literature Legacy Award. Dr. Debbie Reese recently posted a Twitter thread highlighting some momentous events from the year.Screenshot of Facebook conversation regarding \"Native American headdress\" flannelboards.Despite these successes and more, anti-Native bigotry and actions persisted in 2018. Ignorance of Native nations was reflected in Senator Elizabeth Warren’s refusal to apologize for claiming Native identity. (That she pointed to a DNA test as “proof” of her Cherokee identity shows her lack of knowledge. Read this post by Jacqueline Keeler and Kelly Hayes and this piece by Rebecca Nagle to learn more about how both Warren and Trump have exploited and erased Cherokee people and the Cherokee Nation in this fight.) While the professional baseball team of Cleveland, Ohio committed to removing racist imagery from team jerseys this year, there are no plans to change the team name and the team will continue to profit from the racist image, which suggests that the move is more about what looks best from a PR perspective than about doing what’s right. Some educators have shared efforts to teach inclusively in 2018 (learn about how teacher Jessica Lifshitz is confronting Native stereotypes with her students here), but many continue to teach false history rooted in White supremacist, colonialist culture (as seen in the screenshot of a recent Facebook group conversation about flannelboards, the inappropriate use of the words “tribe” and “spirit animal,” and this Twitter conversation about fake tipis being used as classroom decorations). Native survivors of targeted harassment courageously raised their voices  against their abusers in 2018, yet Native women continue to face violence and assault at staggering rates. Companies like Target and Crate and Barrel continue to profit off of appropriative Native merchandise that encourages children to “play Indian.” Native book creators continue to be represented minimally at conferences like #NCTE18. Native stories are mislabeled as “folk and fairy tales.” And racist children’s books are still getting published and promoted. One of these books, published this year in the U.S.A., is It’s Springtime, Mr. Squirrel!.Cover of It's Springtime, Mr. Squirrel!Image from Amazon.com.It’s Springtime, Mr Squirrel! is an international picture book (translated from German) by Sebastian Meschenmoser, author of the popular Mr. Squirrel and the Moon. This is one of those “where do you even begin” kind of books to review - there are A LOT of issues.In the beginning of the book, spring has sprung and the setting is abuzz. Graceful gray pencil marks are lightened by splashes of color. Creatures scuttle about, and Mr. Squirrel’s friend Hedgehog shares that he’s not hungry because he has seen “...a lovely lady hedgehog.” At this point, pink and blue background fills are used for male and female characters, reinforcing a very stereoptypical gender binary. When “the lovely lady” Hedgehog is shown, it is from behind (this “lady” only exists as an object for the male character to gaze). Because Hedgehog is too shy to approach the lady character, Mr. Squirrel shares thoughts about how to win her heart: “The best way is to gain fame and glory by showing everyone how brave and strong you are.” The omniscient narrator then says, “In order to gain fame and glory, of course you had to win lots of dangerous fights.” Regardless of author intent, the not-so-subtle message is to get what I want out of this, I have to assert male dominance (toxic masculinity 101). The text then reads: “...if you want to win lots of dangerous fights, you have to look dangerous yourself.” What exactly does it mean to “look dangerous” in this book? First Hedgehog is shown with a butterfly and flowers atop his head, and later with a mushroom-style skirt and a snail on his head (both sexist jabs against anything other than masculine, cisnormative gender presentations). It is only when Hedgehog wears leaves and carries a sharp stick in what appears to be a stereotypical, generic Native outfit that the characters feel ready to win “any dangerous fight.” (To learn about how “playing Indian” is connected to the colonialist history of the U.S.A. and the impacts of stereotypes on Native children’s self-esteem today, read this study, this post, and this book.)Illustration of Hedgehog with grass skirt and spear. Imagine fromhttps://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Its-Springtime-Mr-Squirrel/Sebastian-Meschenmoser/9780735843103.In the pages that follow, the characters (both dressed up now) attack unsuspecting mice, birds, and bunnies. When the bear character, who is named as the most dangerous creature in the forest, isn’t scared of them (he doesn’t see them), Mr. Squirrel and Hedgehog feel victorious. They take flowers to the “lady hedgehog,” only to discover that she isn’t a hedgehog at all, but a hairbrush. As they sit with their disappointment, a duck approaches and says, “That can happen to anybody.” To some readers, this ending and its be careful who you are attracted to messaging might also call to mind stories of people who are transgender being violently outed, which often results in trauma and assault.Scanned illustration of characters chasing mice. No doubt there will be readers who want to defend this book by pointing out the creator’s impeccable draftsmanship or use of irony. Meschenmoser is a talented visual artist in some ways, but the thing about books for children is that they are about how every image and piece of text work together to create each page, and how every image and page fits together with the next to tell a story. Each book goes out into the world, the actual world where Native sovereignty is not understood by those with power (and many without), and where Native kids are facing compounding intersecting oppressions. These books are read by real kids, many whose very identities are under constant threat. If you work with young people, I invite you sit and think with me about the messages this particular book sends to readers, and how it connects to today...to this month...to 2018. How will Native readers and others with minoritized group identities respond to this book? How might readers with privilege and power react? What might they internalize? If you still want to defend this book, I invite you to consider the purpose supporting an artist’s style above all else serves. Who does it protect? What legacies does it continue? If you choose to read a different book, I’d suggest any of the Hall of Fame recommendations on Indigo’s Bookshelf, the new blog (also started this year) by the group of Florida Seminole and Miccosukee teens who Tweet collaboratively using @OfGlades. If you don’t already follow them, you should. These young people have things to say—and as reflecting on 2018 shows for those us who are not Native, we have much to learn.-Elisa Gall"},
{"title": "PART II: False Victimization and White Aggression: David Lubar’s Public Facebook Discussion Following Baskin’s 2018 TEDxTalk", "date": "Wednesday, December 12, 2018", "text": "The Reading While White team is pleased to welcome Guest Blogger Sarah Hamburg today.In Monday’s post, Allie Jane Bruce gave a close reading of Nora Raleigh Baskin’s TEDx Talk, “Artists Mustn’t Fear the Social Media Call-Out Culture,” looking at how Baskin’s talk addresses “call-out culture,” and how that presentation relates to Whiteness and power in children’s literature. Today, I’d like to go back and examine how online discussions following Baskin’s talk reflect those same dynamics. The online conversations about Baskin’s talk are an illustrative example of how White people in children’s publishing define social media culture, and its norms, in ways that both uphold our own dominance, and enact active racist aggression against BIPOC people in the field.I want to note, especially in the wake of the massacre at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, that this conversation is not meant to convey that White people can’t be marginalized along other identifies; White people, including White Jewish people, can still be subject to other oppressions. However, the focus of this post is Whiteness, and an examination of a specific incident of White aggression and dominance in order to identify larger patterns of racism in the field. After the publication of Nora Raleigh Baskin’s TEDx talk on May 21, 2018, there were many conversations both online and off, but I’d like to focus on one Facebook thread in particular. The thread encapsulates dynamics that occur repeatedly within the social media spaces of children’s publishing. As Allie mentioned on Monday, it’s been several months since the TEDx talk and these specific discussions took place, but a close examination of their scope and impact remains (unfortunately) relevant.On May 24th, David Lubar wrote a public Facebook post which began, “Once again, a writer has been the subject of an over-the-top assault by Debbie Reese.” That writer was Nora Raleigh Baskin, and the “assault” was Dr. Debbie Reese’s series of tweets critiquing the content of Baskin’s TEDx talk.  On May 21st, Dr. Cristina James (who organized the TEDx event at which Baskin spoke) had tagged Dr. Reese on Twitter, with a link to Baskin’s talk and an invitation to, “discuss, contest, argue if you must…” Dr. Reese responded to that invitation on May 22nd with an initial series of tweets expressing her general thoughts on the content of the talk, followed by a longer thread in which she listened to the talk again and live-tweeted her close analysis. (Dr. Reese compiled those threads in a blog post; I highly recommend that readers spend time with her actual words and reactions to the talk, as well as her own response to David Lubar’s post.) At the beginning of the second thread Dr. Reese tagged Nora Raleigh Baskin, and Baskin was then automatically tagged in each of the threaded tweets. That tagging, and Dr. Reese’s presentation of her thoughts and critique more generally, became the primary focus of online discussions about Nora Raleigh Baskin’s TEDx talk. It’s here, in this shifting of focus from the substance of critiques to the manner of their delivery, and the characterizations of responses from BIPOC people as “call-out culture,” online “bullying,” and in this case “assault,” that I’d like to spend time via this post.The full text of David Lubar’s May 24th Facebook post is as follows: (Note, this was a public Facebook post, which could be viewed by anyone, and several participants recorded the post and comments as they progressed. Lubar later made the decision to delete the post and the thread in their entirety. In discussing the post, I’ll be relying on screenshots made while it was still active. While the post itself is recorded intact, unfortunately many of the later comments and additions to the thread are not available. My discussion will focus on the comments to the thread before people began intervening. Full disclosure: Allie Jane Bruce and I were both later participants in this Facebook discussion.)“Once again, a writer has been the subject of an over-the-top assault by Debbie Reese. And, once again, anyone who calls her out is besieged by her defenders, who act as if she walks on water. If those of you leaping to Ms. Reese's defense haven't actually read some of her columns, I think that would be a good thing to do. Much of what she writes is quibbles, false attacks, and weak scholarship. Consider this, from her attack on Susan Cooper: [quote] Ghost Hawk opens with two epigraphs. The first is from Roger Williams and is dated 1643. Williams tells not to be proudful because ‘thy brother Indian was made by the same God that made the English. That Indian, the epigraph says, is just as wise, fair, and strong as the English man.’ The second epigraph is a verse from Woodie Guthrie's song, This Land is Your Land.Why, I wonder, did Cooper choose those two? It was, by the way, rather patronizing of Williams to assume that his God made Indians. How does he know it didn't happen the other way around, with the Indians’ god making the Englishmen?! [end quote] Do you see the problem? Cooper's intent was obviously to show that Roger Williams saw all humans as equal. Making things worse is that the actual Roger Williams quote doesn't specify which god he means. Reese basically attacks Cooper for showing something positive about Roger Williams. You can find hundreds more examples of this, along with some PETA-like campaigns. She attacked Jon Scieszka twice for calling a Mayan \"Kakapoopoohead\" (I might have the spelling wrong), and posted links on YALSA book, with his name in the subject. She did this first by comparing this to Mel Gibson's Apocalypto (sp?), and then, seven years later by comparing this to the news hoax about the Chinese crew names on the plane that crashed. l have writer friends who have been attacked for absurd things. One had a Native American character cross his legs to play the guitar while seated on the floor. Ms. Reese slammed this sentence for being a stereotype. If you play guitar, you know this is the comfortable way to sit. Yes -- many minorities have been badly portrayed in books. but they deserve a better defender, and Ms. Reese deserves to be called out for her tactics.”In the ensuing comments on Lubar’s post, a group of primarily White writers wrote to affirm Lubar’s characterizations, and to add further demeaning remarks about Dr. Reese’s work and about her as a person. These comments continued uninterrupted until May 30th, when several people began posting comments pushing back. In the comments from White people adding their support for Lubar’s post, several central themes emerged. Most prominent among them was participants’ stated belief that they agreed with Dr. Reese in general terms, but opposed her “tactics” and ways of expressing herself. I’d like to look at that idea, and its relationship to Baskin’s delivered remarks about “call-out culture,” more closely.In the very first comment on the post, Jordan Sonnenblick responded to say, “As you know, David, I have tangled with DR in the past. It is frustrating, because invariably, she attacks people who would be _on her side_, but in such vicious and passive—aggressively unfair ways that she divides our little world into venomous little camps.” Others added their agreement to this idea.David Lubar Well said, Jordan. Your point about attacking people who would he allies is an excellent observation.Gae Polisner Every time we try to talk about this and what is wrong with it, I am reminded of trying to talk logic with Trump supporters, and it truly, truly terrifies me. Not to mention, the defense is that she's advocating for kids. Well kids are being bullied online in droves. At times this bullying is leading to suicide and outward violence. What kind of message does it send to the kids to watch adults engage in this nature of cruel communication over and over and over again online?Stephanie Olivieri Gae Polisner Exactly.Susan Fabricant Hess Gae Polisner l agree and have had it out with her on Twitter. Nothing ever positive comes out of her mouth or keyboard.Annette Kesterson I hate the toxic atmosphere she creates and Jordan Sonnenblick is exactly right--even when i agree with her assertions, she is so poisonous that I would never support her in them.Leslie Bermel says, “Alexandra Flinn I agree wholeheartedly. Her voice and expertise could have tremendous impact. It’s her tone and call out methods I take exception with.” And from Lisa Rondinelli Albert, “She does more harm than good with these rants and bullying tactics. What a wonderful antagonist she makes.”Lubar's initial post does cite passages from Dr. Reese’s work in an effort to show specific instances where he disagrees with the substance of her critical reviews, yet his overall framing is one in which he repeatedly characterizes Reese’s scholarship as “attacks” and “assault.” (The word “attack” appears five times in Lubar’s post.)  Lubar cites his disagreement with Reese’s criticisms—whether it’s in her critique of a White author parodying Indigenous naming practices, or in her reading of the implicit condescension in Roger Williams’ words from 1643—as evidence that Dr. Reese sharing her own perspective constitutes an attack. White commenters in the thread then continue this conflation between critique and “attack,” adding words like “vicious,” “venomous,” “bullying,” “cruel,” “nothing positive,” “nasty,” “toxic,” “poisonous.”  And “wonderful antagonist.” Disagreement with the substance of Dr. Reese’s reviews and perspective is quickly lost, in favor of discussion of the idea that the White commenters would agree with Dr. Reese, were she not so “poisonous.” The implication in comments from Sonnenblick, Bermel, Kesterson, and other White people in the thread is that they are somehow allies, and would agree with Dr. Reese’s reviews, except that -- according to them -- the way Reese conducts herself unfortunately maintains racial divisions and alienates White people. On Monday, Allie looked at the ways Nora Raleigh Baskin, in her TEDx talk on the subject, declines to define exactly what she means by “call-out culture.” The result is a conflation between very real online harassment and hate (disproportionately directed at Black and Indigenous people, and People of Color, particularly BIPOC women and nonbinary people) and anti-racist critique from BIPOC readers and scholars. Something similar is happening in this Facebook thread about online culture. In it, White participants’ stated belief that they would agree with Dr. Reese, if not for her “tactics”, fails to define exactly what “toxic,” “poisonous” behavior they mean. The one instance people reference is the fact that Dr. Reese tagged Nora Raleigh Baskin in each of her long series of live-tweets about the TEDx talk. Paul Hankins goes so far as to equate this Twitter tagging with torture, saying, “She uses social media like the walk home from school while being menaced by the bully that will not hit but taunts incessantly. When you go tweet after tweet after tweet, tagging the other person each time, the ‘what abouting’ becomes a form of 'water boarding'.”  Hankins continues, “This is not conversation. This is not the way that I would bring a student to a sense of understanding or learning. Because THEIR EYES WERE WATCHING GOD has been on my mind of late (reading with students), I go back to an idea of how Joe Starks rises to power over Eatonville. Zora Neale Hurston writes: ‘They bowed down to him because he was all of these things, but, perhaps he was all of these things because they bowed down… watch authors now take the safe road and write books with more animal characters or natural settings without characters out of fear of DR’s reach and influence.’\"Later in the Facebook discussion, and in her own blog post, Dr. Reese acknowledges that Twitter’s auto-tagging could have been overwhelming for Baskin, and offers an apology for the (inadvertent) multiple tags. But the hyperbolic allusions to violence, “menace,” and bullying do not match the act of tagging someone in a series of tweets. There is so much more to say here, too, about the comparison to Their Eyes Were Watching God, the idea that listening to Dr. Reese equates to “bowing down,” ideas about who exactly is having to take time away from their writing, and the mocking references to animal characters. (For just one crucial series on the subject of animal characters, see Edith Campbell’s posts on monkeys in children’s books.) It’s also worth noting that on other occasions, White book creators and bloggers have criticized Dr. Reese for not tagging them on Twitter, and cited this as an example of Reese talking behind their backs. (For another discussion of the focus on Twitter tagging as a derailing tactic, see this article from Bustle on reactions to Dr. Reese’s critique of The Love That Split the World.) Throughout the discussion on David Lubar’s post, it’s clear that the actual basis for White people calling Dr. Reese “toxic” is the very existence of her critiques as a Native woman, the fact that she expresses opinions that are “negative” (i.e. not praise), and the fact that White people feel discomfort when encountering her perspective. As in so many instances where we as White people point to “tone” or “delivery” as the problem, the argument becomes a circular one: “I would agree with you if not for your tone, and the problem with your tone is that you dare to be yourself and disagree with me.”Ironically, in a discussion that’s ostensibly about the freedom to express opinions, and about writers’ work in the context of online culture and bullying, White participants in this Facebook thread come together to engage in the collective dehumanization of a Native scholar because of her writing. Dr. Debbie Reese becomes “a wonderful antagonist” and a “menacing bully.” These words disregard Debbie Reese’s humanity, and her right to express her opinions and knowledge through written scholarship (as much an artistic form as fiction writing.) White people join together here, in an online space, to describe Dr. Reese as someone lesser, who exists as a threat. Further, that collective dehumanization quickly moves from words to proposed action. Ed Sullivan says, “I am appalled that ALSC gave her the 2019 Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award for ‘her strong modeling of inclusion, integrity and respect (ALSC Core Values) via the timely insights she shares on the influential blog.’ It disgusts me to sound like some kind of conservative reactionary but Reese is an example of the worst about political correctness.”Susan Fabricant Hess says, “If only we could do more..like boycott the Arbuthnot Lecture,” and later, “Time to boycott.”Finally, Mari Crispano Meli says, “I don't know who this person is or how she gained such power. But I am guessing that it's a good time to call her out on it, as you have done. Unite and conquer!” That’s right, in a thread in which many White participants have gathered to disparage and demean a Native scholar for her invited response to the content of a public lecture, in which they have characterized a Native woman as a “wonderful antagonist” and a “menacing bully,” and in which some have called for a boycott of Dr. Reese’s Arbuthnot lecture, we arrive here at the words: “Unite and conquer!” The racist and colonial framing could not be any more clear. In this thread, a Native woman’s work and words are a threat against which White people must “unite and conquer.” And the White double standard also couldn’t be more stark. If the supposed problem White people are addressing here is online bullying and group behavior, then what exactly is the group behavior of this online thread? Somehow, White norms about social media and bullying, and kindness, don’t seem to apply to us White people.David Lubar’s Facebook post and the ensuing discussion, where White people conflate critique of a TEDx talk with bullying and harassment, echoes the content of Baskin’s talk itself. The progression of the Lubar discussion, where White people unite online to disparage a Native scholar, dehumanize her and refer to her in ways that evoke racist ideas of menace and violence (racist ideas with a long, genocidal history), and propose a boycott of her Arbuthnot Lecture, reveals the stakes of Baskin’s talk. Online bullying and harassment are real, and they have real consequences. Again, though, those harsh realities and consequences are experienced most acutely by BIPOC women and nonbinary people, including those in the field of children’s literature. Online harassment, as with most harassment, is most often a means by which those with power—like White people in children’s publishing—enforce and maintain our dominance. As Allie discussed in her post, Baskin failed to address these power dynamics and disparities in her TEDx talk, and refused to own the power that we as White people have in this field. David Lubar’s Facebook post, and the subsequent thread, are both a reflection and a result of that omission. White people aren’t the victims here, and if we as White people can’t name, take responsibility for, and work to change our positions of power, then we are active participants in maintaining our White dominance. And those whose art and personhood are most deeply impacted by these violent inequities will continue to be BIPOC creators—whether fiction writers, or critical scholars.-Sarah HamburgAs is always the case, BIPOC writers have explored these issues for a long time, and in much more detail than I address here. I’m both indebted to them and their work in everything I’ve said here, and also recognize that it is their voices White people should be listening to, not mine.Links:Debbie Reese's Twitter Threads about Nora Raleigh Baskin's Ted Talk#OwnVoices Controversy by Mia Wenjen (PragmaticMom)"},
{"title": "PART I: A Response to “Artists Mustn’t Fear the Social Media Call-Out Culture”, a TEDx Talk by Nora Raleigh Baskin", "date": "Monday, December 10, 2018", "text": "This is the first post in Reading While White’s End-of-Year Retrospective series, in which we take a look back at some of the events of 2018 and identify recurring patterns.Nora Raleigh Baskin’s TEDx Talk, “Artists Mustn’t Fear the Social Media Call-Out Culture” was published May 21, 2018.  In it, Baskin contends that “loud” and “vitriolic” voices on the internet are threatening artistic and creative expression and therefore constitute a societal danger.  You can see the full video here.In this post, I focus primarily on Baskin’s TEDx Talk itself.  Wednesday, we’ll welcome guest blogger Sarah Hamburg, who will unpack some of the subsequent events that occurred in online spaces. [Ed. 12/12/18: Sarah Hamburg's post is now available here.]Back in May, when Nora Raleigh Baskin’s TEDx Talk was published, I didn’t want to talk about it.  The end of the school year (and my time at my job) was nigh, and I was completely drained.  Listening to Baskin’s talk drained me even more, even though it was nothing I hadn’t heard many, many times before.I was, and still am, grateful to the people who raised their voices to challenge Baskin’s narrative at the time (see Dr. Debbie Reese’s post here and Mia Wenjen’s response here).  I understand that I’m offering my perspective late, especially in our frantically-paced media culture; to some, because it comes late, this post will undoubtedly land as resentful and dilatory.And yet, the dynamics, mindsets, and structures that informed Baskin’s talk, and the rigamarole that followed, repeat themselves; talking about them is, unfortunately, always timely.  After the announcement of the Wilder Award name change (to the Children’s Literature Legacy Award), I observed the very real danger that my colleagues found themselves in, including some BIPOC colleagues who’d had nothing to do with the name change.  I worked on this blog post in fits and starts over the past few months, and offer it now as I reflect that the fear White people so often express at the possibility that they or their work will be criticized falls miles short of the actual hate and harassment faced by those people, especially BIPOC people, who do social justice work.I’ve boiled down my problems with Baskin’s talk to three fundamental points: She never defines the titular “Social Media Call-Out Culture”; she fails to acknowledge that art has the power to hurt people; and, in its aftermath, she did not welcome debate.I’ll begin with what I think is the central problem: Baskin’s failure to define “Social Media Call-Out Culture.I wonder, as I listen to Baskin describe “voices on the internet” as “so loud, and so angry, and so vitriolic,” is she talking about those who tag people with racist, sexist, heterosexist, anti-trans, and ableist slurs, or who openly advocate for violence, such as those who continue to attack Ellen Oh with death and rape threats?  Or is she talking about those of us who criticize and call out problematic content?  Or, is she talking about everyone—conflating critics with those who practice hate and violent speech?  Or is she talking about a category of online voices I haven’t named? Baskin never clarifies.The only example of online interaction Baskin cites is the one with which she opens her talk: Baskin stumbled onto a Twitter thread in which an author describes having arrived at the decision not to try to publish a book because she does not belong to the marginalized group she was writing about.  Baskin continues, “numerous tweets chimed in with praise for her bravery. One using the phrase: It’s time to cede the floor.” (0:47)  The fact and manner in which Baskin quotes “bravery” and “cede the floor” lead me to believe that she has concerns about these tweets, and disagrees with their sentiment (concerns and disagreement I do not share).  But regardless of how Baskin feels about these tweets, the language they use is hardly “angry” or “vitriolic.”  I’m still pondering, therefore, what exactly Baskin means when she refers to the “heated, angry, bifurcated social media call-out culture” (8:23).Why does this matter--why is it important to spell out what precisely Baskin means when she describes a “social media callout culture”?  I identify three primary reasons.Reason 1 - In the absence of a clear definition, I believe that Baskin is, intentionally or not, referring to anyone who she perceives as surpassing what she deems to be an appropriate level of anger—she alludes to a nebulous lump of internet voices, terming them “loud,” “angry,” “vitriolic,” and “heated.”I thought over and over of what Robin DiAngelo terms White Fragility’s Rules of Engagement. Now, Baskin does indeed clarify that “bad writing, lazy writing, should always be called out. Stories that propagate stereotypes that have flat, one-dimensional characters, stories that depict an inaccurate historical record, should be critiqued and reviewed as such” (8:55). As a listener, I conclude at this point that Baskin supports critique and criticism of bad writing, so long as said criticism does not cross the border into the realm of “angry,” “loud,” “heated” or “vitriolic.” In doing so, she demarcates a border between “acceptable discourse” and “unacceptable discourse” without specifying the criteria for either category.She also fails to unpack what it means to be a White person assuming and perpetuating rules for “acceptable discourse”; there’s a long history, in the United States, of White people dismissing voices of people we deem “uppity” or “uncivilized”—and using such terms to justify violence against, and oppression of, BIPOC people. When we White people cite tone or manner of delivery as grounds for dismissing the concerns of BIPOC people, we leverage the pain of those we oppress against them in the service of perpetuating racism.Reason 2 - The second reason I ask “what specific call out culture?” is this: We need to be clear about who are oppressors and who are oppressed here.  There is oppression online; there is honest-to-god hate speech and violent speech that puts people’s physical well being and lives at risk. I’ve been on the receiving end of swastikas, Pepe the Frogs (a racist and anti-Semitic symbol of hate), and conjectures about my physical appearance and religion (unapologetically Jewish, for the record), which is nothing compared to what my BIPOC friends have been through (I know people who’ve had to leave their homes).  But I don’t hear Baskin referencing that kind of hateful rhetoric in this speech; I hear her citing a fear that she’ll be harshly criticized if she writes something that’s not OwnVoices (Baskin also fails to cite that Corinne Duyvis coined the term “OwnVoices,” thereby contributing to the continued erasure of disabled voices in literature).  Here, Baskin misidentifies those who fight against oppression, as if by crossing from “acceptable” to “unacceptable discourse” they’ve become equivalent to those who perpetuate oppression. I doubt she’s doing this consciously, but she is doing it nonetheless, and she isn’t the first; morally equating racism with resistance to racism is a tried-and-true, highly effective method of weakening that resistance and perpetuating racism.Reason 3 -  Much of Baskin’s talk presupposes that the “social media callout culture” exists in opposition to the work that artists do in making art.  This is, I think, a faulty analysis.Baskin opens with the aforementioned story of an author describing how she decided not to try to publish a certain story. Above, I deduced that Baskin assumes that the author’s decision stems from a fear of being called out on social media, but I think it’s possible that it wasn’t fear of a loud, vitriolic, angry social media culture, but rather, education, reflection, self-awareness, and a growing sense of self that doesn’t depend on praise or a need to take up space.  Such a solid foundation allows one to step back at times—allowing other artists, perhaps OwnVoices artists, to step in.I’m sure that Baskin feels genuinely concerned that art is threatened by forceful criticism.  I wonder why she didn’t consider reacting to the Twitter thread thusly: “Concerned as I am about any limitations even being suggested upon one’s art, I also recognize that someone from that marginalized group now has that much of a better shot at getting published, which will be a good thing for art. How exciting! More and better art is on the way!”  The nature of her framing—that she jumped to “art is being limited”—reveals that she is operating from a White default.My second point of contention with Baskin’s talk is this:  Art has the power to hurt people, and artists need to reckon with that, and take responsibility for it.Within the first minute of her talk, Baskin describes, upon discovering the other author’s Twitter thread, “a cycle of emotions: First angry, then sad, then worried, and finally, afraid—for myself, yes; but for art, and for artists, and for the power and freedom of creative expression.”Baskin sets up art as a lofty thing that has the power to transcend our mundane lives.  I agree that the best art can do this. But, I am troubled that Baskin expresses fear on behalf of art, but not on behalf of people.  I am troubled that she doesn’t recognize that the fact that powerful art can transcend one’s mundane life means that art can also damage, hurt, and cause real harm to people’s very real lives.  And that so often, and for so long, we White people have prioritized the lifting up, transcendent “boosts” we get from powerful art over the very real harm that (often the same) art can do to very real people.Lest anyone accuse me of being anti-art, I should specify that art isn’t, by its nature, harmful; but it’s also not, by its nature, harmless.  It depends on the messages packed into, and sent by, the art.At 10:20, Baskin argues: “The decision of what gets published and what does not, what is bought and what sells, never belonged to the writer; that power belongs to the industry—to the publishers, to the editors, to the agents, to the sales and marketing departments, to the big chain booksellers, to the gatekeepers.  Money and economic factors dictate that market.” This is, quite simply, a responsibility dodge. Of course artists have power in this realm, because there’s a difference between writing in one’s diary and pitching an agent or a publisher on one’s writing. And it is, indeed, the responsibility of writers and illustrators (as well as publishers, editors, agents, booksellers, etc) to understand their power and use it responsibly.(For the record: Baskin is far from alone in dodging this responsibility; I’ve observed many creators and critics maintain that art can’t hurt people, a breath away from “people hurt people”.)My final point of dispute with Baskin is simple: I cannot understand why she did not welcome or engage with the critique of her talk (which was offered by many people, including, but not limited to, Dr. Debbie Reese).This TEDx conference organizer, Dr. Cristina James, tweeted extensively to promote Baskin’s talk.  Most of James’ tweets tagged other Twitter users who’d included “#OwnVoices” in a tweet at some point within the past few months.  James tagged more than 80 Twitter accounts (including Dr. Debbie Reese’s) in tweets promoting Baskin’s talk, usually inviting people to “consider [Baskin’s] view on #ownvoices too in her just released @TEDx talk. Please watch discuss contest, agree amplify & keep the conversation going!”  Given this context, it’s doubly difficult to determine who Baskin means when she refers to “angry,” “loud,” “vitriolic,” and “heated” voices on the internet; although I recognize that Dr. Cristina James and Nora Raleigh Baskin are two different people, this juxtaposition would suggest that both Baskin and James seek and welcome robust debate and criticism, especially from prominent voices on the internet (or else why would they be tagged and asked to “discuss, contest, argue…”)And call me naive, but for the life of me, I do not understand why someone would do a TEDx talk if she’s not open to debate or criticism on the subject.  Check back Wednesday for guest blogger Sarah Hamburg’s post, which delves deeper into the online events that followed Baskin’s talk. [Ed. 12/12/18: Sarah Hamburg's post is now available here.]For all her fear of artists being silenced, Baskin never reckons with the possibility that she might be silencing people herself, in this very talk.  She refuses to acknowledge her own power as a White person in the industry, and how that power (wielded now to conflate oppression with anti-oppression, to excuse creators from any harm their work might visit upon children, to dictate what constitutes “acceptable” and “unacceptable” discourse in the world of criticism, and to paint a White-centric narrative that asserts that art is in danger because of “call out culture”) contributes to a world in which the increase in diverse books has been, almost entirely, a boon for White creators.She also fails to recognize that her words might have a stifling effect on another group of people: Critics.  Despite her passionate concern about silencing artists, Baskin doesn’t recognize that there’s also a very real danger in silencing critics.  Happily, we are not a silent bunch.-Allie Jane Bruce"},

And these days, the children’s literature news cycle has the shelf life of egg salad (which is still better than the latke shelf life of national political news).But a lot happened this year, and it’s worth re-visiting some of it.  Both because it’s worth it to analyze things, even late, and also, because it’s worth it to identify patterns that repeat themselves over and over.Over the next two months, we’ll be exploring, analyzing, and discussing various 2018 headlines (and non-headlines).  From TEDx Talks to CCBC stats, from reviews we missed to discussions about shame, we’ll cover a wide range of topics.  We can’t and won’t hit every single thing we missed; rather, we’ll try to combat the frenetic pace of the news by recognizing patterns of thought and behavior, which sometimes get lost in moment-to-moment conversations.Stay tuned; our first post will be this upcoming Monday (December 10).  This post will be edited to compile links to the series as we post.

Please take a moment to check out this Open Letter from the Asian Authors Alliance to Abrams regarding this book, and also check out some of the powerful responses on twitter here and here and here.  (Also, follow the Asian Authors Alliance on Twitter.)As a former school librarian, I am horrified at the harm that this title could visit upon children.  Imagine that you are a Muslim and/or Middle Eastern child (perhaps the only one) in your elementary school classroom, and your teacher or librarian holds up this book and reads the title.  Imagine the looks from other children, the potential lunchtime or recess torture, that could result solely from the impact of the cover and title.The Open Letter implores Abrams to do better; I join them in this ask.UPDATE: In a statement this afternoon (Friday, November 23), Abrams wrote, \"ABRAMS has decided to withdraw publication of the adult graphic novel, A Suicide Bomber Sits in the Library, which was to be published on its Abrams ComicArts list in May 2019.\" The full statement can be found here; you can find responses to the book's cancellation on twitter here and here and here.-Allie Jane Bruce"},
{"title": "The Privilege of Nostalgia", "date": "Thursday, October 11, 2018", "text": "When I first learned about Jane Mount’s Bibliophile: An Illustrated Miscellany, I was excited. (I love books! This is a book about loving books? What is there not to love?!) My heart sank, however, when I saw this preview spread of the “Formative Faves” page via Amazon:Almost every book featured in this spread was written by a White person—and one of them is Little House on the Prairie. (I'm not sure that having your humanity denied to you through racist depictions and erasure in literature—both singularly and systemically—inspires bibliophilia.) Every human illustrated on this page is depicted with the same shade of pinky-pale skin. I know that this is just one spread of the book, and there are attempts elsewhere to include voices of readers and authors of varying identities; still, the message this particular spread sends to me is that the “Formative Faves” page was made with White readers in mind. The stories I read in my own formative years are not too different from those listed in the book. If I made a list of my favorite books from when I was a kid, only one title would be a book by an author of color. There are more racist titles by White people in my childhood memories than authentic multicultural stories or #OwnVoices texts. I can’t change what I read as a child, nor can I deny my majority-White authored reading history. I will never know how much I missed out on, how many stories I did not get to hear, because creators were not given opportunities to write or publish their own stories and also because my grown-up gatekeepers did not give me access to all of the books that were published. I will spend a lifetime trying to understand the effect this lack of connection to these stories and problematic representation in these stories had on my development and socialization. I must continue working to unlearn the lessons taught subtly and explicitly through the stories I did and did not (and still today, do and do not) have opportunities to read.When I think about my childhood reading, I can choose not to think about the racist books I loved. Because I do not face racism as a White person, it is easy for me to (though I am working to not do this) fall into the trap of making racism a “thought experiment” or glossing over what is problematic. This is all a result of privilege. I don’t have to carry the trauma of having to suffer through book lists, read alouds, and a celebrated ‘canon’ of books that dehumanize or erase me because I am White. When I think about my childhood reading experiences and I feel warm and fuzzy, these feelings are a result of all of the books I connected with as a kid, the books that affirmed me, all of the racial mirrors I had (taking Rudine Sims Bishop’s metaphor into account). Those feelings of coziness and belonging are NOT universal, and White readers like me have to stop pretending that they are. Racist books, even those from the past, are not ever reflective of the way all people “thought back then.” As long as there have been books, there have been people fighting racism in books—and today, with more knowledge, I can be thoughtful in choosing which books from my past I want to celebrate in my present. Nostalgia for a racist institution like #kidlit (or politics, or school, or film, or theater, or fine art) will always support racism. Because children’s lit is an institution brimming with White supremacy culture, nostalgia reflects and perpetuates this reality. In our capitalistic society, #kidlit book nostalgia has also been commodified—and its racism has been embedded in that too. Do you love Out of Print clothing? Take a look at how many T-shirts you can buy that celebrate books by creators of color (not many). How about MerryMakers dolls or the children’s literature posters made by Litographs? See how few IPOC artists are represented in what is available. I’m not saying that people should not celebrate a favorite book or author with a tote bag or other merchandise. I am asking my fellow White people to think more about what the tote bag selection says about the industry and its history, and what systems these collections of merchandise continue to support. Book nostalgia and capitalism will never stop chugging out book-themed stuff for us to consume, but librarians, teachers, and readers can work to see how this too is part of the push to romanticize the past—and that ‘looking back’ also impacts our culture of today. Whenever and however we celebrate this past, and assume that readers’ formative experiences were positive and affirming, who are we assuming as the default audience? When White stories, creators, and readers are centered over and over and over again—White people like me are being told that we matter more. That our stories matter more. That our lives matter more. We see this in the “classics.” We see this in what book T-shirt options exist. And this has a direct connection to the inequities we see today, from the practitioner end (for example, the lack of racial diversity in upcoming conference lineups like #mra50) and publishing (see CCBC’s most recent statistics on racial diversity in children’s book publishing). Last month I had a chance to visit the American Writers Museum. In the room focused on children’s literature, there is a mural celebrating children’s “classics.” Unsurprisingly, this mural reflects both the lack of diversity in children’s literature as well as the overt (yet unchallenged in this display) racism in titles like Little House in the Big Woods and Island of the Blue Dolphins. Until there is equity in the children’s literature ecosystem, there will never be equity in our culture of #kidlit nostalgia or celebrations of the classics. We can’t erase nor can we forget the past, but we can choose when, why, and how much to focus on it. We can intentionally examine this past critically, following the lead of people doing this now using the hashtag #DisruptTexts. We can work to understand our nostalgia and the purpose it serves. Hopefully this work will translate into action, including conscious choices to focus less on upholding and romanticizing the past and more on what changes needs to happen, and what excellent books can be celebrated, today."},

{"title": "Knowing Better, Doing Better", "date": "Friday, June 22, 2018", "text": "A little over a year ago, Edi Campbell reflected on anthropomorphized monkeys in the book Voices in the Park via this blog post. In March of this year, Campbell continued the conversation through this critical analysis of Monkey: Not Ready for Kindergarten by Marc Brown. In April she added even more context through this post, in which she writes:Monkeys and apes perpetuate white imperialism in children's books. Sentiments combining their images with African Americans began in tandem with the notion of race and they continue to be used to perpetuate racist views. Sure, there's not always intentional misrepresentation, but when you know the history, you know how the images are interpreted. And, when you know better, you have to do better.Images of apes and monkeys have been historically used (and are still used today, even if subtly and/or unconsciously) to dehumanize Black people and justify or minimize trauma, injustices, and disrespect they endure. This has historic roots and it is still happening, right now, every day. And because kid lit does not exist in a vacuum, in kid lit this is happening right now, every day.Image from Zack at the Dentist.Campbell’s writing has helped me to pay better attention to how this type of racist imagery and messaging shows up in children’s literature, and ever since I’ve been reading and reflecting on her posts, anthropomorphized monkeys have been entering my consciousness left and right. There’s the new release from Serlin and Selznick, and the Barnett-Pizzoli early readers that were advertised last year Image from Zack at the Dentist.(though there are questions now about if/when these will be released). There’s Zack at the Dentist by Jonathan London and Jack Medoff, in which a gleeful banana-loving monkey never brushes his teeth and causes a commotion at the dentist’s office. (He leaves with knowledge of dental hygiene, but he still gets toothpaste on his shirt.) And there’s Monkey Needs to Listen by Sue Grave and Trevor Dunton, in which the only monkey in a class of animals cannot sit still and does not listen to the teacher’s safety tips. (As a result of him throwing paper airplanes, hanging from a tree, and shouting out instead of listening, Monkey crashes a go-kart and spoils the group’s go-kart race.) This book has been created for the White-dominated field of education—the same field in which Black students are disciplined and suspended at disproportionate rates—as part of a “Behavior Matters” series. Image from Monkey Needs to Listen.I have not gone out of my way to search for any of these titles, but the stream of books like this is constant. Consider what this messaging—over and over, and rarely acknowledged outright—does over a lifetime. Consider the implicit bias it helps to build...the internalized dominance or internalized sense of inferiority...the warped sense of reality...the “fun house mirrors” (to quote Dr. Debbie Reese). There may be a variety of reactions to these representations from members of different racial groups (no experience is monolithic). I do know the history, however, and that I can't ignore the painful reactions to this imagery many have shared. A common impulse might be to belittle criticisms. “It’s just one book” or “I don’t see it that way” are just two of many predictable defenses. While each book is factually one book, there is much to be learned from taking a step back and working to understand the big picture, the system in which that one book exists. It might be one book AND it is one book that continues a legacy of racist depictions and associations. It is one book, AND that book is supporting a view of society rooted in anti-Blackness. To the person wanting to shout “I don’t see it that way” or “why can’t a monkey just be a monkey?” when someone else has shared how those images function and make them feel, I would ask them to consider how that response affects others and the situation. I would ask that person to think about why it might be, and perhaps what privileges they have, that make it easy for them to not “see it that way.” One might claim to be unaffected by racism, but we are all socialized beings. Whether or not we know it or claim to be aware of it, what is normalized in society—including the racism normalized and embedded into our world—has an impact on us. To suggest that critics are too sensitive or reading too much into a particular book/image/situation is to ignore many of those critics’ expertise as well as the very real way that racism functions. If you are angry at learning about this imagery and its effects—why not direct that anger towards the racism, and not the people pointing out the racism? Feedback causes discomfort, and feedback is an invitation to learn and to change behavior in the future. What is one doing when that invitation is rejected?White people, myself included, cannot honestly claim (whether to others or to ourselves) to be innocent on this. It is our responsibility to listen to the people who have been sharing expertise and information with us (again and again, often thanklessly, often over generations), and to use what we learn to direct our future actions, including the work of creating, editing, reviewing, selecting, and reading books with or for young people. This might mean acknowledging when we see yet another anthropomorphic monkey, even if it is in a book by a favorite author. It might mean making tough decisions about what we read and how we discuss it with kids. It might mean having that awkward, uncomfortable conversation with your colleague—and also working to listen and check your defenses and cut the crap when you are the one getting called in. We need to acknowledge and understand that we are part of a system, and work to hear and listen to the people who challenge our lenses.  Because of the lives we live, the lessons we’re taught, and the experiences we have, we will all have unique ways of seeing and understanding the world— but this seeing is not completely static. Or rather, it does not have to be. Campbell’s words (as well as the words of Maya Angelou) again come to mind: “when you know better, you have to do better.” We can do better—and we must.SaveSave"},

If you haven’t yet seen the 2018 We’re the People Summer Reading List, please consult it for recommendations of inclusive books by and about IPOC, people with disabilities, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community. The list, founded by Edi Campbell in 2015, is curated by a team of authors, librarians, and academics: Thaddeus Andracki, Edi Campbell, Dr. Laura Jiménez, Alia Jones, Sujei Lugo, Lyn Miller-Lachmann, and Dr. Sonia Alejandra Rodriguez. Titles are organized into the categories of Picture Books, Chapter Books/Beginning Readers, Middle Grade (ages 8-12), and Young Adult (ages 12-18). Each book undergoes a critical review process and is vetted by at least two readers before making it on the list. On the We’re the People website, the team states, “We want readers to become familiar with the names on the list and their creative work and to enjoy the stories they tell and the people they represent.” Readers looking for even more recommendations will be happy to know that past lists are archived and accessible, each organized by the year it was first created. Be sure to check out the We're the People site and the books recommended there.What books are you looking forward to reading this summer? Please share in the comments. Here are a few titles some of us RWW contributors are excited to read or recommend:Cover of I'm Still Here. Cover of Algorithms of Oppression.ELISA: Thanks to a recommendation from my colleague Kary, I just started reading I'm Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness by Austin Channing Brown, in which the author shares personal stories and explores \"the pitfalls that kill our attempts at racial justice.\" In August, my local librarian/educator book club will also be discussing Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism by Safiya Umoja Noble. The book invites readers to understand how racism is embedded into our favorite search engines.NINA:  I’ve bought a copy of There, There by Tommy Orange and am just waiting to get to it; too excited to read something set in my hometown of Oakland. Cover of There, There.Cover of Diary of a Reluctant Dreamer.SAM: I’m looking forward to Alberto Ledesma’s graphic memoir Diary of a Reluctant Dreamer.

Kendi (and if you want a preview, do listen to this event he did at the Schomburg Center for Research In Black Culture).  For fiction, I loved This Is Paradise: Stories by Kristiana Kahakauwila, which is a spellbinding collection of her short stories set on the islands of Hawai’i.Cover of Stamped from the Beginning.Cover of This is Paradise."},
{"title": "Ellen Oh Answers Your Questions", "date": "Monday, June 11, 2018", "text": "Ellen Oh is co-founder, President, and CEO of We Need Diverse Books (WNDB), a non-profit organization dedicated to increasing diversity in children’s literature. She is also a former adjunct college instructor and corporate/entertainment attorney. She is the author of the YA fantasy trilogy The Prophecy Series and the MG novel Spirit Hunters: Book 1. Spirit Hunters: Book 2 will be published Summer 2018.The following is a modified and supplemented version of several Facebook posts Ellen wrote last week.I am going to be blunt.  I am asking you not to get offended with what I have to say but to listen with an open mind and don't take anything personally. This is not personal to any one individual; it concerns the larger community.When We Need Diverse Books launched, I received heinous death threats and rape threats on such a continuous basis I had to shut down all social media for awhile.  At one point, I deleted my Twitter entirely and only came back because of the #whitewashedout movement.  I still get accused of promoting White genocide and I have been called the c-word so often it doesn't even faze me anymore (and it used to make me livid). I've had emails from people who clearly knew where I lived and made comments about my children; I had to skip ComicCon due to specific threats that made me very uncomfortable. And all of this, for something I do on a voluntary and uncompensated basis.And yet, here I am 4 years later still trying hard to teach people that diverse books are not a threat to anyone, but rather, that they make for a better world. So. Let’s talk about fear, confusion, and scarce opportunities that White writers have been complaining about. Let’s talk about how White writers are afraid of asking questions for fear of being labeled bad or racist.Asking questions is part of the growing process. Being afraid to look bad, or racist, because you asked a question--this doesn't even make sense to me. Just ask me, or any of us who have shown a willingness to discuss this issue. Yes, we are tired of constantly talking about the same thing, but we would much rather answer questions than deal with misrepresentations and hostility. And, so what if your question makes you feel bad, or you are embarrassed? If those uncomfortable feelings are the extent of the problem, who cares? People ask me questions all the time. I have never threatened them with death, rape, or attacked their children for existing. But threats have become a part of my life solely because I advocate for diversity in children's literature. So to me, your uncomfortable feelings stem from a place of privilege that I and other IPOC have never had the experience of, and will not experience, in our lifetime. And I know that it offends people when we point this out. But I would much rather be offended than deal with threats of violence.Let’s talk about the heart of the question. Do we want people to write diversely? Yes. We do. When you write your White main character stories, you should people those stories with lots of diversity that reflects the world around us. And that should be par for the course. Next question, should you write a main character who is an IPOC? The answer is: It depends. Will your story use a White lens to tell the story? Then NO. Will your story have a White savior theme to it? Then NO. Will your story exploit the pain of a marginalized culture to get you a paid writing gig? Then NO. Would your story be better told by a person writing from that marginalized community instead? All of these points are based on racism, colonialism, and the White lens and how it shapes the telling of IPOC stories. That's why when you do research to write your story, part of your research is to explore these very points to see if you even should tell the story. There are plenty of great writers who can write outside their lanes brilliantly. They don't ask these types of questions publicly, because they ALREADY know these issues, have already figured out if they can do the best job writing these stories, and then they just do it. And you know what? Sometimes even they will still get it wrong. But the difference is, they listen, they learn, and they do better.I have never ever said that White writers should never write about IPOC. And in fact in every talk, every event, every workshop I have ever given I always repeat the same advice to writers who want to write a story about IPOC:1. Do you need to tell this story?2. If you really feel you need to tell this story, then get it right!3. And be prepared for criticism if you don't.It is amazing to me that I'm so often attacked as some kind of militant diversity police officer stopping White writers from writing about IPOC. Here's the blogpost that gets me in trouble all the time.  I wrote it back when We Need Diverse Books first started, in response to a pattern of White writers calling diversity a \"hot trend\".  They were trying to leverage the sudden interest in diversity to help themselves get published. This problem continues today. The CCBC's data doesn’t lie: There’s been an increase in IPOC books published, but they are mostly by White writers. That was the main point of my blogpost, which is from February 2016. The last paragraph of my post is a paragraph of Don'ts pointing out how not to use diversity to get published. For all those who seem to think this post was telling White people not to ever write about IPOC, try reading it again. And you will see that for every don't, there is a do.Listen, I know criticism can hurt. My first book received reviews that said it read like a \"bad translation of a Shlocky Chinese book\".  Reviewers also said, “don't read Prophecy for good Asian Fantasy, read Eon or Stormdancer or Across the Nightingale Floor” etc.--all books by White writers. Some bloggers trashed my book so badly that I actually received emails from several bloggers telling me that although they liked my book, they were afraid to say so publicly for fear of being mocked by these more influential bloggers. This broke my heart but it didn't stop me from writing.  Receiving criticism--sometimes harsh--is not unique to White writers, but feeling entitled to no criticism--particularly criticism along racial lines--is unique to White writers.People get so mad at Debbie Reese for criticizing bad Native American representation. They say she is tearing down people who are allies. Why does it matter if they are an ally if they made a mistake? If I messed up, I would thank Debbie for tearing me a new one and teaching me to do better and in the process teaching everyone else. It hurts. Yes. But it isn't about you as the writer, it is about the kids reading the book. And DAMN IT in a world where a major football franchise refuses to give up its racist name, and public schools across the country won't recognize the racism of their mascots, we need Debbie to keep us accountable and to remind us of the pain of an entire community of people. So yes, ask questions. There are people who will answer them for you, if you just ask. And please don't get offended if we get cranky or short or if we aren't as nice or as polite as you would like us to be. Remember you are not the first, nor will you be the last, to ask us.-Allie Jane Bruce helped edit this post."},
{"title": "On Owning It", "date": "Monday, June 4, 2018", "text": "A few years ago, inthe early months of Reading While White, I wrote this post, about changing my mindabout a book. In it, I asked, “What am I giving up when I can admit somethingmay not be as wonderful as I originally thought?”Myanswer was nothing. And what I gain is greater understanding and insight.Something to carry with me moving forward, that I hope makes me better at thework I do. And better in the life I live.Fastforward to now. To the recent discussions that have taken place on social mediaabout critics and the “call-out culture” that devolved into a vulgar display ofwhite-centered thinking.AndI truly wonder: What are people so afraid of? What do they have to lose inlistening openly to what critics have to offer them when it comes torepresentation of lives and experiences beyond their own? To admitting thatthey might have things to learn.I’mnot naïve enough to think criticism doesn’t hurt. Of course it hurts. But doesthat mean people should stop criticizing?Shouldsocial justice activists silence themselves, too, because they might hurt thefeelings of police officers, or elected officials, or business owners or any ofus? Should Black Lives Matter only if those proclaiming it do so nicely? ShouldDACA activists, or those speaking out against refugee children being torn awayfrom their parents at our country’s borders, or the poisoning of tribal landsor the water in Flint, make sure they speak softly and kindly at every turn?Racismis racism, whether rooted in government policy, corporate greed, orwhite-centric views of the work we do; whether found on the streets, at ourborders, or in the pages of books for children and teens.Silencedoes not equal change. Discomfort unsettles complacency.  I’mnot an author or illustrator. Neither my livelihood nor my sense ofaccomplishment/ pride/ self depends on what I create. I’m sure it hurts. I'm sure it feels awful, or even scary. It might be infuriating, too. Own everything you feel. And then decide what you're going to do with those feelings.You can say you’re being censored, or silenced, and think of yourself thehero of your own story. Oryou can think about the children and teens audiences of the books you create—not just the reader you envision or the kids you know, but every child and teen. You can own that they're fragile, too. And that they're the point.You can think about about the need for change in the world in which we live—change that cannot andwill not happen if there aren’t those who can tell us from firsthand experience what is wrong with that world. Who is being hurt and how? Who is being left out, left behind, or boxed in?  And you can think about both the risk and the responsibility that is part of creative work, of sharing your talent, and then ask yourself how you can be and do better."},
{"title": "Contemporary Colorblind Racism & White Aggression", "date": "Thursday, May 31, 2018", "text": "There are many resources available that discuss the consequences of an ideology of racial colorblindness. Many White people in our industry, understanding that colorblindness is a damaging form of racism, have moved beyond “I don’t see color.” But we White people haven’t moved as far as we’d probably like to think. So how does colorblind racism in kidlit function today? To me, it looks like White people seeing and naming race, but refusing to acknowledge that race has meaning. For example, we White people have a vested interest in continuing to call for and champion books in which characters’ racial identities mean little or nothing (to us). Conversations and criticisms about what some refer to as “casual diversity” aren’t new, but I’ve seen them showing up more and more in conference sessions, book clubs, and other spaces in recent months. We need to ask ourselves: What is it about the idea of “casual diversity” that makes it so appealing to us White people? One look at the CCBC statistics shows the imbalance of power in kidlit, and the need for more stories expressing a range of genres, experiences, emotions, and characterizations. I am NOT saying that there is not a need for increasing books by and about POC and Native people about all sorts of experiences, including books about contemporary, “normal” kids. I am not saying that we shouldn’t listen to people speaking about their own marginalized racial identities and what types of books they would like to see or write more of and why (please let’s do that!). I am asking us White people to recognize that when we have a laser focus on “casual” racial diversity over other issues in kidlit, it takes on a layer of meaning given the overwhelming Whiteness of the industry. I am asking us to recognize that we have limits to our understanding of others' racial experiences and we also have the unearned privilege to define and regulate what is seen and perceived as “normal” or “casual” in the first place. And as fellow RWW contributor Megan Schliesman pointed out to me in a recent email about this post, when we White people categorize #OwnVoices books as “casual diversity,” we are erasing their cultural context whether we understand and see it or not. As Laura Jiménez recently wrote in this thoughtful post, kidlit has seen calls for more diverse representation answered with more White people publishing “random non-White, non-straight, disabled, non-neurotypical characters, as long as those characters are just like them. You know, ‘normal’, which is White code for ‘White, like me.’” In our White-dominated industry, racial diversity is sometimes reduced to picking a paint color or a character’s name. This is shallow, and it ignores the realities that people and characters with those marginalized identities live, see, experience, and endure. This way of thinking, publishing, and promoting literature devalues the concept of #OwnVoices and maintains White supremacy culture, spreading a flawed message that the world is experienced universally. Can writers from a dominant culture create characters from minoritized groups that “just happen to have” any oppressed identity? Nobody “just happens to be” a member of a racial group. Race has meaning in our world. Whiteness has meaning. Kidlit doesn’t just happen to be a “white space.” The Whiteness of the industry, just like White-controlled neighborhoods, schools, and institutions, is not an accident. (Note that even our assessments and norms for what “good art” is are rooted in centuries of White dominance that has largely gone unchallenged by other White people.)Contemporary colorblind racism also shows up when White people support the myth of meritocracy, the idea that White creators today have success because they have earned it as individuals with no added racial privilege, and that criticism—especially criticism from POC and Native women—is just sour grapes, oversensitivity, attention-seeking, or toxic bullying. The belief that calls for equity involve Native people and POC getting opportunities over \"better qualified\" White people is rooted in literal White supremacy; it assumes that White writers are superior or writing from an objective stance and that critiques against them aren’t the “right” way of thinking or acting. When we White people are afraid of the “D-Word” or attack, discredit, and mischaracterize the work and lived experiences of leader-scholars from marginalized groups, we are refusing to acknowledge the concrete forms of discrimination that have created the way our industry looks like and continues to function today. When White people say we want diversity but then complain about one’s right to publish books about characters outside of our experiences without criticism, often what we are saying is “I want diversity, but I don’t want equity. I still want the power. I am entitled to control.” When we White people complain about how hard it is to be White in today’s publishing landscape when only 7% of children’s books in that landscape are written by Black, Latinx, and Native creators...those feelings might be real, but they are not rooted in reality (and as the saying goes: “When you’re accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression”).Whether we White people are miscategorizing criticism against us or trying to control narratives for change, we are refusing to engage. We are refusing to believe. We are refusing to listen. We are refusing to learn. This is where our racial colorblindness and where all of our predictable behaviors of White fragility or White aggression show up. It is willful ignorance and it is incompetence. It is power hoarding and it is aggression. It is racism. Unless we are working on understanding that and working to build the stamina to own it and and try to push against it when we see it in others as well as in ourselves, we are supporting it.."},
{"title": "Andrea Davis Pinkney’s Challenge: A Letter", "date": "Tuesday, May 15, 2018", "text": "This past March I attended the 2018 Butler Lecture given by Andrea Davis Pinkney at Dominican University. Titled “Behold the Road,” Pinkney’s immersive presentation was an acknowledgment and celebration of the past, present, and future leaders of the world of children’s literature (and the wider world too).  It was also a call to action for those involved in teaching, libraries, and #kidlit today.Pinkney shared that “we are the ones” who build society through books, who can debunk myths, and “dream the impossible.” She spoke of the serious responsibility for those of us who work with young people, explaining how we also “shut doors on dreams without knowing it.” She challenged the audience to consider the year 2040: Who will the leaders be? What will they say? What will they remember? “The thought leaders of tomorrow are counting on us.”Reminding the audience that “Children see what they see. They see what they don’t see,” Pinkney also reflected on past and present conversations around racial equity and inclusion, and challenged those in the audience to write a “Dear Diversity” letter. The idea is to write a letter to Diversity like you would write a journal entry, or speak with someone whom you really trust. After you’ve written it, read the letter. Then, because “it all comes down to the doing,” make a promise. Commit to three goals, and write these down too. Seal the letter, address it, stamp it, and mail it to yourself in a year. See if you fulfilled your promise. Ask yourself, “Am I walking the walk?\"The self-addressed stamp envelope currently in my home office.It is easy for White people like me to deepen our understandings and gain knowledge about systemic oppression and keep it as an intellectual exercise. Learning is an important, necessary step, but it is not always action. Bridging this gap (between what I think/say/learn and what I do) is something I’ve been working on, so after I got home from the Butler Lecture, I followed Pinkney’s advice and wrote a letter. I read it and thought it over, and my goals became clear. Having a self-addressed stamped envelope sitting in your home office so that you can send it to yourself in a year is an analog version of Facebook’s “On this day” memory function (but more intentional). This letter might not be high tech, but I know I learned a lot from the process of writing it, reflecting on it, and organizing my thoughts to form goals. I invite you all to take Andrea Davis Pinkney’s challenge and write your own letter. What ideas show up for you? What goals are standing out? What actions are you committed to taking? I’d love to learn more and connect with those of you who wish to share in the comments.I’m going to follow Pinkney’s directions by not sharing the totality of my letter with anyone but me, but I would like to share my goals and some of the reminders to myself that my letter led me to have here:Pay for it. Or, as my friend Jen says, “support what you want to see in the world.” I can easily not spend my own money on books and other materials due to my proximity to libraries. But I am committed to putting my personal money where my mouth is and financially backing people, books, and ideas that make change. DonorsChoose, Patreon, and fundraising are all part of this. (I’m going to keep a Google spreadsheet so that I can track this type of spending.) People of color and Native people are often not given fair funding compared to their White (especially White cis male) colleagues when guest speaking or submitting work for publication, even for the same events and organizations. If I am ever on the planning end of a workshop, article, or conference presentation, I will demand transparency and equity in the budgeting process. I can’t always afford to spend money, but where I am limited on funds I might be able to give something else, like time.Ask more proactive questions. I am going to work on strengthening a habit of getting as much information as possible before I make decisions. This means doing more research before selecting a book. It also means not making assumptions about who is invited to speak or participate in conferences, workshops, or professional opportunities. If I don’t ask specific, intentional questions, I am likely participating in creating or supporting homogeneous committees, panel line-ups, or promoting books or ideas that don’t match my (and my profession’s) values. Part of this work also demands that I reflect on and check how much space I and my fellow White people are controlling or taking up, and working to put my energies into supporting and centering voices from people of color and Native people. If, for example, I’m gathering information before participating in professional development opportunities, the organizers’ responses to my questions will help me make better informed decisions--and I do not have to say “yes.” In some cases, passing on an opportunity and explaining why can interrupt unconscious behaviors and increase awareness and mindfulness in the future.Don’t work alone. Justice work is community work, and there are unique tensions that come into play for me as a White person trying to understand and dismantle racism. I am reminded of Paul Gorski’s research that shows White racial justice activists as a major source of burnout for activists of color, and all of the different ways that well-meaning White people working against racism unconsciously support the racism they are trying to fight against (by taking credit for or undermining work from others in the community, softening honest messages from “justice” to “harmony,” hogging the mic, backbiting, shushing, centering themselves, etc.). Gorski’s research suggests that White people wanting to fight racism increase their awareness, but also learn to serve: to improve at following directions versus taking the lead. Even if doing seemingly solo work, like posting on social media or writing a blog post, I will look for and embrace the feedback that my community connections afford. That means working to recognize my limitations; to acknowledge the intersections of oppressions (h/t Kimberlé Crenshaw); and to let those with more expertise and experience truly lead, stepping in and stepping back as they deem necessary. This type of collaboration and communication means more conversations, and that does take more time. It is worth it."},
{"title": "Bring It Back!: I Look Like a Girl", "date": "Wednesday, March 7, 2018", "text": "Hamanaka, Sheila. I Look Like a Girl. William Morrow and Company, 1999. ISBN: 9780688146252“I look like a girl, // but I’m really a tiger, / with a rumble, a roar, and a leap! // I look like a girl, / but I’m really a dolphin, / with a / spin and a splash / in the sea.”  So begins Sheila Hamanaka’s poetic, mesmerizing, and sadly, out-of-print I Look Like a Girl.  Four children, whose skin and hair range from light to dark, reveal that appearances can deceive; someone who looks like a girl may actually be a condor, mustang, wolf, or jaguar.A pattern emerges early in the book.  “I look like a girl,” the child declares; the page turn that follows reveals the animal behind the facade.  Both fantastical and physical, fierce and playful, the painterly illustrations leap off the page and into the reader’s imagination.  The accessible yet exquisite poetry packs a punch, too: “Throw out those glass slippers. / Send the fairies to sleep. / No prince is waiting for me. // For if you look twice, / past the sugar and spice, // the eyes of a tiger / you’ll see.”While it makes no explicit references to trans or nonbinary children, the underlying messages may resonate with some. Appearances mean nothing; labels are faulty; what’s important is in a child’s heart. Once, after I read this aloud to 3rd graders, a child said: “Wait, I’m confused. Is that kid a girl?” Another child immediately responded, “The point is it doesn’t matter, just BE WHO YOU ARE.” (To read more about how I use this book with kids, click here).During the past few months of #MeToo, particularly the moments in which the world of children’s literature has grappled with sexual harassment and abuse in our ranks, I’ve often thought of I Look Like a Girl.  I’ve seen kids respond to it with everything from fist pumps and “YES”es to soft sighs of relief that someone gets it, a reaction I share.  As stories of sexist mistreatment, manipulation, and worse arise, we need to balance them with stories that affirm, empower, and provide safe haven.  At its simplest, I Look Like a Girl is an exquisitely written, dynamically illustrated poem. At its most powerful, it reaches across time and space to let children know that they are unique but not alone.William Morrow, the book’s original publisher, is now an imprint of HarperCollins.

{"title": "Reviewing While White: Laura Ingalls is Ruining My Life by Shelley Tougas", "date": "Sunday, January 21, 2018", "text": "Laura Ingalls is Ruining My Life, by Shelley Tougas.  Roaring Brook Press.Reviewed by Allie Jane Bruce.NB - I read, and use page numbers from, a galley of this book.It was with trepidation that I picked up Laura Ingalls is Ruining My Life.  My feelings about the Little House series are overwhelmingly negative.  The more I read analyses of race and racism in these books (for a start on this subject, check out this and this), the more I think this one needs to go the way of the dodo.  To be fair, I never liked the books (they just were never my cup of tea, even when I was a kid) so I’m not battling any nostalgia or fondness, as many of my colleagues are when reflecting on these books or contemplating letting them go.  As I read the description of Laura Ingalls is Ruining My Life, I wondered: Is this an homage to the Little House books?  Or is it critical?  I then tried to let go of any questions or expectations, and as much as I possibly could, approach the book with a blank slate (although I did bring what I know about history and critical race theory, as I bring those to everything).White, 12-year-old Charlotte is one of three siblings; her single mother, whose irresponsible nature and love of talking about “creative energy” frustrate and irritate Charlotte, moves them from place to place in search of inspiration and a “spark” that will finally make her a successful writer.  Of all the places they’ve lived, Charlotte hates Walnut Grove, a home of Little House writer Laura Ingalls, the most.  Her twin brother, with whom she’s always shared borderline-psychic superpowers, drifts from her and reinvents himself as a popular kid.  Unable or unwilling to make friends herself, Charlotte pretends to need remedial help with her schoolwork so that she can spend lunchtime in the classroom with her teacher.  Undeceived, her wise teacher assigns her a series of essays about the real history of Walnut Grove, Manifest Destiny, and the ways that Westward Expansion (which I call Westward Invasion… but we’ll get there…) impacted the people and environment around them.  As Charlotte reads and learns (she reads a new essay, and learns something new, every 30 or 40 pages, a device I found contrived and clunky), she gradually settles in and starts to make friends; but just when things are looking up for her, Mom falters and decides it’s time to move again.  This accessible, digestible middle-grade realistic fiction will delight some; cynical and unromantic, Charlotte is a memorable and captivating personality.  Some readers will also hail it as a nuanced, progressive look at the Little House series; nevertheless, as I argue, it ultimately fails to actually interrogate the racism and problems in the Little House series--instead, it makes a pretense at interrogating them.  The book therefore serves to evolve, rather than interrupt, racism; and it does so in the guise of interrupting racism.For my close reading of the book, and my argument and conclusions about how it evolves racism, visit my guest post at American Indians In Children’s Literature. There, I argue that Laura Ingalls is Ruining My Life is the next generation of racism.  Watch closely, especially if you’re White; racism is evolving before our very eyes."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: Tinyville Town: I’m a Police Officer", "date": "Thursday, January 11, 2018", "text": "Cover of Tinyville Town: I'm a Police Officerby Brian Biggs.Board books are often one of children’s first experiences with literature. Young people chew them, cuddle with them, and yes, read them. They serve as an introduction to what many caregivers hope will be a lifetime of reading. They help children make sense of the world. Creating successful board books is no easy task given their limited format, length, and broad audience (they must be enjoyed by children and, at minimum, tolerable to adults, even upon their thousandth re-read). This challenge increases when a book is about a complex topic about which audiences will have varied opinions and experiences.I thought of this challenge when I first saw Tinyville Town: I’m a Police Officer, written and illustrated by Brian Biggs. I also thought about Amy Martin’s post, “Rethinking Books about Police” and the police book evaluation toolkit created by the Oakland Public Library. A book about a police officer for young readers is an ambitious topic, especially considering the racism, mass incarceration, and police violence in our world. In its Kirkus review, this book is described as “A worthy introduction to the concept of police officers,” so I was interested to see how this book might follow the pattern of the other Tinyville Town books (such as I’m a Librarian) while also setting itself apart. The police officer and town residents discovera monkey eating bananas and donuts.The book opens with a Black police officer and her cat, waking up and heading out for their day. Her fellow officers have different skin tones, as do the people in their community of Tinyville Town. The officer is shown rescuing a cat from a tree and making sure a girl doesn’t slip on a banana peel. When the bakery and grocery store are robbed, she searches for the culprit: “Big ears. Long tail. Likes bananas and donuts.” As she follows the clues (and readers recall a White, bearded zookeeper putting “missing” posters up throughout the book), the “perpetrator” (not “suspect”) is shown having a picnic. The robber—a monkey—smiles wide as the White zookeeper pulls it away (off the page, presumably back to the zoo). The officer heads back home for a good night’s sleep.The monkey character smiles and waves goodbyeto the police officer as it is taken away.I am deeply troubled by the perpetrator in this book being a monkey. The police force kills a disproportionate number of Black people in this country, and there is a racist history of comparing Black people to monkeys (as explained by Wulf Hund and Charles Mills here). I’m sure some readers will say that I’m reading too much into this—that an animal is just an animal. But of all the non-human characters from which one could choose, it is a monkey, and it is important to remember that monkeys have been used throughout history to dehumanize Black people and justify genocide. Conversations continue today about this type of imagery, as seen this week when the clothing company H&M apologized for posting a photo of a young Black model in a hooded sweatshirt with the words “Coolest Monkey in the Jungle.\" Furthermore, for the suspect to return to the zoo sends a message to readers that those stopped by police are brought to places where they belong. Right now New Jersey prisons are trying to ban Michelle Alexander’s The New Jim Crow, and schools in Texas are trying to prevent students from reading The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas. These stories and messages do not exist in a vacuum, and neither does this book.I am sure that the team that worked on this book did not intend to have those connections drawn. The “messy thief” monkey is in the book all the same. I do not believe one book has to do everything, nor do I think I can predict how every reader will react to every text (consciously or unconsciously). Some readers aren’t even speaking, so I’ll never know exactly what they are thinking in the moment. But just because readers don’t express their feelings through speech doesn’t mean that they aren’t paying attention and growing in understanding of their surroundings, their literature, and themselves. They’re taking it all in. What messages are we endorsing as they do so? -Elisa GallSaveSaveSaveSave"},
{"title": "Rethinking Books about Police: Putting OPL's New Toolkit to Work", "date": "Monday, January 8, 2018", "text": "Amy Martin is the Children's Collection Management Librarian at the Oakland Public Library in California, and has worked as a children's librarian in Oakland, San Francisco, and Chicago. All views expressed are her own, and do not reflect those of her employer.Let’stalk about police books for children.WhenI worked as a branch children’s librarian in East Oakland, I had preschoolteachers ask me for books on community helpers--firefighters, postal workers,teachers, police. I handed over the early nonfiction titles we had on police,even as something pinged in my brain telling me I wasn’t giving them the rightinformation. Iam White and grew up in a middle class suburb, and with the exception of havingbeen detained without cause during a protest, I have not experienced a threatto my safety or civil rights at the hands of police. I have a vivid image ofthe one time my family called police to our home in my childhood: we had comehome and found a door slightly open, and an officer came to check the house forus. He arrived within minutes of our call and greeted us politely. After confirmingthat no one was in our house and nothing was missing, he left without incident.Thebooks about police in my library’s collection matched my experience. However,they did not match the experience of everyone in our community. For example,the patron who told me quite cheerfully one morning that she and her fourchildren had been pulled from their beds by police in the early morning andmade to kneel against a wall for hours while officers searched their buildingfor a suspect. The books in my library did not match the experience of thechildren I met who’d had parents arrested, or stopped or searched withoutcause, or had loved ones brutalized. Itwas after the murder of Philando Castile that it clicked for me: we were notseeing the experiences many people of color have with police in children’sbooks, and something was wrong with that. Are we doing children adisservice when every book we provide about police says they only protect,never harm, when it is possible to watch police officers harming unarmed peopleon video? Where is the book for the four-year-old daughter of Diamond Reynolds,Castile’s girlfriend, who was sitting behind him in the car while he waskilled? Or the book for a child in need of reassurance after hearing about apolice killing?Mycolleagues at Oakland Public Library (OPL) and I began a conversation thatmonth that eventually led to Evaluating Children’s Books about Police: a toolkit forlibrarians and other evaluators of children’s literature. Almost a year in themaking, it grew from shared observations of working with children and talkingwith them about police. We took extensive notes on the books in our collections.We talked about what was missing. We reviewed our work with community members,activists, and an officer from the Oakland Police Department.Wedeveloped the toolkit as a professional book evaluation tool. The guidingquestions it offers can certainly be used to evaluate nonfiction “communityhelper” books, but they can also be used with picture books and fiction. As anexample, I’ll use a book that, at first glance, may seem an unlikely suspect: I’M AFRAID YOUR TEDDY IS IN TROUBLE TODAY, by Jancee Dunn,illustrated by Scott Nash.Thetitle page of TEDDY shows a lone police car in front of a house. Thestory opens with two police officers in front of the closed front door,addressing the reader directly. A brown-skinned officer with feminine featureshas arms crossed, while the white-skinned male-appearing partner stands withfists on hips. (The officers’ genders are never stated, so I will use the singular “they” pronoun to refer to both.) Both wear angry expressions.“Oh good. You’re home,” the brown-skinned officer says, then introducesthemself as “Officer Hardy,” who goes on to say  that the police station“received a number of calls,” and that they’re “afraid your teddy got in alittle trouble today.” Onthe following page, as they open the door, Officer Hardy warns the reader to“prepare yourself. It’s not a pretty scene.” Balloons and streamers are nowvisible both inside and outside the house. On the pages that follow, OfficerHardy details the (lighthearted) destruction that has been wrought on thereader’s home by their teddy bear, who invited other stuffed animals over for awild party: pancakes and sprinkles everywhere, a broken bed, crayon drawings onthe walls, and chocolate syrup in the bathtub. A page with four angry human facesshouting into phones states that “your neighbors” were “not happy. Not happy atall,” indicating that neighbors called the police with noise complaints whenthe stuffed animals started playing loud music and dancing. OfficerHardy states that police pursued the fleeing stuffed animals, “searching houseto house,” eventually catching them all with the help of the Fire Department.They then reveal all the stuffed animals confined in a closet. Teddyis then singled out, with the next illustration showing Teddy standing alonebetween the two officers, both of whom look angry, rubbing his paws togetherwith a worried facial expression. Officer Hardy points at Teddy as they ask himto “Come with me, please. I’m going to have to take you down to the station.”All three appear against a white background, removing them from the immediatesetting of the story. Inthree illustrations across the two following pages, Officer Hardy shrinks to achild’s size, their expression shifting from stern to delighted as they commentthat “I used to have a teddy bear once. He looked a lot like you. Gosh, Ihaven’t thought about him in years.” On the following page, Officer Hardy bendsdown to Teddy’s level and places a hand on Teddy’s shoulder. Wearing a friendlyexpression, they inform Teddy that “this time I’m going to let you go.” Theofficers then assist all the other stuffed animals into their squad car, saying“I’ll drop you all off at home.” On the final page, Teddy smiles and winksunderneath a gentle admonishment to “be good, now.” The lit cell phone inTeddy’s paw, along with his mischievous expression, hint that Teddy does notnecessarily plan to heed this recommendation.Withthat long summary complete, I’ll turn now to Evaluating Children’s Books about Police, and demonstrate someways an evaluator of children’s books might use this tool to examine TEDDY.Theevaluative content of this toolkit is arranged in two sets of bullet points:“What could an inclusive perspective look like?” and “Questions to considerwhen evaluating a police book for bias.” In thefirst section, we imagined what elements--words, images, concepts--we didn’tnecessarily find in the existing body of literature that might acknowledgeyoung readers who feel discomfort or negativity around police officers. Inthe second section, we focused on problematic elements of existing books thatseemed to pop up over and over again (I have a spreadsheet of occurrences ofthese problematic elements, if numbers are your thing). I’ll talk through theelements in each section that stand out to me in reading TEDDY.Does     this book acknowledge the feelings of fear and anxiety children may have     on seeing police? For example: \"sometimes, if you see a police     officer, you may feel scared.\" Does     this book acknowledge that some people have negative experiences with     police officers? If so, is there any discussion of how these experiences     might impact a person, family, or community?TEDDY is a picture book aboutstuffed animals coming to life and having a wild party. The emotional core ofthe story is in the tension that exists between smiling stuffed animals playingwith balloons and sledding down couch cushions and stern, angry adult humans,primarily two uniformed police officers, dealing with the resulting mess; theresolution comes from those officers relenting and deciding not to pursuepunishment for the toys. The overall tone of the narrative is tongue-in-cheek;the fun of Teddy’s party contrasts with the sharp law enforcement cadence OfficerHardy uses to describe it: “We don’t know for sure who thought of the chocolatesauce, but we suspect it was the cow.” Haveyou seen those videos of police officers pulling over people of color who havenot committed any traffic violation, then surprising them by handing them icecream? This article in The Root by Preston Mitchumdescribes how these videos get shared on social networks as moments of joy, forthe “fun” of seeing people’s fearful expressions turn to laughter and reliefwhen they realize they are the subjects of a prank intended in lighthearted funby its perpetrators. The police department of Halifax, Virginia executed theice-cream stunt twenty times on a Friday in summer 2016 as a PR move, believingthat videos of people of color laughing and accepting ice cream from abenevolent white officer would generate good feelings toward their department.Mitchum’s article points out that what looks like happiness on the part of thedrivers is actually “That relief every time we interact with police officersbecause we never know if we will leave that interaction alive.” Ijeoma Oluo takes this one step further in The Establishment,likening the videos to an abusive partner hinting that they might hurt you,only to say it was a joke; the relief in this sudden revocation of a threat ismeant to create loyalty in the victimized partner.Thereis generally nothing amusing or cute about arriving at one’s home and seeing apolice car parked outside, or uniformed and frowning officers blocking theresident from entering their home. The decision to open TEDDY with bothof these images introduces the central problem with the book, similar to theproblem with the ice cream videos: ice cream pull-overs are cute and happy toviewers who’ve never felt their lives were in danger during a traffic stop. Theworst they’ve escaped is the minor annoyance of a traffic ticket, not thephysical danger of being shot. TEDDY is meant to be funny andcharming, but this book is only funny and charming if you do not believe thereis any inherent danger in police being in your home. Coulda child who has had a frightening encounter with a police officer at home, orwho’s heard about or been warned about such encounters by family or friends,enjoy this book? Could any person who has had a negative police encounter readthis book and see it as funny? The lack of respect for readers who share theseexperiences amounts to a flat denial of “the feelings of and anxiety childrenmay have on seeing police.”Do this     book's illustrations show diversity in race, sex, age, gender expression,     and religious identity among police, as well as people with whom they     interact? Thereare two officers in TEDDY. Officer Hardy, who delivers the entire textof the book, reads visually as African American. In my research leading to Evaluating,it was common for a children’s book about police to feature a person of colorin a primary role. Creators of these books seem to have gotten the message thatit’s racist to show only people of color as suspects and white people as policeofficers, and it’s actually rather difficult to find one that features onlywhite officers. The Kirkus Review for TEDDY noted that “investigatingofficer Hardy is a black woman and her subordinate a white man, in anespecially nice touch,” but I’d argue that it’s an expectation in acontemporary children’s book, if an unspoken one.The illustrator seems to avoid questions about race insupporting characters because they are mostly stuffed animals. It’s worthnoting, though, that the one human doll among the toys is white with blondhair, and Teddy himself is a light golden-tan in color. Regardless of why theillustrator made this choice, the fact remains that children see a bear withlight not dark fur who is spared a trip to the police station.Does     this book explain the rights children have in interacting with police--for     example, that children may ask to have a parent or other adult present     during questioning?Thetext of this book is in second person, directed to the child reader of thebook. There’s no indication as to whether an adult resident of the home is alsopresent. A throwaway line such as “I see you’ve got your grown-up with you”could have placed an adult on the child’s side in the interaction. There’s nomention of the fact that a child has the right to ask for a parent or guardianto be present during questioning by police. If this is a child alone, as thetext implies, then the book is modeling that it is safe and normal for policeofficers to question a child alone without asking if they would like a parentpresent.Does     this book acknowledge that some people choose to call the police and some     people do not?  Does it acknowledge the perspective that calling     police is not the only way or right way to get help? Policein this story were called by “neighbors,” all of who appear angry, toinvestigate a loud party. Noise complaint calls are an example of “quality of life policing,” or what’s morecommonly known as “broken windows policing.” Creators of Campaign Zero describe how “brokenwindows policing has led to the criminalization and over-policing ofcommunities of color and excessive force in otherwise harmless situations. In other words:police calls for issues such as excessive noise tend to inversely impact peopleof color, and benefit White people. In fact, writers like Nikole Hannah-Joneshave argued that the act of calling police is, itself, primarily available towhite people,since people of color are disproportionately at risk of being harmed or killedafter police are summoned, even if they are the ones who make the call.Ofthe four neighbors depicted making angry calls to police in TEDDY, twoappear white, one is racially ambiguous (light skin and dark hair), and one haslight brown skin. The artist appears to have made an effort not to show fourwhite people calling police with noise complaints, but in this case the attemptto show diversity begs the question: Is this realistic?In many     communities, police officers are required to wear body cameras on their     uniforms. Do this book's illustrations depict body cameras on police     uniforms?InOakland, police are required to wear body cameras, which, as Campaign Zero notes, have been shown to be an effective toolfor capturing instances of police brutality. In fact, California is one of five states with laws requiring policeofficers to wear body cameras (in a couple states, only under certainconditions). Other states have laws about how body cameras are to be funded ordocumented in public record, for a total of thirty-four states with some formof legislation on the books about body cameras for police. Although theofficers in TEDDY are drawn with enough detail to show they have badges,radios, batons (no guns), disabling chemical sprays, and notebooks, they do nothave visible body cameras.NowI’ll move  to the second section of Evaluating:How     does the author of this book refer to people being pursued by police? Many     children's books refer to people being pursued with language implying     guilt, such as \"criminals\" or \"bad guys.\" However, US     laws protecting due process render such terms inaccurate, as people being     chased by police have not been proven guilty in a court of law. People     being pursued or arrested are suspects.Thisimplication of guilt and “badness” comes up so often in children’s police booksthat its absence in TEDDY is actually what is noteworthy. In 2016, whenOPL children’s librarians began our research, every single police book Ireviewed contained language implying guilt used inappropriately: booksconsistently described police as pursuing and arresting “bad guys” or“criminals.” One of the first points contributed to our toolkit by a children’slibrarian was that “People being pursued or arrested are suspects,” andit is inaccurate to call them a bad guy or criminal. There’s no such use ofthis language in TEDDY, which is consistent with the fact that allescape punishment in the end.Does     this book depict violations of civil rights in how police treat civilians     without acknowledging them as violations? You can read about people's     rights when interacting with police in the ACLU document Know Your Rights: What to do     if you're stopped by police, immigration agents or the FBI. If this book depicts a parental arrest, are     procedures for ensuring the child's safety depicted as well? If not, is     that discussed? Children have special rights in the event of a parent or     caregiver's arrest or incarceration, and local police departments may have     their own policies and procedures on protecting children when a parent is arrested.     You can learn more in the Bill of Rights developed by     San Francisco Children of Incarcerated Parents Partnership, and     the paper Safeguarding Children of     Arrested Parents by the International Association of Chiefs of     Police. I’vealready discussed the book’s failure to indicate the presence of an adult.Though Teddy is (presumably) not a parent and is ultimately not arrested, it’s worthnoting that a great body of literature exists around parental arrests andoptimal procedures for ensuring the safety of affected children, including thetwo resources linked above. What’s visible in the work that exists aroundparental arrest points to this indisputable fact: it is traumatic for a childto witness the arrest of a parent, guardian, family member, or friend. In thecase of a parent, it’s so traumatic that a common recommendation is for thearresting officers to ask the parent if they would like their child to be caredfor in another room during the arrest. Itcan be assumed that a child’s teddy bear is a close companion, in a familialrole. The moment in which Officer Hardy informs Teddy that they will be broughtto the police station is not a depiction of arrest, but it is not far off.Furthermore, the illustrations then imply Officer Hardy changes their mindbased on the fact that Teddy reminds them of their own childhood teddy bear.While this makes for a happier ending, with Teddy released rather than led awayin handcuffs, it also suggests that either Teddy was going to be detained forfrivolous reasons, or that the officer has given preferential treatment to asuspect based on a personal connection. I’llnote that Evaluating is pointedly not a bibliography. Any list of titleswe might have produced would be outdated as soon as it was published andrequire constant maintenance to stay relevant. We definitely found books thattempted us to recommend them to everyone, but to be practical, the children’slibrarians who collaborated on this toolkit chose to focus on empoweringlibrarians to evaluate police books for children themselves. TEDDYreceivedthree reviews in professional journals: Kirkus and Publishers Weekly in July, and School Library Journalin October. None mention any of the problems I’ve discussed. PublishersWeekly states that “readerswill revel in the vicarious, rule-breaking fun.” School Library Journalcalls it a “humorous tale of stuffed animal mayhem that will entertain earlyelementary students and provide a fun read-aloud for younger children.” Kirkusnotes the intended humor of the story while saying it could have been stronger,ultimately calling it a “fair if somewhatephemeral story.” Oakland Public Library might have purchased TEDDY as aread-aloud based on these reviews; fortunately, I was sent a review copy anddiscovered the problematic elements;  selectors chose not to buy it withthis additional information. The fact that all three professional reviews of TEDDYmissed the problematic police content assures me that now is the right time forEvaluating Children’s Books about Police.It’s somewhat more accepted today among children’s book reviewers that race,class, and privilege must be considered in evaluating children’s books;however, racism in police-community relations did not occur to any of thereviewers for TEDDY as something critical to consider and as importantto mention as skin tone. In releasing this toolkit, OPL hopes to bringawareness to the need for sensitivity toward varying experiences of police inchildren’s books. We welcome feedback and consider Evaluating a livingdocument, open for review and conversation."},

{"title": "Reading Stories, Reading Lives", "date": "Monday, November 13, 2017", "text": "Over the summer I read a New Yorker article about the paintings of British-Ghanian artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye (“A Bird of Few Words,” June 19, 2017). In it, Zadie Smith discusses the response of critics to Yiadom-Boakye’s work, including the commentary of Robert Storr in the catalogue accompanying the exhibit of Yiadom-Baokye’s work at the New Museum in New York. She quotes Storr as follows:“The impact of her [Yiadom-Baokye’s] pictures is of encountering people ‘we’—the general North American art audience—have never met, coming from a world with which ‘we’ are unfamiliar. One that we have no basis for generalizing about or projecting our fantasies onto.’”In responding to Storr’s commentary, Zadie Smith writes: “There is a respectful caution in this kind of critique which, though undoubtedly well intended in theory, in practice throws a patronizing chill over such work. Yiadom-Boakye is doing more than exploring the supposedly uncharted territory of black selfhood, making—in that hackneyed phrase—the invisible visible. (Black selfhood has always existed and is not invisible to black people.)”As I read these words they struck me deeply, because it resonated with a lot of what I’ve been thinking about, and trying to articulate, in terms of children’s and young adult literature criticism.“Black selfhood has always existed and is not invisible to black people.”Of course the same is true for any group of people historically marginalized and dehumanized by the mainstream narrative: their selfhood has never been in doubt--except by those of us (read mainstream society if you must, read White critics and readers if you’re feeling less threatened and more courageous about looking our profession and ourselves in the eye) who, in reading a work by an African American author or Mexican American author or Korean American author or Choctaw author, try to fit into the framework we’ve constructed to understand their experience, rather than letting the experience and selfhood that exists on the page—and in the real world—speak for itself.There’s a genuine tension here, I know. Isn’t the whole point of being a critic to say what we think about the book? How can we do our jobs if we don’t?Well, to begin with, we can ask ourselves what we should constantly be asking ourselves: What assumptions are we making about the lives of people of color and from First/Native Nations in the real world that influence our response to the book?And what assumptions are we making about readers—is our idea of audience expansive and inclusive? “Black selfhood has always existed and is not invisible to black people.”Writers who are cultural insiders understand this innately and it shows in their writing. Critics/reviewers who are cultural insiders know it, too. And so, of course, do readers who see dimensions of their own experiences and identities fully realized on the page.Sometimes, though, I think the rest of us don’t take this selfhood on faith. So we look for clues, and we don’t always see them, even when they’re right in front of us, in characters who laugh and cry and argue and make amends and annoy and get annoyed and have quirks and contradictions in the way every living, breathing human does. Instead we see the struggle. Or the violence. Or the streets. Or the outsider. I worry we see the context but not the characters and by extension the lives those characters represent, or we do see them and they are held up as something exceptional. Either way, they are othered.  Perhaps this is also why we have too often admired inaccurate books by writers who are outside an experience--they fit our perceptions of that experience but not the reality.“Patronizing chill,” to quote Smith, is a real danger in our field, too. Because publishing for children and teens has always to some extent responded to the world as it is (along with imagining the world that we want), it’s not surprising that we’re seeing a number of books in which racism and police violence plays a role or is a theme. The high profile cases in the news in recent years, and the Black Lives Matter movement in response, have raised our social consciousness. And by “our,” I mean mainstream society’s, and I mean White people’s. Because racist police violence targeting Black and brown-skinned people, if I can use  Zadie Smith’s words in a different context,  “has always existed and is not invisible to Black people.” All American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely has become a deservedly popular choice for all-school reads.The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas topped The New York Times bestseller list for months. A number of other books exploring and reflecting dimensions of police violence against Black and brown-skinned people are also coming out this year. It seems we (read those of us who aren’t Black and brown-skinned) are finally seeing what has been visible and known but went unseen by us for for decades. (Remember the ending of If You Come Softly by Jacqueline Woodson, published way back in 1998?)  The new graphic novel I Am Alfonso Jones, written by Tony Medina and illustrated by Stacey Robinson and John Jennings, offers a more expansive look at this painful history too many of us haven’t seen. We need to own our ignorance. But we also need to be careful how we use our newfound understanding.I haven’t read all of the new books out this year addressing or even touching on this reality of  life in our country. I have read some of them, and one of the things I’m aware of is not wanting to fall into the trap of easily summarizing them as being  “about” police violence or racism. Once they get into readers’ hands, I believe a deeper truth becomes obvious: what they are about is people’s lives. The ones I have read, anyway, are about contemporary teens laughing and crying and arguing and annoying and being annoyed. They’re about kids trying to figure things out, and what those things are changes from book to book, character to character, life to life. But all of it--the living, the learning--ends up being violently disrupted by the reality of racist violence. For me, this is not a subtle difference, because these stories--these characters’ lives--don’t matter because of the violence that happens in them. They simply matter.Here’s something else I think we who are White librarians and teachers need to also keep in mind: What message are we sending to children and teens if the only books we ask or demand White kids read about children of color or from First/Native Nations speak to the violent disruption of their lives? It’s wonderful seeing All American Boys as an all-school read. It’s wonderful seeing The Hate U Give being so widely talked about and shared. But please, let’s not stop there. Black selfhood is complex in both those stories, but no single book is ever enough, however important the story it tells of and to the world we live in. In her novel Piecing Me Together, Renée Watson’s main character, Jade, is an African American scholarship student from a poor neighborhood in Portland, Oregon, attending a predominantly White private high school. After Jade is chosen by her guidance counselor to be part of a mentoring program, she is paired with an upper middle class African American alum of the school. Jade did not ask to be part of the mentoring program, it’s just assumed she’ll find it useful. Then Jade is NOT chosen to participate in an international volunteer trip her school sponsors, despite having tutored some of the students chosen to go. The volunteer program is the reason Jade was willing to leave her neighborhood high school and make the long bus trip every day. When she asks her teacher why she wasn’t chosen, he explains it’s because she has already been given the opportunity to participate in the mentoring program. Why, she challenges--her teacher, her guidance counselor, her mentor--does everyone assume that because she's young and Black and poor she only needs help, and \"opportunities,\" but has nothing to offer, anything to give? Jade’s story is no less important for White readers than All American Boys, or The Hate U Give, or The Boy in the Black Suit by Jason Reynolds, or Brown Girl Dreaming by Jacqueline Woodson. These and other works--by Jason Reynolds and Jacqueline Woodson, by Renée Watson and Nikki Grimes and Rita Williams-Garcia and Varian Johnson and Walter Dean Myers and Virginia Hamilton and so many other Black authors, and other writers of color and from First/Native Nations--need to be shared widely.Yes, many of us all say that all the time. But how do we act on it? And in what way are  assumptions we make about or labels we attach to books, and readers, and the lives of children and teens, getting in our way?Sharing stories is powerful. We all believe that or we wouldn’t be doing the work we do. And we absolutely need to be intentional about diversity in selecting and in reading, but we also need to give readers diverse stories without limiting either the stories or the readers by labels of our own making. Beauty and pain, joy and challenge, humor and heartache, injustice and kindness. None of these things is mutually exclusive in selfhood, in stories, or the lives of children and teens.Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "RWW Interviews: Sarah Park Dahlen", "date": "Wednesday, November 8, 2017", "text": "Our RWW Interviews series continues today with a conversation between Sam Bloom and Sarah Park Dahlen. Sarah  is an associate professor in the Master of Library and Information Science Program at St. Catherine University and an advocate for diverse books for youth. Her dissertation examined representations of adoption, specifically adoption of children from Korea, in books for children and teens. She is married to an adoptee from Korea. She is not an adoptee herself. (Note: Sam is a White adoptive father of two Black children.)  #DiversityJedi #RavenclawThank you, Sarah, for sharing your insights with us!Can you share your origin story? How did you get started in this work?In the early 2000s, I was in graduate school at UCLA – it was a Master of Asian American Studies program – and I had always loved children’s literature growing up. One day I went to Border’s, and I found a picture book called Smoky Night. It shocked me because it took place during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots, and my dad owned a grocery store at the time, and I remember so much about the violence, about the fear, the conversations that my parents and a lot of our family and friends were having. A lot of people I knew – Korean Americans – had businesses in Los Angeles. Some of them burned clear to the ground. We were more fortunate; our business suffered I think only $7,000-$8,000 worth of damage, which is incredible given how much other people’s properties were destroyed. But my dad’s store was in the middle of a residential neighborhood. It wasn’t along the main corridors where a lot of the damage was. So anyway, the protagonist [in Smoky Night] is a brown or black character – it’s not entirely clear the way the illustrations are done – but definitely not white. But who is also clearly not white is Mrs. Kim, the Korean store owner across the way. And the protagonist talks about how he doesn’t really know her very well, she speaks this other language… and it blew my mind that there was a picture book about the L.A. Riots! Obviously [Smoky Night] was not from a Korean American’s perspective, so I wondered: are there children’s books about the L.A. Riots from a Korean American perspective? When I started looking, the closest thing I found was Marie Lee’s young adult novel Saying Goodbye, in which her protagonist goes off to college at Harvard, and there she meets a boy whose parents owned a store in Los Angeles. It was a little bit removed, but that was the closest thing I found at the time. In the course of doing that research I found other children’s books that depicted Korean people. I was like, “There are Korean people in children’s books?!” It was amazing to me! And then I learned that [in 2002] Linda Sue Park had won the Newbery for A Single Shard, and An Na had won the Printz for A Step from Heaven. All of these things came together at the same time while I was in my graduate program. Originally, I had wanted to be a high school history teacher. But when I discovered these children’s books, I decided I wanted to study children’s literature – Korean American children’s literature – instead.After that I had to go and get a PhD, so I did that. I went to Illinois and then I got hired as an assistant professor.You took Debbie’s Reese’s class [while at the University of Illinois], right?I did! One of the classes I took was called the Politics of Children’s Literature, and that was taught by Debbie Reese. Even though I had been an Ethnic Studies major before, it was my first time learning from someone who is an American Indian about all of the issues related to American Indians in children’s literature, and pop culture in general, because we talked about a lot of things – you know these stereotypes and misrepresentations [in children’s literature] don’t happen in a vacuum. At the time, Debbie was very involved in the fight against the mascot. [UPDATE/related news: the U of I recently banned the “war chant” during sporting events.] She was very outspoken, very vocal about it, and we talked about it a lot in class. I’m ashamed to admit how much I didn’t know about American Indians as I was growing up, and in my schooling, and how much I had to unlearn and relearn and how much I’m still learning – because there’s still so much that we should know.We didn’t become close friends until later. It was a few years before we spent more time together and became more friends and colleagues. At the time it was very much student and professor. How cool that you two go back so far! Okay, this next question is in reference to the children’s literature world in general. What, in your mind, has changed over time?There were not as many children’s books about Asian Americans that explore so many things (and there are still a lot of topics that aren’t talked about). I think we’ve seen an explosion of Asian American books – I mean, that BookRiot article [about books with Asian American protagonists]… I thought that was just amazing to have such a strong list. But when I was starting, I read people like Junko Yokota, Lorraine Dong, Violet Harada, Rocío Davis – Asian Americans who are scholars of Asian American children’s literature. To be able to name them on one hand and say, “These are the foremothers who I respect and look up to”… there are more now, and I wish there were even more people doing this work, because there’s so much more to say about it. I think we are still not seeing enough intersectionality. There are so few books that depict Asian Americans with different gender identities, sexual orientations, those who are differently able in various ways… I think we’re a little bit better about socioeconomic diversity. But there are also still an awful lot of immigrant stories, and not all of us are immigrants now. (I mean, there are still a lot of immigrants but that’s obviously changing in this political environment.) But a lot of times we’re still perceived as immigrants, and if we have a lot of children’s books that depict us only as immigrants who don’t speak English, then that’s a problem. So it would be nice to see more intergenerational children’s books, or children’s books written about the later generations. I think Laurence Yep does a really good job with that, because some of his novels take us way back in time, but then also a lot of them are very much set in the present and they’re the children of people who have been here for generations.I was talking to someone recently at Bao Phi’s A Different Pond book launch party about  intergenerational stories and transracial adoption. For example, Sun Yung Shin, who is transracially adopted and has a biracial son, wrote Cooper’s Lesson because she was thinking about what it is like for the biracial child of an Asian person (though Cooper’s mother is not an adoptee). There are so few books with multiracial Asian characters (see Amina Chaudhri’s research). And I’m trying to think if there are any children’s books that depict not the adopted person as the protagonist, but their children. What kind of conversations might happen there? “Mom, how come your parents are also Korean, but Dad, how come your parents are white?” So we have these books where we can explain transracial adoption through the eyes of the protagonist, but we don’t have books where we can explain it to the children of adoptees who are now… some of them are in their 50s, and 40s… and they have children, and grandchildren, and we need resources to help explain adoption to them. So the literature is going to take time to catch up to our realities.I think it was in 2014 that the CCBC’s numbers where the books by but not about [Asian Americans] eclipsed [the books by *and* about Asian Americans]… I think that’s really interesting, we’re the only group out of the four groups where the numbers are different in that way. I’ve heard from a lot of different Asian Americans what they think about that. For example, at the 2017 Asian American Literature Festival Ellen Oh said Asian American authors are told, “We don’t want to hear your Asian American story, that doesn’t sell…” until it does, right?! And so a lot of people will write about other things until they can get their foot in the door. But we still have so many stories that are not yet told about our communities… I was trying to think, there are so many books now that depict gentrification in some way or another, like The Education of Margo Sanchez, The Family Fletcher Takes Rock Island… There are a lot of things that have happened in Asian American history that we don’t have a lot of books about – the fall of the I-Hotel in San Francisco, the founding of Ethnic Studies (which is celebrating its 50th anniversary next year)… we also need books about the murder of Vincent Chin, which was a huge, huge thing in our community. I’ve been talking to poets… to different people like, “Do you think we can have a book about Vincent Chin, what would that look like?” We have a lot of community activists, a lot of people who are legends in politics and education that we don’t have biographies on. It’s really exciting, the Rad American Women books and also the Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls… those collections are really diverse. I like having them for my daughter because where else am I going to find these biographies? I think we have a lot (relatively speaking) of biographies about Maya Lin, but not so much about some of the other people who have done really important work in this country. (And I think I’m going off on a tangent now!) That’s okay! It’s really embarrassing to me… you’re talking about some really important things in history. And I have not heard of so many of these people or events you’re talking about. So I would certainly appreciate books on those people and events!Tell us about your research in the representation of adoption in children’s literature. What questions are you asking? What have you learned so far?My research was specifically on representations of Korean adoption in American children’s and young adult literature. And one of the big questions that came out of that is, “Why aren’t more of the books authored by Korean adoptees themselves?” And I say that very deliberately, in contrast to asking the question, “Why aren’t more Korean adoptees writing?” Because they are writing: they are writing memoirs, and poetry, and novels, and making documentaries, but very few are writing children’s literature. When I did my initial research, out of approximately 50 books, I think 2 of them were written or illustrated by adopted Koreans, and more than 20 were written by white adoptive parents… specifically mothers. Today we’re having these conversations about #WeNeedDiverseBooks and #OwnVoices, and I didn’t have that language when I was writing my dissertation. But we did have phrases like “insider/outsider authorship,” and this is a clear case of outsider authorship; even if the mothers are within the constellation of adoptive families, it still is not the same as having a book written by a Korean adoptee. I also wondered what kinds of stories were being told, and how different people were being represented, and one of the things I found was that birth mothers, if they were present at all, were largely written out of the narrative. Or their mothering was sort of just discursively taken out.One example: in the first book of a young adult quartet, the [Korean adoptee] protagonist said she started a birth search, but then she hit a wall and so she stopped, but you know, whatever, because her birth mother was “probably a prostitute” anyway, “most [birth mothers] were…” which is a really terrible thing to say of anybody (and particularly about Korean birth mothers because a lot of them were raped, a lot of them had no choice in placing their children for adoption, in a lot of cases the children were taken away from them, a lot of times poverty pushes women into prostitution when that isn’t something they would have naturally chosen for themselves. A lot of Korean female adoptees are told that, if they had not been adopted into their white American family, it’s likely that they would have also ended up as prostitutes in Korea, which is also not a nice thing to say). So anyway, I was just appalled when I read that, and as a reader I would not have wanted to finish reading [the book]… but as a scholar I had to! By the fourth book the white adoptive mother, who is a lovely character, has passed away, so that sort of opened space because around the same time, shortly after, the birth mother in Korea makes contact with the protagonist, they exchange letters, and the birth mother comes and visits. And it turns out she was not a prostitute, she was a well-educated women who found herself pregnant and decided that it wasn’t viable for her to keep the child. But like I said earlier, her mothering abilities had been taken away discursively. They’re having this conversation about relationships, and the protagonist says something like, “I’d rather think of you like a sister, I’ve already had a mother.” And then the birth mother says something like, “That’s fine, I would like that,” but then she’s not called a mother, or perceived to be a mother. Relationships with birth parents and adoptees are really complicated, and everyone has to choose for themselves how they are going to navigate them – they could change over time. I have a lot of Korean adoptee friends, many who have sort of “smooth” relationships with their birth families, but I also have a lot of friends who have very up-and-down, “We’re talking”/“We’re not talking” relationships… every adoptee has to navigate for themselves how that relationship is going to look. But when it’s a pattern in American children’s literature and young adult literature, where the birthmother is discursively taken out of the text, or the birth mother is revealed to be deceased, or someone says, “Well, I’m never going to find her anyway,” as in the case with We Adopted You, Benjamin Koo… What is different from the norm: in Kimchi and Calamari, the protagonist says, “Maybe I can go to Korea when I get older and do a birth search.” The reality is that with most agencies in Korea, you can’t do a search until you’re 18 anyway, so that’s realistic. But he leaves open the possibility that he can go to Korea and search for his mom there. I’d like to see more opportunities like that presented, as opposed to foreclosing the opportunities all together, or if there is a reunion: “But you’re not my mom!”Something interesting (and not in a good way) is that a lot of Korean adoptees in real life are named Kim because Kim is a very common Korean last name. So when white adoptive parents adopt a kid named, say, (first name) Jin-Yong (last name) Kim, they’re going to call the kid Kim because they think, “Oh, that’s also an American name.” And so then in children’s literature, we have something like seven characters out of the fifty characters or so are named Kim. I thought that was interesting… the way that is depicted. I once went to a Korean adoptee conference, with about 500 adoptees from around the world, and I looked through the program, and there were about 15 or 20 Kims.And then there were the factual errors: for example, in the Diary of a Teenage Girl series, the birth mother said she was from the city “Puson,” but it was spelled incorrectly; there are a couple of acceptable ways to spell it (Pusan and Busan), and [the author] doesn’t use either one. And then there was the situation when the birth mother was writing to her daughter and she’s talking about the location of the city, she says it’s next to the Sea of Japan. Now, any Korean person who knows anything about being Korean, is not going to say “Sea of Japan” – it’s really contentious! Koreans call it the East Sea. Those two things signal that the author did not have a deep understanding of either Korean adoption or Korean culture. I mean, enough about Korean adoption to throw in that stereotype about the prostitute mother, right?! But not enough to deal with it in a more critical way. And people could say, “Yeah, but she turned out NOT to be a prostitute!” But you have to read book 4 to figure that out! In all the work you do, what are you most proud of?I don’t know how to answer this question!Infographic on representation in children's literatureYou’re allowed to brag!Well… the infographic that David Huyck, Molly Beth Griffin and I worked on together, in consultation with K.T. Horning, Debbie Reese, Edith Campbell, and Ebony Thomas. I think we produced something that was really useful to a lot of people in pushing conversations about the lack of diversity in children’s lit. And I name all those people who worked on it together because it truly was a group effort to get that out there.I’m also proud of the forthcoming journal that we’re doing – Research on Diversity in Youth Literature. I’m working with a team of really thoughtful and intelligent and passionate people, and I’m excited about the interventions we can make using that journal.I’m really proud of my students. I teach both a Library Materials for Children class and a specific Social Justice in Children’s/Young Adult Literature class. You know, some students are required to take the (first class), but then there are a lot of students who elect to take the (second class), and especially this last semester I’m just really proud of the space that my class provided for my students to deal with some really hard questions and to produce work for community partners. Also, I think since coming to Minnesota, I’ve probably brought to campus a lot of authors and speakers by having personal connections with, say, Gene Yang, or Zetta Elliott or Jody Gray, or Debbie Reese, and through building these networks I was able to bring people to campus and have really important conversations with my students and community members. Almost everything we’ve done has been free and open to the public, and it’s really important to me that people have access to these conversations. How did you get involved with the Lee & Low Diversity Baseline Survey?I had been friends with Jason Low of Lee & Low for a while; we’d been in conversation about different things and I’d always supported their books. In the spring of 2015 I knew that Jason was trying to get this survey going – I’d read about it on their blog, I think. Jason thought it was important to have an external partner – maybe a researcher - manage the data, so he reached out to me and asked me if I’d help administer the survey. I mean, I don’t know if he went through 50 different people before coming to me, it’s very possible… But when he asked me – and I really strongly believe in the survey, I believe we need to have data to back us up – I talked to my dean about it and she gave me her blessing. From that point onward, my graduate assistant and I were the only people with access to the survey. Jason would make a connection, and then send me an email, and then I would work with the publisher or review journal to gather the data. So that’s how that came to be.I think a lot of things that happen in this industry are about relationships. I believe if you’ve established relationships then you’ll give opportunities to other people, and other people will give opportunities to you, and then together we can do a lot of great work. And that was a LOT of work, it was a lot of data for my graduate assistant and me to comb through. Jason wrote in the final report that there was a segment of the data that was compromised. Someone hacked a portion of the data and we were able to cut that out, but it was really infuriating to have a project that was so important be messed up like that. Because of that work, some publishers have made significant changes, and it will be exciting to see if another survey is done in the future, and what publishing looks like then. How do you stay motivated or promote self-care when facing frustration or pushback?I recently discovered – I think Ebony or someone else had posted them – some podcasts by therapists who are women of color. So I’ve started listening to those and that has been really helpful.Also because I’m a person of faith, I tend to be hopeful. That keeps me grounded; I think without my faith I wouldn’t be able to survive all this terrible stuff that is going on around us!The other thing is having a community of support. Over the years I’ve really learned who my friends and allies are, particularly in this community. I check in with Edi and Ebony and Debbie every single day, and then I also have conversations going on with other women – women of color, queer women. We just really try to lift each other up and support each other in the work that we’re doing, so that’s been really helpful. Before social media it must have been harder to do this kind of work together, or to at least have the immediacy of communication! I’m thankful I’m doing the work in this era and not in an earlier one!And then things like chocolate (though it doesn’t always help, sometimes it gives me headaches), coffee helps me, being outside – I’m not outside as much as I should be and I’m not exercising as much as I should. And spending time with people away from some of the things that are going on. And then when I come home, Jeff listens to me rant about a lot of different things, and that’s helpful too! (laughter). So yay Jeff!And I think knowing that I don’t have to fight all the battles, and also I don’t have to fight them alone. For instance, I saw a lot of people post that Vulture piece [about the “toxicity” of YA Twitter] on Facebook. Almost every single time I was like, “I’m not going to get into it… I’m not going to get into it…” because I don’t think it’s always going to be a very productive conversation. But then one of my former students posted it – and it turns out I had actually misread something she wrote – but when I challenged her on liking that article her response was that we were learning together… so I think knowing sometimes it’s going to be productive and sometimes it’s not, and knowing when to engage and when not to engage is really important. But yeah, with that one I didn’t engage too much publicly, but I did talk about it a lot privately with my friends and my colleagues.And I think the word “motivated” is really important too. Because we’re motivated by the desire to have good books for all children. And particularly good books for children who haven’t had a whole lot of good books. That has to be our primary focus. I think when we derail the conversation and it becomes more about winning, that’s not productive. And Debbie always talks about how the reason why we’re doing this work, we’re thinking of the kids we’re giving these books to, and that has to be our motivation. So for me, that’s a really big deal. And I talk about the fact that when I was a kid I didn’t have these books, but now my daughter has these SHELVES… not only of Korean American [books], but all kinds of diverse books, and that’s what I want for all children. That’s one of my motivations.What advice do you have for others looking to do equity work in the world of libraries and youth literature?Know that it’s important. Know that it’s hard. And know that you’re not alone.Find a community or communities that will work alongside you, that will support you, that will build you up and give you opportunities. And also, watch out for those coming up after you. Because there’s always going to be a new generation of people with energy and ideas, and we want to make sure that we’re including them and bringing them into the fold, and also protecting them because it is a vicious world out there, preparing them to face that world. I think about how in the Bible Paul discipled Timothy, and then Timothy discipled others, so making sure that you’re both a Paul and a Timothy… know who you look up to, who your role models are, who your mentors are, and also know that you’re responsible for building up the next generation. Because this fight is not going to end next year, it’s not going to end when we reach parity with the numbers, we’re going to be fighting this for a long time! So we have to build a movement that’s sustainable.-Sam Bloom"},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: How the Queen Found the Perfect Cup of Tea by Kate Hosford, Ill. Gabi Swiatkowska", "date": "Thursday, November 2, 2017", "text": "Reviewed by Allie Jane BruceThe Queen and her servantsThis well-intentioned foray into the diversity of international tea-making techniques hits several wrong notes.  The Queen (she is never named), an entitled, irritable, uncomfortable mass of cloth and hair (reminiscent of Eloise), can no longer stand the sub-par tea her servants bring.  Accompanied by James (whose precise role is never defined), the Queen embarks upon a colonialist tour of a few tea-making techniques of Japan, India, and Turkey (although those countries are not named until the Author’s Note).  At the end, the now-happy and delightful Queen (who has, predictably, learned that the secret to a perfect cup of tea is that “you must share it with others”) invites three children (one from each culture) to enjoy the tea she has prepared for them.Noriko and the QueenThe imperialist framework upon which the story rests is troubling, but I want to focus this review on the illustrations, since images and the messages they send are undeniably powerful.At the book’s start, the Queen is almost colorless.  Her skintone is that of the (white) paper background, and her gown is a pale orangey-red.  The first bright colors come when they set off for distant lands.  Soon after, the Queen meets Noriko, who has pink cheeks, red lips, and a bright blue dress.  In several pictures, though not all, Swiatkowska portrays Noriko's eyes as narrow slits.The Queen, whose cheeks and lips are distinctly rosier after her encounter with Noriko, next visits Sunil, who seems to spend his days “dribbling.”  Sunil has brown skin, dark hair, red lips, a yellow shirt, and is missing a tooth, all of which the Queen can see up close as she peers at him through a magnifying glass.  I wonder how this image lands with kids who look like Sunil.The Queen studies Sunil through a magnifying glassThe Queen then visits Rana, after which she returns home and hosts the three children for tea, now in a bright red dress.Let’s unpack.  We’ve got a (literally) white Queen who’s the same shade as paper--i.e., the color of default.  As Her Imperial Majesty visits faraway lands, she soaks up (literal) color from the local children of color, who are stereotypically rendered smiling and cheerful, quite happy to be the subjects of cultural appropriation and magnifying glasses.Rana, Noriko, the Queen, and Sunil have tea togetherThis is a case study in good intentions gone wrong.  Did the creators, editors, or publishers ever envision a multi-racial classroom read-aloud scenario?  Despite its feel-good ending (the Queen makes tea for the children), the bulk of the book features her studying them as if they are a rare variety of tea-making blue leopards.  The message to White children: “You are default; study other people and cultures when you feel something in your life is lacking; people of color are there to cheerfully accommodate you.”  The message to children of color: “You are different and therefore to be studied; you must cheerfully accommodate those who study you.”Troubling as these messages are, they speak to a larger truth about cultural appropriation.  Historically, when different cultural groups (e.g., Irish, Polish, Italian, Ashkenazi Jews) became White in the United States, they sacrificed fundamental elements of their cultures of origin.  This pattern has been well-documented in books like How the Irish Became White and How Jews Became White Folks.  The ancestral language is usually the first thing to go; next are religious rituals, or religion itself.  Recipes are often the last remnants of culture successfully passed down from generation to generation.  What remains, at the end of this process, is a whole lot of White people in search of anything “cultural” we can get our hands on, regardless of what culture that is, regardless of how we impact the people who actually hail from the cultures we appropriate.I find How the Queen Found the Perfect Cup of Tea interesting because it’s an example of Whiteness in search of culture.  The book would suggest that the Queen is truly lacking companionship and self-sufficiency, but I think the longing for culture goes deeper.  And, I think that White people need to explore these things in all-White settings and groups so as to avoid further burdening people of color and First/Native Nations with our issues.  Many good options for such groups are listed in our FAQs and Resources pages.  In the meantime, skip How the Queen Found the Perfect Cup of Tea.  This well-intentioned Imperialist romp perpetuates racism."},
{"title": "Good White People and Ghosts", "date": "Tuesday, October 10, 2017", "text": "Amy Cheney is currently the District Library Managerof Oakland Unified School District after working for many years on the behalfof incarcerated children. All views expressed are her own, and do not reflectthose of her employer.With the horrors of Amerikkkan Whiteentitlement showing more of itself in Charlottesville this past August, Ireceived this email from Center for Popular Action, which I quote inpart: “Whitesupremacy (...) is a reflection of centuries-long oppressive structures thatpermeate every aspect of our government, financial systems, cultural norms, andsociety at large. It’s a system in which Black and Brown bodies are continuallydevalued, marginalized, and criminalized, and those that perpetrate violence onpeople of color are protected, promoted, and honored.” This paragraph gave me pause. When I read“those that perpetuate violence on people of color are protected, promoted andhonored” I immediately thought of a recent experience I had that illustratesthis--and NOT by the Alt-Right plowing cars into people, or Sheriff Arpaio, but by well-intentioned Whitelibrarians and a venerated graphic novelist. I attended an event about Diversity in Graphic novels in May. Jack Baurand Amanda Jacobs Foust, whom I highly respect, gave a great presentation abouta history of comics that illuminated much. Thi Bui  and MarikoTamaki were on the panel representing their beautiful books. You can see thepresentation here and find more useful information on thissite. [updated 10/11/17]However, I wondered why Raina Telgemeier, aWhite writer, whose book Ghosts has been shown to be inaccurate and an act of cultural misappropriation was on this panel about diversity.Let’s be clear:  by being on the panel, this White person wasbeing promoted and honored. I had a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomachthat this was not going to go well. And, it did not. As a White person, I have had many experiencesof my privilege in the realm of showing up to a public forum without adequatepreparation because I am used to being believed, listened to, honored, promotedand protected. Donald Trump exhibits an extreme version of this where hebelieves everything he says is important and true and he can say it justbecause of who he is. I have talked on and on about something I actually knewnothing about, all the while thinking I was making a valuable point.  White people don’t have to prepare oranalyze, or take time to understand people’s point of view because what wethink fits into cultural norms, and…..truly, underneath it all, we’ve boughtinto the belief that we know what we are talking about, that our conversationand voice is important because we are good, we mean well, we are a part of thesolution, and... we aren’t racist.  The analysis that follows is both personal andnot personal to Raina Telgemeier (RT) and the moderators (JB and AJF). They aregood people, fantastic librarians and a terrific author/illustrator.  It ispersonal only in that they have a responsibility, as all of us White people do,to uncover, unearth and deal with the legacy we have been born into.Hereis a video of the panel. Beginning at 41.07, youcan see exactly how it went down. At 41.07 in the video, a question is asked toRT. From 41.35 onward RT deflects, devalues andmarginalizes what people of color and First/Native Nations have been saying toher about her book while displaying all the classic signs of White fragility.AJF and JB support and protect her. What is absolutely horrifying to me about thisinterchange is:1. RT did not andwas not able to provide a clear summary and context of the criticisms leveledagainst her book and break down her responsibilityin perpetuating the devaluation and marginalization of people of color andFirst/Native Nations. She actually turned to the person of color who asked thequestion to provide the context. 2. RT devolved intoher “right” to write a book because “some of my best friends are _______.”  She focuses on her validity towrite a book about Mexican Americans, in part because she married into a LatinAmerican family.  \"I didn't think I wasborrowing, I thought I was experiencing something on a personal level andsharing stories\"  (43.01). RTdoes not show a clear understanding of what people of color and First/NativeNations have been saying about cultural appropriation.  She says that she has been thinking deeplyabout this, but whatever thinking she has done was not apparent or shared inany meaningful way. Here’s just one article (the basic 101 version) thatoutlines some issues about cultural appropriation.  3. RT’s commentsdevolved into personal issues that deflected from the very real issue of thegenocide her book glosses over and normalizes. At43.14 there is a clear example of White fragility and deflecting from theissues raised by people of color and First/Native Nations: “I’m not allowed totalk about going through a divorce right now, but it’s really difficult,” shesays with tears. Somehow RT is now the victim - “not allowed to talk”  and has extenuating circumstances - difficultdivorce - that explains away/detracts from addressing the question. This iswhat often happens when White people are confronted about racism and it’s whatpeople of color have brought up time and again. This was a complete deflectionfrom the racism in the book Ghosts,  the question at hand and what the panel wassupposed to be about.4. At 43.28 themoderators AJF and JB jump in to “take care” of and protect RT from herpersonal issues that she is using to distract from addressing the real issuesof the problems of her book. 5. At 43.33 elaborate andnonsensical arguments are used to protect RT.  AJF uses the bizarre argument that why we needmore diversity overall is because “when there are these unique storiespresented they are highly criticized because there are no other voices tellingthese stories” and that “it’s really easy when there is one example of it to bepicked apart because it can’t be everything to everyone.” I know AJF  didn’t mean that we need more diversity sothat White people don’t get criticized, but that is actually what she said! 6. Accurate context isnot provided by the moderators thereby perpetuating White point of view asnormal. At 44.15, AJF says the bookdeals “a lot with California Missions” and “the things that we are taught about California Missions and thethings that we are not taught about California Missions is huge.” Themoderators should have been prepared--i.e. thought through carefully why theyincluded RT on a panel about diversity, be prepared to provide a context of thefeedback given by people of color and First/Native Nations and to unequivocallydenounce what was written/illustrated in Ghoststhat glosses over and thus perpetuates genocide and violence. For example, theycould have credited Debbie Reese, who has already been so kind to inform thosethat didn’t already know that California Missions were the sites of massivegenocide of First/Native Nations peoples. See her analysis here to understand how Ghosts whitewashes the brutal history ofthe missions. The moderators and the author could have highlighted anddistilled what Debbie Reese and others say in order to educate the audience asto the issues, thus honoring, promotingand valuing the voices of people of color and First/Native Nations.7. White supremacy is used as an excusefor non-accountability. It seems that AJF’s point was thatdue to White supremacy we can’t be held accountable to the ways in which wehave bought in, been misinformed, etc. If that’s the case, how have people ofcolor and First/Native Nations been informed? Yes, due toWhite supremacy we are taught a whitewashed version of history but that doesn’texcuse us for perpetuating what we have been taught, for being so vague in ouranswers and not taking the platform that is given to educate, unequivocally,those in the audience that still may be unaware. Instead these three Whitepeople did not take the platform they had to do this.  The book was notcriticized “because there were ghosts at the Missions” as AJF  says, but 1. because the Missions setting wasportrayed in a benign and thus false way and 2. as  Yuyi Morales points out (in the commentssection): Day of the Dead is not about ghosts but about the souls of thedeparted. These things could have been clearly articulated by any of the Whitepeople. 8. Whitesupremacy is blamed and also used as an excuse for not taking personalresponsibility. At 45.00 RT sorta takes ownership: “It (What is It?This needs to be clearly said!) was an oversight and I have to takeresponsibility for that.” However, within 7 seconds, at 45.07  she clearly does not take responsibility bysaying “but it was not something flagged by a single reader, and I had severalof them.” This comment highlights privilege (“I had readers”) as an excuse tojustify personal innocence. She seems to be saying that not ALL these Whitepeople and other readers could be wrong! Uh, yeah. They could be and are. 9. White supremacy isblamed for victimizing us all. Non-acknowledgement of inherent bias/racism isused to justify not doing adequate research.   At50:50 RT says she did a ton of research and wishes that books and informationwould have been available to her. This is an example of a mistaken, passive anddangerous belief that we are all victims of White supremacy. Let’s be clear: RTis benefiting from, not victimized by, White supremacy throughout this entiredebacle. At 44:39 AJF saysthat “I don’t know of an editor that would have that kind of experience toquestion what we were taught.” First of all, this is a completely arrogantstatement, second of all, it’s not true, and third of all, that’s not anexcuse, reason or explanation: all of us need to learn how to question what wewere taught and how we perpetuate the myth of White supremacy. In addition,it’s NOT up to people of color and First/Native Nations to do this work, but itIS up to us White people. A simple Google search of “california missions racism” pulls up all oneneeded to know. On my browser this isincluded in the second entry: “Missions were little more than concentration camps whereCalifornia's Indians were beaten, whipped, maimed, burned, tortured andvirtually exterminated by the friars.”  Elias Castillo.As to the possibilitythat the Scholastic editorial team did not question, fact check, google orutilize their resources to either hire a person of color or First/NativeNations to write this book or fact check a book by a White author about peopleof color -- that is also their responsibility that doesn’t diminish RT’sresponsibility. This “oversight”might have occurred because it might not have occurred to any of these Whitepeople that they could be unqualified or racist and that it’s theirresponsibility to question the status quo.10. 46.42 Continuedelaborate justifications by the moderators take more time and deflect from thepurpose of the panel. BothAJF and JB appear to hold the book in such high esteem for the fact that it istaking on “this topic” (meaning Day of the Dead? Missions? Biracial kids?). Allof these topics have been shown to be problematic! Why is this not acknowledgedand instead explained away? JB’s perspective that “this could be the ONLY bookthat kids in Kansas read about this topic” means that somehow this justifiesthe writing of it and completely undermines, devalues, and Whitesplains awaywhat people of color and First/Native Nations have been saying about the book. Just to be clear -the criticism isn’t that RT is White and therefore shouldn’t have written thestory. No, the problem is that she used (culturally appropriated) Latinxcharacters and culture that she didn’t accurately represent, and she erased agenocide. Please see Nic Stone’s terrific article about the dangers of “helping” marginalizedpeople be more visible. 11. Thepeople of color on the panel had just a few moments to introduce some goodpoints and places of exploration. These were not picked up by the moderatorsand built upon, instead the conversation was ended. For examples:  at 49.34 Mariko Tamaki clearly acknowledgesher process of understanding how she might be inadvertently racist and outlinesa very simple way to make an apology. This is not heard or followed up on. At 51.35 more from Mariko that’snot expanded upon. At 53.57 Thi Bui gets a few moments at the very end, when shespeaks about telling stories from marginalized perspectives andlistening to feedback. This is where JB ends the discussion. There were manyopportunities on the panel (and before!) for RT, AJF and JB to hear what peopleof color and First/Native Nations were saying. Instead, the attention and timewas used to support and protect RT’s personal defended stance. 12. Thisentire exchange took from 41:01 - 54:51--almost 15 minutes of time. Thispanel was supposed to be about Diversity in Graphic Novels and was derailed bya bunch of White BS. Dare I say that all of this individual lack of ownership of the problem byWhite people adds up to collective systemic oppression? What I’m shining a lighton here is a perfect example of a group of good, well-intentioned White people-- publishers, author, “readers”, editors, moderators, etc--acting together toassert their point of view, meanwhile devaluing and marginalizing the point ofview of people of color and First Native/Nations. Let’s be clear: promoting, honoring andprotecting White people who have been educated but haven't owned theirinadvertent racist mistakes = violence against people ofcolor and First/Native Nations. It’s not complicated. It’s plain and simple. The solidification of “White is right”violence continues with what looks like the all White judging panel for the Eisner Awards selecting Ghosts to win Best Publication for Kids (ages 9-12).It is our responsibility as White people to:●     Assume, own and understand thatwe, as White people, by definition and experience, are racist, regardless ofwhether we are consciously bigoted. ●     Realize it’s a lifelong process tounderstand all the ways that we are positioned in power, and consciously orunconsciously perpetuate this racist system. ●     Take the time to analyze culturalnorms and prepare so as to be aware and inclusive●     Question the status quo●     Expose, attend to, andacknowledge--when appropriate--all the ways that we are racist, inadvertent ornot  ●     Be VERY clear how we benefit fromand perpetuate White supremacy ●     Provide clear examples andinformation to other White people about how we benefit and perpetuate racismand White supremacy. ●     Take action to point out anddismantle the system that we are benefiting and profiting from●     Listen to, find the validity ofand reach a deep understanding of people of color’s and First Native/Nationfeedback--especially those we don’tunderstand or seem contrary to our views●     Move through our shame and excuses(didn’t know, didn’t mean to, but  -blah, blah, blah) ●     Come to a clear acknowledgement offeedback ●     Incorporate this information intoour conversation ●     Take action to rectify theproblem, especially at personal expense.This means taking action that is not easy, convenient or lucrative, but isdoing the right thing to make amends and reparations. ●     Not expect people of color andFirst/Native Nations to shoulder the burden of analysis, feedback, context ofhow we have bought into and perpetuate White supremacy. ●     Google “racism” + keywords If indeed, if RT, AJF and JB want to takeresponsibility, the response could have been/can be any number of things suchas: ●     Use the platform of the panel onGraphic Novel diversity and Eisner award to inform about the many problems ofthe book ●     Acknowledge the people of colorand First Native/Nations that brought the racism to light●     Not accept the award or theposition on the panel but refer a person of color or First/Native Nations to participateand highlight●     Have a forum to extend deeper theracism brought to light ●     Give back all proceeds of the bookto small presses that are highlighting people of color and native people such as BloodOrange Press, or one of the presses listed here. ●     Stop the press run of Ghosts and refuse to make money byperpetuating ignorance and inaccuracies that ultimately harm us all and that areoff of the backs of people of color and First/Native Nations.●     Issue an apology ●     Keep the video that is linked in this piece up on the web. In this wayother White  people who want to see whatcovert yet solidified racism looks like can. Unconsciousness or good intentions doesn’texcuse behavior or make it less racist and violent. Illuminating anderadicating racism takes vigilant work that can only come about if it’sunderstood that we are inadvertently and covertly racist and that we willinevitably expose this. We then need to learn to own this racism, learn fromour mistakes, speak out, refuse to participate with the status quo and takepositive action for a more equitable and just world. Only when personalresponsibility is taken can oppressive systems be dismantled."},
{"title": "Selecting While White: Breaking Out of the Vendor Box", "date": "Tuesday, October 3, 2017", "text": "Chelsea Couillard-Smith is a Senior Librarian in Collection Services at Hennepin County Library in Minnesota, and has selected materials for libraries big and small for nearly 10 years. All views expressed are her own, and do not reflect those of her employer.As a materials selection librarian, I’m keenly aware of the privilege and responsibility that come with the job. Collection development is gatekeeping - when librarians make decisions about what to include, and what not to include, we have to be aware of the effect on our communities. Libraries certainly aren’t the only avenue for the public to discover and obtain books, but we are a critical point of access for many of our patrons.I don’t need to reiterate for readers of this blog that there is a lack of diversity in the traditional publishing world. At the same time, independent and self publishing have exploded. Many diverse authors are now able to share their stories through non-traditional routes, and are even getting a decent amount of publicity and exposure through social media. In general, this is fabulous news for our collections. But are libraries actually able to find and to purchase these books? As almost any librarian will tell you, it’s not always as simple as just going out and buying a book for your library the way an individual might go online and make a purchase.  The vast majority of libraries depend heavily on one or two major book vendors to obtain materials for their collections. Whether or not a title is readily available to most libraries can be as simple as whether or not the book is carried by Baker & Taylor or Ingram. Furthermore, public and school libraries are often restricted in whether, how, and how often they can make purchases - many aren’t able to just go online with a credit card and buy what they want.Staff time is another hurdle in selecting for a diverse collection. In many libraries, selection is done by librarians who are also expected to plan and lead programs, create outreach partnerships in the community, and staff the circulation desk, among many other responsibilities. Materials selection is squeezed into small, stolen chunks of time between other tasks. I understand that many libraries feel pressured to purchase problematic titles. Regardless of what critics say and what red flags a librarian may recognize in a book, if it’s a well-known author or it’s getting a lot of publicity, a library may purchase it anyway because of patron interest. Libraries that already have large collections, dedicated selection staff, and deep pockets are best positioned to balance the problematic titles in their collections with a diverse array of books from small and independent presses. Meanwhile, with smaller budgets and less staff time, underfunded or smaller libraries can find it difficult to buy outside of the box. Many still rely heavily on mainstream review journals or blogs and collection development tools from large library vendors to create their collections, and these resources still tend to prioritize the output of the Big 5 publishers. So they may be purchasing titles that marginalize diverse voices, but face challenges in finding and obtaining the independent titles they need to balance their collections and introduce voices that counter problematic narratives. Even if they have staff members who are plugged into alternative review sources, libraries still may not be able to obtain self-published or small press titles, or they may not feel that they have space in their budgets for titles that are more difficult and more expensive to purchase. In this way, it’s an oddly self-perpetuating cycle whereby the libraries with more staff, more funds, and more flexibility are best able to create broadly diverse collections, while those with smaller budgets, less staff time, and more barriers to purchasing are perhaps as likely to be buying the problematic, high-visibility titles coming from traditional publishers, but are less able to identify and obtain independent titles from diverse authors.How do we break out of this cycle of dependency on traditional sources and methods of collection development?There are small things that any library can do to open up their ability to create a diverse collection.  Some ideas:Something as seemingly innocuous as whether or not your library can buy from a local bookseller, Amazon, or other online sources can be framed as a barrier to diversity and inclusion. Ask decision-makers what it would take to increase buying options and flexibility.  Provide examples of the high-quality titles that can only be purchased from the book’s creator, and help those in charge of these decisions understand the context around self-publishing. Many authors have chosen to retain control over their works rather than have them diluted by the standards of traditional publishing, while others have never been given a chance to share their stories.Advocate for diverse books, even if your budget is tight. Look at selection lists and other collection development tools with a critical eye - whose voices are missing? Advocate for your own regularly scheduled and dedicated time to spend on selection so you can truly dig into alternative resources for identifying and evaluating traditionally marginalized voices. It might feel like an odd way to get some additional off-desk time to buy materials, but your ability to do some research may be affecting the diversity of your collection. Give self-published authors and small presses a chance to be flexible. If you have to use a purchase order, instead of assuming they will only take a credit card, get in touch. See if you can come to an arrangement that will work for both of you. Most of them will be thrilled at the chance to have their book in a library.Ask more of your vendors! You may not feel that your voice means much to a large vendor, but the more they hear from all of us about small, independent presses, the more likely they are to start making materials available. I’ve found that even large vendors are interested in developing new distribution relationships if it means selling more materials. Establish a collection development contact at your vendor, and when you discover titles that are not in their database, make a habit of sending them an email. Understandably, not every self-published author or independent press will want to work with a large vendor, but some may be happy to gain additional exposure and increase the availability of their titles.Collection development is a powerful way to challenge some of the equity problems that exist in children’s literature. Breaking out from the confines of traditional sources of materials and reviews can be challenging and time-consuming, but as long as mainstream publishing remains relatively homogenous, it’s critical work that we need to do to diversify our collections. Whether it’s advocating for our own time to spend on this work, asking questions of our vendors, or opening up new avenues of purchasing, there are small things we can do that make a big difference in our ability to bring marginalized voices into our collections. What are some other practical ideas for librarians with purchasing power?  Leave your thoughts in the comments!"},
{"title": "Looking Back: Teammates by Peter Golenbock, ill. Paul Bacon", "date": "Friday, September 29, 2017", "text": "Teammates by Peter Golenbock, ill. Paul Bacon.  HMH Books For Young Readers, 1990. 9780152842864. Click here to purchase.When I was in fifth grade, my teacher assigned us an essay on our hero (original, I know).  I was in the middle of a major Jackie Robinson phase.  I loved the whole “courage not to fight back” mantra, the way he played (have you seen him steal home?), and especially, the book Teammates written by Peter Golenbock and illustrated by Paul Bacon.  So when I heard about the assignment, I knew immediately who I would write about.I came home and told my mom about the assignment.  “Who do you think you’ll write about?” she asked.  Herman “Pee Wee” Reese, I said.  The guy who, by putting his arm around Jackie Robinson’s shoulders in full view of a crowded stadium, hushed the bigoted spectators and bought Robinson a bit of a respite from the hate and vitriol regularly hurled at him.“No, you won’t,” my mom said decisively.  I was surprised, since like me, she was a big Robinson, Reese, and Teammates fan.  Also, she rarely interfered in my schoolwork.“Uh, why?”  I said.“You may write about Jackie Robinson, or you may write about them both,” she said.  “You will not elevate a White man to hero status, especially over Jackie Robinson, for the mere act of putting his arm around someone’s shoulders.  Jackie Robinson was the real hero.”  (Those probably weren’t her exact words, but that’s how it’s enscripted in my memory.)Jackie Robinson steals home in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series.I was stunned.  I’d never thought of it that way, but it was true--I took a hard look at what Jackie Robinson endured and accomplished: Broke the color line in baseball nearly two decades before Freedom Summer.  Became the first pro athlete to have his number retired.  Posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal and Presidential Medal of Freedom.  Helped found a Black-owned and -operated bank based in Harlem.  Marched with Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington.  Stole 197 bases.  Retired with a .409 on-base percentage and a stellar fielding record.  And then I took a hard look at what Reese did:  Refused to sign a petition, circulated by his fellow players, to prevent Robinson from joining the team; and, put his arm around Robinson’s shoulders, essentially telling a hateful crowd to shut up.  Although Reese was certainly admirable, Robinson was undoubtedly heroic.And then I was forced to self-examine.  Why had I, despite being so thoroughly obsessed with Robinson, defaulted to Reese as my hero?  And what did that say about me?  11-year-old-me didn’t have the language or tools to grapple with this, but I had a vague sense that it was something very ugly within me, a predilection for White saviorism and a willingness to elevate White people over Black people even within the Civil Rights movement, thereby co-opting that movement.  For years after this incident, I connected this vaguely negative, un-articulable feeling to the book that had spurred it.  I put Teammates aside for a long time.Roughly fifteen years later, I revisited it in the midst of a long process of re-educating myself about race and racism, and Teammates is now once again a favorite of mine.  I’ve been thinking about it non-stop over the past week, in light of the protests of police brutality and institutional racism launched by Colin Kaepernick and the resulting national conversation.  I feel certain that some of the commentators demanding that the NFL “keep politics out of sports” would benefit from reading Teammates, which reveals the truth that politics is already, and always has been, in sports.  And, I always encourage educators to be thoughtful and deliberate in how they read and teach Teammates to children.In Teammates, straightforward and accessible text pair with a combination of black-and-white photographs and painterly watercolors to tell the story of the Robinson/Reese friendship.  Segregation, the Negro Leagues, the KKK--Golenbock uses just the right level of detail to skillfully set the historical context, yet this is no “single story” of Black pain.  Even as the injustices of segregation are listed, the Negro Leagues are introduced as “two wonderful baseball leagues”.I wish Golenbock had devoted similar space to the more positive and uplifting aspects of Robinson’s character and backstory; the list of indignities to which he was regularly exposed, from fellow Dodgers (I will not call them “teammates”) refusing to eat with him to pitchers aiming at his head, is gut-wrenching, as is the palpable tension and discomfort in Robinson’s face and body language in the team picture that appears in the book.  It would have been nice to balance these painful elements with positive stories of Robinson’s incredible sports feats, home life, and family.﻿﻿﻿The 1947 Dodgers.  Most of the (White) players appear comfortable and relaxed; Jackie Robinson sits with his arms and legs held tight into his body and his brow furrowed, appearing tense and uncomfortable.Details of Reese’s life are similarly sparse in Teammates.  We get the highlights: he grew up in the thick of segregated Louisville, KY; the Cincinnati spectators hurling hate and bigotry at Jackie Robinson could have been his neighbors.  Reese must have had a strong moral compass to fly in the face of his upbringing and most of the Dodgers by forming a friendship with Robinson, and a strong backbone to demonstrate that friendship publicly, but Teammates manifests the arm-around-the-shoulders moment a little too simplistically.  I could see these final pages becoming fodder for a White Savior narrative in the hands of an irresponsible educator or caregiver.  I could also see it becoming a highly useful tool for teaching about advocacy and taking risks to stand up against bullies and oppressors in the hands of a skilled teacher.  As is true for so many books, its substance depends on its delivery.As a White adult learning about anti-racism, returning to once again study Pee Wee Reese’s story was invaluable for me.  Segregation and other forms of racial oppression would have been part of the landscape during Reese’s childhood.  The buzzwords and acronyms so dear to me would not have been part of his vocabulary.  When he refused to sign a racist, anti-Robinson petition circulated by other Dodgers, he famously said, “I don’t care if this man is black, blue, or striped--he can play and he can help us win.”  I steer clear of language like this, and encourage others to do the same, since it trivializes very real injustices and promotes a colorblind view of the world that is only available to racially privileged White people.And yet, Pee Wee Reese is a strong role model for White people like me.  When Jackie Robinson signed with the Dodgers, everyone expected him to take Reese’s position: shortstop.  Reese was the only player who actually stood to lose something from Robinson’s presence, and yet, he was the one who refused to sign the petition attempting to keep Robinson off the team.  When asked about this, Reese simply answered that he’d thought, “If he’s good enough to take my job, he deserves it.”Ultimately, Robinson started as first baseman, and then moved to second, while Reese stayed at shortstop.  I don’t know this history thoroughly enough to know why Robinson was never made shortstop; given his stellar fielding, it would have made sense for him to play his natural position, and keeping him at second base may well have been an injustice against him.  It seems, though, that it was not Reese’s decision; he was perfectly willing to cede the coveted shortstop spot.  And his refusal to sign the petition took much of the wind out of its sails.These are acts of White allyship (NOT saviorism) from which I can learn.  It’s easy to learn the jargon and concepts of anti-racism.  The true test comes when I am asked to give up something real, something material, perhaps something related to money or physical safety.  I can attend every anti-racist training, read every book, and know every buzzword--at the end of the day, what matters is whether, like Pee Wee Reese, I lead with compassion and a willingness to make real sacrifices.This is the angle I would highlight, were I to read Teammates to kids (I haven’t yet, but am planning to this year). Don’t get me wrong; the arm-around-the-shoulders thing is important.  It takes real courage to stand up to bullies and say “You are wrong, and I am standing with the person you are targeting;” and, one can easily slip into grandstanding with actions like these.  I don’t believe Reese was grandstanding; from what I’ve read, he made a habit of openly and publicly chatting with Robinson at the beginning of games, particularly those with especially vitriolic spectators, with the deliberate intent of getting the hate-filled crowds to back off.  Robinson talked openly about how much he appreciated these actions.  But, I do think that it’s easy to slip into public displays of allyship (i.e., grandstanding) that draw attention away from the systemic changes needed to make real progress.  So, while I would support children who are inspired by the arm-around-the-shoulder narrative, I’d encourage them to focus more on Reese’s willingness to sacrifice the shortstop position and his refusal to sign the petition.And, of course, I’d make sure to backend it with Stealing Home by Robert Burleigh and Promises To Keep by Sharon Robinson and maybe a documentary or even a screening of 42.  I’d make sure that kids understand the difference between advocacy and heroism.  (And that Jackie Robinson stole home 19 times.)And I’d make sure that White kids know that while Jackie Robinson is the hero in this story, I deeply respect and admire Reese.  It is hard to provide positive examples of anti-racist White people to children.  Too often, we White adults provide negative examples--what not to be--or else slide into stories of the Great White Hope.  Teammates, when read thoughtfully, can be a powerful story of a role model, an example for White kids to live into rather than avoid.  I’d like to think that it was this need for a positive example that led eleven-year-old me to latch onto Teammates; in reality, I think I just liked the White savior story I’d internalized.  But with some deep conversation and thoughtful reading, maybe I could have understood the nuances in Teammates a little better.  And then, I could perhaps have understood that while I can never be a hero like Robinson, I can strive every day to be a teammate like Reese.Jackie Robinson and Pee Wee Reese-Allie Jane Bruce"},
{"title": "Looking Back: The Yearling by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings", "date": "Thursday, September 28, 2017", "text": "Today we are featuring a Looking Back post by Diane Bailey Foote. Diane is Curator of the Butler Children's Literature Center at Dominican University in River Forest, IL. Thank you, Diane! Original cover of The Yearling.\"Let me talk to you a little bit before you read this,\" said my dad when I was about nine years old. He handed me a paperback copy of The Yearling by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, which had been published in 1938, and had won a Pulitzer Prize, although that distinction was lost on fourth-grade me in 1976. \"You're going to read language in here that isn't correct. I want you to know this isn't the way I expect you to read and write, but I don't want you to look down on the people who speak this way in this book. This is the way they learned to speak at that time.\" Of course, he was referring as much to relatively innocuous vernacular dialogue spoken by the poor, rural White Floridians such as \"That's what I figgered,\" \"sich as that,\" or \"Them that steals offen us;\" as he was to flat-out racist terms such as \"Injuns,\" or saying in criticism that someone has \"a heart as black as midnight.\" Of course, this really is how the people in the book would have spoken at the time and place it was set. Unfortunately, when a narrator uses objectionable language, even a 1930s narrator, it is somehow harder to accept than when such terms are spoken by a book's characters. For example, in describing a pet raccoon, the narration reads: \"A tiny black paw, like a n*****’s baby's hand, reached out.\" Seriously!? I honestly don't remember how I reacted to this kind of sentence at age nine, but reading it today makes me angry, because it's so unnecessary and mars what is otherwise an enduring work of writing that is both critically acclaimed and popular. I recognize now that my nine-year-old White self was privileged to just kind of blow past that; for kids who may have been called that name, it wouldn't have been so easy. It's especially jarring, because this very scene, in which main character Jody's friend Fodder-wing is introduced, is remarkable in its ahead-of-its-time treatment of a person with a physical disability. Fodder-wing, the youngest son in the large Forrester family, neighbors to Jody's family, was born with a \"hunch-backed frame\" and people think he's \"witless.\" But Jody, the main character with whom readers sympathize and identify, sees and values him for who he really is: a kind boy and a gentle friend to people and animals. Internal illustration by N. C. Wyeth, \"Jody and Flag\"The storyline itself remains compelling and, for the most part, exquisitely written, today. Jody Baxter is an only child living in an isolated setting; his family's cabin is located on what was called \"Baxter's Island,\" not a true island but a clearing in the scrub. It is a harsh life, with constant struggle for survival against starvation, illness, and predatory animals; it is also beautiful, with Jody finding joy in nature when he can sneak away from his endless chores. His \"Ma\" is not overly warm or maternal; his father, known as \"Penny\" both for his small stature and for being \"sound as copper itself; and with something, too, of the copper's softness.\" Jody longs for companionship and befriends a young fawn after Penny, bitten by a poisonous snake, kills its mother to use her flesh to draw out the poison. Jody grows up over the course of the episodic story; he wrestles with a number of ethical situations, from having to kill animals for food, to conflicting loyalties among the other people in the scrub and in town who must rely on one another in hard times. He also learns to cope with death, fear, and loss; Penny is gravely injured more than once, and in one of the more tear-inducing scenes (which is saying something in this book) he finds out his friend Fodder-wing has died. All of this leads up to the time when he must do the unthinkable or his family will starve: His beloved fawn, now a yearling he's named Flag, can't be trained to not eat the corn crop, and manages to escape from every enclosure Jody builds. The end of Flag's life marks the end of Jody's childhood. In a powerful ending, \"He did not believe he should ever again love anything, man or woman or his own child, as he had loved the yearling. …Somewhere beyond the sink-hole, past the magnolia, under the live oaks, a boy and a yearling ran side by side, and were gone forever.\" The language is evocative and unflinching, balancing the haunting beauty of the Florida backcountry setting with the harshness of the lives of the people in the scrub. The Yearling has felt like an old friend itself to me for much of my life, but I'm angry at it today. Angry because so much of it is so remarkable, but it is tainted by the legacy of racism that may have been more common at the time of its writing, yet sadly persists.

These werefarming families, and many of them leased land because the law prohibited themfrom owning it outright. These historical details, explained in anauthor’s note as well as woven into the narrative, inform important elements ofStep Up to the Plate, Maria Singh.  But at the center of the story is a small-towngirl in California who just wants to play ball. Softball, that is. It’s the spring of 1945 when one of Maria Singh’steachers announces she’s going to form a girls’ softball team. Maria worriesPapi, who is more old-fashioned than her mother, won’t let her play. When hedoes agree, she decides to hold off on lobbying to wear shorts: she’ll savethat battle for another day. Maria and the other girls face chiding from theboys but they keep practicing and slowly become a team under Miss Newman’sguidance. Maria’s rival on the team is Elizabeth Becker, a White girl whosefather owns the land Maria’s papi farms. Mr. Becker, clearly upset by thegrowing diversity in their small town where a number of “Mexican-Hindu”*families, as they’re called, have settled, decides to sell his land and move.Maria’s papi wants to buy the land. But because he is an immigrant from India, he can't. (*Amisnomer, Maria notes, since most of the fathers are either Sikh, like her Papi,or Muslim.)There’s a lot packed into this novel: racism,sexism, politics, including the struggle for Indian independence from Britain(Maria’s papi and the other Indian fathers follow the news from their homelandclosely), as well as the inevitable loss experienced by a community and individualfamilies during wartime (including among the families with immigrant fathers). Maria’sMexican American mother and her family have been in the United States forgenerations; her father’s present and future are here but a piece of his heartis also with the fate of India. All of these things matter in the bigger world of ideas and action and socialjustice, of course, but here they matter first and foremost because Mariacares about her family and community. All of these things impact her. At the same time, noneof them change the fact that she is still a girl who wants to play ball, and author Uma Krishnaswami weaves them artfully through the story of Maria and her team.Step Up to the PlateMaria Singh is not as blithe as Krishnaswami’s middle gradenovels The Grand Plan to Fix Everything andThe Problem with Being Slightly Heroic,nor is it meant to be.

Toomer Elementary in Atlanta, GA. Thank you, Eric!Elephant & Piggie Like Reading!: It’s Shoe Time! By Bryan Collier. Disney-Hyperion, 2017. 64 pages. ISBN 9781484726471. Click here to purchase. (Pub Date: November 7)At first glance the reader might assume that Bryan Collier's It's Shoe Time! is a typical entry into the “Elephant & Piggie Like Reading!” series from Mo Willems. The cover, with its three pairs of wide-eyed and grinning shoes, certainly sets us up for an over-the-top story of walking, talking footwear. However, unlike the previous three entries in the “Elephant & Piggie Like Reading!” series (or the twenty-five original books featuring the two pals), It's Shoe Time! includes human characters. Specifically a Black girl and her father, painted in Collier’s recognizable watercolor and collage technique.  Collier’s simple and heartwarming story leaves plenty of space for visual gags and creative puns from the aforementioned footwear. Preparing for her special “Daddy and Me Day,” a young girl decides to wear two different shoes – much to the alarm of the rest of her footwear. The remaining pair (an anxious left flip-flop and gloomy right boot) attempt to save the girl from her footwear faux pas. Full of creative puns and visual gags, young readers will enjoy picking up on the personalities of all the shoes even if some of the right/left wordplay doesn’t always garner a laugh.Image from edelweissLike many of Willems’ “Elephant & Piggie” stories, Collier’s entry into the series follows a similar construction – energetic crisis leading into a heartwarming resolution. Also following Willems’ example, here text is confined to character-specific, color-coded word balloons, allowing readers to understand that the words in purple belong to the girl even when she is off the page. These familiar features paired with Collier’s expressive paintings prove to be a winning combination for this excellent early reader. Reviewed by Eric Carpenter."},

By Useni Eugene Perkins. Illustrated by Bryan Collier. Hachette, 2017. 9780316360302. Click here to purchase. (Release date: November 14)When Andrea Davis Pinkney spoke at the biennial Children’s Literature Institute at Simmons College this summer she said that one of her go-to sayings as an editor and advocate of diverse children’s books is “Show the face.” In other words, on book jackets and in picture book art, illustrations should prominently and regularly show the faces of children of color as a visual means of centering them and their experiences. It seems simple, doesn’t it? But her remarks reminded me of Allie Jane Bruce’s work with her students regarding the whitewashing of children’s book covers, which exposes how very much more there remains to be done in terms of “show[ing] the face.” Davis’s comments also made me want to more closely examine of one of my favorite picture books of 2017, Useni Eugene Perkins and Bryan Collier’s Hey Black Child. There are many, many things I admire about Collier’s work in this book and in others, and his dedication to “show[ing] the face” is among them. Megan Dowd Lambert with Useni Eugene Perkins and Bryan Collier at ALA Annual 2017. Photo provided by the author.I’d read the poem before, and erroneously thought it was written by a Harlem Renaissance poet, Countee Cullen. When I heard it was being published as a picture book with Collier’s illustrations, I was delighted to stumble across him signing it with its true author, Perkins, at the ALA Annual meeting this summer in Chicago. The book’s official release isn’t until November, so I was especially grateful for the chance to snap up an early copy at the Little Brown booth.I was intrigued to learn from the author’s note that the poem has often been misattributed to Cullen and also to Maya Angelou. Perkins is gracious in his Author’s Note, remarking, “I’m honored that my poem has been associated with these two gifted writers, but I’m glad that the world can now learn about the poem’s true roots” as a “closing song for my children’s musical, Black Fairy and Other Plays” published in 1975. I’m glad for this, too, and I’m also glad for the rich visual interpretation that Collier brings to the affirming, inspiring text and its unabashed centering of Black children in the book and as its audience.Cover image of Hey Black Child fromhttps://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/useni-eugene-perkins/hey-black-child/9780316360302/The direct address of the title and body of the text is affirmed and expanded by front jacket art that “shows the face[s]” of two Black children. A boy stands to the left in profile, anticipating the opening of the cover, and a girl stands next to him, her face turned toward the reader, her eyes looking outward to meet the viewer’s gaze. Collier’s decision to expand beyond the title’s singular “child” with this depiction of the two children presents an inclusive vision of childhood that allows neither boyhood nor girlhood to be the default for childhood.Image shows front and back covers of Hey Black Child.And there’s more: open the book to look at the back of the jacket and we see another Black boy and girl there, this time with a boy looking out at the reader and a bespectacled girl looking to the right. It’s here, too, that Collier introduces a visual motif, brightly colored balloons, that is present throughout the picture book as a connection between the spreads that adds a sense of joy and levity to his illustration. Another prominent motif in the collage, rays of light, cross the spine to unite the front and back of the jacket and to graphically underscore the hopeful, encouraging tone of the book as a whole.Picture book scholars Nikolajeva and Scott write that “a character gazing from the picture straight at the reader/viewer may be apprehended as an ‘intrusive’ visual narrator” who, in essence, breaks the fourth wall between the world of the book and the world of the reader, perhaps evoking a greater sense of alignment and intimacy between the character(s) and the reader(s). I believe that to be the case here, where the outward gazes of the girl on the front of the cover and the boy on the back are inviting, open, warm, and just the slightest bit impish. They act as both antidote to and movement beyond the limited and limiting images of Black childhood that so often emerge in children’s books and other media as they embody the same spirit that I’ve seen in so many of the photos and videos shared online under the hashtags #BlackBoyJoy and #BlackGirlMagic.Interior art follows suit, with the children depicted on the jacket each starring in a separate series of spreads with words and pictures that affirm their individual potential and greatness. At book’s end, Collier shifts to use photographs of real Black children, many of whom gaze out at the reader, to reinforce the closing line “Do what you CAN DO/And tomorrow YOUR NATION/WILL BE WHAT YOU WANT IT TO BE.” This shift in media underscores the book’s earnest effort to communicate its message to Black child readers, saying in effect, your photo could be on these pages, too.Throughout, the picture book offers what Critical Race Theory would call “counter-narratives” or “counter-stories” to dominant discourse about Black childhood, resisting engagement with, or even overt acknowledgement of, stereotypes and what Solórzano and Yosso call “majoritarian stories of racial privilege.” Writing broadly about stories (not just literary ones, but ones that might be described in Barthesian terms as “mythologies,”) they continue:We define the counter-story as a method of telling the stories of those people whose experiences are not often told (i.e., those on the margins of society)…Counter-stories can shatter complacency, challenge the dominant discourse on race, and further the struggle for racial reform. Yet, counter-stories need not be created only as a direct response to majoritarian stories. As Ikemoto reminds us ‘By responding only to the standard story, we let it dominate the discourse’ (136). Indeed, within the histories and lives of people of color, there are numerous unheard counter-stories. Storytelling and counter-storytelling these experiences can help strengthen traditions of social, political, and cultural survival and resistance. (32)So what are the counter-narratives in Perkins and Collier’s picture book? As a multimodal text, we must examine those offered by words, and those offered by pictures. In terms of the text, Perkins offers a general counter-story of Black childhood as the locus of potential, possibility, and capability. The lines on the first spread read: “Hey Black Child/ Do you know who you are?/ Who you REALLY ARE/ Do you know you can be/ What you want to be/ If you try to be/ What you CAN BE.”These affirming words don’t offer a specific vision for who the Black child addressee is, which leaves the door open for Collier to move from the general to the specific in his artwork. And, as in other titles such as Martin’s Big Words, Dave the Potter: Artist, Poet, Slave, and Trombone Shorty, in which he revels in visual metaphor and pushes well beyond mere redundancy between text and art, Collier rises to the occasion with aplomb. The first line is accompanied by an extreme close-up of the same picture of the boy depicted on the back of the jacket, his larger-than life, smiling face filling the recto and arresting the reader’s gaze. Never mind “show[ing] the face,” Collier exalts it. Turn the page, and Collier interprets who this boy “REALLY [IS]” as a crowned young Black man with the transparent form of the African continent superimposed on half of his face. This is not the same boy, but perhaps an ancestor, communicating the notion that the child on the prior spread is descended from royalty; he is, by extension a young king.In the foreground of this picture are collaged photographs of art supplies, which set the stage for the culminating spread in this series in which the young boy, himself now crowned, stands at an easel where he paints a picture of a dancing girl wearing a hair bow that looks like a crown, too. This portrait anticipates the next series of words and pictures, which are devoted to the girl who meets the reader’s gaze on the front of the jacket. Perkins’ lines again offer a general counter-story and ask, “Do you know where you are going/Where you are REALLY GOING/Do you know you can learn/What you want to learn/If you try to learn/What you CAN LEARN.” Collier’s art then steps in with specifics, depicting this Black girl as a dancer and a pianist. While collaged sheet music on two spreads reference first the eponymous text “Hey Black Child” and then the song “We Are the World”, I can’t help but think of Nina Simone’s recording of “To Be Young, Gifted & Black”, with lyrics by Weldon Irvine in honor of playwright Lorraine Hansberry as I read these spreads.The girl’s counter-story of learning and musical achievement gives way to the next counter-story of strength and doing as Collier depicts the Black boy from the front of the jacket in a sequence that positions him as a protester holding a partially obscured sign that can nevertheless be read as stating “BLACK LIVES MATTER.” The next spread shows a Black man in a suit and tie, perhaps this child all grown up, and standing at a podium giving a speech before an audience. In the crowd is a Black girl sitting atop a man’s shoulders, holding what seems to be a pair of binoculars to her eyes, which send beams of light up and over the head of the man at the podium and into the sky. The next sequence of images belongs to her, the girl who is depicted on the back of the jacket. The text pulls in phrases from the prior three sequences, starting with: “Hey Black Child/Be what you CAN BE.” Collier once again builds on this general affirmation to offer a specific counter-story of this young girl, first shown looking skyward, as an astronaut. Although I’ve now owned this picture book for three months, I haven’t read it with my Black children, who are now ages 11, 12, 18, and 20. Truth be told, I don’t get much opportunity to read picture books with any of them now, which is the bittersweet reality of their progress into ardent independent readers who have little interest in shared reading (though I can occasionally convince the younger two to read with me). But, I have read this book with my 2½-year-old, Jesse, who is White. One reason I’ve done so is that this book, like others that overtly name race, challenges White readers to resist the socialization that has taught so many of us to adopt a “colorblind” mentality, something that librarian Jessica Anne Bratt addresses in this series of google docs, “Talking about Race at Storytime.” I thought about this as we read Hey Black Child and named his Black brothers and sisters and his Black uncle as people who were or are Black children like those in Perkins and Collier’s book. Doing so afforded us the opportunity to also name his Whiteness, and my own, and to acknowledge his other sister as Latina. Furthermore, the text’s repeated refrain “Hey Black Child” denies Jesse as the addressee, which is an experience I want him to have since so much of his world (in children’s books and beyond) is skewed toward privileging him and his experience, as this oft-cited info-graphic reveals:Image shows infographic by David Huyck from Dr. Sarah Park Dahlen's website athttps://readingspark.wordpress.com/2016/09/14/picture-this-reflecting-diversity-in-childrens-book-publishing/.As did I, Jesse will grow up “Reading While White,” and I think it’s crucial that he experience counter-stories that decenter Whiteness and affirm Blackness and the experiences of people of color and First/Native Nations to avoid the inflated sense of importance that comes through in the image above. Along these lines, reading this book with Jesse made me recall the SNL sketch “The Day Beyoncé Turned Black” that aired in 2016 shortly after Beyoncé performed “Formation” at the Super Bowl. In it, White cast members are disoriented at best, and appalled at worst, at the ways that the song centers Blackness. “Maybe the song isn’t for us,” exclaims a White man.“But usually everything is!” cries a White woman in response. I don’t want Jesse to “los[e] his damn White mind” when he comes upon (counter)-stories or songs that decenter Whiteness, and providing him with a rich array of books and media that don’t imply him as the reader is one step in raising him to resist expecting to find what Rudine Sims Bishop calls “mirrors” at every (page-)turn. A photo of Lambert's son looking at the astronaut illustration.  But there are other reasons to share this book with Jesse, and with all kids, even as I think it’s crucial to affirm Black children as its implied audience. First is the potential for connection with characters that transcend race. When we got to the picture of the Black girl suited up for spaceflight, Jesse exclaimed:“I want to be an astronaut like her, too!” He’s stated this ambition for the past few months, prompting me to find lots of books about space for him, and I am grateful for this title’s counter-story of a Black girl aspiring astronaut that is now part of his repertoire of images of role models. And finally, I want this book in every child’s hands simply because it’s the work of one of the most gifted artists, of any race, of our time.Cover image of Martin's Big Words from http://doreenrappaport.com/martins-big-words/.           Collier’s work consistently astounds me, particularly due to its use of visual metaphor and how this element of his vision for expanding beyond literal interpretations of text places such trust in his readers. I wrote about my now-twelve-year-old Black son’s deep appreciation for Dave the Potter: Artist, Poet, Slave by Laban Carrick Hill for the Horn Book when this title won a 2011 Caldecott Honor when I was on the committee, but it was a prior Caldecott Honoree, Martin’s Big Words, written by Doreen Rappaport that first introduced me to Collier’s genius.          Talk about “show[ing] the face!” The bold jacket art with its beatific portrait of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. eschews any display type and relies on the reader to recognize his image and be pulled into the book to read about him. Once inside the book proper, Collier alternates between images that bear close literal relationship to the text, such as this one below depicting a moment from King’s childhood: Image shows a Black child pointing at a water fountain with \"white only\" painted on it from http://www.thepicturebooklab.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/WP_20131013_00620131013160345.jpg. and those that demand that the reader critically examine how seemingly unrelated imagery interacts with the text:Image shows a collage illustration of a Black child standing before the American flag.          When I’ve read this book with children, they’ve often paused to respond to this picture, which, with its subject’s direct gaze at the reader arrests attention and compels analysis. Readers have commented on how tattered the flag is and how this symbolizes the ways that our country hasn’t lived up to its ideals and promises. They’ve commented on the emotion in the girl’s face, saying that it shows resolve, anger, disappointment, and more. They’ve said that she is one of the Americans the text says King cared about, and they’ve speculated that she’s from another part of the world since the text makes such a reading possible, too. They’ve commented on how the words present a moment of triumph, with King winning a Nobel Peace Prize, while the picture, which doesn’t depict him at all, instead expresses a sense of struggle or determination and hardship.  “It’s like she’s what he’s fighting for,” said one child at storytime, and shivers ran up my spine.           My storytime work is grounded in an interactive method I call the Whole Book Approach, which asks children to make meaning of picture book art and design. Another discussion about a picture book paratext, the endpapers, similarly moved children’s reading of this book from one that emphasized hope, and justice, peace, and light, to also acknowledge struggle, injustice, and oppression. The endpapers depict luminous stained glass windows, and Collier writes in his Illustrator’s Note, “For me the windows are metaphors in a lot of ways. In the dark they blaze out at you like beams of light. The multicolors symbolize multi-races. Stained-glass windows are also a vehicle to tell the story of Jesus. And, whether you’re on the inside or the outside, windows allow you to look past where you are.” In a second-grade classroom where I was leading storytime with this book, children picked up on this intended symbolism and drew upon prior knowledge to name King as a minister and to comment on the central role of the Black church in the Civil Rights movement. And then, just as I was about to turn the page, a child spoke up and said, “I see prison bars, too.”An image of the endpapers of Martin's Big Words, which resemble stained glass windows. You could’ve heard a pin drop.            After everyone absorbed it, this comment prompted the group to talk about how King and other activists were imprisoned, and how they put their lives and their freedom on the line to try to create change in our country. Our entire storytime was enriched by an openness to discussion about not just progress and hope and love, but resistance and oppression and hate.            Based on his Illustrator’s Note, Collier didn’t intend for readers to “see prison bars, too” when they looked at these endpapers, but I’m generally more interested in reader response than I am artist intent. I can’t un-see those prison bars now, and I’m grateful for that since they open up possibility for deeper, richer interpretation of the book as a whole and for how Collier places trust in the reader to make meaning of the complex relationship between art and text. This, it seems to me, is the hallmark of his entire career: to invite children, and especially Black children, to critically engage with how words and pictures work together to tell (counter-)stories, convey information, and to invite us to inhabit a world where the aspirations, potential, and strengths of all children are validated and held up to the light. --------1  Nikolajeva, Maria and Carole Scott.

The cover of The Lost Kitten.After discovering a “skinny, scruffy kitten” on their doorstep, Hina and her mother are surprised when a cat (with other healthy kittens in tow) nods at them from a distance, as if signaling to the humans to help. “They had never been asked to do something by a cat before.” The mom and daughter spring into action, cleaning the animal and crafting a litter box, bed, and collar for it. Hina’s not psyched about the whole idea at first (“If we’re going to have a kitten I’d rather get a cute one”), but her affection grows after taking in the kitten’s gorgeous blue eyes and spending time holding it. (“Just thinking about the kitten made her happy.”)  When Mom heads out for cat food and leaves the kitten in the care of Hina (and Hina in the care of her grandmother), Hina loses sight of the kitten. She searches far and wide—under furniture, in the bathroom, outdoors—and recalls a frightening time when she was lost and separated from her mother at a store. (“That was how the kitten must feel.”) With empathy and resolve, she keeps searching, even as the sun starts to set and a breeze whooshes through her yard. She heads inside (dropping her shoes in the genkan) and as she Image from static1.squarespace.com in which Hina and her mother meet the kitten. reaches for her coat she discovers the kitten napping peacefully on her sweater. Mom returns home with the cat food, and Hina, overcome with relief, has a cry. When she’s done, she and her mom decide to name the napping kitten “Sleepy,” and smile at the surprise in store for Grandma when she learns about the new pet. The story ends with questions from Hina to Sleepy: “‘Sleepy, let’s be friends forever, okay?’ Hey, stop sleeping so much. Are you listening, Sleepy?’”Sakai’s illustrations, rendered with paint and pencil, contain scratches and smudges which give them texture and a feeling of coziness. When the scary flashback occurs, Sakai smartly uses blue page borders to separate this part of narrative from the rest of the story. The mostly-subdued color palette makes for stand-out moments of vibrancy, such as spotting the kitten’s bright blue eyes for the first time or the beautiful pink sunset. The gentle, translated text is full of poetic simplicity and it highlights the wonders of each moment. In both text and image the story is child-centered, as Hina’s experiences, questions, emotions, and concerns are what pull readers in and weave a suspenseful and heartfelt story out of a seemingly ordinary turn of events.

Dad tells the boy, “I used to fish by a pond likethis one when I was a boy in Vietnam.” It’s not something Dad talks aboutoften, his time in Vietnam, and we soon find out why: “He and his brotherfought side by side [in the Vietnam War]. One day, his brother didn’t comehome.”“I get it to light with just one match.Dad nods.”We also see how much the boy idolizes his father through theinterplay between Phi’s text and Bui’s art. When he starts the fire going “withjust one match,” the boy earns a nod of approval from Dad – a close-up (in itsown panel) shows the boy’s proud smile. And when Dad relays this story oftriumph to Mom, the boy stands in profile, smiling warmly in the foreground whilehelping in the kitchen.I get the same feeling from Bao Phi's writing in A Different Pond that I do when I read Mattde la Peña’s Newbery Medal-winning text for LastStop on Market Street. I don’t make this comparison lightly. There are manydistinguished picture book texts published each year, but this one is specialin the way it conveys so much emotional depth with such understated grace. “A kid at my school said my dad’sEnglish sounds like a thick, dirty river. But to me his English sounds likegentle rain.”“I rub my hands together, yawn, andlook up to see faint stars like freckles.”Phi’s attention to detail establishes a real sense of placewithin the text while presenting an authentically loving father-sonrelationship.“Dad hands me a sandwich… ‘Careful ofthe spicy stuff,’ he says.There’s half a peppercorn, like a moonsplit in two, studded into the meat.”Illustration detail from Thi BuiAnd then there’s Thi Bui’s accompanying artwork.

If you haven’t seen it yet, find a copy post-hasteand read it. You’ll thank me later!) Bui’s meticulous use of color and shadowestablish the moody, EARLY morning setting. As the boy and his dad driveto the pond, blues and grays of the pre-dawn street contrast with the goldenleaves of the trees. The spread showing their arrival at the pond shows thewild, scrubby slope down to the water in a surreal range of bluish-greens (italso shows clearly the “No Trespassing” sign along the fence). And on their wayhome, as the rising sun shines through the car windows in “just a faint tint,blue and gray instead of gold,” Bui expertly uses those blues and grays (with ahealthy dose of black shadow) to create a moody light quality that feels justright for that moment of the day.The best picture books have a feeling to them that can behard to pinpoint; the word “lasting” comes to mind. For me, A Different Pond has a lasting qualityto it that few other books have. Buy it, gift it, and read it to the children in your life.by Sam Bloom"},

When Abuela senses something is up, she *wink winks* at Arturo and gives him an old cigar box from his late abuelo. The box is full of letters written directly to Arturo, reflecting Abuelo’s faith, devotion to his family, and interest in the works of Martí and the power of words to make change (“sometimes life’s answers are hidden in poetry”). The city owns the restaurant property, and the Zamora family’s lease is up for renewal. An out-of-touch real estate developer from out of town named Wilfrido Pipo decides he wants to build an exclusive complex on the same spot. With a proposed gym, spa, movie theater, cocktail lounge, and more, “Pipo Place” has almost everything a neighborhood could ask for—except La Cocina de la Isla. The fate of the restaurant and neighborhood will be determined at a city council meeting. In a burst of confidence inspired by Abuelo’s letters, Arturo musters up the courage to tell Carmen how he feels and to speak out about the proposed development. When the family faces a huge blow and all feels lost, Arturo finds encouragement in his Abuelo’s words: “A VECES LO TIENES QUE ESCRIBIR / SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO WRITE IT DOWN.” In the days leading up to the city council’s big decision-making meeting, Arturo and his community unpack what the “exclusive” and “V.I.P.” development might really mean for them, and they reflect on how Abuela and the restaurant she built nourished the neighborhood in more ways than one. When it comes time to learn of the city council’s decision, Arturo, with friends and family at his side, has found peace and is ready to move forward no matter the circumstances. The book concludes with a collection of easy-to-make recipes shared by the author.   While the Wilfrido character feels a bit contrived (he is a capital-V-villain, as the line between “good” and “bad” is quite clear in this story), the young characters and their interactions remain front and center. There is an authentic back-and-forth between Arturo and his buddies, reflected in their teasing Twitter DMs (“@PITBULL4LIF: wat up, bro!!”) and their dialogue while they shoot hoops (in these scenes, their words are formatted like a screenplay, with actions in italics). Arturo’s conversations with Carmen are awkward to the point of hilarious. (\"'Um, are you hot?' I asked. 'I mean not hot like hot, but like sweating hotness…from the heat, and, um, you’re in Miami.'\") Readers with limited Spanish language skills can make meaning of words and phrases using context clues that have been elegantly woven into the narrative. And there’s nothing like an author reading their story in their own voice. I listened to the audiobook CD and I found myself reflecting on the Hear Diversity campaign as I read, knowing that my appreciation and understanding of this book was enhanced through Cartaya’s narration.The Epic Fail of Arturo Zamora also provides an engaging and informative introduction to the life and work of Martí. Readers will no doubt be inspired to learn more when they are finished reading—perhaps through the new biography by Emma Otheguy and Beatriz Vidal.Last but not least, here’s a video of Cartaya sharing real-life places in Miami that inspired the setting. Show this to kids as you booktalk and then prepare to add a bunch of names to your holds list. Better yet, buy more than one copy if you can.Reviewed by Elisa Gall"},

Orca, 2017. 159 pages. 978-1-4598-1583-4. Age 8 and olderClick here to purchase.How do we teach children about racism in the past, so essential to addressing racism that exists today? One approach can be found in Speaking Our Truth, in which author Monique Gray Smith invites young readers along on a journey to learn about residential boarding schools, a painful dimension of Canadian (and United States) history.  “For some of you, this may be a time of significant change in your understanding of Canada’s history. It might be the first time you’ve thought about what reconciliation means and, more specifically, what it means to you and what your role in it is. Simply reading this book is an act of reconciliation. So good on you! Some of you may have started the journey well before picking this book up. I welcome you all to the journey. In my Nihiyaw (Cree) language, we say tawâw, which loosely means ‘there’s always room.’ For you, for me, for your friends, your family, your community. There’s always room.” The reconciliation she refers to is “the restoration and healing of a relationship. In Canada, this refers to the process taken on by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to revitalize the relationship between the citizens of Canada (Indigenous and non-Indigenous), as well as the Nation-to-Nation relationships with the government of Canada.” As in the United States, residential schools in Canada brutalized Indigenous children and communities for well over a century. (In Canada, residential schools existed for 165 years--the last one closed in 1996.) Forcing Native children to leave their families to attend the schools was only the first act of violence of the residential schools. Once at the schools, children were forbidden from speaking their Native language and from other expressions of their Native identity and culture; they were often beaten and malnourished. Those who survived the physical trauma carried psychological scars. The impact on individuals, families, and entire Indigenous communities has been lasting.In telling readers about this history and its continued effects on Indigenous people and communities today, Smith emphasizes that this is not just Indigenous history, it is Canadian history and important for all kids in Canada to know and understand.  She talks honestly about the pain inflicted by the residential schools, and the racism that was the basis for the schools and many other government policies impacting Indigenous people in Canada. Smith is honest, but she is gentle, too, repeatedly addressing readers directly and acknowledging that this information may make them uncomfortable, or sad. Perhaps they have family members who are survivors. Perhaps their ancestry is Anglo and they are feeling guilt. This is a difficult journey, she notes. Take care of yourself along the way. A number of personal narratives from residential school survivors as well as insight from intergenerational survivors--children and grandchildren of survivors who are growing up in families where the trauma’s effects are apparent--are included.  But the first story she shares is her own, discussing her struggle about whether or not she wanted to write this book. “You see, part of my inner turmoil was because my own ancestry is both colonizer and colonized. I am of both Indigenous and non-Indigenous ancestry.” (Smith is of Cree, Lakota and Scottish descent.)She continues, “I hope this book will inspire you. Some of it might hurt you or make you angry. That’s okay. Use it as fuel to help make change in a positive way.” To help with this, she also shares the voices from a diverse group of contemporary children navigating their way through this history, and provides a number of resources at volume’s end. Between the covers, Speaking Our Truth looks at first glance more like a 4th grade textbook than the trade book it is. There are bold-faced terms in the narrative defined in the margins, “Reflections” asking readers questions (e.g., “What parts of this history were new to you?” “How do you see this history continuing to unfold in Canada?” “How would you feel if you were told you could no longer speak your own language?”), and many other design elements typical of educational texts. Don’t let the textbook-like appearance deter you from putting this on the nonfiction shelves in a public or school library. The remarkable tone is so UN-textbook-like, inviting readers in, guiding them along on the journey.. Don’t let the fact that it’s about Canadian history deter you either. Not only for the obvious reason that this is our history too: generations of Native children in the United States were also forced to attend boarding schools, with the same traumatic impact on individuals, families and communities. But also because the racism that made the boarding schools possible applies to so much of our collective history around race. And to our lives today. Among the terms defined for young readers in the opening pages of this work are “racism,” “systemic racism” and “internalized racism.” Name it. Define it. Teach it. Learn about it._________________________________________________Monique Gray Smith also has a new picture book out from Orca:You Hold Me Up. Written “in the spirit of reconciliation” and “dedicated by the author to “children, families and staff of Aboriginal Head Start programs,” the repeated refrain “You hold me up” is followed by examples of ways in which we--adults, families, communities--nurture and affirm children in small, meaningful acts every day. “You hold me up ….when you play with me ... when you augh with me….when you listen to me. \" Check out Debbie Reese’s review!"},
{"title": "Looking Back: Charlie & the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl", "date": "Friday, September 15, 2017", "text": "By Elisa Gall“Nostalgia for childhood favorites is not evidence that a children’s book is not racist.” A photo of the tattered paperback of Charlie and theChocolate Factory I read as a child.Dr. Sarah Park Dahlen, Assistant Professor of Library and Information Science at St. Catherine University in St. Paul, MN, recently shared this quote from her syllabus for her Dismantling Racism: Social Justice and Children’s Literature class. It was a fitting quote for me to see, because I saw it right when I started to reread Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, hands-down my favorite book from childhood. It’s the first chapter book I remember reading independently (and then rereading again and again and again). When my class studied it in second grade, my teacher (who, BTW, had one of those pillow-filled bathtubs one could lounge and read in) snuck handmade golden tickets into a few of the chocolate bars that she later gave to us. I was one of the lucky students to find one, and my prize was not having to ask permission to get a drink from the water fountain for a whole day. In the years that followed, I’d speak to my preference of Joseph Schindelman’s illustrations over Sir Quentin Blake’s, and to the 1971 film adaptation over the Johnny Depp version. I saw the book-inspired musical in London and trekked to Great Missenden to visit Dahl’s hometown and the Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre. The list of ways that this story has influenced my life could go on and on - it’s probably safe to say that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is what sparked my love of reading and children’s literature that I still have today. And it is also safe to say that the book is seeping with racism, as well as other -isms. That’s part of its influence too.I remember becoming aware of Dahl’s reputation as a bigot as I grew older, a reputation built on things he said and wrote (such as the line in James and the Giant Peach that reads, \"I'd rather be fried alive and eaten by a Mexican!\"). In high school a teacher shared that the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I grew up reading was an edited version in which “African pygmies” had been changed to bearded, troll-like Oompa-Loompas. (I later learned through Philip Nel that Schindelman had created illustrations for the original, and it took almost a decade for the edit. The 1964 text copyright remains.) In rereading the book this month, what struck me as strengths are the innovative mix of text and image (especially at the beginning when characters are introduced) and the light, whimsical, direct voice with lots of CAPITALIZATION and exclamations! It’s all very theatrical, with exciting pacing and dare-I-say delicious descriptions of Wonka’s inventions and sweets. But appreciation of those strengths can only happen if you aren’t distracted by the sizeism, colonialism, ageism, and racism also reflected in the book’s pages. Augustus Gloop is greedy. Being fat is described as “repulsive” and a moral failure. India is exotified as a place where Prince Pondicherry, a generic, turban-wearing “Indian Prince,” will not listen to Wonka’s wisdom and builds a palace made of 100% chocolate that melts in the burning sun. Charlie’s 90-something grandparents are bedridden and helpless, “shriveled as prunes, and as bony as skeletons...with nothing to do.” And the Oompa-Loompas, members of a “tribe” Wonka “imported” to live and “work” at his factory, perpetuate the myth of “happy slaves.” Wonka did them a favor, the thinking goes, because he got them out of a bad situation (he shipped them to his factory in humorously drawn boxes “with holes in them”). He is paying them, but let’s not forget it is in cacao beans, which the Oompa-Loompas are addicted to thanks to Wonka’s influence. Oompa-Loompas give “whoops” of joy and are described as wonderful workers who love dancing and music. They wear leaves, bang drums as they chant their songs, and arrive for service at three clicks of Wonka’s fingers. They are also test subjects for Wonka’s experiments, and he doesn’t show much remorse when those experiments go wrong. This Oompa-Loompa narrative normalizes enslavement and reinforces racial stereotypes as well as colonial mentality—that these Oompa-Loompas are “better off” under the care (and control) of Wonka. I am reminded of a post by Daniel José Older in which he shares:Frederick Douglass never allowed himself to be photographed smiling so as not toperpetuate the myth of the “happy slave.” He also warned against being “told of thecontentment of the slaves, and...entertained with vivid pictures of their happiness.” He was astonished to encounter northerners who believed the slaves’ song was proof of their happiness: “It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake. Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy. The songs of the slave represent the sorrows of his heart; and he is relieved by them, only as an aching heart is relieved by its tears.\"I also can’t stop thinking about the messaging around Charlie, the poor, White, innocent “hero,” who stays silent and follows the rules while evil works around him (and benefits from that evil in the end); to me, Charlie exemplifies many of the faults with a “non-racist” versus “anti-racist” ideology.It’s not that I didn’t remember these issues until my recent reread. It is that every time that critical voice or bubble of discomfort arose, I chose not to pay attention to it. It was selective memory, because I did not want to let this book go. I have to call that what it really is: White fragility (and other kinds of fragility, considering the myriad ways this book is problematic). I can’t help but wonder now if my love for this book wasn’t caused by Dahl’s craft at all, but by the joy of remembering reading the book all by myself, or the kickass teacher who made her class immersive and fun (let’s not forget the bathtub). Still, it's worth noting that criticisms of this book are not new. As long as there have been children's books, there have been people working against racism in children's books. My teacher was awesome in a lot of ways, but she did put time and effort into a celebration of THAT title. What if we had read something else? Or what if we had read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory critically? This book has played a huge role in my life and I can’t and won’t deny that; but, I can no longer defend this book or its author, nor can I stay silent during kidlit gush-fests where both would otherwise go uninterrogated. I’m going to keep my brittle paperback, just as I will continue to work to acknowledge and unlearn the influence of this story and others on my own socialization (which still plays out in my thoughts and actions today). But I don’t have to KEEP loving this book, singing its praises, or perpetuating the cycles and systems of oppression it supports. I can find different books—BETTER books—and experience new memories with all of the readers for whom stories are created and shared. From here, there’s only forward.SaveSaveSaveSave"},

Henot only misses Jermaine, he feels guilty because they weren’t speaking at thetime Jermaine was shot and killed. Lolly is also keenly aware that, at12, he can no longer move freely through his Harlem neighborhood as he oncedid. He’s now old enough for territories to matter as crews of older boys andyoung men eye boys like him and his best friend, Vega, looking for theirallegiance or to label them as trespassers.Two surprises gifts as Christmasapproaches illuminate both possibility and disconnect for Lolly. A neighbor andchildhood friend of Jermaine’s gives him a book about New York Cityarchitecture. It’s out of the blue: Lolly has never expressed interest inarchitecture. But he does love building with Lego and has amassed a collectionof kits he's assembled following the exacting specifications of their various instructions. Thebook inspires Lolly to tear them all apart and start over, the only guide hisimagination. And he imagines a lot--not just buildings, but a story to go withthem. In the meantime, one of Jermaine’srecent friends, a guy Lolly knows it’s best to avoid, stops Lolly on the streetwith a gift, one he says Jermaine wanted Lolly to have.  It’s a gaming system. But Lolly doesn’t likeplaying video games. He’s never really liked playing video games. The gift is asymbol of how little his brother, once Lolly’s idol and protector, had grownaway from Lolly and also, Lolly realizes, from the person he once was. In fact,the reason Jermaine wasn’t speaking to Lolly at the time of his death wasbecause Lolly refused to start working with him, even though Lolly wasfulfilling the promise Jermaine himself had extracted long before, back when helooked out for Lolly: Never do what I do.Offering hope, acknowledging hardship. Debut author David Barclay Moorewrites with open eyes about thechallenges of Lolly’s life as a Black boy in a poor neighborhood on the cusp ofyoung adulthood, and with eyes just as wide he shows the many things Lolly hasgoing for him: his terrific mom and her wonderful girlfriend; his dad, who maynot be around every day but is a constant regardless; the community centerdirector; the neighbor who gave him the book; his best friend Vega; the listgoes on. Lolly’s creativity, too, is a force he can harness.Lolly also makes a new friend inRose, a girl who faces challenges of her own, When Rose first starts building withLego next to Lolly, he’s resentful of the invasion of what he considered hisown private space. Then he sees her work as competition. Slowly he starts torespect what she’s accomplishing. He begins to see beyond her nickname (“BigRose”) and reputation (as a bully) and silence to the particular girl, one withwhom it turns out he has common interests. It’s never clear whether Rose’s sometimesdifficult personality is rooted solely in external influences (she saw hermother killed), innate, or a combination of the two. It doesn’t matter to theirfriendship, and I admired the way Moore lets this relationship change and growover time, never rushing it. It’s the characterizations that madeThe Stars Beneath Our Feet truly shinefor me, revealed through masterful dialogue and authentic interactions amongpeople in Lolly’s family and community on every page, in almost every scene. Iboth laughed and cringed at the realistic way the kids at Lolly’s afterschoolprogram talk to one another, sometimes skirting the edge of meanness with theirtakedowns, sometimes crossing over; just as believable was the way they offertrue and generous admiration for what Lolly and Rose accomplish when they build.I didn’t always find the plot astight as the characterizations are wonderful, but even when I felt it loosened,the heart of the story maintained a powerful gravitational pull. When Lolly’sbest friend Vega, hovering on the edge of something dangerous, makes a decisionthat comes down firmly on the side of hope with Lolly by his side, it’s amoment that underscores everything Moore has revealed so beautifully: theimportance of friendship and family and community and creativity on children’sability to see beyond the hardship of their lives to the possibility of them. Heisn’t suggesting it’s easy. He is making clear it’s essential: without hope,there is no choice or agency.Reviewed by Megan Schliesman"},

Click here to purchase.Inspired by the song “Cielito lindo” and dedicated to Apolinar Navarrete Diaz, the author’s mariachi musician abuelo, this picture book captures the lyricism of love, life, and family.Endpapers open to blue-hued photographs arranged in a scrapbook style, with musical notes surrounding them. One caption reads “Me looking up fondly at Abuelo in Dallas, TX, 1984,” and it sets the scene—communicating to readers that what follows is rooted in reality and personal to the author. The title page shows a young girl (presumably Dominguez) and a boy (her brother) cradling a guitar. On the next page, the guitar is swapped for a guitar-holding man (their abuelo). This family clearly loves music and each other.The text explains how Abuelo visited from Mexico (with his guitar) once a year, and how he would tell his grandchildren about his life and sing to them every night: “...if we were sad about something, he would say, 'Sing, don’t cry.' 'Because singing gladdens the heart.'\" The illustrations are colored and shaded in a way that gives each figure texture, resulting in an overall feeling of coziness. Some spreads are full of white space whereas other illustrations fill the page. Dominguez zooms in on Abuelo’s hands while he strums his guitar, and shows his back while readers see his grandkids looking up at him admiringly. These varying perspectives pull readers in and bring memories and other sensory details to life. Parallels between the kids and their abuelo are drawn, including that each generation had to “travel a long way to find a new home.” Abuelo assures, “Some things may be lost forever, it’s true. But maybe that makes room for new and wonderful things to be found.” Through panels (each box is color-coded to match each character’s outfit), Dominguez draws parallels between each character, the losses they’ve endured, and how something hopeful sprouted up as a result of each challenge. (Abuelo lost his leg as a child, and he found music; the girl lost a stuffed animal, and she found a puppy; her brother didn’t make it with the football in-crowd, but he found a new friend and sport with soccer.)The book's main text ends with, “'When you are misunderstood, and when people are unkind, remember—sing, don’t cry, even if it is only in your soul.' 'And always,' Abuelo told us, 'I will be singing with you.'” Dominguez concludes with an author’s note, explaining more about her abuelo’s history and optimism, and how “I carry that optimism and song in my heart.” With carefully chosen text, tenderhearted illustrations, and perfectly paced page turns, this book has a warm, melodious rhythm of its own. Don’t miss it.Reviewed by Elisa Gall"},

HarperCollins Publishers, 2017.  9780062215918.Click here to purchase.Clayton Byrd is cut from the same cloth as his grandfather, Cool Papa Byrd.  Both of them live for the blues, a love Clayton’s mother (Cool Papa’s daughter) cannot understand.  When Cool Papa Byrd suddenly dies, Clayton, determined to run away and join the Bluesmen (Cool Papa’s band), begins a journey that takes him deep into the New York subway system and into a tenuous alliance with a beatbox crew.It just about goes without saying that this latest offering from Rita Williams-Garcia is packed with vivid descriptions and language so poetic it may as well be music, but my favorite aspect of this book was the strength of Cool Papa Byrd’s character and presence, even though he dies less than twenty pages in.  The potency of the (borderline-unhealthy) love Clayton feels for him is palpable, as is his grief when Cool Papa dies; but Ms. Byrd’s feelings towards him are far more negative, as evidenced by her need to sell every one of his possessions after he dies.  This book could be foundational for a curriculum on unreliable narrators, as the voice occasionally switches from Clayton ’s perspective into Ms. Byrd’s point of view, such as when she recalls childhood memories of wishing, fruitlessly, for Cool Papa to “drop anchor at their house and take her to baseball games.”Caregivers and teachers could also use Clayton Byrd Goes Underground to delve deep into the idea of practicing compassion for those who see the world differently than we do.  For both Clayton and his mother, the blues are inextricably linked to Cool Papa Byrd; but for Clayton, this connection manifests as he adores, fears, and idolizes his grandfather, while for Ms. Byrd, it translates to bitter resentment and anger as she identifies her father’s love of the blues as a force that made him “light on the fathering side.”  The ways they grieve for Cool Papa Byrd are in conflict; Clayton clings to every bit of him that he possibly can, to the point of running away from home, while Ms. Byrd feels compelled to cleanse every reminder of his existence from her life.   If young readers can understand that both of these behaviors stem from an unhealthy form of grief for a larger-than-life character, and that ultimately, Clayton and his mother have to accept not only Cool Papa’s death but also the different impacts he continues to have on both of their lives, they will be well-positioned for a more understanding and compassionate existence.  I highly recommend Clayton Byrd Goes Underground, especially for classrooms and family read-alouds.Reviewed by Allie Jane Bruce"},

Click here to purchase. Published in 2016, this novel set in current-day Brooklyn is suitable for a revisit every September. To adults, 9/11 may not seem that long ago, but for young readers who were born after–or infants during–the tragic day it may as well be ancient history. Here, 10-year-old Deja is coping with a number of challenges, all stemming from her family’s homelessness due to her ill father’s inability to work. She is responsible for caring for her two younger siblings while her mother works, and she’s starting fifth grade in a new school near the shelter where her family has just moved. She has a defensive shell built up from poor experiences, including bullying at her previous school, and is surprised to find the students and her new teacher friendly and welcoming. It soon becomes clear that the chasm between her experiences and background knowledge and those of her new classmates is wider than expected. The principal has decided that everyone in school needs to study 9/11, and Deja doesn’t know anything about it. Her sense of alienation and her suspicion that everyone else knows something she doesn’t, is heartbreakingly articulated; she thinks to herself she is “too dumb” to be at the school. The process by which Deja uncovers the meaning of 9/11 to her personally is compelling. Readers feel along with Deja as she learns the facts, including watching a truly horrifying video at a friend’s house. It turns out her father is ill because he had worked as a security guard in the North Tower, and is experiencing what adult readers will recognize as PTSD, as well as lingering asthma from inhaling ash. In a misguided but well-meaning attempt to protect Deja from the horrors he experienced first-hand, he’s insisted on hiding all information about 9/11 from her. Through his daughter’s growing awareness, and not without realistic anger, he begins to come to terms with his condition and seek healing. Some story elements do seem a bit facile. For example, Deja makes two new best friends unrealistically quickly, each of whose backgrounds serves to make a point about 9/11. Sabeena, a Muslim girl, recalls discrimination toward her family after the attacks, and Mexican American Ben’s father served in the military. However, the friends’ give-and-take is realistically done, and frankly, Deja’s ease in making friends comes as needed relief against the sadness of her family’s situation and the terrible facts of 9/11, none of which are spared here. This is a sensitive, credible portrayal of young people coming to terms with a major event in American history that is still affecting society today.Reviewed by Diane Bailey Foote"},
{"title": "Looking Back: Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli", "date": "Friday, September 8, 2017", "text": "By Allie Jane BruceWhen I was a kid, I luuuuuurved Maniac Magee. I swooned as I read about his superhuman athletic feats, howled with laughter at the zany idea that someone could be allergic to pizza, and cried like a baby when, halfway through the book, he walks silently out of town, his spirit crushed. I definitely had a crush on him. I read and re-read the book often enough to remember Jerry Spinelli’s mesmerizing, hilarious language and skillful employment of magical realism.I recently re-read it for the first time in at least a decade, and the experience was both nostalgic and gut-wrenching. I remembered enough to be prepared for the White savior element, but it turns out there was a lot I had forgotten--and yet--internalized.Before I go any farther, I need to say that while what follows is intensely critical, there is one part of this book that I still truly love, and her name is Amanda Beale. This smart-as-a-whip, book-loving, funny, kind, caring, and yet fallible Black girl is just about the only fully humanized and relatable character in the entire book. She is a grounding, heart-driven force in a story riddled with problems, and frankly, I think she deserves better.Onto the criticism. Much of the book hinges on the tension between the East (Black) and West (White) sides of the fictional town of Two Mills. Maniac (whose real name is Jeffrey) seems determined to breach the divide by inserting his White self into the Black side of town. Chapter One, which features an orphaned Jeffrey running away from his life with an aunt and uncle who refuse to talk to each other, establishes the book’s primary theme: Jeffrey’s refusal to live in a world in which people divide themselves. Thus, the book sets up a problematic analogy, in likening segregation produced by generations of institutionalized racism and systemic oppression to a house in which stubborn Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan, who won’t get divorced because they’re “strict Catholics”, have “Two bathrooms. Two TVs. Two refrigerators. Two toasters.” (p. 6)This is a racially privileged White person’s version of racism. This is a world in which racial differences are interpersonal and can therefore be pinned on people who refuse to speak to each other, not on systemic and structural inequities. A world in which there is only Black and White--no Native, Latinx, Asian, or multiracial people to complicate matters. An ahistorical world, in a fictional town in which Black people and White people really are separate but equal--and all it takes to breach these divisions is a plucky, racially colorblind White kid who dares to try. Indeed, the prologue asserts that Maniac’s “legacy”, his “monument”, is the fact that nowadays, “sometimes the girl holding one end of the rope is from the West side of Hector, and the girl on the other end is from the East side” (p. 2). This White savior mentality pervades the entire book.As do stereotypes. I was struck by the stereotypical ideas and language that comprise Mars Bar, the Black, masculine, slang-heavy aggressor who calls Maniac “fishbelly” and “could back up traffic… while he took ten minutes to cross the street” (p. 37).  Likewise, the McNabs are White, masculine, mean, bullying, old-school racists who live in a disgusting home (“Cans and bottles lay all over, along with crusts, peelings, cores, scraps, rinds, wrappers--everything you would normally find in a garbage can” [p. 131]) and are preparing a bunker for what they’re sure will be an upcoming invasion by Black East siders (Giant John McNab describes Black people as “bloodthirsty for whites, like Indians in the old days, Indians on a raid… They're today's Indians.” [p. 152]). Let’s face it, although Spinelli never uses the term--the McNabs are “white trash,” and convenient for any White people looking to distance themselves from racism (why self-examine yourself for racism when you can pin it on those types of White people?). Although some scenes, most of which occur at the end of the book, inject a degree of humanity into these characters, the relish and vividness with which Spinelli describes these caricatures is palpable.These stereotypes--the \"dangerous Black man,\" the disgusting, bigoted \"white trash\" family, and the \"bloodthirsty\" (and extinct) Indians--imprinted themselves in my subconscious. Most perniciously, they reinforced in me a faulty analysis of racism itself. Racism, 12-year-old-me would have said, is because some people, like Mars Bar and the McNabs, are mean to people who look different from them. Never mind that this version of racism--which erases systemic and structural injustices--depends on stereotypes of Black male aggressors and White male rednecks in its own explanation for why racism exists.As I re-read Maniac Magee, I had a sudden flashback to my fourth-grade teacher reading it aloud. This teacher--a White woman--simply loved this passage:“For the life of him, he couldn’t figure out why these East Enders called themselves black. He kept looking and looking, and the colors he found were gingersnap and light fudge and dark fudge and acorn and butter rum and cinnamon and burnt orange. But never licorice, which, to him, was real black.”She dwelt lovingly on this passage, and professed that it must have been a decisive one in winning Spinelli the Newbery medal (not that she could have actually known). Why, I ask now, would someone who clearly doesn’t understand the distinction between race and skin color--someone who is comfortable exotifying dark skin with a surplus of edible metaphors--feel entitled to write a book on the subject? And why would the Newbery committee give a gold medal to a book that rewrites and nullifies an entire cultural identity to suit White fancies?(I’d like to go on a rant here about the overwhelming Whiteness of the Newbery, but that’s another post.)There was one more particularly nightmarish scene I’d erased completely from my memory. About three-quarters through the book, Maniac challenges Mars Bar to accompany him to the West side. Mars Bar, whose pride will not allow him to pass up a dare, accepts. Maniac--who knows full well that the McNabs are White supremacists who are literally building a bunker and planning to stock it with automatic weaponry to use on Black people--brings Mars Bar to a birthday party at the McNabs.  Yes, really. When Mars Bar asks about the bunker, Maniac tells him it’s a bomb shelter.Unsurprisingly, the party does not go well, but thankfully, Mars Bar leaves physically intact. Afterwards, Maniac ponders, “What had he [Maniac] thought? What had he expected? A miracle?” As it turns out, by his own admission, Maniac didn’t give it a lot of thought.Let’s unpack this. Maniac puts Mars Bar’s life in danger on a whim, an exercise in feel-good-y-ness that matters more to him than this Black kid’s life. Nowhere does Spinelli interrogate or problematize Maniac’s behavior. Maniac feels an intense sense of pride in Mars Bar (“this East End warrior” [p. 166]) for concealing his fear. Then, Maniac goes on his way, onto the next thing. His disregard for Mars Bar’s physical safety, and his inability to reflect on the fact that he put a life in danger, are, frankly, horrifying. Scenes like this are why it’s necessary to overtly and repeatedly assert that Black Lives do Matter.During an open-fire-hydrant block party in which Maniac plays and dances with Black (East side) people, an elderly Black man approaches him. It is one of the most upsetting, chilling scenes in the book--certainly written to be more upsetting than the scene in which the McNabs attack Mars Bar. Spinelli describes the man’s voice as “deep and thick and sort of clotted, as though it had to fight its way through a can of worms before coming out”. He tells Maniac to go home. “Never enough, is it, Whitey? Just want more and more. Won’t even leave us our little water in the street… What happens when we go over there?” (p. 60-61) he asks, as he gestures to the White, West, side of town.He’s got a point."},

Not because it isn’t worthy, but because I’d rather spendthe time and space diving into the wonder that I found in Wild Beauty, which addresses racism and classism and homophobia,misogyny and many forms of exploitation, in the contextof a work of magical realism in which what is impossible in the world in which we live when we close the book is, of course, themagic, while the realism of the singular story is grounded in the tragicbelievability of all those terrible things in the real world we wish didn’t happen but do.  WildBeauty introduces the Nomeolvides women, who have been keeping the groundsof La Pradera in full bloom for generations. Not by planting and tending, but bydigging their hands deep into the soil and drawing forth flowers and trees intheir maturity: colorful blossoms, green leaves, ripening fruit. This is theirgift.And curse. Beforethe Nomeolvides came to La Pradera, they were accused of being witches. TheBriar family, the White owners of La Pradera, gave them safe haven in exchangefor them transforming the landscape of the estate. That wasgenerations ago, but the Nomeolvides have never left. Not just because the worknever ends. Because they can’t. The land has bound them to it. They can take atrip into town, but if they try to leave for good they will die, gasping for air as pollen fills their lungs.And there’smore.  When a Nomeolvides woman falls inlove, the land will take her lover—cover him with the earth. For generationsthey’ve sent their lovers away to save them.At the centerof this story is Estrella Nomeolvides, one of five young women who are cousins on the estate. The cousins have ashared secret: they are all in love with Bay Briar, a young woman they grew upalongside and who has now inherited La Pradera. None of them dare to act onthat love for fear Bay will disappear. And none of them believe their mothercould possibly understand her loving another women. Then a dusty,dirt-covered, skinny young man, barely more than a boy and brown-skinned likethe Mexican American Nomeolvides, appears one morning at La Pradera, risingfrom the soil. His clothes are worn and outdated. Is he a lost lover of along-ago Nomeolvides woman returning to the world? He has no clear memory ofhis past. They call him Fel: three letters written on the ribbon pinned to his shirt.Four of the cousins treat him like a brother, but Estrella’s feelings for Felare anything but familial. Not long after,Reed Briar arrives at the estate. Arrogant, entitled, he intends to challengeBay’s inheritance. Bay, and the aunt who raised her,were Briar outcasts. It turns out Reed is too, but he’s been raised with privilegeand hubris and is seeking to find his way back to the center of the family’sand society’s good graces. The Nomeolvides are the means by which he intends toimpress. Estrella understands this. They all do. But she is the one who agreesto give him what he wants, hoping to leverage greater safety for the rest ofthem.  Reed’sarrogance and attitude, his greed and his lust for power, are symbolic of thehidden history of the Briar’s and La Pradera; a history that turns out to bethe source of the curse that ties the Nomeolvides to the land, and seals theirlovers’ fates; a history rooted in race and class prejudice.  Woveninto that history are the generations of Nomeolvides women who were complicitin covering it up without knowing. “Nomeolvides”:Do not forget. But it was the land that never forgot what happened. And it’s theland that has demanded some form of justice ever since, doing what the world of White men and privilege refused to do.Wild Beauty unfolds in its own time under the surehand of Anna-Marie McLemore’s lush storytelling. Sensory-rich details create avivid physical and emotional landscape while the characters breathe on the page.There is magicand there is realism in Wild Beauty.  In the story, and in the real world, hoperesides in the space between them. Hope is what happens when lies becometruths; when mothers and daughters let go of their secrets; when gender doesnot define who we are or whom we love; when justice belongs to the living, andwe do not forget the dead.  Reviewed by Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "Looking Back: Where's Waldo?", "date": "Wednesday, September 6, 2017", "text": "By Elisa GallMartin Handford’s Where’s Waldo? (published as Where’s Wally? outside of the United States) turns 30 this year. To celebrate, Where’s Waldo? Destination Everywhere! will be released later this month. I first learned about the anniversary from Dr. Debbie Reese on Twitter: Debbie Reese's tweet reads, \"Hey, @Candlewick, did this stereotype get cut from the new 30th anniversary edition of Where's Waldo? I HOPE SO.\"The image featured in Reese’s tweet shows the backpack hauling, striped clothes & glasses-wearing Waldo character walking past a crowd, including two people lounging outside a tipi. They appear as stereotypes of First Nations/Native people, wearing generic headbands with feathers. One is smoking a pipe, and next to the pair is a brown dog with a headband and feathers atop its head. I did a double take after seeing the tweet, because I was a huge Waldo fan as a kid, and I did not remember that image from the series. As a child I owned a Waldo t-shirt, and as a school librarian I’ve probably checked out Waldo books to kids hundreds of times. I’ve even dressed up like Waldo for Halloween. But truth be told, it had been awhile since I’d spent time with the books. So today I sat down and did just that. My first reaction at opening Where’s Waldo? was feeling overwhelmed and overstimulated. Overstimulation might be an understatement. I didn’t know where to look (that’s the point of a search and find book, I suppose). A reader could spend a good hour on one spread alone, looking and thinking and wondering about each drawing, character, setting, and situation. There is A LOT going on. A chaotic sea illustration featuring the canoe scene described in the main text of the post.There are a lot of sophomoric, goofy moments happening, as well as a bunch of cringe-worthy ones, including the image Reese shared in her tweet and this image showing another group of “Natives” paddling a canoe amidst chaos in the sea. Instead of lounging, this time they are in battle position: one has mouth agape and leg up, as if chanting, while his canoe-mates are either paddling or holding weapons at the ready. Reading this post Reese wrote several years ago helped me to clarify why the feathers and stereotypes represented here are so problematic.The introduction page for \"Trouble in Old Japan.\"I noticed that people of color and First Nations/Native people are present in Handford’s books, but often when real settings and cultures are present they are also used as props or gimmicks, such as in Where’s Waldo Now? when Waldo travels the globe. The images from “Trouble in Old Japan,” in which Waldo comes upon sumo wrestlers and samurai, show how this setting-specific representation is also troubling. An illustration of sumo wrestlers and samurai featuring Japanese stereotypes. Many of Handford’s fantasy worlds in Where’s Waldo? The Fantastic Journey lack racial diversity and feature what appear to be huge crowds of White human characters. This subtly (and wrongly) communicates to First Nations/Native children, children of color, and White children that White is the default for representation - and in these make-believe stories, First Nations/Native children and children of color either do not exist or are not welcome.A scene with flying dragons, a castle, and a White crowd of characters. A scene with many White characters wearing blue, green, or red clothing.I’m sure that some will say that you can’t criticize the whole book or series because of a few images, or that these images are somehow less likely to be noticed on account of the clutter and topsy-turvy storytelling happening around them. I do believe that there is so much crammed into each spread that a reader might notice something different every time they read the book; that makes me aware that with more time examining these books, I’ll likely come to see additional elements of racism and other systems of oppression reflected in them. Even if we aren’t consciously taking all of the messages in at each read, we are seeing them and they are affecting us. I didn’t even REMEMBER these scenes from my childhood, but that doesn’t mean that they didn’t have a role to play in my socialization. It’s not that I didn’t see them, but rather that I didn’t notice them or understand them.The publisher’s site for the 30th anniversary book promises “12 classic scenes as you’ve never seen them before,” and that has me wondering what will―and hoping what will not―be reflected in those scenes. I’m not ashamed that kid-me loved these books, and in many ways I think Handford’s complex visual storytelling is part of why I’m so into visual narrative today. I am frustrated, however, that I didn’t have a teacher or role model to help me notice and question these images. I worry about how many teachers and caregivers today are looking at Waldo books and celebrations with children without reflections or critical conversations. A great anti-bias lesson in a classroom might be to look through these books and try to spot and discuss the -isms and -ias. A different kind of search and find book, if you will."},

One day Michael spotsMina at an anti-immigrant rally (his father is a leader of the far-right“Aussie Values” group; she is a counterprotester with a sign reading, It’sNot Illegal to Seek Asylum). Soon thereafter Mina appears in Michael’s class at ultra-poshVictoria College. At first Michael and Mina are at odds, with Michael spouting out things he’s heard from his folks (of his beliefs, Michael says, “I wear my politics likehand-me-down clothes: Some bits feel like they don’t fit properly, but I expectI’ll grow into them, trusting that because they’re from my parents they’ve comefrom a good source”) and Mina understandably taking offense. But Michaeland Mina grow closer, eventually bonding over their love of indie music andschool assignments. They begin to develop complicated and strong feelings for each other. Bit by bit, Michaelbegins to discard articles of the “hand-me-downclothes” he inherited from his ultra-conservative parents, and he and Mina fall in love.Chapters alternate between Mina’s and Michael’sfirst-person narratives. Both voices ring true. As a White cishet male, Imyself have never been subject to microaggressions. Reading about Mina’sexperiences as a young Muslim woman in overwhelmingly White spaces waseye-opening and painfully realistic. Each tiresome interaction serves as amirror for young readers from marginalized groups while providing a window intoa different experience for those readers who, like me, have the privilege ofnot having to worry about loaded questions like, “Where are you from?” Abdel-Fattahalso succeeds in portraying a White cishet male who has to make some toughdecisions, but does so with thoughtfulness and empathy. In this way Michael is something of a model for how White people can move beyond binary thinking and take part in meaningful conversations with family and friends.The Lines We Cross would be a great title for high school literature circles – the format, the plot and characters, and the timely topic would make for great discussion.

Click to purchase.The cover of The First Rule of Punk.To María Luisa, or Malú, two years is forever. It’s the rest of middle school, and the amount of time that she and her professor mom will be living in Chicago thanks to a too-good-to-pass-up job opportunity at a Midwestern university. Two years seems like a lifetime spent away from Dad, Florida, and the record shop Dad owns and lives above. (“Spins & Needles wasn’t just a record store; it was my second home.”)Malú identifies as punk (through style, skateboarding, music, zine-making, attitude, and more). She connects to her White, punk dad but struggles with pressure she feels from her mom (who Malú nicknames “SuperMexican”) to be “señorita-like” and more connected to her Mexican identity. Things in the Windy City don’t start off very well. Malú’s Blondie-inspired makeup conflicts with the dress code at Posada Middle School, and Selena Ramirez, a bully from class, calls her a “coconut” (brown on the outside, White on the inside). In time, new friends, Latina mentors, and musicians come into Malú’s life. She and a group of buddies start a band (the Co-Co’s), but she hides it from Mom, worried about what she’ll think of it. When the Co-Co’s are denied a space on the Fall Fiesta talent show program by school administrators, the bandmates take matters into their own hands and stand up for what they believe. In the process, Malú learns a few things about being punk—and being herself.An example of a zine portion of the story.The First Rule of Punk is a middle grade novel that will appeal to fans of comics and other visual narrative. (Suggest it to readers who like Victoria Jamieson’s Roller Girl!) Pérez includes examples of the zines Malú creates and shares, which show depth to character by allowing her inner thoughts and elements of backstory to be communicated in a visually poetic fashion. The protagonist’s voice is endearing, engaging, and funny (if even a little bratty at times), and readers will root for Malú all of the way. If you’re a librarian or a teacher (or a teacher-librarian), consider using the book to inspire kids to make and distribute their own zines. Pérez created this handy guide so there are no excuses not to. (And pssst: if you want to listen to some tunes while you read or create, there’s a playlist too.)Reviewed by Elisa GallSaveSave"},

{"title": "The Messages We Receive and the Voices We Hear", "date": "Wednesday, August 9, 2017", "text": "About a week ago, I learned through Alia Jones that Simon & Schuster re-released Popcorn by Frank Asch as a board book. If you’re unfamiliar with the book, it’s about a bear named Sam who hosts a B.Y.O.P. (Bring Your Own Popcorn) house party when his parents are away. The kids pop so much popcorn that it fills the home (and the book’s pages) before the partiers eat their way out of the mess. When Sam’s parents return home (with a surprise popcorn treat for him) he has learned a lesson that is as big as his stomach ache—but it’s not about cultural misappropriation. You might be wondering what costume Sam chooses for his wild-and-crazy Halloween party. Or maybe you already have predicted it:﻿﻿﻿﻿An illustration from Popcorn where Sam dons generic \"Native\" clothing and looks at his reflection in the mirror. The cover of Popcorn by Frank Asch shows Sam with a feather atop his head.Critical conversations about this book are not new. Discussions about the effects that costumes and other inauthentic First/Native Nations imagery and actions have on youth are not new. In “White America needs to stop assuming Native American culture belongs to them too” authors Dina Gilio-Whitaker (Colville Confederated Tribes) and Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz explain that historically “playing Indian at its core reflected an inherent hatred of Indians, not love or affinity. From the Boston Tea Party forward, US Americans obsessed on vanishing Indians in a multitude of ways that translated into trying to become them, or at least using them to project new images of themselves as they settled into North America and left Europe behind.”Around the same time I learned about the Popcorn re-release, I picked up Always, Abigail, a contemporary middle grade book by Nancy J. Cavanaugh. Less than 40 pages in I encountered a passage where characters pretend to do a \"Native American sister ritual\" complete with a made-up chant:A photograph of pages 34-35 of Always, Abigail.Oof. A few days later I was making my way through my library's board books section and I came upon this title:The cover of Spot: My Toys by Eric Hill.A page from Spot: My Toys which shows a teddy bear and a tipi labeled as a tent.Double oof. This was all happening while USBBY was responding to feedback about its “Indigenous Experience in Children’s Books” panel for the upcoming October 2017 conference in Seattle. (If you are unfamiliar with that situation you can read a summary and letters to USBBY leadership from Debbie Reese, Naomi Bishop, Naomi Caldwell, and Christy Jordan-Fenton at AICL.) USBBY conference organizers have adjusted the schedule since questions were raised, but it remains that there will be no American Native Tribal representation on the panel. Oof doesn’t seem to cut it.This was all in about a week’s time - a week where I also saw a play based on Moby Dick which used the words “savage” and “cannibal” to describe characters from Queequeg’s fictional indigenous homeland, and where through Netflix I watched a contestant on the Great British Baking Show be commended for a “Wild West” themed cookie sculpture. I might not see it at every moment, but this disregard for First/Native Nations people is happening constantly. It is all around us, and all of us—kids and grown-ups alike—are soaking in the normalcy of it. Babies who grow up reading Spot end up being kids who read Popcorn, tweens who read Always, Abigail, and adults who fail to interrogate media which reflects cultures as costumes and fodder for play. This is not about good people and bad people—we all receive messages that influence how we see the world. But which messages will we notice? Which will we ignore? Which will we reject? The cover of Fall in Line, Holden! by Daniel W. Vandever.This week I ALSO found out about Fall in Line, Holden! by author-illustrator Daniel W. Vandever (Navajo). You can buy it here for your home or your library. I ordered a copy and I am excited to receive it in the mail, especially after watching this author interview in which Vandever discusses the importance of a contemporary story that also does not forget history. How many books like Always, Abigail and Popcorn are there in the world for every Fall in Line, Holden!? Too many. It’s not because of a lack of First/Native Nation creators and leaders. Those who are there need to be listened to and supported. They need to be given space on panels about their experiences and identities, and space on panels about other topics too. Imagine if there were twenty books like Fall in Line, Holden! or Hungry Johnny for every Spot book. Thirty Indian Shoes and In the Footsteps of Crazy Horse for every Always, Abigail. Instead of Popcorn getting re-released, imagine if publishers were investing in more books like I Am Not a Number, My Heart Fills With Happiness, We Sang You Home, Sky Sisters, Mission to Space, The Birchbark House, and more. These books might not always be available through your regular vendors or on Amazon, but they can be bought, placed face out on displays, given as gifts, added to reading lists, and read with children. Native books exist. Native voices exist. Do we see them? Do we make space for them? Do we listen to them? I am reminded of a talk I heard journalist Jacqueline Keeler (Navajo/Yankton Dakota Sioux) give this spring. She asked the audience a question on which I continue to reflect, and I invite fellow non-Native folks to reflect on it too:“If you realize you are a colonist, then what are you going to do about it?

{"title": "Reviewing While White: Medical Mayhem by Stephanie Bearce & Eliza Bolli", "date": "Thursday, July 20, 2017", "text": "By Elisa GallCover image of Medical Mayhem from:https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51KXTtZcQ8L._SX311_BO1,204,203,200_.jpgIn Twisted True Tales from Science: Medical Mayhem, Bearce’s casual writing style describes facts about medicine and medicinal history for a middle grade audience. Bolli’s black and white sketches mix with photographs and colorful cartoon-like art to give the pages a humorous, accessible feel. But that comical tone will end for many readers (as it did for me) when they come upon back-to-back sections introduced with two large images. Image 1 - from \"Try Tobacco\"The first image is part of a section called “Try Tobacco,” which details how First/Native Nations peoples in the 15th century used tobacco as a toothpaste and also to relieve earaches, toothaches, and itches or sores from snake and bug bites. The author mentions how figures like Columbus and his crew “certainly weren’t the first” on North and South American land and that the continents had “thriving populations who had established trade routes, governments, and medicines.” The Spanish’s believed superiority over the First/Native Nations people is referenced, but rather than explain how those beliefs resulted in harmful actions and genocide, the author writes that the “Spanish missed out on the opportunity to learn...about healing plants and medicines from the Native Americans.” No specific tribes are named nor are there any references to modern-day (or present tense) First/Native Nations peoples. The image of a smiling, cigar-smoking man with braided hair, a nose and face striped with blue paint, and three feathers above his head overpowers the section; it is a recognizable stereotype of a First/Native Nations person. Dr. Stephanie Fryberg, a member of the Tulalip Tribes and an Associate Professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Washington, found in a study the negative effects that stereotypes like this can have on First/Native Nations children and their self-esteem.Image 2 - from \"On Pins and Needles\"The next section, titled “On Pins and Needles,” focuses on traditional Chinese medicine, specifically acupuncture. The author explains how many people still use the practice today, and writes, “It seems that the ancient Chinese physicians may have had the right cure after all.” The illustration accompanying this section features another stereotype; it is a character with big teeth and slanted eyes that is reminiscent of Cousin Chin-kee (an amalgam of notorious Asian stereotypes) in Gene Luen Yang’s American Born Chinese. In an interview about American Born Chinese, Yang speaks about that character and the emotional impact that visual stereotypes can have on readers. With Yang’s book, the stereotypes are confronted and interrogated. In Medical Mayhem, both images sit unchallenged underneath their respective chapter headings. Regardless of the artist’s intent, these pictures communicate messages to readers about First/Native Nations and Asian people; they dehumanize them and mark them as “other,” reinforcing White superiority. While some readers might claim that the book contains several caricatures of different types of people and identities represented, White people have the luxury of seeing caricatures of them as comical and benign. It can't be ignored that caricatures and other grotesque distortions have been used historically (and still function today) to perpetuate stereotypes; these stereotypes influence actions and behaviors which can harm members of minoritized groups in very real ways. This book and some of the conversations I’ve had around it remind me of this image Dr. Grace Yia-Hei Kao recently linked to on the blog affiliated with the Women’s Studies and Religion program at Claremont Graduate University:A triangle-shaped visual representing examples of overt and covert white supremacyfrom https://radicaldiscipleship.net/2017/07/05/white-supremacy-overt-covert/.There are some elements of racism and the White supremacy embedded into our culture that seem “obvious.” Then there are those that are more subtle, that are hidden or masqueraded as socially acceptable. While discussing this book with colleagues and friends, the issues with this book’s images seem more out in the open, above the line. I can’t assume that every reader will look at these images and see “obvious” stereotypes, but many readers I’ve spoken with are also troubled by the illustrations. This leads me to remember that some creators and editors didn’t see it. It wasn’t obvious to them (either that or they chose to ignore it).In Is Everyone Really Equal?, Özlem Sensoy and Robin DiAngelo explain the dynamics of White racial superiority and the indirect messages White people receive about superiority.  They write, “...[the messages] come at us collectively and so relentlessly that resistance is virtually impossible. While we may explicitly reject the notion that we are inherently better than people of Color, we cannot avoid internalizing the message of White superiority below the surface of our consciousness because it is ubiquitous in mainstream culture.”To me, that’s important to remember too, because even as I am aware of problematic books and work to review these texts critically, they are affecting me and the readers with whom I share and discuss them. They are reflecting and perpetuating cycles of oppression and dominance, as symptoms of current injustices but also as media influencing how the next generation is socialized. That pushes me to question what I don’t yet know or see, and to keep working to move that line down, lower and lower, until no norms of White supremacy (whether overt or covert...explicit or implicit...in that triangle graphic or not...in books, within myself, or elsewhere) are ever deemed acceptable or excusable.Update 7/23/17: The publisher of the book, Prufrock Press, responded and announced that they would be making changes to the book after Dr. Debbie Reese contacted them on Twitter. Dr. Reese is sharing that exchange and more information on the American Indians in Children's Literature blog.SaveSave"},
{"title": "The White Canon of Schools", "date": "Friday, July 7, 2017", "text": "The work of making books for children and teens more diverse and inclusive is ongoing.  How do I know?  MANY People of Color offered specific examples throughout the American Library Association conference in Chicago. One area of work that needs attention is the continued Whiteness of the literary canon, especially in our K-12 schools.  During his 2017 CSK Honor speech Jason Reynolds (video) recalled a discussion with his college English professor.  Their debate was focused on Reynolds’ interest in writing a thesis about the expansion of the traditional canon to acknowledge the contributions of the wide diversity of U.S. authors.  His White professor would not accept this idea.  This White gatekeeper of culture said a work must “shape and shift the face of literature” to be considered canonical.  Reynolds offered some remarkable examples (Nikki Giovanni, Ralph Ellison, Zora Neale Hurston, and Phillis Wheatley to name a few). The professor denied all of these possibilities. Will you do the same?Let’s talk about the work to be done in our high schools. If you work in or liaison with secondary schools what are the titles students are required to read (i.e. the canon)?  Steven Wolk reported the results of a national survey he conducted to answer this question.  The top ten titles (with a three way tie for 10th) identified in his article What Should Students Read? (Kappan Magazine V91 N7 2010) were:The Great GatsbyTo Kill a MockingbirdCatcher in the RyeLord of the FliesRomeo and JulietThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinnMacbethAnimal FarmOf Mice and MenHamlet, 1984, The Things They CarriedAccording to this survey the White canon maintains a firm grasp on the reading lives and imaginations of all secondary students. Wolk said of his findings “When looking at what students are required to read in school in 2010, it might as well be 1960.” These books are required reading. Think about the dynamic of a system that continues to force a diverse student body to read mostly White male authors.  Compulsory reading of the White literary canon is one way White supremacy is expressed and sustained in schools. Are the required books in schools near you overwhelmingly White?  Can you use your power to make change? What will be the pushback?  How do we redefine classic?  The first Printz award winning book, Monster by Walter Dean Myers, shaped and shifted the face of literature - right?! United States schools were legally segregated until the 1960s.   Would it be reasonable to establish sometime after Brown vs. Board of Education as a timeframe to select our readings?  Reynolds presented the need to make the expansion of the canon a reality in our K-12 schools. This is part of the work. I don’t have the answers to all of these questions.  But, I do know we need to get to answering them without delay."},

My friend’s acknowledgement pressed me to remember that while the whiteness in that room is not surprising, I can’t let myself “get used to it.” It needs to be at the forefront of my mind. I get to choose every day whether institutional racism in my world and in my field bothers me or not...whether to notice or think about it or not...when for others that whiteness is poking at them day in and day out, causing pain and planting weights I won’t ever have to carry.As much as conferences exhaust me, I love connecting with people and learning ways to improve in my practice. I get energized and often have a feeling of being part of something bigger than myself. This too, is complicated. While there is work being done to dismantle racism in the field (and it is worth noting that much work is being done and led by people of color and First/Native Nations folks), youth librarianship still has so far to go. That I feel energized is partly dependent upon others feeling exhausted...that I feel seen and understood and welcomed is the other side of the coin which makes others feel excluded. I can’t forget this. I was at a session for ALSC (an ALA division to which I am a member) when the organization was described by a White woman as “welcoming” and “inclusive.” For many people, it is those things, but one White woman’s experience can’t be taken as universal—to accept that would be to ignore and undervalue Hathcock’s, Campbell’s, Ettarh's, and Dahlen’s experiences and shared perspectives. I can’t ignore how whiteness in my organization affects who does and does not see it as “welcoming” and whose voices have been heard and ignored historically—and are heard and ignored today. (Alec Chunn’s recent ALSC Blog post “And the Work Continues” speaks to some of these challenges.) Racism is embedded into our profession (and world) and just saying an organization is welcoming and inclusive doesn’t make it so.This conference I also found myself reflecting on Megan Dowd Lambert’s “alongside, not despite.” I am celebrating the ALA Youth Media Awards alongside the history of the awards Javaka Steptoe spoke to in his Caldecott acceptance speech. I am listening and viewing recordings of honorees and library leaders sharing their favorite award-winning books alongside being disappointed when they laud problematic books such as Island of the Blue Dolphins, The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses, and The Little House series. I am psyched about this year’s award winners and honorees alongside being aware that we have awards named after Theodor Seuss Geisel and Laura Ingalls Wilder, creators with complex legacies worth interrogation.The Geisel Award website says that Geisel was “always respectful of children.” The Wilder Award website shares that Wilder “wrote...primarily to entertain. She was interested in providing her young readers with information on how life was lived by their ancestors. Wilder’s books were not about the country’s leaders; they were about the country’s people.” I don’t believe these statements are wholly true. Geisel’s propaganda dehumanized people of Japanese ancestry and from other marginalized racial and ethnic groups—that work wasn’t respectful. Wilder’s books include characters saying “the only good Indian is a dead Indian.” To me, this represents a limited and biased view of who is included when we say Wilder’s books represent “the country’s people.”Without recognizing these creators’ whole legacies, what do having a Wilder Medal and a Geisel Award say about what—and who—the profession values? What do those stickers on books communicate to children? What feelings of inferiority do they generate, or what feelings of dominance do they support? Of course, these awards (monuments to Wilder and Geisel) aren’t the only instances in librarianship, the country, or the world where we have pieces of our unjust past and present made visible—in America we have money, textbooks, the National Anthem, and 4th of July celebrations, just to name a few. But when we celebrate an award honoring someone’s life’s work, and part of that work is in opposition to the core values of the association, we are being selective in what we are remembering. Sometimes we are consciously selective. Other times we are getting “used to it,” becoming comfortable. I need to step away from that comfort and remember that it is NOT okay. To me, this is all worth noticing, naming, and changing. Elisa GallSaveSaveSaveSave"},

And while we are tired – like, really tired, friends – it’s worth noting that there are different levels of “tired.” Check out these amazing post-ALA reflections from women of color to find out more about this:Edi Campbell discusses her conference experience in characteristically perceptive language here; at one point she references......this post from April Hathcock, wherein Hathcock discusses the exhaustion that comes from being a person of color in an overwhelmingly White space; and finally,Sarah Park Dahlen talks about her ALA here, finishing with a call to young librarians of color: “We see you,” writes Dahlen. “We’re here for you. We do the work for you, and the young people we all serve.”This one isn’t from a woman of color, but it’s another excellent wrap-up from the conference. ALSC (Association for Library Service to Children, a division of ALA) blogger Alec Chunn, who refers to himself as a white man in his post, talks about his takeaways from Annual, including a thoughtful discussion of a diversity panel in which the speakers of color experienced microaggressions at the hands of the White facilitator.Moving on from post-conference thoughts:Zetta Elliott has crafted an affirming and powerful essay on her work for ALSC’s journal, Children and Libraries;Roxanne Feldman writes about Gene Luen Yang’s Reading Without Walls challenge as seen through the eyes of a student of color’s mother; andAngie Thomas, author of the much-lauded debut The Hate U Give, writes about Why We Need Diverse Characters in YA Books.Here’s to a restful and restorative weekend for all of you."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: The Warden's Daughter by Jerry Spinelli", "date": "Friday, June 23, 2017", "text": "By Allie Jane BruceSet in the 1950s in the fictional town of Two Mills, PA, The Warden’s Daughter tells the story of 12-year-old Cammie’s spiral into depression and rage as she is forced to finally come to terms with her mother’s death and her own impending young-adulthood.I find much in this book troubling, but first and foremost Boo Boo’s character--or should I say caricature?  To me, she reads as little more than a stereotype of a sassy Black woman.  Here’s an excerpt:    “Now,” Boo Boo went on, “she be up there”--she gestured toward the apartment--“snootin’ around with y’all.  Like she live there…” She reached down between her bosoms and pulled out a huge red bandana.  She dusted my face with it, made me laugh.  “Y’all tell your daddy, fire that arnge hair and hire on Boo Boo.  Boo Boo’ll do him some dustin’ like he ain’t never seen!”Here, we see a Black woman caricatured and dehumanized (her speech and “bosoms” add to the stereotype) asking, like a good mammy figure, to do some cleaning for her paternalistic White prison warden.  I wonder how many times this will be read aloud in classrooms, and how the above section will land with Black students (particularly Black girls) in the room.  I also ask: why is Boo Boo the only one with a nickname (Boo Boo? seriously?) rather than a real name?Boo Boo’s function in the book goes from (stereotypical) comic relief to (spoiler) her suicide, which serves to propel Cammie even further into depression and self-destruction.  So, this Black character is functionally a non-humanized tool used to further the complex White main character’s development--a pattern that’s been identified as a problem in stories from Blood Diamond to To Kill a Mockingbird.I also question the taste and wisdom of presenting a nostalgic, voyeuristic view of prison (centering a White warden and his daughter) with no racial examination or unpacking.  No book is published or exists in a vacuum, and publishing The Warden’s Daughter in the face of public cries to examine mass incarceration seems willfully ignorant at best.  In a time when we need children’s books that shine a light on the structural racism embedded in the prison system, I hope that authors and publishers have more, and better, books in store.  Those seeking more relevant and topical prison stories might try Jacqueline Woodson’s Miracle’s Boys and After Tupac and D Foster.  Other ideas?  Leave them in the comments!"},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: Loving Vs. Virginia by Patricia Hruby Powell ", "date": "Thursday, June 22, 2017", "text": "Powell, Patricia Hruby. Loving vs. Virginia. Ill. Shadra Strickland. Chronicle Books, 2017. 260 pages. ISBN: 978-1-4521-2590-9One of my favorite podcasts is Politically Reactive hosted by comedians W. Kamau Bell (who has a new (adult) book out this season) and Hari Kondabolu.  The duo take on big contemporary issues with a healthy dose of humor.  There are plenty of episodes that make me laugh while simultaneously producing outrage.  In a recent episode the guys talked with Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Kahn-Cullors about a range of issues including the erasure of Black women’s voices historically (such as Fannie Lou Hamer) through to the present moment (including BLM). Thankfully Fannie Lou Hamer’s words are available to youth in Voice of Freedom: Fannie Lou Hamer, Spirit of the Civil Rights Movement, written by Carole Boston Weatherford and illustrated by Ekua Holmes (Candlewick Press).  When I read Weatherford’s book I was stunned by Hamer’s story and that I had never read or heard anything about her.  Weatherford and Holmes reclaimed a voice that was nearly lost to us. Voice of Freedom is an example of the  potential of youth publishing to uncover stories and voices that have been suppressed. It set a promising standard for future books.  This is why I found myself with a mixed reaction to Loving vs. Virginia:  A Documentary Novel of the Landmark Civil Rights Case by Patricia Hruby Powell, illustrated by Shadra Strickland. Powell does an admirable job of crafting a narrative of this interracial love story. It is ideally suited for a young adult audience.  The lives of the Lovings in picture book form never really worked for me. Powell has shared why she wrote this book as a documentary novel:“I could show the two falling in love and running through the woods at night. I could show Sheriff Garnet stopping Richard’s car and saying about Mildred, “Who you got in there?” rather than just writing that the sheriff was racist and stopped black people in cars in order to intimidate them. In a “documentary novel,” I could show all this and also create dialogue that draws the reader into the emotional heart of the story.”Accompanied by Strickland’s illustrations, these imagined scenes do serve to make the story more novelistic.  Do they serve to effectively document the past?  I’ve learned from many wise book evaluators that we must consider a book as it is and not as we wish it to be. Powell’s stated purpose was to add fictional elements that would string together the historical record.  She has accomplished her purpose on the fictional side. The beautifully illustrated fictionalized scenes are joined by period piece photos and newspapers. The book falls short when it comes to expanding the historical record. Why write a documentary novel if not to enlarge the factual knowledge about events? My disappointment is the information that was gathered but left out.  The acknowledgements by Powell reveal that she has done the hard work of a documentarian - beating the pavement to interview many people associated with or connected to the Lovings. Specifically, she met with members of the Rappahannock Nation, yet this thread of the narrative is missing in the story. There are many unanswered questions about Mildred Jeter Loving when it comes to her tribal ancestry.  Debbie Reese* has done exhaustive research on this topic at her blog American Indians in Children's Literature.   Here is a succinct timeline by Dr. Reese that highlights the conflicting social and political identify issues of a bi-racial woman in the U.S.“In the 1950s, Mildred Jeter said she was Indian. We don't know if she said that out of a desire to avoid being discriminated against, or if she said that because she was already living her life as one in which she firmly identified as being Indian. Either way, it is what she said about who she was on the application for a marriage license.In the 1960s, because Mildred Jeter and Richard Loving's marriage violated miscegenation laws, their case went before the Supreme Court of the United States. To most effectively present their case, the emphasis was on her being Black.In the 2000s, Jeter and her children said they are Indian, and specified Rappahannock as their nation.”This raises so many questions about the life of Mildred Jeter Loving. The information that was gathered by Powell from Rappahannock voices was left out of this story. I don’t believe this was a purposeful erasure by Powell.  Erasing First/Native Nation voices and lives is so deeply rooted in White culture it continues to happen with little conscious thought by most of us White folks. What is the purpose and promise of a documentary novel for children and teens?  To me, this documentary novel would reveal more about the Rappahannock Nation and Jeter's connection to it, and explore why Jeter felt the need to avoid the discussion amid the politics of the 1960s.~ Ernie Cox *We’ve received some criticism here at RWW for relying heavily on Debbie Reese’s scholarship on First/Native Nations.  For me there are two simple reasons I point to her work.  1.) She has done more research on this topic than anyone else I can find. 2.) She has influenced my thinking on this topic and I MUST give visible credit to her.  To do otherwise would mean erasing her voice (for more about how White men have systematically robbed the intellectual work of Persons of Color or First/Native Nations look at Hidden Figures or Breakthrough! How Three People Saved “Blue Babies” and Changed Medicine Forever by Jim Murphy.)"},
{"title": "Stepping into the Gap", "date": "Wednesday, June 21, 2017", "text": "Last week I read EdiCampbell’s blog post Voices.It’s been rubbingagainst my conscience--and consciousness--ever since.  Even as I wasreading it I felt it--the friction of absence, ironically. The discomfort ofacknowledging what I missed as a White reader. I was blind tothe racist image that can be seen in Voicesin the Park. I didn't see it back in 1998, when it originallycame out in the United States, and not the last time I took a look at it.I’m not going to spendtime talking about intent. I’m not going to spend time arguing whetheror not the image of the gorilla in the book is racist.  I’m not going tospend time criticizing or defending the book.  None of that is the pointfor me right now.The point is that myunderstanding of the gap between what I see in a book as a White reader andwhat readers who aren’t White may see was further illuminated. I’ve known thegap is there; I try to be mindful of it.  But it’s so much bigger than Irealized. A flashlight isn’t enough to illuminate it. A floodlight may not beenough. The only way to understand it is to step into it. The point, as Edi Campbellwrites, is about perception. And I need to be out in that gap, beyond what Ican clearly see, beyond my comfort zone, to begin to understand perspectives beyond my own.  What all of us see anddo not see is influenced by our experiences and by the internalized racism thatlives in our hearts and minds and pulses through society. We didn’t invite itto take up residence, but there it is anyway, blocking the light and we don’teven necessarily know it. But once we do know it,we can’t ignore it. Not if we want change in the children’s and young adultbook world and change in society as a whole. But as we in the children’s andyoung adult literature world have proven over and over, we often can’t talkabout the impact of racism on the work we do without backing into corners,because it makes us so uncomfortable. Sure those of us who areWhite readers and writers and editors and critics can live with our limitedfield of vision; we can choose not to step into the gap. We’re doing fine. Butothers are not. Sometimes they’re hurting. Sometimes they’re angry. Sometimesthey’re dying.  Any newspaper will tellyou this is not hyperbole. None of this is easy,for anyone. Edi asks herself, “When am I sensible and whenam I sensitive? When am I giving into my own colonized thinking (not seeingthings), when am [I] waking people up and when am I crying wolf? And what doothers think? Publishers have to be able to trust marginalized people when wesay ‘this is wrong’. Yet, when do we really know whether an image is being usedto exoticize human diversity (and reinforces age old stereotypes) or simply toexpress creativity? I do think this deserves a robust discussion, yes of courseon this blog, but even more so in publishing houses where images are createdand taken to our children.”Are we up for that? Arewe up for robust discussion, not to mention an honest accounting? Are we readyto step into the gap? If we aren’t, then I believe these very same conversationswe’ve been having in one way or another for well over fifty years will continuefor another fifty with too little to show for them. Gains will be made, but I’mguessing they will be made largely outside the publishing mainstream, notwithin it. Within it, we will be asking the same questions we’re asking now, wewere asking years ago.Gains outside themainstream are not enough. Good intentions are not enough, either.Edi asks, “In the 21st centurycan we not be sophisticated enough to overcome colonization of our minds?”I would also ask, Can wenot be courageous enough and compassionate enough to do so, either?

{"title": "Whose Reviews?  And Other Thoughts on Collection Development, Intellectual Freedom, and Diversity", "date": "Wednesday, May 31, 2017", "text": "I was recently talking to a library school class about intellectual freedom and the importance of following policies and procedures. At the same time, I was thinking about the discussions that have taken place around diversity in some of the collection development workshops I’ve been part of. And about the discussions that have taken place on social media, where cries of censorship are inevitable every time someone has had the audacity to suggest that a book by a beloved author or illustrator, or book that’s been collecting a string of positive professional reviews, or is an old favorite of many, falls short or is problematic when it comes to cultural representation and does not necessarily deserve a place in every library collection. I’ve written thoughts on this subject here, and here, but lately I’ve been thinking more about the relationship between collection development, intellectual freedom, and inclusiveness.I want to start by saying that yes, there are absolutely threats to intellectual freedom when it comes to collection development in libraries, even beyond the self-censorship that is an ongoing struggle in the work we do. For example, in many libraries, collection development is done with little time, and sometimes even less training. This can be especially true in smaller libraries and schools. A person may have great instincts but no access to, and sometimes even no awareness of, review journals and other professional resources. They may have had little or no exposure to intellectual freedom as a concept that provides the philosophical framework for collection development to help ensure access to relevant resources for the entirety of the communities they serve.Because of time or resource and other constraints, some may rely on Amazon to find out about books, or an algorithm to select what they’ll purchase. It may feel like an efficient or accessible or even necessary way to do the work of collection building, but at what cost?  It’s likely to eliminate or severely hamper the odds of acquiring books that are outside of the publishing mainstream, and undermines what it is we are striving to do in school and public libraries: meet the many and varied needs and interest of EVERYONE in our communities, an idea that goes hand in hand with intellectual freedom. These are sometimes the realities of working in understaffed and under-resourced libraries. Policies and procedures, if they exist, often have a tenuous relationship to what is actually happening. Or there’s this: the absence of board-approved policies and procedures for collection development and reconsideration of materials; or the subversion of policies and procedures by administrators and boards; or the stripping-down of policies and procedures to such a bare minimum that they provide no real guidance for either collection development or, in the case of a challenge, reconsideration (what, exactly, is the book being evaluated by to determine whether it belongs in the collection?). But even as we grapple with these things--and we have to grapple as a profession with all of this--we also need to be talking about how library staff are choosing the materials they are collecting specific to the question of whose voices are privileged and whose go unheard in that process.  So if you’re worried about intellectual freedom, ask yourself this:How does a school or public library collection development policy support—or inhibit—seeking out books beyond the mainstream—those from large and mid-size presses – to include collecting materials from small presses, or self-published materials, that may speak to the diverse population and diverse needs of their constituencies?Do policies and procedures demand professional reviews?  Many small press and most self-published book will never be reviewed in professional journals.  They may be highlighted on a website or blog devoted to promoting critical discussion of inclusion and diversity in books for youth, however.  The same kinds of blogs may also offer cultural critiques of books lauded in mainstream journals.  Chances are these voices are marginalized in terms of collection development, if they are considered at all.How can we address the fact that some of “procedure’s” part of policies and procedures may be undermining the critical need for building collections that are inclusive, reflective of and responsive to the needs of children and teens who are diverse themselves and living in a diverse world?I think we are at a critical juncture in our field as we consider the relationship between intellectual freedom and diversity and inclusion. They are foundational values to the work we do, in theory. In practice, the institutions that have developed—the review journals, the recommended lists, mainstream publishing itself and those acting as mouthpieces or influencers in social media and elsewhere—too often pit one value against the other.The bias toward traditional publishing—and Whiteness--in the field of children’s and young adult literature isn’t necessarily going to go away in the next five years. Some collection development policies already call for materials that are free of stereotype and bias. But openly acknowledging the bias toward traditional publishing in professional review journals and providing ways to counter that bias is another way to codify real commitment to inclusiveness in collection development. There is nothing wrong with citing the need for professional reviews and recommendations in policies and procedures. What’s wrong is narrowly limiting how we tend to define those sources.  In the 21st century, there is a significant critical discourse happening beyond traditional outlets, and policies and procedures should reflect this and validate a broader range of sources and resources for making informed, professional decisions: blogs on which librarians and educators of color review books and provide recommended lists are just one example. I invite you to share others. Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "Bring It Back: The People Shall Continue", "date": "Tuesday, May 2, 2017", "text": "Ortiz, Simon. The People Shall Continue. Ill. Sharol Graves. Children’s Book Press, 1977.  23 pages.  ISBN: 0892391251First published by Children’s Book Press (now an imprint of Lee and Low Books), Simon Ortiz’ epic, poetic story of Native peoples, The People Shall Continue, begins with creation.  It honors and reflects the differences among cultures (“Some say, ‘from the ocean.’ / Some say, ‘From a hollow log….’”) while also connecting the dots to demonstrate their similarities and cohesion (“The teachers and the elders of the People / all taught this important knowledge: / ‘The Earth is the source of all life… The people must be responsible to her.’”)Never does the People’s story fall into the “it was a simple paradise” trope.  As the People from the North, West, East, and South give and take meat, fish, corn, and hides to each other, there are cold winters, famines, and fights among them.  Their leaders stress the need for patience and respect for each other and the Earth.  Also absent is the “Columbus, the first European to discover the Americas, arrived out of the blue”  narrative.  In Ortiz’ story, the People remember visitors from a long time ago, who never stayed for long before returning home.  Likewise, nothing about European invasion is sugarcoated; the Spanish, “heedless and forceful,” come “seeking treasures and slaves.”  Soon, the English, French, and Dutch arrive as well, teaching about “a God whom all should obey” and claiming they are “special men of this God.”  Thus, Ortiz names the specific invaders, and though he does not cite Christianity by name, he includes it as a means by which European invaders justified genocide.As colonialism takes root, the People fight back.  Here, for the first time, Ortiz names specific tribes and leaders: “In the West, Popé called warriors from the Pueblo and Apache Nations. / In the East, Tecumseh gathered the Shawnee and the Nations of the Great Lakes, the Appalachians, and the Ohio Valley to fight for their People…”  There is no submission, no “lambs to the slaughter” narrative; and, after over 300 years of war, from necessity, the People “began to settle / for agreements with the American government.”  Next come the Treaties, then the missionaries, boarding schools, miners, railroads, forced resettlement--all are named for the destructive forces they were and are.  And yet, Ortiz grounds everything the People endure with survival and hope: “All this time, the People remembered. / Parents told their children, / ‘You are Shawnee.  You are Lakota… / This is the life of our People. / These are the stories and these are the songs. / This is our heritage.’”The book ends with a new beginning.  As the People learn and live history, they assert:  “We must fight against those forces / which will take our humanity from us. / We must ensure that life continues. / We must be responsible to that life. / With that humanity and the strength / which comes from our shared responsibility / for this life, the People shall continue.”  At this point, “the People”--which begins the book as a phrase that denotes Native peoples--expands to include all marginalized groups.  In that expansion, that invitation, Ortiz preserves, protects, and honors the humanity of everyone who has been dehumanized by systemic racism, poverty, and oppression.  In this poem, Ortiz suggests a way forward:  Recognize our shared humanity.  Work together.  There are more of us.  They cannot dehumanize us if we humanize each other.I can see a multitude of uses for this book in classrooms, as well as within families and communities.  An English teacher could dig into the language that somehow reaches the pinnacle both of melodic poetry and accessible storytelling.  A history teacher could use it as a framework for an entire curriculum or unit.  Book creators and publishers should take note of the last page, which models responsible bookmaking with a note that thanks people who helped by name, and also acknowledges that although the book is in English, it’s meant to be told orally by a tribal storyteller.I would love to see this back in print, ideally with new art.  Currently, while there is a wide variety of People portrayed (I am not expert enough to know whether the clothing and hairstyles are accurate), the backgrounds are one or two solid colors, and little storytelling happens in the pictures or in the turn of a page.  I would so love to see what Julie Flett would do with this text, were she given the opportunity to re-illustrate it…Please please please, bring it back!!-Allie Jane Bruce"},
{"title": "Alongside, Not Despite: Talking about Race and Settler Colonialism in a Children’s Literature Graduate Course", "date": "Thursday, April 27, 2017", "text": "Photo courtesy of Megan Dowd Lambertby Megan Dowd LambertI teach an elective graduate course called The Child and the Book at Simmons College, in which we critically examine how children, childhood, reading, and childhood reading are represented and constructed in fiction. We turn to scholar Rudine Sims Bishop’s framework of Mirrors, Windows and Sliding Glass Doors to consider who is included and who is excluded from those representations and constructions, we read adult memoirs of childhood reading, and we address the role of adult mediation in children’s reading transactions in various contexts. I open the semester with a reading memoir assignment that asks students to revisit a book from their own childhood reading in order to juxtapose their memories of reading it with their rereading as adults. This exercise highlights the slipperiness of memory, the pitfalls of sentimentality and nostalgia, and the instability of textual meaning when one rereads a text and it provokes responses unrecalled from an earlier reading, or when one considers readings from diverse perspectives and critical lenses. The majority of my students are White women, and in almost every semester I’ve taught this course I’ve had students use this assignment to revisit a book from Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House series. I also assign either Little House in the Big Woods or Little House on the Prairie in this course, and we inevitably discuss how rereading books from this series prompts students to critically examine the series’ overt racism and its attendant, unvarnished idealization of settler colonialism and Westward expansion. The most recent time I taught this class, I paused the discussion after a student said she was struggling with how to reconcile her fond childhood memories of co-reading the books with her mother and her contemporary recognition of how the series perpetuates ideologies that are abhorrent to her. “I feel bad saying I love these books despite their racism,” she said.“Then don’t say that,” I told her. “Say you love them alongside their racism and then interrogate what that means for you as a White reader.”I don’t think this directive made her feel less “bad,” but that wasn’t my goal. Some of the best learning can happen when students become uncomfortable with their readings and must interrogate them. To quote scholars Perry Nodelman and Mavis Reimer: “Although certainty is comfortable, it can also be oppressive and limiting.”1As a teacher, an important part of my role is to prevent such discomfort from devolving into defensiveness. My shift to have students say “alongside” rather than “despite” was spontaneous that day, but it ended up being an effective tool to push them beyond affective, nostalgic responses and into critical engagement with, not only books in Wilder’s series, but others we studied throughout the semester, as well. The word “despite” had allowed White students to neatly avoid confronting the text’s racism, and to thus cling to a reading imbued with a false racial innocence.  On the other hand, the word “alongside” prompted White students to grapple with the racial privilege necessary to say they loved a book even as they plainly regarded its racism. Then they progressed toward a consideration of how they would respond to a similar statement about a book that somehow denigrated a marginalized population to which they belong: “I love this book alongside its misogyny, its anti-Semitism, its Islamaphobia, its homophobia, its ableism, its classism…” Many of my students are future teachers and librarians, so we also considered how actions, not just words, can communicate attitudes toward particular books through decisions about displays, book-talks, programming, curriculum, or collection development.  During this discussion, a student asked, “But how can we know which book will harm or offend which readers, patrons, or students as we make these decisions?” This question got to the heart of the ethical dilemma that my students were grappling with in their thinking about real readers’ responses to literature and how they would serve them in their professional lives, and I drew on personal experience to help inform our conversation. I am not a librarian, nor am I a classroom teacher who works with children. But for nearly a decade I worked at The Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art, where I led drop-in storytimes and oversaw the Reading Library. Leading storytime isn’t a regular part of my work now, but whenever I do get the chance to do one as a volunteer at The Carle, in my kids’ classrooms, or as a visiting author with two picture books of my own, I’m careful to always include books by diverse authors and illustrators, and I track the titles I use in order to keep myself accountable (a practice I advocate to my students and that I stretch to model in my syllabus development). But today the young readers with whom I interact most often are my own children—three sons and three daughters, ages 2-20. Ours is a multiracial, adoptive, blended, queer family, and issues of representation, diversity and inclusion have been every bit as important in my family reading life as they have been in my professional life. Two of my sons are Black, and I don’t think they could be more dissimilar in temperament and personality. Their differences lead me to believe that my younger son is more likely to be personally harmed by a book’s racist content than his older brother ever has been—meaning  that he might internalize something he found degrading and have feelings of embarrassment, shame, sadness, hurt, or a questioning of his own worth.While I do believe the potential for individual harm is important, it isn’t the only factor when I (and, I’d wager, others, too) speak out about racism in books for young people, or when I guide my students in considering how their critical reading will inform their work in classrooms and libraries, or when I think about the books I choose to purchase or borrow for my family’s reading at home. In addition to weighing the potential for individual harm, I also think about how literature, like any art, not only both reflects culture and its attendant sociopolitical power structures, it helps create it. My older son might scoff at what he reads as a flat, racist caricature of a Black teenager devoid of humanity and brush it away like so much dirt off his shoulder, while my younger son might feel personally wounded and wonder “Is this how other people see me?”; but both are harmed and endangered by the perpetuation of dehumanizing depictions of Black people in a society rife with the stereotype of the Black male menace to society. The stakes are high in a society where the phrase #BlackLivesMatter needs routine explanation and justification, and where, as Native scholar Debbie Reese, a Nambe Pueblo Indian woman, reminds us in her work, Native people are routinely relegated to the past and erased as contemporary members of sovereign nations.2 I’m not naively saying that efforts to call out racism and idealized depictions of settler colonialism in children’s books will directly prevent the many violent manifestations of racism and attacks on Native sovereignty in our society. I am saying that the stories we tell (and read and teach and display and circulate) can subvert or reinforce underlying dominant ideologies of race and White supremacy that contribute to that violence and often allow its perpetrators to act with impunity. The work of critiquing books that reinforce such ideologies can feel woefully inadequate, especially when confronted with seemingly intractable indifference or resistance amid cultural forces that extend well beyond our bookshelves. But I’m hopeful when I see my students (all of them, not just the White students I reference above) push themselves in their critical thinking about books and about the child readers that they will work with in their careers.  There’s grace in this work, and it’s a necessary corollary to that of creating and advocating for diverse books that can help create a safer, more humane society for all.1 Nodelman, Perry and Mavis Reimer.

If it is historical in structure, does it use present     tense verbs that tell readers the Native peoples being depicted are part     of today's society?Megan Dowd Lambert grew up in Vermont and earnedher BA at Smith College and her MA in Children’s Literature at Simmons College,where she is now a Senior Lecturer in Children’s Literature.

{"title": "RWW Interviews: Elizabeth Denevi & Teaching While White", "date": "Thursday, April 20, 2017", "text": "By Elisa Gall I’m excited to continue our RWW Interviews series today with a conversation with Dr. Elizabeth Denevi. Elizabeth is the Associate Director for Mid West Educational Collaborative, a nonprofit that works with schools across the United States to increase equity, promote diversity pedagogy, and implement strategic processes for growth and development. Before that, she served as Director of Studies and Professional Development at the Chicago school at which I work - and she is a current parent in my school community.Elizabeth writes and presents nationally on topics of social justice, equity, and diversity as educational excellence. She recently co-founded (alongside Jenna Chandler-Ward) Teaching While White, a new blog and podcast resource for promoting racial literacy and helping educators build skills to create anti-racist classrooms. I look forward to learning from TWW and I hope everybody adds it to their resource lists and bookmarks toolbars.How did you get started doing anti-racism work? What has changed over time? I started when I was teaching ethnic studies courses. As I got more into American history and literature, it became impossible to ignore issues of race. I went back to do my PhD so I could study racial identity development and to develop strategies for teaching about racial identity and racism in schools. Unfortunately, not much has changed over 25 years. We are still struggling to understand how race affects teaching/learning. And most teachers do not know that racially diverse classrooms create higher levels of critical thinking.Can you share with our readers your definition of “diversity?”“Diversity” is simply the presence of difference. In a school context, we are referring to differences which impact learning. Since we can correlate racial identity development with academic achievement and the social construction of race in schools, we know that racial differences matter. We need to explore our own racial identity as teachers so we can help our students to explore theirs.Can you tell us about your new site?I felt like I needed a way to keep my Whiteness front and center in my work with schools. And I don’t like to do anything alone, so as Jenna and I continued to talk about the kind of work we wanted to do with teachers, this felt like the right way to go. Writing has always been a way for me to consolidate my thinking, so I was eager to try the blog format. And Michael Brosnan has been a wonderful writing partner for years as he published the first piece I ever wrote about being White. Jenna had the brilliant idea to do a podcast, which is both terrifying and exhilarating. I think it’s a very powerful medium that I’m eager to learn more about.Who are your heroes, both within and outside the education world?Oh, my. This will sound corny, but my husband, Randolph Carter, is one of my biggest heroes. He was a Black Panther and has spent his life working for social justice in all kinds of contexts. He never quits and never backs down. He is uncompromising when it comes to the lives of children and people of color in schools. And he has raised three amazing children.In your opinion, can classrooms or libraries ever be “neutral?” Why or why not? Absolutely not.  This is such a critical issue. I am talking to teachers across the country who are terrified to talk about race or what is happening around race and ethnicity in our country right now. Most are White teachers who are scared to death of getting in trouble for saying or doing the “wrong thing.” They have seen their colleagues sanctioned, and even fired, for challenging racism and racial privilege in our current climate. They hope their silence, or even their decision to avoid any “controversial” topics, will keep them safe. The problem is that it’s an illusion. Because staying quiet is the same as keeping the status quo in place. And this collusion with racism extends way beyond classrooms and into administrative offices and boardrooms. The leadership structures are just as complicit, hoping they can just “go along to get along.” It’s an old story, but one that will always have the same ending. Teachers make choices every day what to teach. There is no generic curriculum. We have so much content out there, and we carefully choose what to teach based on many factors. Not one of those factors – be it our experience, identity, or location – is neutral. Do you have a favorite children’s book to share? Can you recommend a professional book?What a hard question! Because I’m a mom of multiracial kids, I love Black, White, Just Right because it names and affirms racial difference as just that -- different, not deficit. I’m also a huge fan of Todd Parr because his books do the same thing: affirm difference. For teachers, I love Mica Pollock’s work and Robin DiAngelo’s scholarship on White fragility. I’m also a fan of Paul Gorski  because he has held our feet to the fire on promoting equity. He reminds us that our work to make schools more just and fair is not about “inclusion” or “cultural competence.” It’s about being excellent, informed, well-trained teachers who know how to manage all kinds of differences so all children can thrive. What advice do you have for other White people working on anti-racist practices? Challenge racism because it’s bad for White people. If you try to end racism for people of color, then you can choose to fight or not. And if you get tired, or it gets hard, you can stop. If you do it for you, because it’s the only way you can get up in the morning and look yourself in the mirror, then you won’t stop. And you will see why racism is bad for everyone. The effects of racism clearly impact White people and people of color differently. But as B. D Tatum noted, it’s a kind of smog, and we are all breathing the same air."},
{"title": "#WPC18", "date": "Monday, April 17, 2017", "text": "By Elisa GallPhoto from http://www.whiteprivilegeconference.com In two weeks, a few of us from RWW will travel to Kansas City, MO alongside teachers, librarians, academics, nonprofit leaders, activists, counselors, members of spiritual communities, high school and college students, and more to attend the 18th annual White Privilege Conference, or WPC. If you haven’t heard of the conference before, you might have questions about what it is all about. The WPC website offers several explanations:WPC is a conference that examines challenging concepts of privilege and oppression and offers solutions and team building strategies to work toward a more equitable world.It is not a conference designed to attack, degrade or beat up on white folks.It is not a conference designed to rally white supremacist groups.WPC is a conference designed to examine issues of privilege beyond skin color. WPC is open to everyone and invites diverse perspectives to provide a comprehensive look at issues of privilege including: race, gender, sexuality, class, disability, etc. — the ways we all experience some form of privilege, and how we’re all affected by that privilege.WPC attracts students, professionals, activists, parents, and community leaders/members from diverse perspectives. WPC welcomes folks with varying levels of experience addressing issues of diversity, cultural competency, and multiculturalism.WPC is committed to a philosophy of “understanding, respecting and connecting.The conference was founded by Dr. Eddie Moore, Jr. and it “looks at White Privilege intersectionally, in the context of various systems of privilege.” (You might also recognize Dr. Moore from the documentary film, “I’m Not Racist...Am I?”) Dr. Eddie Moore, Jr.Photo from https://eddiemoorejr.comIf you are attending WPC, there are pre-conference workshops held on Thursday. The main conference starts on Friday and goes through Sunday. There are a few keynote talks each day, and several sessions from which participants can choose. There are also daily caucus meetings where people with shared identities can get together and process learning from each day. There are early morning walks and discussions with Dr. Moore, and at night, there are film screenings, dinners, fundraisers, performances, and additional community events. All of these sessions offer learning opportunities for people to practice the process of anti-racism work.You can register for WPC here. In addition, the Association for Library Service to Children is supporting a meetup at 7 p.m. on April 29 for members and prospective members interested in joining together to discuss their learning and conference experiences.  All are welcome to that event, even non-librarians and folks not registered for the conference. Click here for more information and to R.S.V.P. for that meetup. Allie, Ernie, and I will be there and look forward to meeting and learning with everybody. Please spread the word!If you can’t make it to Kansas City this year, follow along with participants as they share their learning via #wpc18. ALSC members will also use #alscatwpc. If you are planning your professional development for the year ahead, note that WPC is always around the end of April. We believe this conference is a learning opportunity not to be missed, and we hope our conversations and tweets encourage even more people to engage in this work and perhaps attend the conference next year.SaveSave"},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: The Secret Project", "date": "Tuesday, April 11, 2017", "text": "From http://d28hgpri8am2if.cloudfront.net/book_images/onix/cvr9781481469135/the-secret-project-9781481469135_hr.jpgby Sam Bloom, Allie Jane Bruce and Elisa GallAfter reading Jonah and Jeanette Winter’s The Secret Project (Beach Lane Books, 2017), a few of us at Reading While White wanted to discuss our own reactions to it and what we have learned from reading and reflecting on criticism including Dr. Debbie Reese’s review at AICL. During this conversation it also came to our attention that Reese’s critical review was posted to the All The Wonders promo page and later taken down, adding another layer of complexity to our discussion (we recommend you read “What Happened to “A Second Perspective” at All The Wonders?” by Dr. Reese as well). Feel free to join our conversation and add your questions and/or thoughts in the comments!Elisa: When I first read The Secret Project, I was immediately drawn into the visual narrative of the ending. It was so gripping that I found myself focusing on that part of the book and remembering little else. When I saw the critical review on AICL, I knew that I had allowed myself to be wooed by the final pages. Sometimes a “WOW” effect like that can lead readers to prioritize one successful piece of a book over its serious problems. To me, that choice to overlook is the epitome of privilege I carry with me as a White, non-Native reader. Sam: I really liked it on first read. It’s embarrassing now, having seen the things Debbie pointed out, that seem so obvious. When I saw the spread with the Hopi man, I thought to myself, “I’m sure they got it right, this is the Winters we’re talking about.” That’s such a naive statement, but it was my first thought, so I just glossed over it. And like you, Elisa, I was gobsmacked by that ending.From http://blogs.slj.com/afuse8production/files/2017/01/SecretProject3-500x344.jpgAllie: My first reaction was just like both of yours.  That ending--so sad! So powerful! So, just, beyond words (literally)!  To be honest, I still feel that way.  That ending is one of the most powerful things I’ve seen in a picture book, ever.  This is where I need to practice my nonbinary thinking: The book has incredible merits; the book erases Pueblo people.  These things are both true.Elisa: Sam, that hope (“I’m sure they got it right”) is something I’ve noticed myself having. I find myself wanting to take the easy route of just going with the flow and trusting that a book (especially from a publisher or author whose past work I admire) is authentic and accurate. Looking critically and asking questions can be tough work. It definitely pulls me “out” of the narrative, which is why almost subconsciously I find myself resisting and wanting to “gloss over” as you put it. I have grown accustomed to getting to stay “in” the books I read. I try to remember that so many readers NEVER get to stay “in” (and some never get “in” at all) because the world of children’s literature has never been inclusive to them. Allie: What you’re describing is, I think, a set of skills that are not prioritized in library school.  I’m reminded of this post that Megan wrote about her process of letting go of A Fine Dessert a year and a half ago.I need to practice that skill of letting go.  It is a professional skill.  When I love a book for a particular reason, and then find out that it contains one (or more) problematic elements, I need to do what Megan did with A Fine Dessert: Sit. Breathe. Think. Go through whatever mental process I need to go through.  Then, practice saying the words “I changed my mind.”Megan’s older post is, in fact, so completely on-point here that I want to quote from it:I cannot ignore the voices of those who have helped me understand something I didn't consider before: No matter how thoughtful the intent was in depicting this mother and child, the end result is that it can be seen as perpetuating painful imagery of \"happy\" slaves.Am I ashamed I didn't see this myself? Yes. Because it's the kind of thing I'd like to think I wouldn't miss.But I'm not so ashamed that I'm going to dig in my heels.I can let go of A Fine Dessert. Did I come to this decision easily? No. Am I sad about letting go of the book? Yes.But it's a small sadness.Yes, I still appreciate many other things about A Fine Dessert, but I can also accept that this is a fault it cannot overcome for me when it comes to recommending it to librarians and teachers.Swap The Secret Project in for A Fine Dessert, and alter that second line to read, “No matter how thoughtful the intent was in depicting the setting, or how successfully it communicates the massive global and moral implications of developing nuclear weaponry, the end result is that it erases Pueblo people from this story.”Elisa: Yep. It is admittedly tough to come to terms with the fact that a title you first thought was excellent, or even haven’t read yet but want so much to be flawless, misses the mark...but again, tough for whom? Is it as tough as being a Native reader who sees (to quote Debbie Reese’s recent post) The Secret Project as yet another book in the “ever-growing pile of books in which this or that topic is more important than Native people?” Whose reactions and feelings are being prioritized if criticism is ignored? And there is plenty to talk about with regards to the way the conversation about this book played out after concerns were being discussed.Allie: I followed the way the conversation unfolded with great interest.  I had hopes that this would become a groundbreaking case of mainstream non-binary thinking, that we could acknowledge the merits of the book, and talk about how powerful that ending is, and also acknowledge the ways in which it erases Pueblo people, and what implications that has in the context of our history and our world.  Instead, I saw the same patterns as always, and found myself asking the same questions as always.Particularly troubling to me was Matthew Winner’s comment on AICL, in which he says that All the Wonders enters into a “verbal agreement” with book creators to shine a positive light on their book.  If I were entering into an agreement, verbal or written, to promote somebody’s work to the exclusion of criticism, I would change my job title from “librarian” to “salesperson” and ask to be paid for this work.  Now, it’s not my prerogative whether anybody else follows that advice--except that it impacts our profession as a whole when leaders in the field refer to themselves as “teachers” or “librarians” but in fact serve as de facto members of publishers’ advertising teams (for more of my thoughts on this, see my post responding to the recent Wall Street Journal article here). I see so much personal, passionate “I looooooooved this book” from the “rock stars.”  By contrast, I see such rational, researched, informed opinions from Debbie.  But somehow Debbie is always the one who gets called “nasty” or “unprofessional” while the “rock stars” are seen as the pinnacle of the profession.Sam: I think some of the backlash Debbie received is due to the fact that she is a woman, and the “rock stars” are men. I’ve been called a “rock star,” too. For doing the same damn thing an enormous number of women in the profession have done before. What’s that phrase about standing on the shoulders of giants? Well, I am certainly standing on the shoulders of giants to get to a point where I can get invited to the publisher dinners and shmoozy events, and guess what: pretty much EVERY ONE of those giants is a woman. And yet I, as a man (a White man, at that) may get up and read a story or two to kids; I may sing and dance and act goofy; I may do book talks for school age kids; and I’m the “rock star” even though there are how many women doing ALL of those things, probably with more skill and grace, who won’t get any attention for simply DOING THEIR JOB?Elisa: I know we have shared Robin DiAngelo's work on White Fragility before, but it is worth sharing again to notice these patterns you’re describing. You make good points, too, about \"librarian\" versus \"advertiser.\" I have been reflecting on this a lot. The line has definitely become blurred. Influence marketing works (which is why we see it),  but it is so important for our profession that it becomes clear if/when librarians are getting paid (or given benefits) to celebrate a book/author/publisher. Librarians DO spotlight and promote books and authors, but after careful evaluation. And even then, it is okay (expected!) to reevaluate your position after receiving new information. You might even change your mind.It feels good to get a book sent to you because a publisher thought you'd like it, or invited to a dinner with a creator whose work you admire. These gestures can feel like agreements. Let's be real - it is business! It can be hard to separate those warm fuzzies from problematic texts. But it is imperative. I acknowledge my own participation in this system. I keep telling myself: you want to go to that dinner or schmooze with creators? Fine. But then be ready for the hard reality that at the end of the day, no matter what you’ve been given or how much you like that person, you have to do your job. Allie: We spend much of our professional lives, by nature of the profession, in the thick of conversations about judging books, whether to spend budget money on this book or that, whether this book is good enough for this list or that award.  We form opinions, positive and negative, sometimes passionately so, informed by our expertise in book evaluation, our experiences sharing the book with kids, observations about a book’s accessibility, popularity, and so much more.  When it gets into that “passionate” territory, though, let’s face it:  It’s often hard to separate one’s personal love or hate for a book from a professional assessment, based on expertise, research, and knowledge.Elisa: I agree. And going back to how critics can get accused of bullying or being “nasty,” I think there is a myth that it is somehow always easy or fun for critics to interrupt racism or bias in a text. It can be disappointing, alienating, and scary. If representation of your identity is at the center, it can be traumatic and in some instances, people’s safety can be put at risk. No matter how it is shared though (and even if/when it is directed at something I am passionate about), I am working to remember that criticism reflects care and commitment. It is how things improve, because I have hope that discomfort will lead to deeper reflection in the future, and more honest, thoughtful, and accurate books getting made as a result.[Ed. note 10/17/17: The Reading While White team has decided to close comments on this post.  Please email us with any questions.]"},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: Undefeated", "date": "Tuesday, March 21, 2017", "text": "by Sam Bloom, KT Horning, and Megan SchliesmanSome of thefootball fans at Reading While White (Sam, KT, and Megan) have read Undefeatedby Steve Sheinkin (Roaring Brook, 2017) and are finding it extraordinarily discussable. If you arefamiliar with Sheinkin’s books you’ll be Unsurprised (hehe) to learn that ithas garnered 4 starred reviews. We can’t imagine it won’t be discussed later inthis year as a major award contender. Recently we had an email conversationwherein we weighed things we greatly appreciated against questions we still have.The conversation is below, with a few tweaks for the sake of coherency.Sam: I lovedso much of this book, but I think there is A LOT to talk about with the choicesSheinkin made.KT:  If you were expectingthe book to be about the Carlisle Indian School, you might be disappointed.It'sactually about the Carlisle football team which was so influential in thedevelopment of modern football. Jim Thorpe is the central figure but he is justone of the many star players that Sheinkin writes about. Thorpe went toCarlisle specifically to play football because he wanted to play on thegreatest team at the time – maybe of all time, once Thorpe was was added to theteam. Anyway, the boys on the team were treated very differently from otherstudents at Carlisle – they had their own dorm, got good food, etc., somethingthat contrasted with the conditions for the others. So there was a really bigincentive for the athletes to excel because they didn't want to be treated likeone of the regular kids. But even so, they were really exploited (kind of likecollege players today) because they brought so much money into the school. Ithought Sheinkin did a really good job of writing that part of the story. Theparallels to modern football are fascinating.Megan: I agree, KT.  I actually startedthis book and could not put it down.  The stories of the athletes are socompelling. And there are so many fascinating stories about how this teaminfluenced the way football is played – including the forward pass! The gameowes so much to the Carlisle Indian School team and individual athletes there. Sam:  Speaking of the forward pass,Megan, that particular section is one of the most thrilling bits of writingI’ve seen in years. (It’s on pages 120-123, if you have the book and want tofollow along.) Sheinkin recounts the way Carlisle fullback Pete Hauser’s“lordly throw, a hurl that went further than many a kick,” set the powerfulPenn football team and fans back on their heels. This is one of countless timesin Undefeated where Sheinkin writes about football in such a skillfulway that fans of the game will certainly be in heaven, but football haters (Iknow there are more than a few of you out there!) will also be compelled tokeep reading.KT:  Yes! I loved the story when Thorpe kickedthe football and then ran down the field to catch it himself. It was alsointeresting to learn about their coach, Pop Warner, who really helped todevelop the Carlisle team but who wasn’t really the most admirable person. Hisultimate betrayal of Thorpe was terrible. And there were just so manyinteresting personal stories of other teammates who were also great athletesand were so influential in the development of modern American football. They were the first football players to figure out they could run around,rather than through, the other team, and they also practiced and practiced toincrease the length of their field goals, kicking distances we take for grantedtoday but that were unheard of in the early 20th century.Megan:  At the same time, I came away fromthe book thinking that if I did not have prior knowledge that the IndianBoarding School System was brutalizing not only to students but their families,and that policies forced Native children to attend, I would not come away from thisbook understanding this. I think all but one of the Carlisle athletes hebriefly profiles went to Carlisle if not willingly (and sometimes eagerly, atleast as outlined here), then because their family wanted them too. That is socounter to the overall narrative of boarding schools with which I’m familiar.And at the least, I wanted an author’s note contextualizing the experience ofthese athletes at Carlisle in the larger story of Indian Boarding Schools, sothat readers can understand that this was an experience forced on generationsof Native children and had a profound impact on them and their families. It waspsychically cruel, in addition to the physical cruelty that children oftenexperienced. Still, Ithought Sheinkin did a good job of pointing out the elite athletes at Carlislehad preferential treatment—better food and conditions—compared to the grimmerreality for most. KT: I agree, Megan. All those hauntingbefore and after photographs of the students when they first got to Carlisle,and then afterwards when they had been forcibly assimilated speak volumes. ButI also agree with Megan that an author’s note would have been helpful forreaders who don’t know much about Indian Board Schools in general.Sam:  There are moments when Sheinkin seems to remember the brutal facts(such as in the Epilogue, when he writes about the difference in experiencesbetween athletes and non-athletes: “[I]t becomes clear that these schoolsinflicted enormous and lasting pain on entire generations of young people”). Inthe acknowledgements Sheinkin admits to struggling “to find some kind ofbalance between stories about this thrilling team… and the harsh realitiesbehind the stories.” Personally, I don’t think he entirely succeeded. I’m not afan of didacticism, but like Megan and KT, I wanted more of the “harshrealities” Sheinkin alludes to in the above quote. I think he owed that toyoung readers, and while he gave glimpses, they were too few.(Plus, let’s be honest: Sheinkin is such a great writer, surely he couldhave included more analysis of this complex and painful part of history withoutit turning his audience off.)Megan: In fact, I was struck by his choice to offer a brief mentionof how racism is playing out today in terms of Native people and football whenhe brings up the controversy surrounding the Washington R**skins team name. Itfelt almost tacked on in the chapter it was part of, and yet I was glad heacknowledged it. (This topic, too, could have been further discussed in aNote.)KT:  Even with its faults, I still think it’s a pretty great bookoverall. But, again, we’re all reading it as non-Native critics. I’ve given acopy to a colleague here at the UW-Madison School of Education who is Lakota.He’s a football fan, too, and he knows a lot about the Carlisle Indian School,in general, and the story of this team. He also recommended an adult book onthe subject by Sally Jenkins called The Real All Americans. He’ll let meknow what he thinks about the Sheinkin book once he’s read it.  I’m eagerto see what he has to say and, with his permission, I’ll share his commentswhen they come in."},
{"title": "Why \"Rock Star Librarian\" is an Oxymoron", "date": "Tuesday, March 7, 2017", "text": "So, in a weird way, I think the Wall Street Journal kinda nailed it this time. If you read it right.The article talks about a bunch of White men as \"rock stars\" of the children's literature world. I think that's one of the more accurate descriptors I've heard.  Sure, they'll call themselves book \"champions,\" but with cardboard cutouts, fancy titles, huge contests, highly publicized road trips, book deals, and more, who could blame the Wall Street Journal for terming them rock stars--or us, for thinking they doth protest a little much?\"Publishers can’t advertise in classrooms and marketers can’t reach kids who haven’t yet hit social media, but these experts enjoy a direct line to school gatekeepers.\"  Just look at all the blurbs, the cover reveals, the cheerleading blog posts, the fervent tweets, the... um, the advertising, the marketing.  And what a sweet deal for publishers! They don't even have to pay these rock stars the usual rates they pay those who work in their advertising departments--free books and some perks (fancy dinners, access to big names for interviews) will do just fine.  Unless… until... they do... hire... them.  Which makes me ask:  Since when are the skill sets for librarian-ing and advertising so similar?  And, can we fix that, please?  Because they shouldn’t be.  And neither publishers nor librarians should think that they are.Here's the real kicker, as far as I'm concerned: What has the growth of the rock star done to the professional field of librarianship and other children’s literature professionals? Are we just here to function as de facto members of every publisher's advertising team? I know the \"right\" answer, but I'd believe it a little more if I'd ever seen one of these rock stars do something that might piss off a publisher even a little. The ugly upshot is what happens to librarians (and other field professionals) who do actually (and thoughtfully) criticize books, book creators, and/or publishers. Especially the women of color and Native women who dare criticize. They're labeled as angry, combative, overly-sensitive, and generally unreasonable. Is it harder to get hired/published?  Darn right it is.  And perks? Fancy dinners? Forget it.(A slight pause here to thank those publishing professionals who do, in fact, appreciate the hard work of these librarians, and who expect and encourage criticism and critical conversations. We see you.)I understand why the article’s subjects aren’t happy with it (and are denouncing it on social media)... and I'd be really interested in what their conversations looked like with the Wall Street Journal.  Did you confront the WSJ about how they've belittled and dismissed calls for better representation in their previous (ha) reporting on children's literature?  Did you say “if you are taking the time to visit me at a work event, please do the same for a woman of color?”  Did you think about saying, perhaps, “I will give you a comment about inequities in the field, including yours, as well as a list of names of people to whom you can talk in order to right some of those inequities?”  I’m grateful to Donalyn Miller (whose voice and advice to include more diverse voices were excluded from the article, despite the fact that she co-founded the Nerdy Book Club), and to many others, for speaking up about this; see this thread by Ebony Elizabeth Thomas for one.  I wonder what other conversations took place before the fact.  Did anyone consult with friends and allies about whether doing this piece was a good idea in the first place?And, what now? Will you take a look at some hard truths and use your power to advocate (not just advertise) for marginalized people? Or will you reap the best of both worlds--you get to be rock stars AND you get to be appreciated because you denounced the article?What are our responsibilities, as children’s literature professionals living in a rock star world?  A few thoughts (add more in the comments, please!):-If you are in charge of selection/buying, actively seek out voices beyond these white men--for that matter, seek out voices beyond white women and the major review journals too.-Deliberately incorporate the vital work of librarians and critics of color and First/Native Nations into your decision-making processes.  Need somewhere to start?  Check out our list of Kindred Spirits.-If you are a rock star, acknowledge your privileges, and your limitations.  Do you practice admitting that you do not know it all, or that you are still in the process of learning about structural racism and unconscious bias?  Do you regularly guide people to voices beyond your own?-Do not put anyone on a pedestal.  The truth is, these guys are on pedestals that other white people (largely white women, like me) created.  We crowned these rock stars; we can un-crown them too.This brings me back to the article, which correctly did not include any women, people of color, or Native people under the descriptor \"rock star.\"  Because they're not.  Partly because “rock star” denotes “white man” in the first place (at least, it does to the Wall Street Journal) but also because they’re so many other things.  They're educators. They're critics, and critical thinkers. They're responsible budget-spenders. They’re tireless fighters.  They're advocates.  Who would have time to be a rock star, on top of all that?-Allie Jane Bruce"},
{"title": "Questions Agents and Editors Can Use to Evaluate American Indian Content, by Kara Stewart", "date": "Wednesday, February 22, 2017", "text": "Note: This post, authored by Kara Stewart (Sappony), first appeared on From Here to Writernity. Are youseeing American Indian characters or content? QuestionsAgents and Editors Can Use to Evaluate Native contentDevelopedby Kara Stewart (Sappony) with many thanks to Debbie Reese (Nambe Pueblo) forcontributions.Dear Agents and Editors, Have you just been presented with a manuscript that has AmericanIndian content? I know what you’re thinking. “Great googlie mooglies, how do Itell if the Native content in this doorstop is accurate or if it will cause agarbage fire for my agency/house?”  Or you may be thinking, “Well, I really like the voice, the plotis killer, and the author says shedid a lot of research.”  Or you may not be overly familiar with problems in the ways thatwriters create American Indian content, and think “I’m sure it’s fine…”Or….*eyeswipe over listed resources*  “Okay! A resource list! Content should be good to go.” But thatniggling doubt… are those resources reliable?Or perhaps you’re thinking, “It’s just this one little paragraphthat has American Indian content... and it sounds okay to me...we don’t need tocheck on just that!”Stop right there!I know neither you nor your authors want dumpster fires, so hereis a handy (errr… I think it’s handy and hope you do, too!) set of questions(and answers!) you can use to evaluate that manuscript. And a bonus resourcelist! By using it, you can gain skills to inform yourself and help authorscreate great books that help, rather than harm.Just pick from List A (for authors who claim to be AmericanIndian) or List B (for those who do not) and have at it!A couple of notes on the questions:These are meant asguides. Any single question may not lead you to a definitive answer, but willinform you. Or you may come up with additional questions to ask or research onyour own. It is not racist or badform to ask questions specific to American Indian citizenry. For AmericanIndian populations, the question/answer is larger than underrepresentedminorities or historical oppression, and involves tribal citizenship.  AmericanIndian people are, first and foremost, sovereign nations­ with structures in place to govern ourselves. This includescitizenship. Asking “Are you enrolled?” or “Are you a citizen of your nation?”then, is a question that many welcome. The answer will tell you a lot. Most AmericanIndian authors will understand why you are asking and openly share theircitizenship with you.One little paragraph,sentence, or phrase can make a difference in a book’s tone, believability,consequences, and how an American Indian reader may respond to it. Why include AmericanIndians at all in that phrase, sentence, or paragraph? Choose from List A orList B.For List A, Question 4and for List B, you will need at least one, preferably two, vetted readers fromthe tribe whose content is included. The author’s American Indian contact andtheir auntie who works at the college does not count. An objective, tribally-vetted person from the tribe who is familiarwith Native literature does.Is pondering thesequestions slightly uncomfortable? It is for me too, but I believe it is crucialthat agents and editors take an informed, pro-active stance in the stream ofwhat gets published. Cliché, but we need all hands on deck. I’m not suggestingan interrogation, but a conversation that includes these questions will greatlyimprove depictions of American Indian people in children’s and young adultbooks.As editors and editorialagents, you often ask writers to revise something that you think isn’t right.It might be a factual error, or asking for clarity. You can do that, too, with AmericanIndian content.Ultimately, what you’reasking is this: “What will children most likely walk away from thisbook/section believing about Native people?” Boil it down to what is/isn’t onthe page. And don’t forget American Indian children! What will they walk awaywith, when they read this book or this section?LIST A: For authors who claim to be AmericanIndian1.I see your bio says you are Native American. What tribe do you associateyourself with? 2.Is that a state, or federally recognized tribe? 3.How are you involved with your tribe? 4.Are you writing about your tribe or another tribe? List A Cheat Sheet Potential Answers:1.      The author should be able to definitivelyname a specific tribe. If not, they may have Native ancestry at some point intheir family lineage, but they are most likely not part of a tribe or familiar enoughwith it for them to be able to write in the #OwnVoice framework.  If an author seems to change their mind, giving different tribe names at differenttimes, that indicates they’re in an exploratory phase of finding out their AmericanIndian ancestry. Note: if an author tells you they are Native via a DNA test, hitthe pause button! Read (re-read) Kim Tallbear’s article, There Is No DNA Test To Prove You’re NativeAmerican. DNA means nothing. What matters is lineage and kinship,not DNA.On the plus side, an author may say, “Iam a citizen of the Choctaw Nation and of Navajo descent” or \"I amSappony\". Or, “I am Lumbee and Sappony, enrolled with the Lumbee” or\"I am an enrolled member of the Sappony\", if the author understandsthat there are members, and there are enrolled members, and it sometimes makesa difference.  Note: if a writer givesyou enrollment information for two distinct tribes, that’s a sure sign that thewriter is not versed in citizenship. While we may have parents or ancestry frommore than one tribe, we are enrolled in one. That’s a protocol widely knownamongst those who are raised with knowledge of their native communities. Youcan also ask the author for their tribe's website and contact information. Manytribes verify membership through tribal ID cards. You can ask to see the tribalID card. “And do you have a tribal ID card?” is acceptable. If the person doesnot have a card, but is a member/citizen, they’ll likely know that they (andyou) can verify enrollment or citizenship through letter/email. We are askedfor our tribal ID cards fairly often – at university offices, to register todance at powwows, or as acceptable forms of identification to vote in somestates, for example.2.     Question 2 is, in essence, a check on Question1. It is easy for someone to fudge their way through Question 1, especially ifyou, agent/editor, don’t feel confident in your ability to sniff out AmericanIndian authenticity. If they don't know if their tribe is state or federallyrecognized, that is a red flag that points to shallow understanding andknowledge.  It lessens the chance theyare really part of any tribe. Neither state nor federally recognized is 'betterthan' or more authentic than the other. If their tribe is neither state norfederally recognized, that could be a warning signal to find out more, sincethere are many groups that claim to be American Indian tribes.3.     Asking how one is involved in the tribethey claim is another check on Question 1. Being a member of a tribe is morethan an enrollment number or membership verification. It a way of life. It isgiving back to your tribe, your family. It is being involved. Some nationsrequire tribal members to live nearby, or require participation in tribalactivities. Possible follow up questions: Did you grow up in the community youare writing about? Do you live there now? Are you able to get back to see yourfamily much? If a person says they serve on the tribal council, or sit on acommittee for their tribe or state or federal Indian organizations, volunteerat tribal events and can name them, or can tell you other ways they give backto their own Indian community, their state-level Indian community or thefederal-level Indian community, then they have a higher chance of creatingcontent that is accurate.Caveat: volunteer work at variousIndian functions or organizations is not really an indicator on its own sincemany non-Natives volunteer and may therefore think they have enough Nativeexperience and friends to write about us. See List B.4.     If the author is American Indian butwriting about another tribe, see List B. American Indian tribes are so variedthat a Lakota writing about the Mohawk, a Pueblo writing about the Sappony, aTohono O’Odham writing about the Ojibwe, means that the author is writing abouta culture not their own, a culture outside of their own experience. They mayhave a fundamental understanding of the overarching issues, stereotypes andvalues in ‘Indian Country’ in the generic sense, but would be an outsider toanother tribal culture. We think that you will still need a vetted reader, ortwo, from the tribe whose content is in the book. See List B.LIST B: For authors who are not AmericanIndian but claim to have done research and/or have enough American Indianexperience to result in authentic, accurate, non-stereotypical text:1.      Why did you want to write a book about AmericanIndians/include this part with American Indian content in your book?2.     What tribe are you writing about/whattribe’s content is included in this part of your book?3.     Why did you select this particulartribal nation for your story?4.     Who have you interviewed/spoken with inthe tribe, and can you give me the names and a statement from the tribe thatacknowledges that these people are vetted by the tribe to speak for them?5.     What is your personal experience withthis tribe?6.     What resources have you used to informyour work?List B Cheat Sheet Potential Answers:List B questions are more recursive than List A questions. 1.·       If the author talks abouthaving worked with American Indian kids/community and says that they asked the authorto write a story for them, and this is that story, we have an example ofsaviorism. It’s not just authors of European ancestry who can getit wrong. Writing from ANY ‘outsider’ culture – White, African American, Asian,Hispanic – should have equally rigorous scrutiny when including American Indiancontent. If the author is being a savior, they may have saviors in the story,too. Also, very commonly, authors will express having an affinity for AmericanIndian culture, being fascinated with Indians, or growing up near a reservation– Danger, Will Robinson! Proceed with caution! This can be code for “manystereotypes ahead”.  See Answer 6 forgreat resources to combat that.·        If there are a couple of AmericanIndian references in the book, “some Indian tribes say…” or “..look like anIndian..” or “Hopi legend says…” or “Indian burial ground” or “wise, old Indianman said …”, ask the author why they chose American Indian culture for thatreference. We’ve seen many books in which it seems the author did not imagine AmericanIndian children as amongst the audience for the book. With that in mind, ask whythe author needs to include American Indians at all in that phrase, sentence,or paragraph. Can the scene stand without it? Why is it there? Can anothergroup reference be substituted there? If the answer doesn’t support accurate,non-stereotypical text, you probably want to lose it. 2.  If there is nospecific tribe mentioned . . .  Danger, Will Robinson, Danger!3.     This answer circles back to Question 1but will give you more specific information. Pay particular attention if theauthor says something like, “I had a neat idea for a historical fiction bookbased on a real tribe/person/event.” See Answer 6.4.     Via a social event or mutualacquaintance, a non-Native author may feel they have someone they can turn towho can help them with their American Indian content.  But that doesn’t mean that the Native personyour author spoke with speaks for the tribe, has a larger view of the culturalquestions, or knows anything about American Indian representation inliterature. The author may pose questions and receive vague or simpleaffirmation for that content. The assumption is that feedback from any AmericanIndian person is fine, or that positive feedback from an American Indian personis validation of authenticity, accuracy and acceptance. That is a falseassumption.  You and your author—and yourauthor’s readers—deserve more than that. Writers worked, in some cases, yearson the manuscript. It is important to find someone who can give the content theserious attention it, the writer, and readers, deserve.  This is why it is important to have not onlyappropriate, but objective, AmericanIndian information contacts as well as vetted (someone the tribe agrees canspeak for them) readers.  5.     This answer circles back to Questions 1and 2, but will give you more specific information. Again, if the author talksabout working or living with/near American Indian kids/community and the storywritten was well received by them . . . time to ferret out more information.What experience? For how long? Time frame? What did the work/interactionsconsist of? What about this experience enables you to write from the point ofview of an American Indian person?6.     The Devil is in the details . . . andthe overall tone. Authors can have all their facts historically correctaccording to accepted sources available. But it is the interpretation of thefacts into a story that makes the book harmful or helpful. I’ve seen a numberof books that get most of the ‘facts’ correct, but the overall tone is that ofstereotypes (which may be difficult for non-Indian writers, agents and editorsto see when that has been the prevailing mode of American Indianrepresentation). I’d highly recommend that agents and editors read the RevisedCriteria from How to Tell the Difference: A Guide for EvaluatingChildren's Books for Anti­-Indian Bias. Reading a manuscript throughthat lens and thinking deeply about Eurocentrism and colonialism will make allthe difference. You can find guidelines, suggestions,statistics and a number of resources here at Writing About Native Americans.It is a long post (as was this).        But if it is truly important to you and yourauthor to stop perpetuating stereotypes, you will have made it to the end ofthis post.

{"title": "Bring It Back: Families", "date": "Monday, February 6, 2017", "text": "Among the many genres and subgenres of informational books for children are those about the people around us. One niche in this category are books about families.  Most bookstores or libraries will stock several of these titles.  Some explore families worldwide (beware the title that compartmentalizes race, ethnicity, and religion to geography - especially making America a White land) others look at families here in the United States.  Most authors and photographers do a good job of showing the wide range of families (big families, small families, adoptive families, interracial families, gay and lesbian parents, divorced families) however the writing style tends to use overarching and general language. One exception to this trend is Susan Kuklin’s Families. Kuklin, Susan. Families. Hypersion, 2006, 36 pages ISBN 978-0786808229 opKuklin interviewed several children between the ages of four and fourteen to learn more about their families. Fifteen families are featured - each on a two page spread.  The children selected clothing, household items, and pose for their family photos.  Each child picked a historic family photo they referenced in their conversations. These images are inset with accompanying text to deepen our understanding of the family's history. This approach to crafting a book about American families creates a text that is wholly unique. We hear the child’s view on their own families.  While all of these families live in the United Stated they represent the reality of a global society. The assortment of families we find in this type of book are all here but with a depth and breadth unparalleled by other titles. Kuklin has captured the voice of children introducing the multitude of possible families.   The availability of this notable  project is now limited due to it being out of print. Some questions that come to mind: Hyperion, can you bring it back? If the pictures and cultural references are outdated, creating barriers to reprinting, maybe a second edition is in order?  JEHANGIR: My family’s from India. People think we’re Hindu because most of India is Hindu. I’m Muslim. The things I do are mostly Muslim. But the things I eat and wear are usually from Indian culture.Cover image, photograph, and excerpt from the author’s website.

{"title": "Reviewing While White: The Nameless City by Faith Erin Hicks", "date": "Thursday, February 2, 2017", "text": "by Angie ManfrediNames matter.Names matter when it comes to people and  to cultures.  And names matter when it comes to locations. So I was hesitant when I first heard the title of Faith Erin Hicks’s graphic novel The Nameless City. What would it mean for a city to be “nameless”? The Nameless City is the first in a series.  The main plot revolves around two characters, Rat and Kaidu, who become best friends even though they are from different worlds.  In Hicks’s universe, “different worlds” pretty much breaks down to “conquerors” and “conquered.”  The main action takes place in the titular “Nameless City” - a city, valuable for trade due to its location at the opening of a river passage, that has been the subject of repeated cycles of conquest over generations.  Kaidu is a member of the Dao people, the current occupiers of the city.  Rat is a member of the group known only as “The Named,” i.e. the residents of the city, presumably made up of “generations” of residents who have survived the cycles of occupation. I say presumably because one of the main weaknesses of The Nameless City is not taking the impact of generations of conquest as serious as is warranted.  Who makes up “The Named” and when does a city resident become considered as such?  Are “The Named” composed of any disenfranchised citizens no matter who is conquering the city or can you become part of “The Named” when a new conquering group arrives? If Kaidu’s Dao people were conquered and replaced as leaders would the Dao then belong to “The Named”? Hicks never specifies any of this or sorts it out in any coherent way and that’s a real problem in a story that is ostensibly about the importance of different cultures and people coming together to build a coalition: how can we appreciate that if we can’t really tell them apart in the first place?The idea that some people, and some places, are “nameless” is a common, and troubling, White stereotype.  It allows White people to other and exoticize people of color. Hicks never uses “tribes” to describe the people who have lived in/conquered the city. This is just one of the problems with how the book avoids specificity of culture and location.  Various groups are referred to as “the horse people,” “the people of the river,” and “the warrior people.” The first people who lived there, whose language and science has been lost, are referred to as either “The Northern People” or the “The First Builders.” But we also get a few specific names such as Dao, Yisun, and Liao. Do those names sound “Asian inspired” to you?  They did to me and that ties into the key problem of The Nameless City. I say “Asian inspired” for a number of reasons, one being the fact that Hicks herself has openly talked about how she drew inspiration for the story. Here’s an interview with her at Comics Alliance:CA: You say it’s loosely based on feudal China?FEH: Well, the setting is based on that particular time period, but there’s no historical link between the story that I’m telling and and events that happened in that period. I just used it as the inspiration for my story’s setting.CA: If you weren’t worried about historical accuracy, did you still spend time researching?  And did you limit your research to that period, or did you pull in some elements of other things?FEH: I did a little bit of research on later periods, but most of it was specifically influenced by the Mongol dynasty that oversaw China during the thirteenth century.There are some really troubling statements here and I think those attitudes show up in the text. Writers, especially White writers, should not just cherry pick the aspects of a culture and history that they want for the look and atmosphere of a story while leaving out anything that they don’t know enough about or don’t feel engaged by.  That's a textbook definition of appropriation and it's endemic in works by White people.  Just because White writers choose to make up cultures, tribes, and even races doesn’t mean they then somehow exist in a world where real life biases are harmless.Along with the names, the “Asian inspired” elements show up everywhere in this work and it is clearly intentional. There are Chinese junk ships, Chinese style clothing and fighting, and the repeated use of Asian inspired names as mentioned above. There’s even street signs that have “Chinese-like” writing that isn’t actually a real language. What elements did Hicks use as \"inspiration\" and what did she leave out?  WHY?  What do those omissions tell us? The Nameless City  has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. Kirkus and Booklist both starred it, Kirkus named it to their Best Fiction of 2016 list. But let’s take a closer look at the reviews. The Publishers Weekly  review says it has \"a Tibetan air\" while the Kirkus review says it is \"Asian-influenced\" ... these things aren't interchangeable. Booklist seems more aware of Hicks’s process and says the setting “resembles thirteenth-century China.” Resembles? Influenced? Air? These are weak words for the fact this book takes place in a world that samples from Chinese history on a surface level only when it suits the author. Asia doesn’t mean only China.  Tibet and China are not interchangeable. These cultures and places deserve more than being used as set decoration or “trendy” influences for stories. The fact that reviews are just lumping it in with hand-wavey \"you know, like, over there?\" is indicative of the problem. Asia is not a mono-culture and removing details, appropriating only what you want, perpetuates the kind of thinking that now, more than ever, kidlit/YA should be tearing down.At one point in The Nameless City (pg. 89), Kaidu’s father (part of the Dao, the group currently occupying the city) tells him, “For thirty years the Dao have brought peace and prosperity to the Nameless City.” Hicks makes a great choice: to illustrate this scene with Kaidu receiving this pronouncement from his father while sitting in front of a painting showing Dao warriors in battle - specifically while they are slaughtering people. It’s a bracing contrast, one left for the reader to wrestle with, and the kind of brutal introspection this text needs more of. In another scene towards the end, a monk from the Named describes the Dao’s battle as a “sneak attack.”  Kaidu repeats back the story he knows: “It wasn’t a ‘sneak attack’! It was a heroic battle.” The monk answers, “So the Dao say. The Yisun might think differently” (194). Again, these are the kind of conversations about conquest and ruling that this book should be engaging with, but too often Hicks chooses to smooth over the consequences of colonization and conquest by falling back on half-explored themes of how perhaps we’re more alike than different. This is all further complicated by the opaqueness regarding an actual, specific setting and culture. There are certainly some strong elements in the The Nameless City.  But overall this is a title I can’t recommend. Cultures aren’t interchangeable. Names matter, even in supposedly Nameless Cities. --Further Reading: Laura Jimenez’s takes a critical look at Nameless City, including how it fails the Bechdel Test.I couldn’t have written this piece without the support and help of two of my favorite indie comic creators: Wendy Xu and Trungles. Wendy has a short, informative tweet thread about the issues she had reading The Nameless City as a Chinese person. And Trungles has a tweet thread about the problems (and the strengths) of the book. Let me stress that one of the most important things you can do to boost the voices of artists of color is to support their work financially. So if you love indie comics by creators of color, I urge you to check out and support Wendy’s Patreon and Trungles’s Patreon. I love getting their drawings and updates!"},
{"title": "RWW Interviews: Debbie Reese", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "Debbie ReeseDebbie Reese, PhD. is an accomplished scholar and literary critic. In addition to numerous peer reviewed publications exploring diversity in children’s literature Debbie frequently offers her expertise at conferences. She is one of the founders of the American Indian Studies program at the University of Illinois where she received the Provost’s Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 2003. Debbie currently serves on the  Literature Advisory Board for Reading is Fundamental and The Journal of Children’s Literature.   I appreciate Debbie making time to talk with us about her career and life. Can you share your origin story? How did you get started in this work, and what has changed over time?That is an interesting question! It creates an opportunity for me to address the tremendous visibility and invisibility of Native peoples. We are not “First Americans.” Our origins predate what came to be called the United States of America. Time and again, though, writers and their editors seem hell bent on doing a force-fit in their depictions of us. In a cynical moment, I’d say that was a political move, intended to undermine who we are. In the next moment, I’d say that it is indicative of ignorance or a feel-good embrace of an American society that—intentionally or not—wants to look away from the stories it tells about history.  My origin story, then, as a woman of a Native Nation is this: I’m tribally enrolled at Nambe Pueblo in northern New Mexico. In the 1600s, my ancestors fought like hell against the Spanish explorers and missionaries who sought to take our lands and eradicate our ways of being. That fight is why I’m still here and why my people are on the land we’ve been on, for hundreds of years. In fact, our kiva—which is similar to a church—has been there since the 1300s. We still use it. When we pray, we don’t pray for our personal needs. Our elders remind us that what we do is for our community and for the world. Those words are powerful and stand in stark contrast to “the American dream” which tends to be about one’s own accomplishments and acquisitions. I know that answer is a bit long, but it is part of my origin story. What I do as a scholar in children’s literature—especially what I do at my site—is an embodiment of those teachings. Stories. Words. They matter. They shape individuals, communities, and the world, too. I started American Indians in Children’s Literature in 2006 as a way to make my work freely accessible to parents, teachers, librarians, professors… anyone who was interested in learning about the ways that Native peoples are represented—or I should say misrepresented because that happens more often—in children’s and young adult literature. Change over time? The year 2016 marks a significant moment. Several books were withdrawn or revised, due to conversations on social media. Content area bloggers are making a difference in how writers write, how editors edit, and how reviewers review books. I’m more optimistic than I’ve ever been! I’m a realist, though, and acknowledge the power of capitalism. Money talks. What we buy matters.And, I’ll add, that I see the current presidential administration as a threat to Native nationhood. The presidential memorandum about the Dakota Access Pipeline is deeply unsettling. Native people who went to Standing Rock went there with sovereignty foremost in their minds. They, like me, carry a different origin story than most Americans do. So much of the news media about the resistance to the pipeline focused on things like drums, tipis, and feathers but said little if anything about our status as sovereign nations. I can’t help but wonder: if the word “nation” were present in more children’s books, might that help reporters, and allies, too, understand and speak of our nationhood in ways they do not, now? Have you seen any important trends or themes in publishing by and about First/Native Nations over the last ten years?I’m thrilled to see a growing awareness of our sovereignty! I love, for example, that Reading While White is using it. Collectively, you hold a lot of influential power, so I’m really happy to see it here. I’m also seeing a growing awareness of what it means to be a tribal member or citizen. History being what it is, so many people claim to be “part Native” – I’m seeing more conversations about what that claim means. I know it makes people uneasy to wonder if someone is Native or, not-quite Native, or not-really Native at all. If we can shift from thinking that is a racist question, to thinking of it as a political one similar to nationhood or citizenship in, say, France, I think we’d all be in a better place. I love that Tim Tingle’s How I Became A Ghost has “Choctaw Nation” on the very first page, and I love that Cynthia Leitich Smith’s Jingle Dancer has information about the Muscogee Nation in the author’s note. This matters! I’ve started to see Native characters that are LGBTQ. Unfortunately, most of them are stereotypical. That is frustrating. Native kids who are LGBTQ need mirrors, too, but the ones they’re getting are just like the ones Native kids have gotten for decades. Those aren’t mirrors. Those are White Man’s Indians. Literally, those images are created (for the most part) by White writers. The need is there, however, and I’m hopeful we’ll see better representations, soon. I’ve also started to see Black Indians. Or—I should say—I’ve noticed two in particular that I didn’t notice before. This new awareness of two favorite books is important. In Jingle Dancer and in Rain Is Not My Indian Name, Cynthia Leitich Smith has two characters that are Black Indians. Now, whenever I read, I keep an eye out for that. And whenever I give a lecture, I talk about her characters. African Americans in the audience are thrilled. It speaks to the need for more of that, too. They have to be well done, though, and Smith’s are terrific. Researching these characters is on my to-do list. I’ve got to read and analyze Virginia Hamilton’s Arilla Sun Down and Michael Dorris’s The Window. What is one question you wish more White People would ask about First/Native Nations?“Do I know what I’m talking about? How do I know it?” If people would just hit the pause button on what they think they know, a wide range of questions open up. This is critical thinking that asks us—me, too!—to question what we’re taught, who taught it to us, why it is taught that way… In light-hearted moments, I want to say “WHO SAID” in the way kids challenge each other on the playground.  In all the work that you do, what are you most proud of?A few years ago, Simon Ortiz asked me to give a talk in the lecture series named after him, at Arizona State University. He is from Acoma Pueblo and is amongst the most respected Native writers in the U.S. I gave my lecture in October of 2016. Now, I am in the company of women I deeply admire, like Buffy Sainte-Marie, Ofelia Zepeda, and Leslie Marmon Silko, and Wilma Mankiller. https://english.clas.asu.edu/indigenousOddly, I’m proud of the fact that people whisper “Debbie Reese hates white people” to each other. It means they are aware of my work. Whether they believe that I hate white people or not—they’re paying attention. How do you stay motivated or promote self-care when facing frustration or pushback?Around me, I have photographs of my daughter as a little girl, her cousins, my siblings grandchildren. In lectures I’ve been sharing this photo. That’s my little sister’s granddaughter. Her joy is infectious. I want to see that joy on her face every time she picks up a book with Native content.  Who are your heroes, both within and without the children’s literature world?Last week on Twitter, I posted a series of photos of Native women I’m inspired by. This was part of the women’s march to Washington DC. I’ll share their names here. Suzan Harjo, for her activism and bringing the National Museum of the American Indian from an idea to a stunning reality, there on the National Mall in DC.Joy Harjo, for her poetry, her music, her stories.  Lotsee Patterson, for working to get Native people into library science. Cynthia Leitich Smith, for her mentorship of writers, and her own books, too. Elizabeth Reese (my daughter) and other young Native women like her who have a fierce commitment to standing up for our Nations.What advice do you have for others looking to do equity work in the world of libraries and youth literature? Network! Find others who are doing similar work. Being able to reach out to them is crucial. This is hard work. They will sustain you. I could name some of the people I turn to, but I’ll use RWW’s social media platform to direct your readers to another one! Go onto Twitter and search using #DiversityJedi. We started using that hashtag--created by Cynthia Leitich Smith--on November 2, 2015. Two of the DiversityJedi were in this RWW series of interviews! Laura Jimenez and Edi Campbell are people I learn from, and turn to, as well.   -Ernie Cox"},
{"title": "Rudine Sims Bishop: In Appreciation", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2017", "text": "Have you ever used the phrase “Mirrors and Windows” when discussing the need for more diverse children’s books? If so – or even if you’ve only heard someone else speak these words in this context – give a tip of your cap to Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop.On Monday at the Youth Media Awards in Atlanta, Dr. Bishop received a standing ovation after winning the Coretta Scott King-Virginia Hamilton Award for Lifetime Achievement. How many of us were thinking, “It’s about damn time!” Dr. Bishop, Professor Emerita at Ohio State University, has done enough to push children’s literature forward for two or three lifetimes. Check the Reading Rockets site for several video interviews and a handful of links (one of which connects to her seminal essay, Mirrors, Windows and Sliding Glass Doors).The idea behind Dr. Bishop’s work is simple: all young readers need more books with characters of all ethnicities and backgrounds, having a diverse range of experiences. This doesn’t mean that African American children only need to see more books with characters like themselves (although obviously they do), or that Ojibwe children only need to see more books with characters like themselves (might I add, in the present tense), and so on; but that African American children need to also see those Ojibwe characters, and vice versa. And also, children from non-marginalized groups (read: White kids) need to see these aforementioned books too. When White kids see White characters all the time, they get a distorted view of reality. White kids are overwhelmingly seeing “mirrors” but not “windows,” and that’s a huge problem.Rudine Sims Bishop acknowledges the crowd at the Youth MediaAwards after winning the Coretta Scott King - Virginia HamiltonAward for Lifetime Achievement.(By the way, earlier I mentioned the need to tip one’s hat to Dr. Bishop when talking about windows and mirrors. Let me take that a step further: we must give credit where credit is due by citing Rudine when we use this phrase, no matter the situation. This is really a good guideline to follow in general, but especially since many White people tend to take credit for ideas and things created by people of color or First/Native Nations, I implore readers to attribute this phrase to Dr. Bishop.)This may all be old news to some, but one of the reasons Dr. Bishop is so impactful is her years of service, of pushing and prodding the children’s literature world to think more broadly about what diverse books can do. And she has done so for all these years with characteristic grace and understated authority, leading by example.I had the great fortune of serving on the Coretta Scott King Book Award Jury these last two years with Dr. Bishop as my chair. When you’re on a book award committee, you get to know the other people in the room extremely well, and it isn’t always rainbows and ponies, as they say; things can get heated at times. Discussions hit brick walls, and committee members get feelings hurt – we have such personal attachments to the books we have read and loved! There were a few times I wanted Dr. Bishop to tell us what to do in these hard situations: “Come on,” I’d think. “You’re RUDINE SIMS BISHOP!! You have more knowledge than the rest of us combined! DRAW US A MAP!!!” But that isn’t the way Dr. Bishop works. She is not someone who is going to tell you what to do, or what to think; Rudine Sims Bishop does not direct. When Rudine speaks, the whole room leans forward, and not just because she has such a quiet voice. Dr. Bishop exudes authority, but not the kind that demands one snap to attention. Her authority lies in her knowledge, yes, but above all in the graceful and dignified way she carries herself.All of this is to say: thank you, Dr. Bishop. Thank you for your tireless and continued work. Thank you for being a shining example of true leadership.-Sam Bloom"},
{"title": "Advocating at Midwinter", "date": "Thursday, January 19, 2017", "text": "If you’re going to the American Library Association’s Midwinter Meeting in Atlanta over the coming days, you’ll have a chance to hear some great speakers, and maybe even do some committee work and attend the 2017 Youth Media Awards announcements.  Although the Midwinter Meeting is not as program-oriented as the annual conference in summer, it will, like any library conference, have a large contingent of publishers in the exhibit hall. This makes it a perfect time for you to speak up for diversity directly to publishers.Back in 2014, the incredible Cindy Pon, a long-time advocate for diverse books and super talented author, approached me and some other librarians about heading into the exhibits hall with the determination to ask about and talk about diverse books with publishers. Hannah Gómez wrote a post about it for YALSA’s Hub blog and that’s the basic template I, and many other librarians, have followed for canvassing the exhibits and posting our results.  Since Cindy’s original idea, the goal has been to raise the online profile of diverse titles (build that buzz, get people wanting them as hot books) and also to let publishers know that we, the buying public - especially librarians and educators - want diverse titles and appreciate the ones they put out. You can check out the #diversityatala hashtag on Twitter and see the Twitter account. I am urging all of you to join me in this effort.  What we’re looking for, more than anything, is numbers.  We want there to be wave upon wave of people asking publishers about diverse books, particularly by #OwnVoices authors.  We want publishers to know these ARE the books we want to buy, promote, and share. Here are a few tips I think are especially effective when taking the diversity conversation to publishers in any exhibits hall:Be positive. You know how much it sucks when a patron starts yelling at you about how their $1.75 fine pays your taxes so you’d better do what they say?  Because, among other things, they just don’t understand the hierarchy of how your library is structured?  That’s what it’s like when you go up to a random publisher booth representative who does publicity and marketing for the school market and start a conversation about how much you hate one of their books. Now look. Most of you probably know that I’m the last person on the planet to urge you to “play nice” and “be kind.” I am a huge fan of directly and unceasingly calling out bullshit! But most of the people working the floor are not editors or execs.  The thing they want to hear the most and the thing they get the most use out of is knowing what you do want and what is popular in your community, classroom, and library.  That’s what makes them want to sell and promote MORE, not just to you but to everyone. Look at nametags.  That’s just good manners, for one, so you know who you are talking to and it also lets you see what this person’s actual job is - maybe you will end up talking to an editor or someone higher up at a company. That can absolutely impact what kind of conversation you have. So here’s what I mean when I say “be positive” - talk about a diverse book from that publisher that you love, your patrons love, you love using in class, or you never have on the shelf because they’re always in circulation. Tell them WHY it is amazing.  Find a picture or a copy of it in their booth if they have it and make a huge fuss over how wonderful and popular it is. Mention that the diversity is part of why you love it and would love to see more books like it from them. You don’t have to lie and you don’t have to fake enthusiasm - but you can build on the truth.  Be specific. “I’d love to see more books from Native authors.  Have you read In the Footsteps of Crazy Horse by Joseph Marshall III?  It’s from Abrams and it’s amazing.” “Are you familiar with the concept of #OwnVoices books? They’re some of our favorites at my library. My teens have loved Written in the Stars by Aisha Saeed and If I Was Your Girl by Meredith Russo.”“I’m so happy you published Niño Wrestles the World and Rudas: Niño’s Horrendous Hermanitas. We have such fun with them at storytime! I’d love more books like that for storytime.”Know what you are talking about. Have specific examples.  If you’re afraid of blanking, prepare some notes beforehand to take with you to the booths, or take a minute or two to look around the booth and see what books they have out that you’re familiar with and can talk about, or that you want to know more about.Make them sell you. Ask the booth reps what diverse books they are excited for. Put them on the spot. Selling books, and selling you on the books, is their job and they should be able to do that for diverse titles and POC/FNN authors.  And one way we can make sure they’re ready to promote these books to everyone, not just those of us doing the specific asking, is to consistently ask about them. And if they can’t booktalk a diverse book?  Tell them that’s what you’re looking for, and let them know we want the sales pitch from them in the future. Stop by small publishers too. This is sometimes harder at Midwinter, since they often don’t have as much of a presence, but it is still worth keeping on your radar. You should always take time to seek out smaller publishers - especially because they are often doing THE MOST work in publishing #OwnVoices authors.  I think every person who visits exhibit halls during conferences should read René Saldaña, Jr’s post  Forgive Me My Bluntness: I’m a Writer of Color and I’m Right Here In Front of You: I’m the One Sitting Alone at the Table, and not just consider what it says but consider how it will impact your time in exhibits. I always have at least a few small publishers I want to visit to talk about specific books with or just hear about what they have coming next. Our support and enthusiasm for their work - as well as letting them know that we can and will financially support them in our buying - is important and this is a good chance to let them (and their authors) know. Spread the word. Use the hashtag.  Share pictures of the books on social media. Be excited about them to the booth reps. And tell them why. Tell your colleagues to go ask the same things.  Show that there is demand every chance you can get. Buzz for books is made by PEOPLE. We can amplify buzz, we can make diverse books and #OwnVoices authors hot. We can do this all the time, of course, but exhibit halls are this opportunity on steroids and a chance for us to do this directly with the publishers in real time. We’ve got to make the most of this. So if you’re going to be at ALAMW, please consider joining us! One of the biggest problems diverse books face, especially #OwnVoices titles, is the FALSE assumption that they’re like medicine. “Well, I don’t really wanna read this but, SIGH, diversity, I guess.” Our enthusiasm, our excitement, our focus can show that’s not the case. Let’s use our voices to make a difference.ResourcesAva, who blogs at Bookiness and Tea, put together a list of 60 Diverse Books to Look Forward to in 2017 Rich in Color’s Release Calendar is always a great place to check.And if you see me anywhere at ALAMW, please come up and say hi! I love chatting (surprise) and meeting new people and even going around the exhibits on missions!-Angie Manfredi"},
{"title": "RWW Interviews: Laura M. Jiménez", "date": "Tuesday, January 10, 2017", "text": "Laura M. JiménezOur RWW Interviews series continues today with a conversation between Allie Jane Bruce and Laura M. Jiménez. Jiménez earned her Ph. D. in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology from Michigan State University in 2013. She is currently a lecturer in Boston University School of Education’s Language and Literacy program. Her research primarily focuses on reading comprehension and issues of representation in young adult literature with a special interest in graphic novels. Her work has appeared in The Journal of Education, Journal of Language & Literacy Education, Journal of Lesbian Studies and, most recently, The Journal of Literacy Research. She is currently working on a large-scale project looking at the ways women and girls are represented in graphic novels.In addition, she writes a blog (http://booktoss.wordpress.com/) in which she reviews graphic novels and brings her understanding of graphic novels, YA literature and representation to a wider audience.---Can you share your origin story? How did you get started in this work, and what has changed over time?Originally, in grad school I studied literacy, reading, and reading motivation.  I wasn’t interested in literature then.  I read a lot, though, I always have.  Reading saved my life when I was a kid.  But in academia, literature and literacy are separate, and I was looking at literacy.  Then I started teaching children’s literature, and I found out that the way that it’s taught is very marginalizing along race, class, and sexuality lines.  That bothered me.  It’s also not grounded in literacy research.  So, I changed the way I taught.  Instead of putting all the “others” in the “ethnic aisle,” which, in academia, means the final week of class or in its own course, I taught it as a normal part of children’s literature.  And it was really difficult for my students, way more difficult than I thought it should be.  I was teaching the people who would go on to be American teachers--White women for the most part--and they were having a really really hard time connecting with these stories outside of their lived experiences.  And the more stereotypical and trope-ful the book was, the easier they could connect with it.  So I had to ask, how do I get people from White America to learn how to read and experience books in ways that are so different from them?  The answer came largely from W.E.B. DuBois’ theory of dual consciousness.  So when I write my blog, I’m trying to help White, straight, able people develop that dual consciousness.  It’s my way of saying, “I see the world this way.  This is how I can translate it for you so you can also see the issues that I am seeing.”At first I was writing about books that I liked, good fit for classrooms.  About a year ago I decided, after talking to Debbie Reese, that I was going to take the idea of criticism head on--real, literary criticism.  Using race, queer, feminist theory to do that work on an open blog space.  Now, I research and write almost exclusively about graphic novels.  What finally did it for me was when I had read and posted about Delilah Dirk by Tony Cliff.    It was being touted as this great adventure story for girls, and it was incredibly sexist and misogynistic.  Her physicality is completely stereotypical, her cleavage is always perfect and out there, her arms are like little twigs, her upper arm is the same thickness as her lower arm even though she’s this sword-wielding badass.  The importance of image can’t be understated.  And the response I kept getting: “It’s so fun! He tried.”  And I finally said, “I can’t give a medal for trying.  Kids, girls, boys, everybody, deserves a better representation than this.”  It completely rankled me, and I took the gloves off.Now, I don’t go looking for bad books.  Unfortunately, it’s not that hard.  I blog about the fabulous, I blog about the crap.  Unfortunately, there’s a lot of crap, pumped out under the guise of diversity in literature.  That’s what really bothers me. Tell us about your research in graphic novels.  What questions are you asking?  What have you learned so far?I look very closely at comprehension and motivation.  Typically, when academics look at graphic novels, everyone is saying “Look how motivating we are!” and nobody has asked “what are kids learning from this?”  Recently, that’s changed. What we’ve seen is that reading graphic novels is different from reading print novels.  It takes different processes, attention, time.  I’m not sure that reading graphic novels will directly transfer to reading print.  I’m not saying it won’t, there’s just no research base to say that it will.  I suspect there is a subset that will like the metacognitive work you do in both--the questioning, the predicting, inferencing, finding evidence.  I think the higher order thinking you do when you’re reading graphic novels will transfer over to print.  But I’m not sure yet.Here’s what we do know: kids that read graphic novels learn content, solid information, from them, that they are then able to produce on standardized tests.  In one study I’m involved in, kids read Nathan Hale’s Hazardous Tales: One Dead Spy, and then we asked them standard history questions about the American Revolution.  We didn’t teach the book like a history text; they read it like a novel.  But they learned the content and the vocabulary.The other thing is, all the kids wanted to read the books.  That’s the motivation piece.  We know that if they don’t want to read, kids will actually put more work into avoiding reading than the reading would actually take.  I borrow a lot of my thinking and teaching on this subject from library science--that “shut up and get a book in their hands” mentality.  If they don’t like it, get another one.  That is very very different from literacy-- “they should read this book for this reason.”  That’s the traditional thought.  What I tell people is, the question is, “are they going to read or are they not going to?”  And the arbiter of that is the child.  The older the child, the more sophisticated they are in subverting the systems they need to read.  So the single best thing we can do is motivate them.And graphic novels are additive, because they contain visual cues as well as verbal.    We have enormous visual cortexes; we really are built to see the world.  We think that that visual component attunes the memory, and makes it easier to retrieve.  It is possible that reading multimodal books  embeds the information in a sort of multi-dimensionally or multiple places in your brain. In all the work that you do, what are you most proud of?I recently got the only piece about graphic novels in Journal of Literacy Research.  It took two years, and I brought in a second author to help me with the writing.  I’m hoping it’ll change the way the literacy field looks at graphic novels.  They’re not just popcorn, not just useful to keep the kid busy in the back of the classroom.  They’re complex, multi-dimensional literature. How do you stay motivated or promote self-care when facing frustration or pushback?I am very bad at self-care.  I think I am much better at handing out advice about taking care of yourself.  I am great at giving that advice, telling people to take a night off, but I’m the worst at actually doing it.  Luckily, I have a group of friends that give that advice right back at me.  So when I’m feeling completely drained, I just get angry, and then I’m not good.  And then I need to step back, take time off, spend time with my kids, cook a meal, read for pleasure.  I have people to tell me that, and I am smart enough to listen. Who are your heroes, both within and without the children’s literature world?Debbie Reese.  She is an inspiration, a touchstone.  I venture beyond my own identity: lesbian, Latina, nontraditional learner.  But I’m looking at representation of marginalized communities, which means I’m looking at communities I’m not a part of.  In some ways, that holds its own problematic issues.  But I can always go to her and say, “Am I totally off base here?”  She knows what’s going to get kickback, she knows when you’re sticking your neck out.  And she’s so generous.One hero I’ve never met - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who talks about the balance between knowledge and skill, finding flow.  He’s looked at aesthetics, and how people read and react to what they’ve read--very needed.What advice do you have for others looking to do equity work in the world of libraries and youth literature?What I’ve discovered is that treating White, straight, able people as the problem or the enemy does not work.  I take that stance seriously.  Whiteness as an identity can’t be the problem--I start with that in mind.  I have to give them opportunities so they have the chance to be aware of their own identity.  It sounds strange to people, but I truly believe that White people do not realize that they are White.  It’s like trying to ask a fish to identify the water.  So I try to give them opportunities to see the water.  I have them identify their identities out loud.  I get them used to literally saying the words out loud: race, racism, White, Latinx.In my teaching experiences, which are mostly with middle class White women, I think they have decided the best way to not get in trouble is to not talk about race, sexism, really all identity.  Just avoid it.  Avoid it at the cost of anything.  I have to break through that training.  We can’t deal with it if we don’t talk about it.  So I have them read WONDER and OUT OF MY MIND, as a paired texts.  By that time, at the end of the semester, I’m really looking for them to name the kind of flat character that Palacio gives us in Auggie--the object he acts as versus the kind of character Draper gives us in Melody.  I also look to see if they can figure out that she’s Black.  She doesn’t name it because she doesn’t need to.  By and large, there’s usually one or two people who don’t see it.  But the rest of the class does, because we have a community that can talk about it.  That last class, I am hoping I don’t have to say one word.  If I get them there, it’s been a successful semester.The one thing that frustrates me the most--and I’m glad that Reading While White is doing what it does--is that if I say something about a book, if Debbie or Edi says something, we’re all told that we’re not giving the author a chance.  That they tried.  We are not believed.  If you look at the traffic RWW get vs the traffic I get or Edi gets, even though we’ve been doing this for longer, you get more, and the only difference is that you’re White.  To be honest, part of me resents that.  And, I am glad that there are people willing to amplify our voices.  If I write something, and you pick it up, that means so many more people will be willing to hear it.  And that is paramount to my work.  You get a lot of crap, the same criticism, but at the end of the day, you are heard and you are believed.  Without White voices, our message can’t be heard.  We are not believed.  It’s good that your team realizes it.-Allie Jane Bruce"},
{"title": "Award Attention", "date": "Thursday, January 5, 2017", "text": "In January, many youth librarians look forward to the announcements of ALA’s Youth Media Awards, which happens on the Monday morning of the Midwinter conference; this year, on Monday January 23rd at 8am Eastern.  (Details including a link for the live webcast can be found here.)Over the years, this press conference has grown to include all of the youth media awards selected by ALA Divisions or Round Tables, including the Schneider Family Book Awards, the Stonewall Awards, the Coretta Scott King Book Awards, and the Pura Belpré Awards.  This last award is co-sponsored by The Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC, a division of ALA) and The National Association to Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking (REFORMA) together, which ensures its announcement (via ALSC) at the YMA press conference.  REFORMA is an affiliate of ALA.  There are other youth book awards selected by ALA affiliates which are not included in the YMA press conference, as they are not co-sponsored by an ALA body. They include: Asian/Pacific American Award for Literature to honor and recognize individual work about Asian/Pacific Americans and their heritage, based on literary and artistic merit. Sponsored by the Asian Pacific American Library Association (APALA).American Indian Youth Literature Award to identify and honor the very best writing and illustrations by and about American Indians. Books selected to receive the award will present American Indians in the fullness of their humanity in the present and past contexts.  Sponsored by the American Indian Library Association (AILA). This award is presented every two years and will be announced next in 2018.Sydney Taylor Book Award  presented annually to outstanding books for children and teens that authentically portray the Jewish experience. Sponsored by the Association of Jewish Libraries (AJL).Of all of these awards, the Coretta Scott King, Pura Belpré, Asian/Pacific American and American Indian Youth Literature Awards are notably all for books created by people of those communities, about their own experience.  Over the years, I've heard the following questions repeatedly, largely from White people: “Shouldn’t any book about [a marginalized race] be eligible if it is the best portrayal of that experience?” or “Shouldn’t any book by an author of [a marginalized race] be eligible because it promotes an author of color?”  In fact, I have asked these questions myself during my career, and, gratefully, been reminded by White colleagues that either question misses the point. Organizations of librarians from marginalized communities take the lead on these awards, and the last thing they need is to explain how sorely these awards are still needed to well-intentioned White people. Yet they do.  Marc Aronson’s Slippery Slopes and Proliferating Prizes back in 2001 and Andrea Davis Pinkney’s response echoes today’s post-election railing against identity politics. While I applaud all the youth media award winning authors and illustrators, you will always hear me clap the strongest for #OwnVoices book awards.   Please buy these books, and share the news, especially for those without a presence at the ALA Youth Media Awards press conference. These are meaningful awards deserving of everyone’s attention, and White people can do a better job of holding them up. --Nina Lindsay"},

She blogsat https://campbele.wordpress.com/ and can be found on Twitter at @CrazyQuilts. Thank you, Edi, for sharingyour insights with us!---To many of us, youare an online superhero. Can you share your origin story? How did you getstarted blogging?Super hero? No, I’m just a librarian doing her thing. Thereare so many, many more librarians, publishers, editors, authors andillustrators who have done this for such a long time! Their persistence hasmade it that much easier for me to do what I do. Just imagine some of thethings I post that would have had serious consequences just a few decades ago.Because of what they have stated, exposed, spoke and risked, those of usworking today are able to feel hopeful.So, how did I get started?? I came into the library afterspending part of my career teaching Social Studies. I had actually been aschool librarian for a couple of years before I began blogging. I was lookingfor a new technology to master and I was also thinking about so many librariansand teachers who kept saying that they had a difficult time finding books byAfrican American authors. I thought that could be something to blog about. Ithought I could combine my interest in technology and in books to promoteliteracy for African American teens. I immediately saw the need to also includebooks for Latinx and my blog continued to become more and more inclusive.What has changedsince?I think several things have changed over the years. I’vetried different things over the years, some more interesting than others. Ithink I blog to promote Native American authors, authors of color and theirbooks rather than to promote literacy and that’s probably because I’m not in aschool library any more. Much of the sharing I used to do on my blog is nowdone on Facebook and Twitter and I think that brings up one major change in myblog: I just don’t post as much as I used to. I think my posts fell off when Iwas on BFYA and then the Walter Award Committee, and I’ve not really recoveredfrom that, not gotten back into the blogging routine. Next year, I’m on anotheraward committee so I’ll be back to blogging without talking about current booksthat are eligible for that award.Something else that has changed since I started would bethat other forms of social media have come about that have actually provided avoice to marginalized people. This has been a huge development.You’ve talked aboutthe importance of connecting with people with whom you disagree. How do you breakthe echo chamber?I have two Twitter accounts and two Facebook accounts and itamazes me how many people I connect with that seem to share my sameperspectives. I’ve even reconnected with people from grade school and highschool and still I see little dissent on my FB feeds.At this time when we’ll “unfriend” someone who says theslightest thing with which we disagree, it seems that it takes a consciouseffort to connect with people of differing opinions. It’s following that personwho says something you don’t completely agree with or in ‘real life’ it’staking the risk of saying some things others may not agree with and being ableto listen to others’ reactions. I’m beginning to think that coming offline andhaving those face to face connections is where we’re really going to buildrobust communities. Online, where there is no chance to read body language orfacial expressions we tend to parse words while expecting nuancedconversations. It’s easy to get caught up and misunderstood online.I like what Ashley Hope Perez said a few weeks ago in givingadvice to people who want to be allies. She suggested using social media as atool for listening. Sometimes, just listening helps us grow more than thinkingwe have to say something, especially if we’re listening to people outside theecho chamber.In all the work thatyou do, what are you the most proud of?This is going to feel like a punt, but I am most proud of mychildren and this definitely includes my daughter in law. While I maintain thatthey have become the awesome people that they are despite me, I am so very,very proud that they are my children. I learn so much from them! They are trulyamazing people.I take pride in being a librarian. While people claimlibrarianship is dying, I find it to be a very vibrant and demanding professionthat requires me to keep learning, allows me to innovate services and provideways for me to make a difference for others.Can you tell us aboutthe We’re the People list?This is also something of which I’m quite proud! For thepast couple of years, I’ve been able to work with some of the most amazingpeople in children’s literature (Tad Andracki, Sarah Park Dahlen, Sujei Lugo,Lyn Miller-Lachmann, Nathalie Mvondo, Debbie Reese, Ed Spicer and EbonyElizabeth Thomas) to create summer reading lists for all ages of children. Wework together throughout the year to identify books written by authors of colorthat are chapter books, picture books, middle grade, young adult and adultcrossover. We critically review each book so that our list contains books thatwe would be proud to give any child.We look for books from small and large publishers, as wellas self-published books. Intersectionality is extremely important as we look forbooks that also include LGBT+ characters, those with disabilities and thosefrom a variety of socio-economic backgrounds. We want biographies as well assports books, speculative fiction and mysteries. We try to apply diversity inevery sense of the word. It’s a lot of work, but it’s good work.How do you staymotivated or promote self-care when facing frustration or pushback?I don’t work alone. From the very beginning, I’ve been witha network of people who are just amazing! The network has changed over theyears, but it’s always been there and I can always turn to them for clarity,strategy or for a good laugh. Being surrounded by people of integrity is thekey to accomplishing most things in life, including remaining sane.Balance is a critical part of self-care, but it can bechallenging when you earn your living by your passion; when you want to getaway from work, yet you want to read a book! I’ve only recently questioned‘what am I doing for me?’ It helps to be healthy, to eat to live rather thanliving to eat and to get out in nature as much as possible. I think celebratingis an important part of this equation, but in equity work, it can seem likethere is so little to celebrate at times, but there are small successes and ithelps to stay positive to recognize them.Who are people youlook to for advice and inspiration?My family really takes a strong interest in what I do. Mychildren keep up with much of what I’m doing and we talk about many issues thatintersect with my passion, and with their passions, too. Talking to them,getting a perspective from outside that echo chamber really helps. And theinspiration I get from my daughter-in-law as well as my three children knows nolimits.Children’s literature is an intersecting world. We have somany differences within this community, but we have that common drive to getgood literature to our children and that really holds us together. I’veapproached so many people for advice and rarely if ever have been turned away.There are too many people in children’s literature who excelat what they do to begin naming names, too many people who have shared wisdomor advice with me and who inspire me.What advice do youhave for others looking to do equity work in the world of libraries and youthliterature? I’d say if you’re interested in doing equity work inlibraries and/or children’s literature, you should be clear about why you wantto do this work. If it’s about what you want to get and not what you want togive, you may want to spend your efforts on something else.I’d say understand that you’re joining a network of peoplewho are and have been entrenched in this work; build upon their knowledge. Knowthat we’re reaching a point in time where those who are LGBT+, disabled, NativeAmerican or people of color know who we are and what we want. We’re not lookingfor missionaries to represent our interest. We need workers who honor the pastwhile creating a new future. I’d say forget patience, we’ve been patient toolong. Look back and fly forward.- Elisa Gall"},
{"title": "Introducing Our RWW Interviews Series", "date": "Wednesday, December 28, 2016", "text": "We are pleased to introduce our newest series, where we will feature key players from the children’s literature world in conversation with a core member of Reading While White (RWW). The topics will vary, but all will be pertinent to our thrust of racial diversity and inclusion in books for children and teens. We are grateful to Edi Campbell, who gave us the idea for this series; appropriately enough, Elisa Gall’s interview with Edi is due up first (check back tomorrow morning).Our interviewees will be mostly women of color and First/Native Nations. Why? Because we want to reflect the reality of who has been doing the work in this field. Of course there are men among the “Diversity Jedi,” but let’s be honest: when we men do anything in children’s literature (or any other field, for that matter) we get heaped with more praise than we deserve, or at least more praise than a women would get in the same situation.We look forward to these conversations and hope you will tune in to our first interview post tomorrow.- Sam Bloom"},
{"title": "Spotlight On #OwnVoices: When We Were Alone", "date": "Wednesday, December 21, 2016", "text": "Robertson, David A. When We Were Alone. Illus. by Julie Flett. Highwater Press, 2016. 24 pages. ISBN 978-1-55379-673-2.An inquisitive young girl, working in the garden with her kókom, asks a series of questions.  \"Nókom, why do you wear so many colours?\" \"Nókom, why do you wear your hair so long?\" \"Nókom,why do you speak in Cree?\"Nókom's answers come in three parts: What life was like at home, in her community; what life was like at the school she went to, which was far away from home; and what life was like when she and her classmates managed to escape from the watchful eyes of their captors for a few minutes at a time, during which they remembered, and briefly re-lived, happy times.Robertson's straightforward yet poetic text (\"...at the school I went to, far away from home, they cut off all our hair. Our strands of hair mixed together on the ground like blades of dead grass\") makes this deceptively simple book accessible to roughly first grade and up, and Flett's delicate collages encapsulate the mood of every page turn.  Descriptions of the enforced bleakness of life at boarding school, as children were dressed mono-chromatically, punished for speaking their own languages, and prevented from seeing their family members, are reflected with appropriately bleak renderings; in the rare moments children can snatch alone, splashes of color and vibrancy emerge.Perhaps most noteworthy about When We Were Alone is how it elegantly balances three separate narratives: life at home, in the community; life at a dehumanizing \"school\"; and, brief snatches of humanity and happiness in the face of that colonial force.  As important as it is to teach children the truth about race and colonialism in history, there is a danger of instilling in them a narrative in which Native peoples are necessarily victims.  When We Were Alone honestly presents a history that attempted to victimize Cree children--and then counters it with a narrative of survival, humanity, and community.  A first purchase for every children's collection.Reviewed by Allie Jane Bruce."},

TheSecret Stars. Illus. by Felipe Dávalos. Marshall Cavendish, 1998,  32pages ISBN 0-7614-5027-0 op On the Night of the ThreeKings, Sila and Pepe think excitedly about the toys that might appear the nextmorning, and they worry that the frigid weather might make locating their NewMexico home next to impossible. Their grandmother, cuddled with hergrandchildren under a cozy quilt, assures them that the Three Kings will find away to navigate by stars even with clouds in the sky. (“There are stars behindclouds / and in many secret places.”) As they sleep in bed, she takes them on adream where they find stars shining everywhere: in the twinkle of the freezingflowers, a spider’s icy egg sac, and even in the chicken coop. The childrenwake on the day of the Three Kings to notice beautiful stars in the veins ontheir grandmother’s face, presents waiting for them in the barn, and threefrozen and glistening pine trees:“Look-ee, look-ee there,Sila,” cries Pepe.“The pines have become the Three Kings!”“And their crowns and capes,” says Sila,“they are filled with stars.”Through theirdialogue, the family’s faith and love shines as brightly as the glitteringpieces of nature they discover together. The Three Kings, each with a differentskin tone, are shown on the title page and later as figures on the mantle, butthe mysteries of their gifts are left for readers to interpret. The text is engaging, full ofmetaphor (“She is the warm hearth on this cold night. / She is the nestlinglog.”) and descriptions, such as the “Rat-a-tat-tat” of the freezing rain onthe rooftop. The illustrations combine spot art with paintings within frames,reflecting the Southwestern setting. A darker palette allows for shiningobjects to pop, reinforcing the mood of discovery and feel of light amid theshadows of winter. While this is about aspecific holiday, the family’s warmth and the children’s enthusiasm andanticipation will have universal appeal. It’s no surprise to me that the Pura Belpré Award Committee recognized Dávalos with an honor for illustration in 2000. Let’s get itback in print so that more families can snuggle up like grandmother, Sila, andPepe and create new memories reading and sharing this story together. -Elisa GallThe #OwnVoices tag in this case applies only to the illustrator."},
{"title": "Bring It Back!", "date": "Tuesday, December 13, 2016", "text": "I'm sure we've all had the experience of setting out to buy a favorite book as a gift for a child or a teen -- or replacing a worn library copy of a popular item -- only to find out that the book is out of print and no longer available.This seems to happen with even greater frequency with books by and about people of color and First Native/Nations. Joseph Bruchac's memoir Bowman's Store: A Journey to Myself was published by Dial in 1997 and went out of print so fast it never had time to find its audience or work its way into the secondary curriculum -- and this in a time when teachers were crying out for authentic books about First Native/Nations for their classrooms. Luckily, Lee & Low managed to bring it back into print just four years after its original publication, and it's been in print and available from them since 2001.Just this fall Lee & Low has brought back into print another great book, Mama and Papa Have a Store by Amelia Lau Carling (as well as the Spanish language version La tienda de mamá y papá, with the translation by Carling as well).  This exceptional picture book recounts part of the author/illustrator's early childhood in Guatemala as a member of a second generation Chinese immigrant family. It was originally published by Dial in 1998 and it won the Américas Award, as well  a Pura Belpré Honor for illustration in 2000. In the early years of the award, there were so few Latinx books that the Belpré Award was given every two years so there would be a large enough pool from which to choose. And there were times when one of the awardees would already be out of print by the time the award was announced.But Lee & Low can't bring every great book back into print.I always want to buy John Steptoe's brilliant picture book Baby Says (Harper, 1988) as a gift for every new baby I know. But I can't because it's been out of print for years and I can't afford the $47.50 used book dealers are asking for for it on Amazon. It's a shame Harper never had the foresight to issue it as a board book. They wouldn't even need to change the trim size or truncate the text. How can we let publishers know that we want these books when we can no longer buy them to demonstrate that?  Diverse books need to stay in print longer than they currently do, and they need to be available in paperback and board book editions, too.With this in mind, we're launching a new series on Reading While White called \"Bring It Back!\" We hope to call attention to the great  #OwnVoices books we have on our library shelves which have all too quickly disappeared from the stores and warehouses. Because it's not just that #WeNeedDiverseBooks.  #WeNeedDiverseBooksToStayInPrint. --KT Horning"},
{"title": "Spotlight on #OwnVoices: Freedom Over Me", "date": "Tuesday, December 6, 2016", "text": "Bryan, Ashley. Freedom over Me:Eleven Slaves, Their Lives and Dreams Brought to Life. A Caitlyn Dlouhy Book / Atheneum. 52pages. ISBN 978-1-4814-569-6Peggy, John, Charlotte and child, Stephen, Mulvina, Jane, Athelia, Qush, Bacus, Betty. It is with little more than these names thatthis book began. Ashley Bryan explains in his author's note that he acquired acollection of slave-related documents and found among them an 1828 estate appraisal for the Fairchilds: “Eleven slaves are listed for sale with thecows, hogs, cotton; only the names and prices of the slaves are noted (no ageis indicated).” From those names, Bryan imagines lives into being. Each of the eleven African andAfrican Americans—men, women, one teenager, one child—is introduced with aportrait and first-person narrative poem. The portraits show somber faces alivewith fine lines, set against backdrops comprised of scraps of historicaldocuments relating to slavery. On each portrait, the individual’s name and ageappears at the bottom in a light, lovely script: “Peggy, age 48.” Next to the name and age, in heavytype, is the purchase price. For Peggy: “$150.” In a book that emphasizes the fullhumanity of these individuals, that speaks the imagined truths of their livesbut also gives weight and breath to their imagined hopes and dreams, theatrocity of slavery is represented first and foremost by that purchase price accompanying every portrait. Theseare human beings who are owned, who are “appraised” and assigned a dollar valuelike cotton or cattle. The first-person narrative for eachindividual provides some of the details of her or his life as Bryan imagines it.Peggy is a cook in the Big House. She remembers her village being raided, herfather being killed, being captured along with her mother and surviving thejourney to America that many others did not. She is not only a cook, but ahealer, and wanders the estate gathering herbs. For each subject Bryan offers asecond poem, a dream poem, and an accompanying painting that breaks free of allformality and sobriety in a vibrant, joyful scene. In “Peggy dreams,” Peggyreflects on her given name. She was Mariama before she came to America, whichmeans “Gift of God.” She finds joy in relieving the suffering of her fellowslaves. “Mrs. Fairchilds's dinner guests / praise my cooking. / The praise,however, / that touches my heart / is to hear the slaves / call me HerbDoctor.” “Bacus, age 34” ($250) is a blacksmith.He’s married to “Charlotte, age 30,” a basketmaker, and they have a daughter,“Dora, age 8,” with whom Charlotte is being sold ($400). Bacus knows of slaveinsurrections, has studied the stars and thought about running, wondering if all three of them can make it to safety. But he’s worried now about being soldand separated from his family. Charlotte learned how to weave as a child inAfrica. Now the owners profit from her skill. She knows she and Bacus couldearn enough to live in freedom if they can escape. Their daughter is “Dora” tothe owners, but Charlotte and Bacus call her “Akua, Sweet Messenger.” When Charlotteis busy weaving, others in their community help care for Dora.In “Bacus dreams,” the blacksmith tells how every strike of his hammer against hot metal is an outlet for hisanger, a blow for justice. In “Charlotte dreams,” she speaks of her artistry asa means of self-discovery. In both dream poems the speakers note the distanceand difference between how their owners see them, and who they are. Enslavement weighs heavily on these individuals as Bryan imagines them—of courseit does. The psychic brutality of slavery is at the foundation of this work. Butwhat rises from its pages are eleven vibrant lives: people with history andhopes, dreams and drive, talent and tenderness. So, too, does a glimpse at the connections and community that help sustain them. The institution of slavery sought to erase the humanity of those who were enslaved. Ashley Bryan brings that humanity into full relief here, because while there is no way of knowing what these individuals truly hoped and dreamed or who and what they loved, hoping and dreaming and loving is simply and profoundly part of what it means to be human. Reviewed by Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "When the Personal Is Not Professional (Or, It's Not about Me ... or You)", "date": "Monday, November 28, 2016", "text": "There is a place for loving books in my personal life and there are many titles that I have strong emotional attachments to. This includes childhood favorites as well as recently published books that spark a deep response in me.I imagine the same is true of most of us in the field of children’s and young adult literature. We believe in the power of books to shape and to transform and to move young readers because we have experienced it, often from the time we ourselves were children. We are passionate about books in general, and specific books in particular.  And the books that have shaped or transformed or touched us individually, even in small ways, are the ones we tend to feel most passionate about. When it comes to favorite books from childhood, I think it is easier for many people to understand that holding them dear is a matter of personal opinion rather than professional judgment. As a result, it’s often (but not always) easier for us to also hear cultural criticism of those beloved titles. We can love the book personally while accepting the criticism professionally. (Allie wrote recently about being able to hold these two things simultaneously.)When it comes to new books, however, I think the line between personal opinion and professional judgment too often gets blurred or disappears altogether. Maybe this is part of the reason why exchanges on social media are simultaneously impassioned and entrenched: it's hard to separate the personal from the professional.  And sometimes, it's hard to separate egos too--at least that's how it seems when people respond to critiques, especially cultural critiques, of books in which they are clearly emotionally invested with either passionate defense or passionate disregard, the end result of which is the same: dismissal of the concern as ultimately irrelevant. Discussions around books at this time of year when awards are on everyone’s minds can become particularly passionate and particularly entrenched.The work I do as a professional evaluating books for children and teens is absolutely informed in part by my personal response to the books I read.  And I read a lot of things that don’t move me at all.  I read others that leave me feeling ambivalent, even as I see a place for them in a library collection. As a result, when something does impact me strongly (positively or negatively), you can bet I take notice. And when the impact of what I’ve read is to feel pleasure, even excitement, of course I hope others will feel the same. I know I’m not alone in this.But there is a problem when that personal response becomes a deeply invested emotional attachment that gets in the way of our professionalism.When a book deeply moves us in some way it’s understandable that we become emotionally invested. Maybe it’s something that delights, perhaps even sparking a sense of joy; maybe it makes us feel hopeful; maybe we are saddened by what we read, but that sadness nourishes a sense of empathy. Maybe we find its literary elements astonishingly complex or lyrical; it’s visual elements striking or brilliant, and our excitement at its accomplishment makes us want others to feel the same.   Our emotional investment can make us eloquent in our praise. It can also fuel an infectious enthusiasm. (One of the things I love most about the work I do is being able to share my enthusiasm for specific books with others.) But that emotional investment, in a book, or in an author or illustrator, can also make us unable to hear criticism that is essential to evaluating the same book with our professional rather than personal lens. And professionalism demands that we do just that: seek out and seriously consider informed perspectives when it comes to accurate and authentic representation of race, culture, ethnicity, sexuality, gender and other aspects of identity reflected (or absent) in a book we are evaluating when its content is outside our own experience.  Instead, we too often take it personally. Egos get bruised. And that has to stop. It has to stop if we are ever going to move into truly constructive conversations. And it has to stop because this business of being a librarian, reviewer and critic is not about us. The late Ruth Gordon, librarian, writer, editor, brilliant and blunt commentator and critic, used to challenge people who said they “love” a book.  She made me stop and think about how we use this word in our work.I have come to the conclusion that saying we love a book is a place we may start. It isn’t the place any of us should end in our work as professionals. Yes, it can be hard to hear and consider criticism of a book we “love” and think is exceptional. But it's also our job to be able to do so, because the work we do isn't in service to ourselves, or to books and authors and illustrators, no matter how much we may admire and appreciate them. The work we do is in service to children and teens. Ultimately, in our roles as professionals, our emotional investment belongs with all of them.Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "A Deep Conversation About Binary Thinking", "date": "Monday, November 21, 2016", "text": "Look, I understand the need for a verdict on a book.  Do I spend my limited budget and shelf space on this book?  Yes or no?  This is our lives, as librarians.  But more and more, I wish I didn’t have to make that decision, because what I want to do is have a conversation about the book.It might surprise some to learn that a collection-development “no” verdict from me doesn’t necessarily equal “this book is poorly executed,” and a “yes” doesn’t mean “this book is well executed” (you’re welcome, James Patterson).  And a “no” doesn’t necessarily mean “this book is problematic,” and a “yes” doesn’t mean “this book is not problematic.”  Sometimes a book is well executed and not problematic, but not something I can devote budget to (this happens most often with upper YA, since my school ends at grade 8).  And more often than people think, yes, I include a problematic book in the collection.  This is the real world.One example of this is As An Oak Tree Grows by G. Brian Karas.  I use this as a teaching tool to discuss rewriting history, particularly the erasure of First/Native Nations people, with 6th graders.  I am lucky that Bank Street has the Claudia Lewis Research collection, which is open to anybody within Bank Street to browse and check out from (including kids), but is separate from the main collection; that’s where one can find As An Oak Tree Grows.When a book is problematic, I often want to talk about it with kids.  We parse out what messages it sends and how those messages might impact different readers.  Sometimes these are “mild offences” (we talk about gender stereotyping in Jon J. Muth’s Zen Shorts as examples of microaggressions) and I struggle with whether I should put the book in the Claudia Lewis collection or the Main Children’s collection.  Either way, though, the book is available to anyone with a Bank Street library account.I get frustrated when people conflate yes/well executed/not problematic or no/poorly executed/problematic into lump categories, or respond to me as if I have done so.  I like having conversations that dig deep into ways in which books are problematic and ways in which they are empowering.  I learn so much from these conversations.  And when I read criticism or critique of something I love (even something I love as much as Hamilton!)--it actually doesn’t ruin it for me.  It makes me grateful that I have the chance to learn something new.It took me a while to develop this ability; the idea that I can simultaneously love something and critique it--holding both of those truths at the same time--runs counter to typical White culture.  It requires “and” thinking, instead of “but” thinking (next time you’re in an argument, try saying “yes, and” instead of “yes, but” and see what that’s like).  I used to respond to criticism of things that I love defensively; that reflex was born of binary-based thinking and a perfectionist worldview in which criticism necessarily undoes us.So ten years ago, I might have refused to read criticism of Hamilton, because I believed that valid criticism would “cancel out” the things that I loved about it.  (Incidentally, it also used to be very hard for me to hear criticism of myself.  One of the best things about ditching a perfectionist worldview was that it liberated me from constantly needing a slew of defense mechanisms to preserve a perfectionist-based self-image.)  Now, I love that I know so much more about First/Native Nations’ people’s presence in the Revolutionary War, and at the Continental Congress, and the relationships that George Washington and Thomas Jefferson had with First/Native Nations people.  I also learned about how the show largely erases enslaved people and First/Native Nations people from history, and while I didn’t love this, I parsed out how the show reflects the society in which we live, and I’m grateful for that.  We’re living in an age of questioning age-old assumptions and rethinking how we’ve always done things--how lucky we are, to be alive right now!So when a new book comes along that offers an opportunity for rich, educative conversations, I want to have those conversations.  As Brave As You, for example, I love.  And I want to have conversations with kids about Genie, Ernie, and Grandpop and how much I love their relationship and their growth over the course of the book.  And I want to talk about how the book misappropriates the word “ninja” (the plural of “ninja” is “ninja,” ninja practice ninjago, and someone is not studying to be a ninja unless they are studying to be a paid assassin--these are factoids that a ninja-obsessed child would most likely know) and what messages that sends.  I am extremely fortunate to have a good friend who educated me on ninja, and I want to carry forth the rich conversations she and I have had about it, and share what I’ve learned.  Talking to someone who is only interested in fitting As Brave As You into a good/bad binary won’t help those conversations.These complex, rich conversations won’t provide any easy answers for a question like “Do I spend my budget money on this title, or not?” but they might help inform such a decision.  Likewise, they might inform conversations about “does this book belong on a ‘Best Of’ list?” or “does this book deserve an award?”.  In some cases, such as “does this book book further or deter understanding about a culture?”, a binary “yes” or “no” is useful--this is why I appreciate Debbie Reese’s blog (which, incidentally, includes more non-binary thinking than many give her credit for) and regularly use it to inform my decision-making.I know that you have to make a yes or no decision about whether to buy a book, but please don’t let the need for that decision prevent you from also having a rich, complex conversation about the book.  And if there are problematic titles in your collection, I highly recommend that you have conversations with kids about them and encourage them to think in non-binary ways.  Otherwise, they might not be able to understand that J.K. Rowling’s misappropriation of Navajo culture is not OK.-This post brought to you by an enthusiastic Harry Potter fanAllie Jane Bruce"},

Today Sam looks at a novel published last year.Thanhhà Lai. HarperCollins, 2015. 272 pages. 9780062229182. Click here to purchase this book.Mai can’t believe her parents are making her go to their native Vietnam for the summer. A California girl through and through, Mai would rather be on the beach with her best friend Montana, hoping for a glimpse of HIM (the boy Mai is crushing on). But instead, Mai’s dad (Dr. Do-Gooder, as she calls him) sets up “a one-man surgical clinic” to treat kids in remote villages; Mai gets dragged along as a companion to her grandmother, Bà, who is embarking on one last search for her long missing-in-action husband Ông, Mai’s grandfather. But Mai just wants to get the trip over with already: “I get that my preteen anxieties can’t compete with Bà’s classic suffering. After all, she lost her husband in THE WAR, which I always think of in all caps. Still, selfish or not, I’m going home as soon as I can maneuver around the sad saga of Bà.”Mai is a hard character to love at first, seemingly as egocentric and shallow a 12-year old as you could find. But she undergoes a transformation of sorts while in Vietnam: she listens to relatives speak, slowly learns the language, and develops an understanding and appreciation of the culture; she becomes friends with Út, the polar opposite of girly-girl Montana, and translator Anh Minh, who speaks English with a Texan accent; and finally, through her love for Bà, Mai shows heart that has been there all along, hidden under the snarky, Facebook-checking tween veneer.After winning the National Book Award and a Newbery Honor for her debut novel-in-verse Inside Out & Back Again, it wasn’t as if Lai was going to sneak up on us. But what did surprise me was how funny her follow-up is. (Chapter 13, I’m looking at you. Without getting too spoiler-y, it involves thong-related confusion.) Mai’s narrative voice is hilarious, authentic, and maddening in equal measure. (Speaking of voice, I highly recommend the audiobook, expertly narrated by Lulu Lam—she gets Lai’s mix of sarcastic wit and poignantly beautiful prose just right.)It’s a rare thing for an author to knock it out of the park on her first two books. I know I’m but one of many who can’t wait for Thanhhà Lai’s next release.Reviewed by Sam Bloom"},
{"title": "On Safety Pins, Advocacy, Whiteness, and our field", "date": "Monday, November 14, 2016", "text": "I’ve been thinking a lot over the past few days.  Thinking about our field, and the White people in it.  To borrow from Dave Chappelle--we need to get our shit together.So let’s start communicating in clear, non-bullshitty ways.  Here are my expectations for White people in the field (and to be even clearer, I am a White woman, and much of this I’m writing down to hold myself accountable).White people, I expect you to study the history of race and racism, colonialism and white supremacy in the USA and in children’s literature, and to learn how all of the above are still alive and well today.White men, I expect that in addition to studying the above, you will become experts in patriarchy and misogyny and how they are linked to White supremacy.I expect you to learn about racism as a system that allots power disproportionately to White people, and our unique responsibilities as White people to dismantle that system.I expect you to commit the time and money you can to this education process.  I expect you to read books, read articles, and watch videos.  A starter list: The Root, Colorlines, Latina Lista, Indian Country Today, Hyphen magazine, and The Aerogram.I expect you to, if you possibly can, attend an anti-racist training.  I highly recommend The People’s Institute’s Undoing Racism Workshop, Border Crossers’ trainings, and SEED trainings.I expect you to prioritize this education process over your yoga class.I expect you to educate yourselves before you take actions, recognizing that one of the most dangerous things we White people can do is act without education.I expect you to ask for guidance, to hold yourselves accountable to people of color and Native people, especially women.I expect you to lift up people of color and Native people, especially women (and not just authors and illustrators--I expect you to lift up librarians and teachers and activists).  I expect you to thank them for what they have taught you.  Start with our blogroll.  Become fans of those people.White men--I expect you to recognize that you are uniquely safe in the USA.  You have a shield that nobody else has.  I expect you to use that shield to advocate for others.White women - I expect you to educate yourselves on White Feminism and take responsibility for organizing with other White women to interrupt it.White men--I expect you to connect with other White men, to organize to undo White patriarchy.  Including the White men you feel you are better than, smarter than, separate from. Your life may not depend on it, but your humanity does.I expect that when someone says “ouch” to you, you will apologize.  I expect you to expunge “I didn’t mean...” and “What I meant was…” from your vocabulary and to introduce phrases like “You’re right. Thank you for educating me” and “I clearly have some learning to do.”I expect you to name racism when you see it.  When someone else names racism, I expect you to listen and back them up.  And when other people deny or erase their experiences, I expect you to say, “that is not OK.”White people who are exhibiting safety pins, or their characters with safety pins, I expect you to stop and consider how you have responded to the work of people of color and First/Native Nations and their allies when it comes to naming racism in the children's book industry.  Too many of us ignore, dismiss, or actively undermine their work to fight racism.  Please do some soul-searching and ask yourself how “safe” you really are.Here's something else to consider: not everyone finds the safety pins a meaningful symbol. For some people, they erase the very real reality that they aren't safe.White librarians, teachers, bloggers, and reviewers: I expect you to stop merely advertising for books by/about marginalized groups and to prioritize advocating for them. Let me break this down.Too many of us happily advertise for ourselves, for book creators, or for publishers when it costs us nothing and gains us rewards (like fancy dinners.  And free books.  And connections with authors/illustrators.  And fancy jobs.  And fuzzy warm feelings.)Too many of us disappear when we are called upon to advocate for marginalized people, to put ourselves on the line when it gains us nothing (except our humanity) and could very well cost us something (like the above perks).Too many of us trample people of color and Native people, especially women, in the field, in our field.  Too few of us advocate for women of color and Native women who are librarians.  Too few of us thank them.Too many of us make light of the struggles of people of color and Native people. Too many of us utilize their struggles to get the laugh, to advance our brands. This must stop now. (Make no mistake here--I am in favor of humor as a coping mechanism. But humor that makes a joke of oppression--and thereby strengthens the oppressor--is not OK. Good humor makes fun of the oppressor.  Better humor highlights the nature of oppression.  The best humor weakens the oppressor.)Too rarely do we name our privileges as White people and White men in this field.  White people, I expect you to name your whiteness openly and frequently.Too often, our White fragility and male fragility is activated when people of color name racism and when women name sexism.  Too often, we demand to be comforted in those moments.  By people of color and Native people, and by women.White people, I expect you to make mistakes.  Over and over and over again.  I expect you to apologize for them, over and over and over again, without asking anyone--especially women, people of color, or Native people--to take care of you.  I expect this to be a struggle (it is) and I expect you to not give up.You can no longer be passive, non-racist, \"good\" people; you need to work to actively dismantle this mess.If it makes you feel uncomfortable or confused or guilty or shameful, sit with that for a while (those feelings won't kill you--I speak from experience), then help each other organize.The thing to do now is soul-search.  Listen.  Read.  Talk to other White people who are a little further on this journey.  Let yourselves be educated about the special powers and privileges you have by virtue of being White--especially White men, especially now.  Challenge yourself to ally (verb) every day.White people, including Allie, I expect and accept nothing less from you."},

{"title": "Day of the Dead, ", "date": "Tuesday, November 1, 2016", "text": "Author/Illustrator Yuyi MoralesIn October of 1994 Iwas still dealing with immigrant depression when, on the streets of WalnutCreek, California, I saw something strange. As I pushed my son’s stroller, we passed houses coveredwith spider webs, bloody skeletons, ghosts hanging from trees, and a plasticchainsaw laid on a front lawn. I even recognized a mask from a horror movie onthe lawn. When I returned to my mother-in-law’s house, where I lived during my firstyear in the USA, I asked her in my broken English what I had just seen. Sheexplained it was Halloween.Ever since thatfirst sight, I found it interesting how Halloween precedes the Mexicancelebration of the Day of the Dead. At first sight they even seem to have asimilar theme — death — and yet they are profoundly different. Just like mytwo grandmothers.I grew up in Mexicoin the house of my paternal Abuela, a devout Catholic who said that during theDay of the Dead, you had to receive your deceased loved ones with offerings andan altar, or else face dire consequences. My maternal grandma, a single motherof twelve, had converted to a small new evangelical church and believed thatcelebrating the dead was a thing of the devil. She had taught my mother to stayaway from this and many other traditions. Day of the Dead in Mexico can hardlybe avoided; the streets filled with cempasúchil flowers and the smell of copalincense follows you everywhere. When my mother eventually abandoned the church,many of our friends started including our family in their celebrations bysharing their leftover bread baked for the altars, and we soon participated inthe feasts of the food our family and friends hosted. As a teenager, I had myown break with both of my grandmother’sbeliefs, and I passionately tried to learn what it meant to celebrate the Dayof the Dead beyond the bounds of religious ceremonies.Last summer, duringmy residence at the Maurice Sendak Fellowship, one of my fellow authors broughtme an advance reader’s copy of Raina Telgemeier’s graphic novel Ghosts. I love graphic novels and I had heard that Raina’s books are a huge hit with kids, so Iwas excited to see this book. I began reading and found a story featuring amixed Mexican American family whose youngest child, Maya, is affected by cysticfibrosis. But to my disappointment, something felt off. My first surprise wasthe name of the protagonist. “Catrina” is a term used in Mexico to satirizepoor Mexicans who aspired to adopt European aristocratic identities. Cat, shortfor Catrina, and her family move to a cloudy California town where they makefriends with a Mexican family named the Calaverases (from the word calavera,Spanish for skull, another invented name that made me pause). As CarlosCalavera befriends Catrina and her younger sister, he tells them the town isinhabited by ghosts. The narrative, although touched by stereotypes, makes foran interesting ghost story — the relationship between Cat and Maya is complexand tender as they love each other while dealing with their fear of Maya’s possible death. But when the storyattempts to weave in the celebration of the Day of the Dead, which in this booktakes place on the night of Halloween rather than on November 2nd (!), itreinvents what is to a large, living community a precious, ancient, and evensacred tradition.  \"Ifeel that this image says so much about the Mexican people'splayful relationshipwith the idea of death.\" Yuyi MoralesWoman in Morelos. Photo: Yuyi MoralesDay of the Dead canbe traced back to the Aztec rituals honoring the deceased during the eighteenmonths of their calendar. After the Spaniards conquered Mexico, these ritualswere made to coincide with the Catholic ceremonies of All Saints and All Souls,condensing the celebrations into two days, November 1st for honoring thechildren and November 2nd for honoring the adults. In small towns, entirecommunities prepared under strict rules for the ceremonies, while urbansettings celebrated with sugar skulls, skeleton toys, and a playful attitude oflife being one with death. At the heart of the celebration there is the beliefthat during the days reserved for honoring the deceased, our relatives andfriends now dead should be received lovingly when they visit us from theafterlife for this one day of the year. In Ghosts,these ideas get muddled by the construction of a world where, on the Day of theDead, random ghosts, rather than the souls of the departed, come on themidnight after Halloween to have a grand party with strangers. I know that atleast one of my grandmothers would turn in her grave if she read that on theDay of the Dead ghost cruises and ghost pirate ships tether to the docks, andthat teenagers fall in love with cute dead boys attending the celebration.  Yuyi Morales's Day of the Dead altar, 2016.Photo: Yuyi MoralesAccording to theauthor, Ghosts is inspired by herexperiences of the annual celebrations for the Day of the Dead in the streetsof the Mission district, the Latino neighborhood in San Francisco, of which Ihave also been a participant since the late 90’s. The first time I attended one ofthese celebrations I was delighted to do it in community. From the time I hademigrated to the USA, most of my celebrations were spent alone at home with myson. I was surprised by Day of the Dead in the Mission neighborhood; this wasnothing like the reverent ritual back in Mexico. Gathered for the procession,behind the Aztec dancers and the families with candles and pictures of theirdead loved ones, was a huge crowd. San Francisco, in all its amazing diversity,had come to join the celebration, and some of the participants paraded wearingcostumes with masks, or their faces painted like skeletons, ghosts and otherstrange creatures. In the procession a woman carried a picture of Frida Kahlo,which made me wonder if she didn’thave a relative or a loved one to honor instead. That same night I got invitedto a Dia de los Muertos party where there was dance, drinks, and a costumecontest. The winners were a white couple dressed like sexy vampires. Thereceiving of our loved ones dead had turned into a Halloween spectacle. Likethe author of Ghosts, I have enjoyedthe San Francisco festival for years. As an immigrant I find joy by sharing incommunity the traditions that sustain me. But while I can enjoy dancing with myfriends on that night, I would never suggest one can learn about the spirit ofDay of the Dead by partying at a street festival.I think I canunderstand why an author would decide to use Day of the Dead to tell a storythat tries to make sense of death not as the end, but as a continuation oflife. At its core, this celebration gives a way for people, in this case children,to ease the fear of death of our loved ones. But for all of its goodintentions, Ghosts, carries out anerasure of essential parts of an ancient tradition by rewriting it as acelebration rife with stereotypes, at the expense of a very alive culturalpractice.The other day I reada comment on Amazon in response to Debbie Reese, a tribally enrolled member at NambePueblo in northern New Mexico, who expressed concerns that Ghostshad given an inaccurate portrait of who were buried in the California Missions.“I don't appreciate you getting ... offended over a beautifully crafted novel thathas nothing to do with your heritage,” the comment read. I was astonished, andthen I reasoned that a response like this one is the product of the continuouscolonialism we all have been a part of. When groups of people have beensystematically erased from narratives, books, history, and the world, theybecome invisible to the rest of us. When people can’t be seen, they can be reinvented intoanything, including mascots, bandidos, liars, exotic things, merchandise,romanticized beings, things of the past, or folklore.  Why do I think weneed this discussion? I know I need it because I am a teller of stories, and Icould be the author who, in my enthusiasm to tell an inclusive story, might usemy craft to erase and redraw identities, practices, and ways of living that arenot part of my imaginarium, but that are about real people living real lives. Ineed this discussion because I hope that no child has to explain that somethingI wrote in a book is an inaccurate picture of who he or she is, because of howdifficult it is to refuse an imposed identity once it has been written in abook by a prominent author. I need this discussion because I want to cast awaythe fear that in order to avoid making mistakes that could hurt the mostvulnerable, I would have to work under rules that constrain my imagination,impair my art, smother my voice… Except, that isn’t what is being asked from us, authors,is it?  Photo: Antonio Turok I like to believethat what it is actually asked of me and of everybody who is committed to childrenand literature is to be strengthened by principles. Principles like honesty, sowe have the courage to say what we feel and who we are, but also to recognizethat our vision of the world is always limited and that there is nothing wrongwith admitting we still need to learn things we don't know. Principles such asrespect, so that we listen to the voices of those who are seldom heard beforewe attempt to be their voice. Principles like love, so that we see the humanityand the power of others as we see ours, so that we connect not as saviors orvictims, but as equals.This year my Day ofthe Dead will be celebrated in the altar I built to honor my dead loved ones,whom I will receive with joy in my house. There will be no fear of ghostsvisiting, since my friends who left before me, my long-gone grandparents, mydeceased teachers, and my relatives dead will come invited by the bright lightof the marigold flowers I arranged. They will arrive as a gust of wind, afeather floating on the sunlight, a butterfly, a hummingbird, or a whisper; andafter they eat the spirit of the food I placed on the altar for them, and theyplay with the toys I offer them, drink a much needed glass of water, and evenread some books I will leave for them, they will be ready to take the longjourney back to the land of the afterlife until they return next year. MeanwhileI will keep them alive in my memory, in the stories I tell, and in the best ofour traditions. Lee, C.B. Not Your Sidekick.Duet / Interlude Press, 2016. 296 pages. Paperback: 978-1-94505303-0 Thereis so much to love about C.B. Lee’s 22nd-century superhero story,starting with its protagonist, Jess Tran. Jess is a Chinese-Vietnamese Americanteen living in a world that is both startlingly different and very much thesame as ours. Geopolitical realignment after the third world war, which followedthe 21st-century Disasters, led to the formation of collectivesacross the globe. Jess’s parents emigrated from the Southeast Asian Collectiveto the North American Collective, and Jess has grown up in the small city ofAndover, Nevada region. On adaily basis, Jess goes to classes, hangs out with best friends Emma and Bell,and has a fascination with old tech, especially DVDs. She is openly bisexual,and no one thinks twice about it. Along with gender identity, it is amatter-of-fact aspect of the story; part of the background, not a dimension ofthe plot. But inthis future, some humans have inherited meta-abilities, superpowers that wereoriginally activated during the Disasters due to the release of X29. Jess has afangirl crush on Captain Orion, commander of the Heroes League of Superheroesand granddaughter of one of the original meta-humans. The Heroes League andNorth American Collective run a meta-human training program, and manycommunities have their own superheroes in place to battle the super-villainsthat also reside there.  Outside ofJess’s family, no one in Andover knows that Jess’s parents, mild-mannered realestate agents Lia Hua and Victor Tran, are C-class superheroes Smasher andShockwave, keeping the community safe from villains Master and MistressMischief. Meta-human abilities are genetic, and manifest byage 17. Jess is about to turn 17, and it’s clear she hasn’t inherited any. It’syet another way Jess’s older sister, Claudia, who has already been labeledB-class, outshines her.Tryingto forge her own path, Jess pursues an internship at Monroe Industries, arobotics company. To her surprise, she gets it. Even more surprising, herlongtime secret high school crush, Abby Jones, is another one of the interns. Mostsurprising of all, Jess learns that the people behind Monroe Industries arenone other than Master and Mistress Mischief. The Mischiefs are away, however, and another intern, M, is standing in,wearing the Mischief suit in order, M explains, to maintain authority.  Jesssays nothing at home about the Mischiefs. After all, they are more prankstersthan villains, and Jess admires some of what they’ve done. (At least one oftheir pranks saved the public from eating contaminated cheese.) And even thoughJess doesn’t know who M really is, they develop a friendship. Jess even findsherself confessing her crush on Abby to M, which M encourages her to pursue. SLIGHTSPOILER: It won’t be a huge surprise to most readers that Abby is actually M,and that their attraction is clearly mutual. Abby also reveals that her parentsare the Mischiefs. Jess in turn confesses that she is the daughter of Smasherand Shockwave. Neither truth gets in the way of romance. Of greater concern,however, is that the Mischiefs are missing, and have been for awhile, and Abbythinks Captain Orion is behind it and the disappearance of other villains. Sheasks Jess to help her prove it. It’snot the first time in her life Jess has felt torn between two things. In acommunity with a large Asian population, Jess feels comfortable, yet althoughshe can understand both Chinese and Vietnamese she’s not fluent in either, and sometimesfeels she’s not quite “enough” of either culture. But this is different. Thisis someone she trusts—and loves—asking her to question someone and somethingshe’s always believed in: Captain Orion and the Heroes League.Thereare surprises in store as the novel builds to it’s action-packed climax, including the sobering revelation that racism has not disappeared in the 22nd century.  Like many superhero outings, this one delivers social commentary in the context of a novel in which pacing, plotting, and characters make for an effortlessly enjoyable work. Jess,Abby, Emma, Bell and other characters are both genuine for our time and fitseamlessly into this imagined future that middle gradeand young adult readers can all enjoy.Reviewed by Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "Seeing Myself in Books (and Book Character Parades)", "date": "Saturday, October 29, 2016", "text": "This post mentions Halloween, so if you celebrate the holiday and are planning on dressing up, here’s a reminder to reflect on your costume and how your “fun” might come at the expense of others. When I think about Halloween, I am reminded of a chapter in Debby Irving’s Waking Up White where she describes a conflict in her then-school community about their Halloween parade tradition. Irving learned that Halloween is troubling and spiritually harmful to members of her school community; to many parents, the parade presented deep conflict when their children wanted to participate in it. Their feedback was brought to a school committee, and everyone worked together to start a new, more inclusive tradition, ending the parade but recreating “the feel-good, spirit-building vibe the parade had once delivered.” Instead, students dressed as beloved book characters and held a parade on Dr. Seuss’s birthday in March to celebrate Read Across America Day. (In case you’re wondering, this story is in chapter 25 of Irving’s book. If you haven’t read it, I recommend doing that NOW.) Thanks to social media, I’ve seen many schools host book character parades during October and throughout the school year. While I’ve never walked in a book-specific costume parade before, I love a good literary costume. As someone who does celebrate Halloween, whenever I dress up I try (youth librarian that I am) to go with a kidlit theme. This year, I’m going to be Hilda from Luke Person’s comics and soon-to-be Netflix series. I’ve noticed something about my book costume choices over the years. Every character has been White like me—except when I was Toad from Frog and Toad (by Arnold Lobel, a White author-illustrator). When I think of potential children’s book costumes, most of the human options are of White characters because in children’s books, most of the human characters are White, and most of the other (non-human) characters are by White creators. My experience is the reflection-heavy disco ball side of the illustration by David Huyck presented through Dr. Sarah Park Dahlen’s blog: While I as a White person have options, options, and more options about children’s book character costumes that reflect and affirm that aspect of my identity, not everyone has that same privilege. (I should note that this lack of diversity isn’t exclusive to race. In Australia, for example, librarian Ozge Alkan worked with author Hazel Edwards and illustrator Serena Geddes to create Hijabi Girl after Alkan’s students, sick of dressing as Little Red Riding Hood for their book parades, were looking for a young character in a hijab to dress up as.) I brainstormed characters by People of Color/First Nations authors who might make an appearance at book character parades this year: CJ & Nana, Ling and Ting, Niño, Super Indian, Sparrowboy, Marisol McDonald, Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern...the list goes on. Have these characters ever crossed my mind as costume options for me? If so, what held me back from dressing up? Was it fear or caution so as not to offend people by appropriating a culture or claiming an #OwnVoices character for myself? Was it worry that people wouldn’t recognize me given the differences in how that character looks and my own appearance?  Did I wonder, subconsciously, if those books were somehow not “visible” or “classic” enough for people to “get” my costume without explanation? Was I just choosing a character that was easy and comfortable for me to see myself as? While there is an art to selecting and creating a memorable costume, “classic” is problematic and “visible” is too often a measure of marketing budgets or perceived majority interests, which don’t always lean in favor of diverse, inclusive books and series. Is it possible, in the right context, for a White person to respectfully dress up as a character with a different racial identity? (People in the cosplay community have discussed this and more after some cosplayers altered their skin color while dressing up.)If a character is not identified right away, a costume is one way to start a conversation and spread the news about great books. And how often have I seen (or perhaps expected) children to dress as White characters when they don’t identify as White? I feel anxiety about even considering going as a human book character who doesn’t look like me; I’m working to mark that discomfort and remind myself that it is nothing compared to the experience of going to a Halloween store, or turning on the T.V., or walking into a bookstore or library and not seeing an abundance of characters affirming my own racial identity. Does that mean I shouldn’t be Hilda this year? Does that mean schools or libraries shouldn’t do Halloween or book character parades? Does that mean I should dress up as characters who don’t share my same identity? Not necessarily. Something is lost when a member of a privileged group dresses up as a character who doesn’t belong to that same group, even if it is done with as much care and thoughtfulness as one can muster. While Black Hermione creates a wanted mirror, a White Peter at a book character parade could take something away, for a quick web search for “children’s literature costumes”  demonstrates that White reflections and choices aren’t lacking. Debby Irving’s school community transitioned to a book character parade because it delivered a “feel-good, spirit-building vibe” without the feelings of exclusion that the Halloween parade caused. Book character parades can be a step towards inclusivity worth celebrating and supporting; but, if the children’s literature ecosystem is not yet wholly inclusive, can a parade about its books be?"},
{"title": "Spotlight on #OwnVoices: Juana & Lucas", "date": "Tuesday, October 25, 2016", "text": "Juana & Lucas. Written and illustrated by Juana Medina. Candlewick, 2016. 88 pages. ISBN 978-07636-7208-9 Here in the United States, books about children living in Latin America are few and far between. That's just one of the reasons I was so delighted to find Juana Medina's new book for newly independent readers.Juana is a funny, amiable girl who lives in modern day Bogotá, Colombia.  Lucas is her dog and her constant companion. Aside from Lucas, she loves drawing, Astroman, repollitas (brussels sprouts), Bogotá, her mami, and her best friend Juli.  She'd rather play fútbol than go to school -- she detests her school uniform which is hot and itchy. She's also not too wild about her math class, and really dislikes her new English class. In fact, much of the book is devoted to adult friends and relatives trying to convince her that English is worth learning. Spanish words appear frequently and naturally in the text. They are almost always cognates so they are easy for non-Spanish speakers to translate. And there is enough context to help readers understand the Spanish.  The book is generously illustrated on every page, making this a good choice for  children who are just getting into chapter books. But there is a sophistication to the artwork, as well, which includes diagrams of significant people, pointing out the most important things about them. And Juana's voice is sharp and distinctive. She walks the fine line between being Everychild and being singular. In literature she is most akin to Atinuke's Anna Hibiscus, but she is part Ramona, too. Young readers will find her very appealing and we can hope that this will be the first volume of many about Juana and Lucas.It's extraordinario!"},
{"title": "Awards Discussion Fodder: Thoughts on Stereotypes", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2016", "text": "Let’s talk about stereotypes.  Award season is right around the corner, and while I’m not writing this with any specific book in mind, it’s good to think about stereotypes when considering award contenders.So what is a stereotype?  Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie talks about this much better than I can, but I’ll give it a shot.  Here’s what Merriam-Webster brings to the table:Stereotype (n) - an often unfair and untrue belief that many people have about all people or things with a particular characteristicLet’s take this apart.  A stereotype is, indeed, a belief.  But it’s not necessarily a belief about “all” people in a group.  Melissa Harris-Perry, for example, talks about multiple stereotypes of Black women: the “mammy,” the “hyper-sexualized woman,” and the “angry Black woman.”  In this sense, there are multiple “single stories” of Black women (to borrow Adichie’s term).  The fact that (most) people don’t believe that any one of these stereotypes applies to the entire population of Black women doesn’t mean that they’re not stereotypes.“Untrue”--that’s another problem.  Is it untrue that some East Asian people play the violin?  That some Latinx kids play soccer?  That some Jewish people have relatively big noses?  And why shouldn’t they? (Says the Jewish girl who has fought for a proper bagel and lox.)The problem with stereotypes is that they are reductive, not that they are categorically false.  Which brings me to my personal definition:Stereotype (n) - A reductive story, told about a person or people, that intentionally or unintentionally dehumanizes them.So what does this mean for book evaluation?  I think it means we need to pay attention when characters are given stereotypical traits.  Is the Native character just there to be noble and stoic?  Does the South Asian character just talk about math and samosas all the time?  Does the Black best friend do more than be the Black best friend?If a character includes a stereotypical trait, it’s important to ask whether the author actively counters that stereotype.  If you want examples, go read something by Gene Luen Yang, who could teach a master class in defeating stereotypes.  In The Shadow Hero, for instance, Hank’s mother begins the book as a stereotypical Chinese “tiger mom” and, over the course of the book, becomes fully human and 3-dimensional.  American Born Chinese (SPOILER ALERT!!!) employs a different strategy to nullify Chin-Kee, who embodies every grotesque, inhuman stereotype of a Chinese man: Chin-Kee winds up beheaded and exposed as the non-human thing it is.So ask yourself: When an author introduces a stereotype about a character, does s/he work to counter that stereotype by humanizing the character?  Because as much as we wish books existed in a vacuum, they don’t; including a minor East Asian character whose defining trait is playing the violin is loaded, and different from including a minor White character whose defining trait is playing the violin.  Neither is necessarily bad--what matters is whether all of the characters are allowed to be fully human.If and when someone brings up a concern about stereotypes, it’s important that we listen, especially if we were previously unaware that something is a stereotype.  That lack of awareness is itself a privilege, and we should welcome the chance to remedy our ignorance.-Allie Jane BruceEd. Note 10/19 - Thank you, Tsujimonster, for pointing out my mistake with \"s/he\".  That is 100% my error, and I'm sorry.  I should have used \"they\" so as to not exclude people who identify as nonbinary.  I'm going to leave it as-is in the piece, for maximum transparency and to avoid confusion, but I'll say here: In the 2nd-to-last paragraph, where I say \"...does s/he work to counter that stereotype...\", I should have said \"...do they work to counter that stereotype....\" -AJB"},

While reading the paper before he makes his deliveries, he finds solacein the comics. He especially loves the story of Mark Steed, a police officer(Black like him) who changes from mortal to superhero when he transfers powerswith a falcon and defends the defenseless as “Falconman.” Fiction becomesreality when a sparrow jumps in front of Henry’s bicycle and the two experiencea mysterious “ZAP!” Henry flies over hishandlebars and soars into the sky, loop-de-looping over the neighborhood,delivering papers and helping animals and people in distress along the way.When he realizes that by flying, he has grounded the bird, Henry makes onefinal heroic act. After returning things to normal on Thurber Street, Henrynotices that the big adventure has made him feel “just a little better.”Pinkney employs thescratchboard technique of illustration for which he is famous, but histraditional picture book format shifts when the superhero elements come intoplay: captions, panels, and sound effects enthral readers and provide clues tothem about what is actually happening. (The Falconman comic strip Henry lovesis written by “Barney Nipkin,” a Brian Pinkney anagram.)Even though printnewspaper deliveries might not be part of every family’s routine in 2016, and atween with a paper route is even harder to find—most young people still knowwhat a newspaper is (and the comics format is as beloved as ever). The Adventures of Sparrowboy is relevant to today's readers, on account of the ever-increasing popularity of comicsand graphic novels and the reality that the world's news can still be hard  to grasp.The Adventures of Sparrowboy validates the experience of seeingdifficult news, and also engaging in a thrilling escape. It is recommended to anyfans of visual narrative, especially those self-identified superhero kids looking for someone new tocelebrate.Reviewed by Elisa Gall"},
{"title": "Leaves Changing Color", "date": "Friday, October 7, 2016", "text": "Award Season is full upon us!  A few weeks ago Kirkus announced its Finalists for the Kirkus Prize in Young Reader's Literature. Children's and Teen Editor Vicky Smith called it \"a Heckuva List,\" and it is. Narrowed down to just two titles in each of three subcategories (picture books, middle grade, and young adult), it features diversity in style and audience as well as in authorship.   Few lists of this length do, to this extent. That is, until this week, when the National Book Award Finalists were announced. Of course, we'd seen the longlist earlier so I was already hopeful, but following years when it was remarkable to have more than one writer of color among the finalists, it is wonderful to see, here too, a broader readership represented. Building on two strong years for diversity in the ALSC Newbery and Caldecott awards, can we hope that award juries, and the organizations that run them, are taking fully to heart the need to bring to the table voices that might have previously been undervalued? Are they finally asking: whose excellence in literature, and why? Setting standards by a canon that responds primarily to White voices is an exercise in exclusion, and ultimately, irrelevance. The books now being recognized for major awards by book creators of color and First Nations/Native people can only make the field stronger, and expose previous year's lists' paltry tokenism. Looking at these lists, I'm reminded of what Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a talk last year at Georgetown University Law Center:\"People ask me sometimes ... 'When will there be enough women on the court?' And my answer is: when there are nine.\""},

Chronicle, 2016. 32 pages ISBN 978-1-4521-5472-5 Click to purchaseFirst published in South Korea in 2012, Bomi Park's debut is a dreamlike picture book that celebrates the wonder of the natural world. When an unnamed small girl awakens to the first snowfall of the season, she puts on her boots, coat, scarf and hat and heads outside. Never mind that the sky is still pitch black. That's all part of the sense of wonder we get from the pictures, shown in black, white and shades of gray. The only color initially is the red scarf the little girl wears around her neck, and the red stripe across her knitted mittens. The textured paintings are quiet and subtle and striking. With her puppy companion at her side, she begins to roll a snowball. She rolls and rolls, it gets bigger and bigger, and she gets further and further from home. Through a field, past an early morning train, through the dark woods -- there is nothing threatening in her snowy world. Rabbits, a fox, a deer, and even a bear watch her with curiosity, even reverence, as she steadfastly rolls, rolls and rolls. An interior spread from First Snow by Bomi ParkBy the time she reaches a clearing, her snowball is twice as big as she is and it almost blocks her view of the dozens of other children who've had the same idea. They combine their snowballs to create a village of snowmen, all decked out in the children's hats and scarves. And then the children and the snowmen mysteriously lift off the ground and start to float away.  But was it all a dream? Or her active imagination at play? The final page showing one tiny snowman in the little girl's back yard suggests that she didn't really roll all that far away from home. Unless, of course, the snowman floated down from the skies...Bomi Park is an amazing new (at least to the U.S.) talent, and I hope this will be the first of many picture books we'll see from her. Kudos to Chronicle for finding and publishing this gem of a book, and for making it possible for a small girl in South Korea to roll her snowball all the way to the United States.Reviewed by KT Horning"},

Today Sam looks at a novel published in 2010.By Olugbemisola Rhuday-Perkovich. Arthur A. Levine Books, an Imprint of Scholastic Inc., 2010. ISBN 978-0-545-09676-8 Click here to purchase.On the first day of eighth grade, Reggie McKnight is picked to say the school pledge at a whole school assembly, but when he opens his mouth to speak... he throws up. In front of everyone. Now “Pukey,” as he is known, is the subject of teasing (mostly from his former friend, Donovan) at his Brooklyn school. Plus, Reggie pines over a girl who seems to be out of his league (“A cool wind blows in when the doors opens; it’s Mialonie”) and things are rough at home, with his long out-of-work dad moping around the house and his mom working extra hours to help make ends meet. Luckily, Reggie’s best friends — civic-minded Ruthie and aspiring DJ Joe C. — have his back, even when he finds himself managing the class presidential campaign of hard-to-love Vicky. But self-conscious Reggie starts to come into his own when his church group begins a service project at the Olive Branch Shelter, where he begins to discover his own superpowers — kindness, decency and leadership.Rhuday-Perkovich’s debut works on many levels. It’s a classic school story with engaging middle school characters (though Donovan’s bad guy act is a bit over-the-top). Reggie’s family is supportive and the problems they face ring true. But the volunteerism central to the story is something that we don’t see as much in fiction for young people. The descriptions of the student experiences at the Center are nuanced and believable — Reggie is disturbed at first (“bleach and homeless people take funk to a whole new level”), but eventually finds his comfort zone and weaves himself into the fabric of the place to become a catalyst for positive change.Rhuday-Perkovich has an ear for dialogue — how many books for older middle grade readers have realistic discussions about God and spirituality? But Reggie and Ruthie question each other in more than one memorable exchange on the subject, and their youth group leader Dave is a believably affable adult (“Only Dave laughs at his Bible jokes”).Rhuday-Perkovich just released her second novel, Two Naomis (co-written with Audrey Vernick), which has garnered two starred reviews as of this writing. Two Naomis is surely on your radar (perhaps you’ve fallen in love with it already!), but don’t miss Olugbemisola Rhuday-Perkovich’s debut; Eighth Grade Superzero is an overlooked gem of a novel.Reviewed by Sam Bloom"},

Smithsonian/Viking, 2016. 53 pages ISBN 978-0-451-47637-1 Click to purchaseThe Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture had its grand opening just a few days ago, so this book is especially timely. Bolden recounts the 100 year (100 years!) history behind getting the museum built which started at a GAR gathering of African-American Civil War veterans in 1915 (1915!) with a desire to build a national monument to honor these men. With little to no power to lobby Congress, the members of the National Memorial Association didn't make much progress but kept going. All the while their dream was growing until it had expanded into a full museum to honor African-American history. By 1929 a bill was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on his last day in office. Yes, they could build a museum --  if they could raise half a million dollars to help fund it. The dream was put on hold from several decades but always had its champions, including Senator John Lewis who, starting in 1988, introduced the modern version of the bill for the first time. It wasn't until 2001 until the bill finally passed and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.After that, plans were submitted, an architect and builders were selected, and collections were acquired. Bolden describes each of these steps in vivid detail, showing how each one relates back to the original vision.  Her text is generously illustrated with photographs of the people involved from 1915 to present, as well as some of the amazing artifacts that have been acquired. They include a plane that was used for training by the Tuskegee Airmen, a train car from the Jim Crow era so visitors can experience what the segregation felt like, and Louis Armstrong's trumpet.Individuals have also donated treasured family heirlooms. Most moving perhaps is the plain cloth sack that had been in one South Carolina family for five generations. It has been sewn in the 1850s by a woman named Rose, packed with a few belongings for her nine-year-old daughter, Ashley, who was being sold. On parting her mother told her \"It be filled with my love always.\"  This one artifact illustrates the vision of museum Director Lonnie G. Bunch: \"We want to bring everything to a human scale. Rather than coming here ans saying I've learned about slavery, you'll say, 'I've learned about the people who went through that experience.'\" This book will be an excellent resource for anyone planning to take children to visit the museum. And for those who can't make the trip in person, it offers a bit of vicarious experience. Last week Edi Campbell wrote \"a somewhat biased opinion piece\" on the book; that can be found here.reviewed by K.

And the same cast of adversaries returns: El Extraterrestre, Cabeza Olmeca, El Chamuco, La Momia de Guanajuato, and La Llorona. None of them, not even Niño, can defeat the Rudas. The genius here is that all the Rudas' tactics are typical toddler behaviors. They defeat El Extraterrestre with the Poopy Bomb Blowout, and when the Olmec Head steps in to vanquish them with a diaper change, they go for the famous Nappy Freedom Break.  They teethe on El Chamuco's tail and then point to the Guanajuato Mummy as the culprit and, most hilariously, grab two of La Llorona's children, saying \"Gimme!\" and \"¡Mio!\"  In the end, only Niño can defeat them by employing a classic older sibling move. As with the first book, there is a playful blend of Spanish and English, and plenty to look at in the illustrations -- El Extraterrestre trying to sneak up on Niño with his net, the perpetually open onesie that results  from the Nappy Freedom Break, and a clever cameo appearance by Señor Calavera, just to name a few.  What I most appreciate about the book, in addition to the brilliant artistry, is the way in which it captures young children at play, working things out for themselves without any adult interference. ¡Vivan Niño and his hermanitas!Reviewed by KT Horning"},

The most recent move fromCompton to Newport Beach, California has produced another town of strangers forCindy and her family to encounter. These interactions are often difficult, embarrassing, andscary – the perfect mixture of emotions to make middle school in a new town ananxiety filled journey. The first such meeting happens immediately uponarriving at their new condo in Newport Beach. The condo manager (who reminds Cindy of Mrs. Thurston Howell III fromGilligan’s Island) responds to the accented English of Cindy’s father by speaking slowly and loudly and repeating phrases. Introductions withnew peers and neighbors usually follow a predictable pattern:Cool person:  “Hi,what’s your name?”Me: “Zomorod Yousefzadeh.”Cool person (stepping back, looking scared): “What kind ofname is that?”Me (being extra cheerful and not scary): “I’m from Iran.”Cool person (looking more scared): “Where is that?”Cindy is again put in the role of needing to educate American's about the history and geography of the wider world.  This changes when she meets an aspiring (sixth grade) journalist Carolyn.  Carolyn is sincerelyinterested in Cindy’s life and background and they become fast friends. Tripsto Carolyn’s house become a reprieve from the gloom of Cindy’s mother whorefuses to learn English and sits at home watching everything from Three’sCompany to The Brady Bunch (contemporary middle grade readers will need to reachfor Youtube or reference the memory of an adult to understand some of the references tothese shows). Carolyn even interviews Cindy’s father, a petroleum engineer, fora social studies project.   Theseconversations provide a vehicle for Dumas to trace the history of Iran.   That history takes an unexpected turn duringtheir 7th grade year when Ayatollah Khomeini leads a religiousrevolution in Iran. These events throw the Yousefzadeh family into turmoil.Updates from relatives still in Iran report a complete restructuring of thesocial order. Women have less rights and career options, wealthy people arebeing harassed and their belongings are seized, and many Iranians are beingimprisoned and tortured.  Not long afterKhomeini’s rise to power several Americans are taken hostage.  The Iran hostage crisis is covered everynight on the evening news and suddenly many of Cindy’s neighbors and peers arevery aware of her family’s home country. The tension of the crisis drags on into the 8th grade year ofmiddle school. Cindy’s father loses his job; her mother falls into a deeperdepression, and now outright hostility begins to bubble up from neighbors andother kids.   When the crisis finallyends the kindness of strangers comes to the rescue of Cindy and her family.Firoozeh Dumas has created a middle grade character withboundless humor and hope.

Everything felt still inside him.”  Yoshio realizes ma had been there all along, “between the thumps of his boots whenhe ran; when the wind stopped for just a moment in the bamboo grove; at the endof his family’s meal, when everyone was happy and full; after the waterfinished draining from his bath; before the koto’s player music began—and hovering in the air, right afterit ended. It was between and underneath every sound.” There is something just rightabout the sensory-rich lyricism of this picture book about finding silence andstillness within. It reads aloud beautifully, full of playful language,alliteration, and onomatopoeia as it gradually builds toward a breathlessclimax of … quiet. Yoshio’s quest is one thatreaders and listeners will follow effortlessly even as it invites them to considerthe sounds and silences around and within them.  From scenes showing the busy, chaoticstreets of the city to those showing spaces and places where Yoshio pauses toreflect and to listen, the illustrations of this story set in contemporary Tokyoare exquisite. The detailed pen and digitally colored scenes are both expansiveand intimate, a perfect match for a story full of both bustle and stillness. An Afterword gives additionalinformation about the Japanese concept of ma and the seeds of this story in the friendship of the author’s fatherwith Japanese composer Toru Takemitsu, who, when her father asked, said his twofavorite sounds were “the wind through bamboo and the sound of silence.”Reviewed byMegan Schliesman"},

She’s not perfect likeher big brother Peter, or adorable like her little sister Clara (who can getaway with anything). She’s not a master gamer like her best friend Logan, or asuper actress like her other best friend, Maxine. When Maxine and Logan getassigned to the same homeroom, Abbie’s anxieties skyrocket. To make thingsworse, the lunchroom is corrupt, with the 8th graders dominating theonly line providing delicious food. When Abbie overhears her study hallcompanions complaining about the cafeteria, she realizes that they have sharedproblems, and that they can work together towards a solution. Abbie leads hernew friends (and soon all of Pointdexter Middle School) in a “lunchrevolution,” where the kids exchange food. When parent pushback puts an end tothe lunch trade, big brother Peter takes her out for pastries and providesencouragement, reinforcing that “not everything has to work out” all the time. Setbacksaside, Abbie learns that she makes a decent “voice of the people” and thatmaybe she isn’t “100% doomed” after all.Although Abbie’s Asian Americanidentity is not mentioned specifically (Wu is a name with Chinese origins), readerswill find themselves relating to and learning from various aspects of Abbie’sstory—especially her status as “middle child” and the stress and anxiety she carries.Vivat’s simple, black and white illustrations bring to mind notetaking anddoodling in the margins, which is appropriate for this hybrid novel about school.The pictures add humor and support the plot, too. For example, as Abbiereflects on how middle school “changes everything,” she watches her friendsfloat away while holding onto helium balloons, denoting the distance growingbetween them. Abbie speaks openly about her emotions, but she casually usesableist language (like “crazy”) and pokes fun at a teacher rumored to be “shippedoff to a psych ward” after a mental breakdown.All in all, Frazzled is a back-to-school story that will appeal to fans ofRachel Renée Russell’s Dork Diaries and Grace Lin’s Pacy Lin Novel series. The story wrapsup at the end, but the sequel possibilities are wide open. I suspect young readers,after getting a chance to read Frazzled upon its release on 9/27, will be askingfor more.Reviewed by Elisa Gall"},

Click here to purchase.A day before The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye’s publication, the National Arts Council of Singapore rescinded a $6000 publishing grant it had originally given to graphic novelist (and Singapore resident) Sonny Liew. The Council’s reasoning: “The retelling of Singapore’s history in the work potentially undermines the authority or legitimacy of the government and its public institutions, and thus breaches our funding guidelines.” We book lovers tend to get our knickers in a twist when any hint of censorship wafts our way, and so it was that I indignantly picked up Charlie Chan Hock Chye based entirely on the surrounding controversy, with little to no background knowledge of Singapore or the cartoonist himself.One of Chan Hock Chye’s cartoons witha cartoon-version Sonny Liew’scommentary along the bottomYears before Charlie Chan Hock Chye was to become “Singapore’s greatest comics artist,” he was just a boy helping out at his parents’ provision shop in Singapore. During breaks at the store he would draw; eventually one of Chan Hock Chye’s comics was circulated in a literacy magazine. This was during a time of revolution in Singapore – there were uprisings, protests, and a general sense of unrest. Chan Hock Chye’s work grew ever more political in its scope – in a way he (and his comics) grew up along with the country of Singapore. And though Chan Hock Chye’s story and work certainly show his great affection for Singapore, taken as a whole this is a warts-and-all look. (I’d bet the National Arts Council of Singapore would consider this a great bit of understatement.)Speaking of Singapore and its history, I think it would be safe to say that we Americans tend to know a decent amount about our own country’s history and maybe that of a few other countries (mostly those whose story is intertwined with ours through wars, such as England, Vietnam, and Germany). But I am guessing that not many Americans know much about Singapore’s tumultuous history. Like so many other nations, colonialism and racism played a huge part in Singapore’s story. So while many readers will see similarities to many other countries’ histories, this book will most certainly be an eye-opening work for most readers nonetheless.It is next to impossible to review Liew’s latest without mention of a pretty huge spoiler, so look away if you want to go into this book clean. (Highlight the next paragraph if you prefer to live life on the edge.)Charlie Chan Hock Chye wasn’t a real person. His life – including his cartoon career – is Liew’s creation. That Chan Hock Chye’s story (and his comics!) feels so authentic is a testament to Sonny Liew’s amazing storytelling. But though the character of Chan Hock Chye were created by Liew, the story is steeped in Singapore’s history (just check out those extensive end notes).Liew’s storytelling is so nuanced, so sure-handed. Frequently shifting perspectives give the reader an insider’s view to history in the making. The phrase “epic” is arguable overused to describe things of all sorts, but that is really the best word for Charlie Chan Hock Chye; John Lewis’s March trilogy (written with Andrew Aydin and illustrated by Nate Powell) is a good comparison, but this is a single volume where March is separated into three. Graphic novel fans, history buffs, lovers of creative presentation and compelling true stories – this is for all of you.Reviewed by Sam Bloom"},

And she really wants to be the best at somethingbecause everyone else in her family is famous and successful and heroic. Her oldersister is going to Harvard, her older brother is a soccer star, and her littlesister stars in commercials and models. Allie is so … normal comparedto them.  But if she can win the KansasTrailblazer Contest she can FINALLY stand out. She even has the perfect personto write about: her beloved bisabuelo, the last surviving WWII CongressionalMedal of Honor winner in Kansas. The only problem is her ex-best friend Sarah isher biggest competition.  Is Allie destinedto be friendless and in last place forever or will she be able to win theTrailblazer contest and finally show everyone she’s outstanding?  And is it possible that being first might not be the most importantthing? This is the booktalk I’ve used this year for Allie, First At Last (and you are free to use/modify it for yourclass visits and outreach) because I love sharing this book with my communityof high-achieving kids who feel pressure to alwaysbe first and best.Cervantes’s has cleverly made Allie the third of four children,the one who always feels like she’s a little bit left out, the heroine of thisstory about finding out what a real “trailblazer” is. This makes it easy forkids to connect to Allie because all kids can relate to the feeling she hasthat she’s just not “different” enough. But Allie also has grand plans tosucceed and a determination so Cervantes neatly sidesteps clichés and wornplots about so-called average kids. This is an amazing look at a multi-generational Mexican-Americanfamily with deep roots in our country’s history and present.  The way Cervantes makes this the matter offact truth of the story is effortless and natural.  A lot of this is rooted in Allie’s bisabuelo,a fantastic character who loves and dotes on Allie and his othergreat-grandchildren.  He helps Alliethink about what being “first” really means. Another highlight of this book isthat it not only looks honestly at how competition can drive kids but givesreaders ideas for how they can move past their negative competitive urges. Another superb element of this book is how Cervantes explores the multiplicityof the Latinx experience.  Allie, who isobsessed with trailblazers and people who are the “first” to accomplish greatthings, befriends Victor, a new kid. Victor is a child of immigrants and heplans to be the first kid in his family to graduate from high school and go tocollege – the kind of first Allie, a third generation kid from a high-achievingfamily hasn’t given  a second thought to.They both grow and learn through their friendship, which is just another strongelement in this book.  Through Allie andVictor, Cervantes does a wonderful, non-didactic job of showing that there isn’ta “single story” of Latinx life in America in 2016. I highly recommend Allie,First At Last – it’s been very popular in my booktalking and it’s a fast,engaging read for fans of contemporary school stories. Allie, First At Last has fabulous sibling dynamics, awesome olderadults, and friendship drama, everything readers are drawn to! It has short chapters, humor, and characters like Allie who areeasy to relate to, even when they are being stubborn or selfish. I alsorecommend Angela Cervantes’s first book, Gaby,Lost and Found (2013) another fantastic title, this one dealing with a girlwhose mother has been deported to Honduras.

Lee & Low, 2016. 32 pages ISBN 978-1-62014-250-9 Click to purchaseIt's a sad fact that the vast majority of easy readers are about cute little animal characters. Cute little male animal characters, in fact.  I've got nothing against Frog & Toad and Elephant & Piggie -- I've recommended them to countless parents and kids and bought them as gifts for many of the children I know who are learning to read. But not all kids like animal fantasies. Many children develop clear reading preferences for nonfiction, for science fiction, for realism, for the anti-cute, at an early age, some as young as three or four. So what do we have to give them when they are just learning to read? If they don't like animal fantasies, not much. If you are looking for books about female characters (other than Amelia Bedelia), even less.  And if you are looking for any easy readers reflecting diversity, almost nothing.That's why I was so excited to see the new easy reader series just launched this year by Lee & Low. In addition to reissuing two older books by Lulu Delacre about two little coquís named Rafi and Rosa, we have two brand new volumes by Paula Yoo and Shirley Ng-Benitez about a diverse group of playmates: Lily, Pablo, Padma, Henry and Mei.In the first volume, Lily has just moved to a New York City apartment building from a home that had a yard with flowers. She's not sure she's going to like big city life -- it's not at all like what she's used to. But her parents show her parts of her new neighborhood that remind her of home -- a flower stand and a public garden, for instance. And they introduce her to some of the rich multicultural elements a big city can offer, such as Italian pizza, signs in Spanish, a store with Kenyan artwork, and a shop selling saris from India. Finally they go to the public library where Lily finds many of the same books she loved in her previous home. And she also meets a new friend -- Pablo, who also loves to read. In Want to Play? Pablo takes center stage as he leaves his book behind for a while and ventures out to play with Lily, introducing her to new friends along the way. They join Mei and Padma on the swings and then join Henry for a game of basketball. Before long, the playground equipment turns into the setting for their imaginary play, as they climb a mountain (the slide), spend time at the beach (the sandbox), and board a spaceship (the merry-go-round).  Both books have the simple, episodic story lines that are the hallmark of good easy readers, as well as short sentences, large font, and plenty of white space. The watercolor illustrations offer both context clues and cultural specificity. There is a large cast of characters (this is a big city after all) but you can always tell who is who, and which children are the five main characters. While Paula Yoo has written excellent books for older readers, she proves herself to be just as good at writing for new readers, which is no easy task. Although the story lines are simple, she adds depth to each one. In Lily's New Home the diversity that defines the city becomes part of the story line, and in Want to Play? the children's imaginary play (so well reflected in Shirley Ng-Benitez's illustrations) makes the playground even more fun.Most remarkably, Yoo and Ng-Benitez together have created truly engaging child characters living in a vivid realistic world with just a few masterful lines of text and ink.  I hope these will be the first two volumes of a long and successful series about the five friends. What a great beginning for Dive into Reading! -- and for brand new readers. Reviewed by KT Horning"},

In exchange, she gains hissupport of her entry to the school.Mercy arrives at St.Clare’s a social and cultural outsider. She isn’t welcomed warmly. The lack offriendly reception at the school doesn’t surprise Mercy, or even necessarilybother her; she’s less interested in friendship than securing her family’sfinancial future by getting a good education. Then the earthquakehits. Mercy and herschoolmates become essential to one another’s survival as they escape theschool and make their way to one of the city parks where people are seekingrefuge. Terrified for her family, Mercy tries to go home to Chinatown, but itsoon becomes clear the news is grim: Chinatown has been devastated. She is notalone in grief and worry among her classmates. But figuring out how to surviveis paramount and the girls have no choice but to work together. In doing so,they eventually make the decision to help others, too, sharing the food theyfind and the companionship they are beginning to rely on with other refugees.Distinctions of class and race become, briefly, meaningless, and a few realfriendships begin to form.Outrun the Moon is a vivid work of historical fiction, its rich sensory details makingtime and place come alive. But it’s just as richly detailed when it comes tothe cultural and social context of the story. One of the most striking aspects of the book is the way that racism ispresented as a fact of Mercy’s life. It doesn’t weigh down the narrative, butit also can’t be ignored by the reader. It’s in assumptions and attitudesMercy’s faces; it’s in direct comments made to her (“The board of educationprovided your people with a public education.”) and quieter asides sheoverhears. It’s in the very fact that St. Clare’s is considered off-limits toher, as well as in countless other moments and elements of the storytelling.Yet in spite of theracism, the hardship, and tragic events that are part of the telling, Outrun the Moon is a book full ofoptimism. This balance—of authenticity, honesty, and optimism—broadens itsappeal. Middle school readers drawn to stories about strong, spirited girls or wholiked boarding school-type stories when younger will not be disappointed, butneither will those who look to works of historical fiction for a generallytruthful accounting of the times in which they are set. But Outrun the Moon is historical fiction, and author Stacey Lee includes aninformative author’s note (two of them, actually!) acknowledging where she tookliberties, and where she didn’t. There was, indeed, a coming together in theaftermath of the earthquake “without regard to class distinctions, race, orcreed. It was a time of goodwill and inclusiveness. It did not last forever.”She states it is unlikely, however, that a girl in Chinatown would have gainedadmittance to a White school.  “However,history is a general overview, and overlooks the story, the possibility of the individual.” The possibility ofMercy Wong is one that readers today can revel in.Reviewed by Megan Schliesman"},

Today Angie looks at the John Steptoe Award-winning novel published in 2015.By Ronald L. Smith. Clarion Books, 2015. 208 pages. ISBN 978-0-544-44525-3 Click here to purchaseThe first time I read Hoodoo was in Mississippi in July.  Though it was a sweltering day, I had goosebumps from almost the very first page.  Hoodoo is that kind of book – it’s so good it can make a Mississippi summer day seem cold as winter.Hoodoo Hatcher is 12 years old. He has a heart-shaped birthmark under his eye, which is something of a namesake for him because when Mama Frances saw it she declared that he had powerful hoodoo – folk magic – in him. Only Hoodoo hasn’t ever shown a single lick of magical ability.  Turns out he doesn’t have any hoodoo in him at all, unlike everyone else in his family, unlike his Daddy, who was a powerful mojo man who met a mysterious end. At least that’s what Hoodoo has always thought.  But now The Stranger has arrived in Hoodoo’s small Alabama town and dark things are following in The Stranger’s wake – people aren’t acting right, corpses are being dug up from the local cemetery.  And The Stranger is looking for a boy. A boy named Hoodoo.  But why?  And how can Hoodoo stop The Stranger if he doesn’t have any magic of his own?This is a variation of the Hoodoo booktalk I’ve done for a little over a year now.  (And please feel free to steal it to use in your school and outreach visits.) I’ve used it for 6-8th grade classes and every time I use this booktalk, the kids are spellbound.  I watch as their mouths dangle open or a little “oooooh” runs through the crowd.  Without fail at least one kid waves their hand or blurts out a variation on “I BET HE DOES HAVE MAGIC, THOUGH!!!” and the others nod with appreciation.  This is an acknowledgement of how skillfully Smith hits the beats in this story.  Yes, Hoodoo does have magic of his own, but he’ll have to go through trials and tribulations as he learns how to access it and what it means.  Kid readers know this and they savor it because it tells them that they, too, have their own possibilities and are on their own journeys.Hoodoo is just a joy to read.  There’s no other way around it. Sad, scary things happen in it - there's real loss and consequences and very dark dealings but reading it is ... fun. It's a book you get swept up entirely in, thanks in large part to Hoodoo’s narrative voice. This is an amazing example of how a book is written authentically in dialect.  It's never overdone, it never sounds condescending or fake but it has a real rhythm of the way a Black boy in Alabama in the 1930s might speak. Hoodoo reaches out to the reader and he has such a real kid voice. He gets frustrated by the way grown-ups in his life, Mama Frances especially, seem to be keeping information about his parents and magic from him.  And Hoodoo, like any normal, real kid would, is plenty scared of The Stranger, a fictional creation so scary and malevolent he practically leaps off the page.  (The Stranger reminds me of the darkest creations from Stephen King. This book reminds me a lot of King’s writing, because both King and Smith know that nothing is scarier than childhood.)Hoodoo is also the perfect example of how an authentic setting can take a story to the next level. Smith sets Hoodoo in a small Alabama town during the Jim Crow era and the details of how this impacts Hoodoo’s life are woven quietly and yet seamlessly throughout the story.  It makes one thing clear: Hoodoo and his family and friends are on their own when it comes to fighting The Stranger. No White people are going to get involved and, anyway, they have no way to understand or access the generations of tradition and hoodoo that bind all this good and evil together. Hoodoo unspools like a true classic Southern gothic yarn, only unlike the work of Faulkner, O’Connor, or Welty, Smith centers the Black experience. I love Hoodoo for so many reasons, but one of them is because the White gaze is just … irrelevant. I want children’s literature to not just diversify but decolonize and Hoodoo is a book that takes that seriously.Every time I booktalk Hoodoo, I have kids fighting over it.  It’s a perfect book to take on class visits: high interest horror with a fast-paced plot. Hoodoo won the 2016 Coretta Scott King John Steptoe Award for New Talent, which is the perfect award for it because it signals that Ronald L. Smith is an author of great talent to watch.  I couldn’t agree more. Hoodoo Hatcher is an indelible character and the exact kind of Black kid hero kid lit needs more of.  All this means I think you need to start sharing this book immediately, if you didn’t know. (As Hoodoo himself would say.)Reviewed by Angie Manfredi"},

(In my relatively large public library system in Cincinnati, Ghosts has a waiting list of 55 people; kids’ books don’t have waiting lists that lengthy unless they’re written by J.K. Rowling!) Of course publisher Scholastic/Graphix is doing a big marketing push, including the #GhostsTakeover hashtag on Twitter this past weekend, and of course the book is getting lots of love in review journals (four stars as of this writing). These are things we expect when a hugely popular author releases a new book.In Ghosts, tween protagonist Catrina and her family have just moved to foggy northern California to make breathing easier for her little sister, Maya, who has cystic fibrosis. They meet neighbor Carlos, who is way into ghosts (he gives the sisters a ghost-themed tour) and sparks a renewed interest for the girls into their own Mexican heritage. This all happens alongside the coming of Fall, Halloween, and the Day of the Dead.At BEA in Chicago in May and then again at ALA Annual in Orlando in June, many book lovers scored ARCs of the book and so the buzz increased. But there was also a growing chorus of concerned voices, too. In a post for the blog Teen Librarian Toolbox (hosted by School Library Journal), Karen Jensen wrestled with the culturally vague aspects of the book, especially concerning Telgemeier’s treatment of the Day of the Dead; very soon thereafter, California-based public librarian Faythe Arredondo blogged about Ghosts at Teen Services Underground. “Borrowing from other cultures to tell your story may seem minor,” wrote Arredondo, “but it can be harmful to people of that culture.” Before you read any further here, take a look at what Jensen had to say, and read Arredondo's thoughtful post. (For more insider’s perspectives on Day of the Dead, read this and this.)Recently Ghosts received a positive review from the New York Times, in which Dan Kois wrote that “Day of the Dead plays nicely into... dynamics of Mexican-American family life.” But is that really the case? Okay, if you go to a Day of the Dead celebration later this Fall, it is true that many will wear Day of the Dead makeup, and that there are face-painters who will do it for you.   However, there is growing unease with the way Day of the Dead is becoming popularized: commercialized, and colonized, by White people.UPDATE, 9/19/2016: These were mentioned in the comments, but just in case you missed them, here is Debbie Reese’s review and Laura Jimenez’s review.By Louise Erdrich.

Through the perspective of the eight year-old twins, and pickingup where Chickadee (2012) leaves off,the reader continues to follow closely the daily life of this Ojibwe family andtheir community.  As they are forcedwest, so are the buffalo, and through the buffalo themselves Makoons andChickadee learn that “Soon the generous ones will be gone forever.”(p.118)  Erdrich’s naturally evocative prose suffuses the reading experiencewith precise details of each daily scene, flavored with humor (a running jokeis the vain but untalented hunter Gichi Noodin) and propelled forward withexpectancy. Nokomis’ tending of her garden, the twins’ raising of the buffalo calf,and even, ultimately, Gichi Noodin’s lessons learned demonstrate, to Makoons andto the reader, how his people’s lives will continue to change.  Like the books that precede it, it is a delightful and muchneeded addition to children’s historical fiction.  A perfect companion book to Chickadee, it offers, at the same time, amore somber counterpoint.  At itsopening, Makoons shares a vision with his brother:We will become strongand bring down buffalo. We’ll have horses, we’ll feed our people. All of uswill travel into the great grass places, toward the western stars. We will nevergo back east to our lake, our deep woods. … We will be tested too … We willhave to save them … Our family. Only … We cannot save them all.  (p.3-4) At the close of the book, Chickadee reflects on what hascome to pass so far, and asks his brother “Was this all? …Your dream. Is itover?” (p.147)  His brother only offerssilence. A testament to Erdrich’s power as a writer is that this foreboding islaced with threads of hope, strength, and memory, enacted by her telling of thestory, and the reader’s listening.

Cassie has healed, and returns to the cutthroat ballet academy, where she and Gigi (freshly returned from her own injury) quickly become besties--and vicious, manipulative plotters, determined to hurt the people who hurt them last year.  June struggles with anorexia, bulimia and the sinking realization that she will never be number one at the American Ballet Company.Bette, meanwhile, uses her time at home (she's been expelled from the academy) to practice non-stop and and prove her innocence.  Determined re-capture her spot as Prima Ballerina, she fights her way back into the spotlight, only to find that she must share it with Gigi in the school's end-of-year performance of Swan Lake.Like its predecessor, Shiny Broken Pieces is simply delicious.  Horrible \"accidents\", sabotage, self-destruction, and a teacher/student affair populate the pages.  But Charaipotra and Clayton also achieve a \"real\" feel in some of its quieter moments, as June takes one painful step at a time to cure and heal her eating disorders, Bette comes to grips with the pain she's caused, and the lines between friend and enemy blur as Cassie manipulates Gigi until she hardly recognizes herself.  Chapters alternate between the three main characters, each voice distinct and immediately recognizable.  Readers will find their sympathies swinging rapidly from character to character, as each girl's passion and sense of self-righteousness builds.  Compelling characters, heart-pounding action, and complicated relationships make for a breakneck read.Reviewed by Allie Jane Bruce"},

Click here to purchase.This lovely little book follows Basanta, a young girl living in a village in modern day India.  Basanta works with her mother in the big house, often working for the rich girl of the house, Little Bibi.  Being around Little Bibi makes Basanta question everything about her life - why does Little Bibi have so much?  Why can't Basanta have fine things too?  When Basanta finds a ring that Little Bibi has lost, it doesn't seem to wrong to consider keeping it for herself.  Little Bibi has so much.  Will she even miss the ring? In the course of the story, readers follow Basanta as she learns about the things that have real value in your life.There's a lot to love in Zia's second novel but what really stands out is the setting. Though the village where Basanta and her family and friends live is never named, the details of life there are richly woven throughout the text.  We meet the merchants and families that create the fabric of the village and spend time with the children as they play, conspire, and create together.  Basanta is a determined, curious girl who questions the way her world works and doesn't just settle for \"that's the way it is.\"  Her Amma is another great character - she loves Basanta but also expects her to make hard choices, do the right thing, and think about her actions.  I love grown-ups with personalities of their own (that are still so loving) in children's literature. One of my favorite parts of Child of Spring is a kite flying battle between the children in the village. It's a lively, exciting scene that brings play and competition to children to life in a very immediate way. Basanta's struggles to understand her place in the world is also a struggle to understand her place in the community of her village and this is, again, where Zia's writing really shines.  This is a book so firmly rooted in place it is almost tangible. I think this would be a great book to do as a read-aloud to a class: the chapters are short and episodic and there's lots of great, descriptive writing to dig into.A few notes: I wish Peachtree hadn't chosen to italicize the numerous Hindi words throughout the text. There's no need to italicize another language in a text, even if that is the way \"it's always been done.\"  It distances the reader. (Check out Daniel José Older's awesome video about why he doesn't italicize Spanish in his stories - this is it in a nutshell.) I also wish Zia had been more definitive about the exact place in India (an author's note mentions the book is set in \"the state of Hyderabad in India.\" which is where Zia grew up) and time of the story. I have also seen a few reviews refer to this as a middle grade book but I think it is much more suited to to an older elementary crowd, so keep that in mind as well. (I think it would be perfect for 4th-6th grade readers.)I was glad to spend time with Basanta and her entire village - the children are ingenious and determined and they have fun and are allowed to make mistakes like real kids. I was taken with this sweet and immediate story of growing into a community and a place.Reviewed by Angie Manfredi"},

Little Bee Books, 2016. 36 pages. ISBN 978-1-499801033. Click here to purchase.Freedom in CongoSquare begins with a two-page foreword by historian Freddi Williams Evansproviding historical background and context for this picture book about CongoSquare in New Orleans, which was a vibrant gathering place for free and enslavedpeople of African descent in that city. Evans explains that the enslaved whocame to New Orleans under brutal conditions and continued to live brutal lives asthe property of others were the ones who made Congo Square famous. “Code Noir” laws designated Sundays as holydays, Evans explains: work-free and for worship. While Sunday mornings may ormay not have been work-free in truth—some worshipped, some still worked, forthemselves or others—Sunday afternoons found many Blacks gathering in placesaround the city, “until a law made Congo Square the only place they could meet.”                         In CongoSquare, the musical traditions and dances of different Central and West Africancultures resounded. Some played drums and other instruments, some danced,others sang, clapped, or shook gourd rattles. New styles of songs and danceswere introduced by people coming from across Louisiana and other states. “Overtime, the intermingling of the different African, Caribbean, and Europeanstyles led to the development of new styles.” Jazz music was one of the stylesthat grew out of this dynamic convergence.                CongoSquare remains a vibrant gathering place today, Evans notes, one in whichpeople gather from all over the world. “There they enjoy the freedom ofexpressing themselves by singing, dancing, drumming .… If you are ever in NewOrleans on a Sunday afternoon, feel free to join in.”               The pageturn that follows this concluding line of the Foreword is dramatic because ittakes us back to the time when Congo Square first became famous. For those whoskip the Foreword (don’t skip the Foreword), the start is no less powerful: “Mondays,there were hogs to slop, / mules to train, and logs to chop. / Slavery was noways fair. / Six more days to Congo Square.”                CaroleBoston Weatherford’s potent text doesn’t waste a word or a syllable. The firstfourteen couplets count down the days to Congo Square, documenting the work ofenslaved men and women as they labored in fields and in houses, in despair andin defiance. “The dreaded lash / too much to bear …. Run away, run away. Someslaves dared.”                The remaining eleven couplets mark the transition to Sunday, and the gathering inCongo Square. Here the tone turns hopeful, spinning out details of the joyousgathering where news is shared and music and dancing, chanting and singing liftspirits and hearts. “Grouped by nation, language, tribe, / they drummedancestral roots alive …. The piece of earth was a world apart. / Congo Squarewas freedom’s heart.”               Thetwenty-five couplets that comprise the principle narrative are set against R. GregoryChristie’s spare, expressive paintings. Stylized, elongated figures with littleor no facial details carry out the heavy work of Monday – Saturday. Sometimes they stand erect, sometimes their backs are stiffly bent with burden. An image of the enslaved workers asleep hasechoes of Tom Feelings’ haunting images for TheMiddle Passage—black silhouetted figures lying prone.          But these stiff, constrained people breakloose and free once Sunday comes, moving fluidly, with joy and abandon, againstpulsing, vibrant orange, yellow and gold backdrops that erase all detail ofsetting—the mood and the music is all that matters. Only the final page spreadbrings a return to some background detail, with the suggestion of trees. CongoSquare, it is clear, is a brief, psychic escape from the realities ofenslavement.            Aglossary and an author’s note conclude this rich and stirring work. In hernote, Weatherford provides additional historical information, including thefact that “there was more to these gatherings than revelry” as she explainsthat Congo Square also served as a hub of communication for free and enslavedBlacks as well as a marketplace. “For a few hours every Sunday, Congo Squaregave slaves a taste of freedom.”Reviewed by Megan Schliesman"},

The first author-illustrator whose name popped up was EricVelasquez, as several people recommended his books, including Looking for Bongo, which had just beenreleased. The picture bookbegins with a boy in his baseball shirt pajamas, with brown skin andan Afro, looking beneath his covers, under his bed, and right through thefourth wall: “Where is Bongo? I need Bongo to watch TV with me.” In English andSpanish, he asks his grandmother, his cat, his dog, his dad, his mom, and a deliveryworker if they know anything about what might have happened to Bongo. When itseems that all hope is lost, he spots the soft arm of Bongo, his plush puppy,between two sets of drums. When Wela (the character’s abuela) accuses him of forgetting where he placed his toy, thechild devises a trick to catch the suspected stuffed animal thief. He succeeds on the story’s final page in a high point of action and sibling humor. Rendered in oil painton watercolor paper, Velasquez’s illustrations showcase the loving family.Readers see the fashion designer mother working from home, inquisitive pets, a mischievoussister, a caring abuela, and a supportivedad promising to help when he can. Also visible are the family’s cherished books—including a nod to Grandma’s Records by Eric Velasquez himself. Text and images affirmthe characters’ Afro-Latinx identities subtly. The English and Spanish dialogue and the pet cat named Gato highlightthe two languages spoken in the home. On the title page, Bongo peeks out frombehind a set of bongo drums (which originated from Cuba). On the next page,conga drums (derived from African drums) appear beneath the dedication. When Bongois finally found, it is between these two sets of drums. (Information about thedrums and their origins is included in a glossary.)On the back flap of the book, Velasquez shares a throwback family photo and amessage that the book portrays an Afro-Latinx family “much like his own.”  February’s#largefears chat brought up the issue that sometimes the Afro-Latinx experiencecan get lost in terms of representation, especially in books for young people.With Looking for Bongo, this is not the case.

Clickhere to purchase.Little White Duck: A Childhoodin China. Written by Na Liu.Illustrated by Andrés Vera MartínezAs part of our Spotlight on#OwnVoices for September, we will feature books not published in the last yearon Throwback Thursday. Today Sam looks at a graphic novel memoir publishedin 2012.In the realm of children’s books, graphicnovels are a relatively new phenomenon. The popularity boom for the format hasleveled off somewhat, but I think we can all agree that the kid’s graphic novelsection at the library is here to stay. And yet I still often see this questionon listservs and Facebook groups: “What are the must-have titles if I’mstarting a graphic novel section for kids?” Anything by Gene Yang or Raina Telgemeier; the Big Nate,Babymouse, and Amulet series; groundbreaking Newbery Honor books El Deafo and Roller Girl – these and many more are legit, go-to titles thatget thrown out all the time in answer to this question, and for good reason.But I would put Little White Duck in my own first 5 graphic novels forkids – I believe it is absolutely essential for all children’s collections. Based on incidents from Liu’s early life, thisepisodic memoir finds Da Qin (Liu’s childhood nickname –it means “Big Piano”) and her younger sister Xiao Qin (“LittlePiano”) navigating life at a time of transition in China, the 1970s. AsLiu said in an interview, her generation was “caughtbetween one way of life and another, between the old and the new,” a dynamicthat Martínez (who is also Liu’s husband) captures beautifully in his nuanced,earth-toned art.  The result is a short graphic novel that packs asurprising emotional punch.Each brief story has a title set off in a boxat one of the edges of a panel, giving the book a scrapbook feel. In the firstvignette, Da Qin recalls the day Mao Zedong passed away. This may not have beena sad day for many Chinese at the time, but for Da Qin’s family Mao’s death wasa devastating loss (a subsequent full page spread explains why). Another storyshows how Da Qin and Xiao Qin tried to “be like Lei Feng,” a martyred Chinesesoldier who was made to symbolize the selfless, nameless citizen, the “tinyscrew that completes the machine.” A montage shows the inspired sisters helpingthose in need, including a group of baby chicks who don’t seem to be gettingenough water to drink in the hot sun; in a darkly humorous sequence thegirls “help” the chicks drink water, with disastrous results.The narrative reaches its emotional climax whenDa Qin’s father takes her to visit his extended family, who are mostly poorfarmers. The kids from the local village are drawn to the fancy duck design onDa Qin’s jacket; they rub their grimy fingers all over it, turning the whiteduck a grubby black. Afterwards, Da Qin recalls, “I wanted to let them touch mycoat, but at the same time, I didn’t want them to get it dirty.” What strikes meabout this episode is the way Martínez visually delineates Da Qin’s innerstruggle both before and after the other kids mess up her jacket; that this isDa Qin’s first time considering class differences is made obvious through thesequencing and storytelling. But all is handled with a light touch, leadinginto a symbolic coda: Da Qin and Xiao Qin, riding atop a crane high over acity, the Yellow Crane Tower representing China’s past behind them, ashimmering line of skyscrapers symbolizing the country’s future ahead.Reviewed by Sam Bloom"},

Jackson is devoting his focus to the  Maplewood Middle School Botany Club, Charlie de la Cruz edits the Maplewood Herald, Megan Feldman and Hashemi Larijani geek out with the Tech Club while Bradley Boardman serves as the guidance office helper. When a wing of the school is flooded suspicion is immediately aimed at the Greene gang. It appears Dr. Kelsey, the school principal, lacks any hard evidence of responsibility for the prank until Jackson receives a link to surveillance video.Hashemi and Megan circled the table to stand behind Jackson. A grainy video of the social studies wing flickered on the screen. Then a familiar face popped into view.“Um, that’s me,” Hashemi said.“And me,” Megan added a few seconds later.Hashemi watched as he and Megan, both dressed in black, snuck in the first floor girls’ bathroom. A few seconds later, the video cut to Bradley, Charlie, and Jackson slipping into the boys’ bathroom. They too were dressed in black.The video continues and shows the kids exiting the bathrooms and water pouring out into the hallways. The gang has problems but being caught is not one of them - the video is a fake! They receive instructions that this video will be sent to Dr. Kelsey unless they steal the answers to the upcoming social studies final exam. As Jackson and company set out to discover who is responsible for framing them the layers of plotting develop rapidly. Jackson and Charlie are clashing over who should lead the crew. The students who want the exam questions are being used by two other students seeking revenge on the gang for an embarrassing event in the past. The aspiring chair of the school honor board, Serena Bianchi, is convinced Jackson is up to no good again. She sets out to catch the crew by getting access to the school surveillance system.  Readers who can suspend their incredulity that the principal and bumbling security guard would give a middle school student access to the surveillance videos are in for a fast-paced technology fueled con to top previous jobs.  The gang knows they could prove the video is a fake but time is working against them. They will never get the video analysis complete before the final exam. They must decide between being considered guilty (even for a short period of time) or going through with the theft of the answer key.  Brief chapters loaded with pop culture references, a variety of cons (both explained in a concluding section), high end technology, and lots of dialogue keep the story moving and growing. A few characters could be more nuanced in their development but this is easy to ignore considering the large number of actors (detailed in the front papers) in this con. After all, the heart of book is Jackson Greene - an African American male character who defies the single story of Black boys that often pervades children’s literature. Jackson is a con-man/James Bond inspired guy who is endearing to the reader. He uses his smarts and a team to operate on the fringe of legality in order to reach positive outcomes. This is a narrative common for White male characters (think of Tricky Vic or Alex Rider) but rarely (if ever) inhabited by an African American.  To Catch a Cheat will be greeted with enthusiasm by young readers.Reviewed by Ernie Cox"},
{"title": "September Spotlight on #OwnVoices: The Head of a Saint", "date": "Tuesday, September 6, 2016", "text": "by Socorro Acioli. Translated from the Portuguese by Daniel Hahn. U.S. edition: Delacorte. 181 pages. ISBN 978-0-553-53792-5 Click here to purchase Translated novels for children and teens are a rarity in the U.S. publishing industry. Rarer still is a translated novel from anywhere other than Western Europe. The Head of the Saint by Socorro Acioli is one of the rarest of the rare -- a translated young adult novel from Latin America.Acioli is a Brazilian author who workshopped this book with Gabriel García Márquez, the master of magical realism. The Head of the Saint clearly shows his influence on her writing. (That's a good thing.) The term \"magical realism\" is being thrown around a lot these days, used to describe virtually any literary fantasy.  One of the things I especially appreciate about The Head of the Saint is that it offers us a good example of Latin American magical realism in the form of a slender volume for younger readers in the English-speaking world who may not yet be ready for One Hundred Years of Solitude.Fourteen-year-old Samuel arrives in the small town of Candeia, homeless and hungry. His dying mother had asked him to go to the town to light a candle at the feet of St. Anthony. But that's only part of the reason Samuel has gone there. He has his own mission, too -- to seek revenge on the father who abandoned them. He takes shelter inside the the head of a broken statue of St. Anthony and, almost immediately, he begins to hear the voices of Candeia's townspeople who are praying to the saint. One voice in particular haunts him -- that of a young woman singing. He is determined to find her, certain that it is their destiny to be together.And as for all the other praying townspeople? Samuel himself is a non-believer so he decides to have some fun with them, attempting to answer their prayers. Before too long, people are flocking to the statue's head and to Samuel, believing he is able to perform miracles. His \"miracles\" become a money-making venture for him, but they are crowding out his original goal of finding his father, and the praying voices are drowning out the singing of the mysterious young woman he's falling for.It soon becomes clear that Samuel's presence is starting to transform Candeia. When he arrived, the town was slowly dying but now that their prayers are being answered, the townspeople once again have hope, and the town begins to thrive again, But not everyone is happy with Samuel's miracles and the town's rebirth, and that adds a layer of intrigue to the overall plot.  While many threads in the story will be brought together and tied up by the end, readers will never be offered an explanation for the voices Samuel hears inside the saint's head. They just... are. Beautifully written, with a strong sense of place, The Head of the Saint is the sort of book I wish we had more of -- translated children's and young adult books that make Latin American authors accessible to English-speaking kids here in the U.S., opening the door to a world of great literature throughout the Americas.Reviewed by KT Horning"},

Orca Book Publishers, 2016. ISBN: 978-1459809574. Click here to purchase.My Heart Fills With Happiness is a gorgeous board book that celebrates the joys in children's lives - the things that truly fill their hearts with happiness like dancing and being with family. The brilliance of My Heart Fills With Happiness is in the direct simplicity of the text.  As a librarian who regularly presents storytimes to ages 0-6 I am constantly looking for books that will engage children in talking about their world. What do you see?  What do you do?  Who are you with? These are the questions that light up children's eyes and open them to conversation and learning.And yet I am often frustrated by how hard it is to find books like this that show the true diversity of the world. But My Heart Fills With Happiness is just the opposite. Written and illustrated by two Native women, this is a book that shows the fullness and joy of contemporary Native families.  It is a book that invites even the youngest children into a world where Native families have value. THIS is a book you could read at a truly engaging, honestly diverse storytime. I love everything about this book.  Julie Flett - of course - is one of the most talented illustrators working today. Her style jumps off the page in My Heart Fills With Happiness.  Children will delight at the details: children dancing and exploring nature, families embracing and watching bread in the oven, a father and son drumming joyfully together. Monique Gray Smith, in her board book debut, knows exactly how to make each short, declarative sentence engage children in the book and in conversation. As I read this book the first time, I could immediately see a storytime crowd following along and discussing the book at the same time I could imagine sharing it one on one with a newborn or small toddler. I hope Gray Smith plans on writing more picture books.  My Heart Fills With Happiness pulls off the hardest balancing act in all of picture books: writing something that is equally lyrical (the book is full of rich language) and yet clear enough for the littlest listeners to understand and engage with.  (\"My heart fills with happiness when...I see the face of someone I love.\").This is a physically small book that has a huge impact.  If you regularly present baby or toddler storytimes, I highly recommend it.  My only wish it that we could have it a format larger than a board book so sharing it with groups was easier.  But I also think it would make an amazing baby shower gift and it's certainly a must purchase for board book collections at any library.  When I think of Dr. Sims Bishop's \"mirrors, windows, and sliding glass doors\" My Heart Fills With Happiness is the exact kind of book I think of.  It affirms and celebrates the joys and bonds of Native families for all readers and it makes children lean in to talk, listen, and learn.

To her surprise, she's selected as the school's one and only scholarship recipient.The story is told in letters Lucy writes to a girl named Linh.Linh’s identity, although it must be inferred, seems obvious: she is one ofLucy’s Stanley friends; someone she’s left behind when she goes to Laurinda, even though Laurinda is nota residential school.           The differences between the world Lucy’s Laurinda classmates’ inhabit—a worldin which being White and wealthy is the norm—and the world Lucy has come fromand the life she leads at home is vast and often shocking. It’s underscored incountless ways, day after day, and Lucy’s dysphoria as she moves between theseworlds is profound. But even as she rails against the wealth and privilegeand racism of her classmates in her mind, it gradually affects her and the wayshe views her home. “Everything was so cheap and tacky here …. The dollar storethat I loved so much, the place that brought such endless cheap joy to theLamb, seemed like a roomful of junk. All the things that I’d loved so much nowseemed sad …. Now that my life had shrunk down to homework, and the Lamb, andsewing after school, my mind started wandering to places I had no businessbeing in.” (p. 203-204)As the school year progresses, Lucy is takenunder the wing of the “Cabinet,” the ruling trio of girls at Laurinda, a groupthat had previously dismayed her with their contempt for classmates and teachers. Sheunderstands she hasn’t been invited into this inner circle for no reason. Butunlike the tutor she was assigned, these girlsdon’t suffer from misguided good intentions, let alone a White savior complex.Lucy finally realizes that the “Cabinet, with the tacit approval of theheadmistress, keeps people in line and that they have brought Lucy close to the centerof power so that she will take advantage of the position and in doing so,acquiesce, representing the school in the manner the school proscribes.It is at this point in thenovel that Linh finally makes an appearance in the flesh, fierce and genuineand brilliant. She is not who we thought, and her identity underscores the terrible rift Laurinda created in Lucy's life, but it's a rift she is now ready to repair. She will take what Laurinda has to offer but not leave anything behind.Alice Pung’s writing isfresh, original, and deeply perceptive. She is sometimes funny, sometimes crushingas she reveals racism and classism ranging from the understated and subtle tothe glaring. Pinpricks or kicks, all are sharp and scathing. From the hierarchyof high school to the hierarchy of society, Pung stitches a novel that exploresbig issues through complexities of characters and family and social relationships that feelgenuine. Her story, infuriating with regard to some of its truths, is stunningin its poignancy with regard to others. It is, finally, also one difficult toput down.   Reviewed by Megan Schliesman"},

ISBN 978-1-4814-1590-3 Click here to purchase In just three years, Jason Reynolds has established himself as a rising star in young adult literature. As Brave As You is his first middle-grade novel and with it, he proves himself to be just as skillful a writer for a younger audience.  This is a book I want to put into everyone's hands. It's deep, funny, and original. Eleven-year-old Genie and his older brother Ernie are city kids, used to navigating the familiar streets of their Brooklyn neighborhood. When they are sent to rural Virginia to spend a month with their grandparents while their parents work on their marriage, they both face a high learning curve. Everything is new to them -- daily chores, working in the hot sun to pick peas from the garden, and living by grandma's strict rules. Even the tea is different -- too sweet!Ernie approaches everything with his usual Brooklyn bravado, trying to school his younger brother in how things should be done and, most of all, trying to win the affections of Tess, a wise-cracking girl his age who lives on the nearest farm. Genie prefers to hang back a bit and observe. He has a lot of questions about everything, and he writes them down in a spiral notebook to keep track of them so he can look for the answers once he access to the internet again. Being in his father's childhood home fills him with even more questions. Why doesn't his dad get along with his grandfather? What was his dad's brother, who was killed in Desert Storm, like? How can he repair the little model truck he wrecked the first day, one of the few mementos that remained from his dead uncle? He is especially curious about his grandfather who is blind but who is just as capable as a person with sight. How does he do it? Why does he carry a gun in his waistband? And what's behind the forbidden door that Grandpop goes through every day and closes behind him?  By listening to Grandpop's stories and asking him questions, Genie eventually earns his trust, and he is allowed inside the secret room, a real honor since even Grandma can't go in. Genie is amazed to learn that Grandpop has recreated the outdoors inside the room -- complete with five live, singing swallows, whom Genie names after the Jackson 5.  He learns that the one thing his grandfather is afraid to do is to go outside on his own. Thus, the room.When Genie accidentally kills Michael Jackson by feeding him apple seeds instead of dead flies, he enlists the help of Ernie and Tess.  Have the brothers developed enough country smarts to catch a live swallow?  And will Genie be able to replace it without Grandpop knowing before they have to go back to Brooklyn? Throughout the novel, Genie is driven by his desire to repair the model truck and to catch a swallow, both of which give dramatic tension to the story.  But it's the human relationships that give the story its heart. Like most eleven year olds, Genie is awkward and unsure of where he stands, especially with people he doesn't know well, but even, at times, with his brother, whom he admires and wants to emulate.  And then there are the often inscrutable relationships between adults -- his parents, his grandparents, his father and uncle and, most of all, his father and grandfather. There's a lot for Genie to figure out but by keeping his ears, eyes, and heart open, he will learn to navigate the dynamics within his own family, which will prepare him to navigate the wider world. Reviewed by KT Horning"},

{"title": "Reviewing While White: Mary Jemison, Native American Captive.", "date": "Tuesday, August 23, 2016", "text": "By Ernie Cox Whiteness is difficult to see and talk about for many of us (White people) because we know it by another name – “normal”. In The Racial Contract Charles W. Mills explains how the White normative view is established and maintained: “…what it requires to achieve Whiteness successfully, to become a White person, is a cognitive model that precludes self-transparency and genuine understanding of social realities.”   In the new Based on a True Story series from Macmillan, the White point of view is the lens through which young readers experience the timeline of United States history. The decision to contract this series with a single White author has ensured a series that will only strengthen the dominant White narrative of U.S. history while ignoring the realities and perspective of people of color and members of the First/Native Nations. By way of example, we will review one volume (which to date has not been reviewed in professional journals) in this series – Mary Jemison: Native American Captive by E.F. Abbott. The book opens in 1743 with Mary Jemison’s pregnant mother making the transatlantic voyage to America. The passengers are weary: “Thirty days. And still no land in sight”“Why did we want to go to America?”“What will we find there”“Land to call our own”“Wild savages” “Freedom” (page 2) By 1758 Mary and her siblings are helping to tend the family homestead in central Pennsylvania.  “Travelers from western Pennsylvania told frightening stories. More and more colonists were attacked by savages”  (page 6).  In his scholarship about Whiteness, Mills details how the dichotomy of savage (in this case First Nations) and civilized person (Europeans) is constructed around the description of space: “Europeans, or at least full Europeans, were ‘civilized’ and this condition was manifested in the character of the spaces they inhabited”  (pg 42, Racial Contract). Those spaces included the cities of Europe, the colonial towns, and the settlements.  Abbott devotes time to detailing how Mary’s family toiled to make the land civilized. “The family had worked hard to make their farm. They cut down trees and pulled stumps. They built a house and barn. They had fields for crops, meadows where lambs and calves could wander, and an orchard dotted with pink apple blossoms.” (pg 4). “NonEuropeans were ‘savages’ and this condition was manifested in the character of the spaces they inhabited”  (pg 42, Racial Contract). The White narrator of Jemison’s story foreshadows the danger: “A savage would be silent.” “A savage would creep quietly through the woods – until, at the very last moment, he would whoop the death yell” (pg 8). Mary wants to escape the the frontier and move to Philadelphia. “Let the wild animals and wild people have these woods”.  The narrator repeatedly equates First/Native Nations people to animals.   The Shawnee men who arrive at the Jemison’s farm  “were desperate with hunger – like bears waking up from their hibernation starving and cross”  (pg 21). In selecting Jemison’s story as a way to explore the colonization of North America, Abbott inevitably casts First/Native Nations people as aggressors.  According to the author’s note, the major source of information for this book was A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison by James E. Seaver in 1823. Seaver wrote the book based on interviews with Jemison. Abbott found that many dates in Jemison’s recollection were inaccurate, but the larger problem with Abbott’s book is that the entire narrative of colonisation is through the eyes of a White person.  Even the version of the Seneca creation story was taken from Seneca Indian Myths by Jeremiah Curtin, a White folklorist.   We can find no source information to indicate that Abbott contacted or read the accounts about Mary or the larger social history of the Seneca Nation by anyone other than White scholars of a different era. Today’s young readers will be little more enlightened than Mary was in the late 18th century. Several images are included in Abbott’s book to provide context for the historical period.  Among them is this image from the Library of Congress. Note the caption on the original.  Abbott captions this image as “A wood engraving of Native Americans attacking the British during the French and Indian War.”  Images and text work together to establish the members of the Seneca tribe as the aggressors.   After Mary is taken away by Shawnee men and sold to members of the Seneca Nation she begins to understand more about the First Nations. “The Six Nations have signed a treaty with the Yengeese at Easton” Jako-ki said“Six Nations?” Mary said“Oneida, Onondaga, Mohawk, Cayuga, Tuscarora, and Seneca,” Jako-ki said. The Seneca women go on to explain how many treaties have been broken. Mary recalls her father describing the First/Native Nations as savages who “didn’t deserve the land because they didn’t farm or build houses.” “Now Mary knew differently. She slept in a bark house. She ate the corn the tribes grew” (pg 94).  What Mary doesn’t realize and readers are not told is that “The Seneca were the largest of six Native American nations which comprised the Iroquois Confederacy or Six Nations, a democratic government that pre-dates the United States Constitution.”  https://sni.org/culture/Nina posted a few months back about In the Footsteps of Crazy Horse by Joseph Marshall.  In that review she talks about the refreshingly different perspective provided in that story, which is grounded in a First/ Native Nations point of view. The “Indian Captive” narrative has a long history in children’s literature. Lois Lenski won a 1942 Newbery Honor for her book Indian Captive: The Story of Mary Jemison. Why is it that over 70 years after Lenski’s book the same narrative (albeit poorly written and researched compared to Lenski) of White superiority over First/Native Nations is still being published? Most libraries are well stocked with narrative voices such as Abbott.  Mary Jemison: Native American Captive does nothing to enlarge the scope of children’s literature. If the complete story of North America is to be told publishers need to seek out stories by more First/Native Nation authors.  Mary’s story ends in her old age explaining her history (and by extension the story of the Seneca) to White kids who live nearby.  The Based on a True Story series leaves contemporary kids in the same position - dependent on the White normative view to understand U.S history."},
{"title": "On White Fragility, by Guest Blogger Justine Larbalestier", "date": "Thursday, August 18, 2016", "text": "Author Justine Larbalestier. Photo by Niki Bern.Why do we white people hate talking about race?My theory is that it makes us feel like we are the baddies. A notion we recoil from because we have been taught all our lives that white people are the goodies. So many of our stories are about us saving (some part of) the world from racism and exploitation: Dances with Wolves, The Help, Avatar (some other world) etc. All too often in these stories, as in probably the most famous example, To Kill a Mockingbird, we're also the baddies doing the terrible things but that's okay because we're the white saviours.The story we often tell ourselves about white colonialism is that we saved the \"savages\" from their brutish, cannibalistic lives by giving them Christianity and civilization. We tend to edit out our \"gifts\" of small pox, massacres, slavery, and the fact that the vast bulk of verifiable incidents of cannibalism were committed by white people. *Cough* Donner party.Coming to terms with the fact that, not only are we not the goodies, that historically we are, in fact, the big bad is not easy. Nor is realising that individually we white people can, and frequently do, hurt people on a daily basis because we don't think about how our whiteness smooths our path for us while flattening others.When we are called on our (usually) unthinking racist statements and acts we tend to fall apart. All too often other white people rally around to tell us that the problem is not what we’ve said or done—nope, it's those mean people calling us on it.“I'm a good person. I can't be racist.”This spectacle is called white fragility.It doesn't have to be that way. We white people can get out of our own way.Here's what I do when a Person of Colour or an Indigenous person calls me out (in the non-­duelling sense):1. Assume they're speaking in good faith because they know more about racism than I do. Too many of us whites are convinced we know more about racism than the people who actually experience it. We don't. Even those of us with PhDs on the subject.  Someone saying something mean about us because we're white is not the same as systemic racism.2. Listen. That uncomfortable feeling? I've learnt that it's a good thing. I no longer run away from it.3. Learn. This is the part where I figure out why the criticism is making me feel uncomfortable. Always remembering that feeling uncomfortable is nothing compared to being subjected to racism. Discomfort isn't lethal.4. Assume that the calling out is not about me but about making the world a less racist, more equitable place.5. Do what I can to make the world a less racist, more equitable place. Obviously, this is the hardest part.Ways white writers can make the world (or publishing, at least) a less racist, more equitable place:To help diversify YA, we white authors can support Indigenous authors and Authors of Color by reading their books, recommending their books, blurbing their books, and recommending them to our agents. When we're invited to conferences, or festivals, or to be in anthologies, make sure they're not majority white. We need to make more space for People of Colour and Indigenous people in our very white publishing industry.These are by far the most important things we can do personally to increase diversity.However, I keep seeing white authors getting hung up on whether white people are allowed to write from points of view not our own. Spoiler: we're allowed. No one is stopping us. Will doing so make YA more diverse? No, it won't.Obsessing over that question has little to do with making YA a more diverse genre and everything to do with centering the concerns of white authors. A more important contribution to making YA more diverse would be to stop obsessing about it. Yes, we were taught by To Kill a Mockingbird that racism can be solved by a well-intentioned white person saving the day, but maybe it's time to say goodbye to that more­-than­-fifty­-years-­old model.Recently I've said I'm going to focus on writing white main characters in my single point of view novels. That's a personal decision. I've not told anyone else to do likewise.  This decision is also not much of a contribution to diversifying YA. It's about my journey grappling with my whiteness and racism and fragility.My name is Justine Larbalestier and I'm white and fragile.For too long time I believed in being a white saviour. I thought that by writing from the point of view of a Person of Colour I was helping make YA more diverse. I was helping YA's diverse readership see themselves represented. There were so few books for them! I was supplying the lack! I was doing good!For years the response to my books—glowing reviews, award nominations, fan letters from People of Colour—supported my belief that I was doing good.I had read critiques of the white saviour complex but was sure they didn't apply to me. But one day in early 2009 a black woman blogger wrote a critique of my novel Liar.Liar has a black teen protagonist. The blogger wrote that the book hurt her, that it was full of painful tropes, and that she would not read anything else I wrote unless it was not about People of Colour because I could not be trusted with the stories of anyone who isn't white. Further, that she wasn't going to read any more books with PoC protags by white people because we always get it wrong.I felt like I'd been punched.It was the most painful criticism any of my books had ever received and I've had reviews call for my books to be burnt and me to be slapped.I sent the critique to several friends so they could reassure me she was wrong.Yes, in the face of someone literally stating she had been hurt by the racist tropes in my book, all I wanted was reassurance. I thought my hurt feelings were more important than her actual pain.That right there is white fragility.I'd love to tell you that I understood that at the time. I didn't.I knew enough not to say anything publicly. I just moaned to my friends.Not long afterwards people started realising that the cover of Liar had been whitewashed. That particular blogger wrote brilliant critiques of the whitewashing. She was one of the many voices who helped get the cover changed. I continued to follow her work online and found myself agreeing with the majority of it.Which only made her criticism burn more. She was right about so many other things, did that mean she wasn't wrong about my book? I wanted to believe she was wrong. My friends had told me she was. Besides, she'd gotten several details of the plot wrong. Clearly her anger blinded her. It was an angry, disgusted, sarcastic review.  She used the word \"ugh\" a lot. She wasn't being reasonable.I ignored the critique and went on to write (with Sarah Rees Brennan) yet another book with a PoC main character, Team Human. This time the protagonist was Chinese ­American. There were no critiques from well­-known bloggers. I saw one or two reviews on Good Reads by Chinese ­American reviewers who had problems with it. But it got great trade reviews! Lots of other Chinese ­American readers loved it!I kept thinking about that review. More and more blog posts and articles were appearing about the lack of PoC and Indigenous writers in YA and the need for diversity.  The conversation was starting to shift from merely being about representation. There was growing talk about who wrote those trade reviews, who gave out those awards. Overwhelmingly white people.I'm not sure when it happened but sometime in the last few years, amidst the growth of #WeNeedDiverseBooks and #OwnVoices, I started to realise that blogger was right. Of course she was right. Liar had hurt her. I had hurt her. More than that, I finally realised her critique was not about me. It wasn't all that much about my book, either.She was explaining what it's like to read books by white people that purport to be about people like her, that arrogantly trample on her lived experience, without a thought as to how that affects her. She was saying she'd had enough. She didn't trust white writers like me. And why should she?We white people tend to judge books individually and not within the wider context of systemic racism. PoC and Indigenous readers don't have that luxury. They can't step outside their lived experience. The racism in one particular book might seen mild—or even invisible—to white me, but for the PoC reader who has been bombarded with those tropes over and over and over again, it's too much.Her critique showed me how high the stakes are.Before I read her critique I had never seriously considered the harm I could cause writing PoC and Indigenous characters.Her angry, disgusted, sarcastic critique was what finally got through to me.The fact that it took me so long to hear what she was saying also made me realise that there is no way to talk about white privilege or racism that doesn't get heard by many white people as an attack. Even if she had written her critique in a nice way I'd still have felt gut-­punched.Frankly, back when I first read that critique I'd read hundreds of books and articles about white privilege, white supremacy, appropriation, diversity, racism. Most of them written very nicely indeed with nary an angry word. I'd not thought any of them had much to do with me because I was sure that I'm one of the good ones. Like that nice white lawyer in To Kill a Mockingbird who saves the day.Frankly, her anger got through to me more effectively than if she had been nice.Except.I reread that critique while writing this essay. Here's the thing: it wasn't that angry or sarcastic. It was more sad and disappointed.It sounded angry to me back then because I didn't want to think about how my books weren't helping YA to become diverse. I didn't want to think about how I was part of the problem. I wasn't ready to listen so I heard it as angry yelling.Until we white writers are ready to listen, until we're ready to accept that, yes, we are a part of systemic racism, yes, we benefit from white supremacy, it doesn't matter what the tone is, we won't be able to hear or understand what's being said.A big part of why we find it so hard to listen is that we whites are rarely taught about race. Unless we're very lucky, our parents don't sit us down and explain it. Our teachers mostly don't either. Most of us have not been prepared to think or talk about race. As a result most of us will literally do anything we can to avoid talking about it.This feeling that we're the baddies is so uncomfortable we change the subject as soon as possible.Or, just as bad, we follow through on naive notions about how we can fix it. You know, like writing a nice book about a good white lawyer who tries to save a black person from being jailed for a crime they didn't commit because they've been framed by a bad white person and now racism is over. Yay! A white man once told me that was the most important novel ever written about race. He wasn't joking.We white people have much unlearning to do. Step one: throw away the myth of the white saviour. Let other communities speak for themselves.Note: Thank you, Alaya Dawn Johnson, Scott Westerfeld and Doselle Young for your feedback on earlier drafts of this essay. All remaining infelicities of expression and unclarity are mine all mine. I'd also like to thank Edi Campbell and Debbie Reese for their amazing blogs. They are two of the best resources out there on YA, Children's Literature and representation of PoC and Indigenous people. For some of the other people who have shaped my thinking on these issues check out the people I follow on Twitter.Although the single point of view novels I write now have white main characters they are not all-­white books. I don't live in an all-white ­world so I don't write all­-white books. The books I'm working on that have multiple point of view characters are also not all-white.I didn't name the blogger I discuss above because she critiqued my book without naming it. She did that because she was tired of white people yelling at her every time she critiqued a book for being racist. I wasn't about to point more of them in her direction.Justine Larbalestier is an Australian-American author of eight novels. Her most recent, My Sister Rosa, is about a seventeen-year-old boy whose ten-year-old sister is a psychopath. It was published in February by Allen and Unwin in Australia and New Zealand and will be out in North America in November published by Soho Press. Her previous novel is Razorhurst, which takes place on a winter’s day in 1932 when Dymphna Campbell, a gangster’s moll, and Kelpie, a street urchin who can see ghosts, meet over the dead body of Dymphna’s latest lover, Jimmy Palmer.  Her most popular novel, Liar, is kind of self explanatory, i.e. it’s about a liar. She edited Zombies versus Unicorns with Holly Black. Her other novels include How to Ditch Your Fairy and the Magic or Madness trilogy.Ed. 6/20/20 by Allie: Due to too much spam, I'm closing the comments on this post.

{"title": "Interview: Renée Watson talks Langston Hughes, I, Too, Arts Collective, gentrification, and more.", "date": "Sunday, August 14, 2016", "text": "Author and I, Too, Arts Collective Founder Renée WatsonReading While White is delighted to be joined by Renée Watson, founder of I, Too, Arts Collective, today.  Below, RWW team member Allie Jane Bruce interviews Renée.Allie: Congratulations on launching this initiative!  How did it happen?  Did you just pick up the phone one day and say to the owner, \"I want to turn this brownstone into a space for poets”?Renée: Believe it or not, it really did happen that way. Only before the phone call, I had been thinking about how I really wanted to see that space used for something meaningful in the community.I have been thinking this for many years now and the more Harlem changes, the more urgency I felt to do something. So before making the phone call, I had a proposal together and had thought out a whole businesses plan—you know, the practical stuff. Once I shared my vision with the person who owns it, she was very moved and agreed to give us till the end of August to raise money for the lease.Did you and she talk about the gentrification happening in Harlem?  Is that a motivating force for both of you?Yes, we’ve talked a lot about gentrification and our hope to preserve this space instead of seeing it become overpriced condos.For me, gentrification is very complicated. I appreciate not having to go across town to get healthy food options, I’m the first person in line for a good brunch, and as a writer I spend a lot of time in coffee shops working.  I enjoy shopping at trendy stores but I am not for erasing a people’s history, pushing them out so that they can’t afford to live in their neighborhood, their home. This is one of the reasons why I started I, Too, Arts Collective.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Watson's YA novel This Side of Homeis about twins who have different reactions to the gentrification impactingtheir Portland neighborhood.As I’ve toured the nation on a book tour sharing This Side of Home with young people, I’ve heard countless stories of communities being dismantled, of local and cultural histories being erased. I hope that restoring Langston’s home can be a way of reclaiming space, a way to ensure that Harlem’s literary history—Black literary history—will be preserved.So, yes, it is about standing up against gentrification. But my other motivation is about providing a space for people of color and people from marginalized communities to have a haven to create and tell their stories. Our stories matter and so many people try to speak for us, try to come in and “give us a voice.\"  I, Too, Arts Collective is not about giving a voice but providing a space for young and emerging artists, as well as professional artists, to share and develop the artistic voice they already have. To put on record for themselves where they come from. Inspired by Langston’s body of work, we hope to encourage people to not shy away from the pain or only write about the joy, but to create art in response to it all.When I read Langston Hughes, I'm struck by how much of the social issues present in his work are front and center in the USA today.   I'm thinking especially of his (out of print) book Black Misery, which was from a child’s point of view.  For example:\"Misery is when you heard / on the radio that the neighborhood / you live in is a slum but / you always thought it was home.\"And also: \"Misery is when you start to help an old white lady across the street and she thinks you're trying to snatch her purse\" and \"Misery is when the taxi cab won't stop for your mother and she says a bad word.\"What do you think Langston Hughes would be writing about today, if he were alive?I think he'd be writing the same kind of poems he wrote back then—poems about Black lives and how they matter. Poems that humanize otherness. I have been reading his poems, as well as poems by Lucille Clifton a lot lately. They are keeping my spirit intact, keeping me from wallowing in sorrow and frustration. There is sadness in their work, yes, but there is also an unapologetic pride and joy there too. There’s a truth telling, a rebuking, an honoring, and a love that Langston writes with. When I teach him in the classroom, I ask young people to think about how they can also be recorders, responders, rebukers, rejoicers and rebuilders of their world through art. I encourage them to compare and contrast the times we are in now and the times that Langston lived through—what’s changed, what’s the same? How far have we come, what more do we need to do?I love how you crystalize these ideas: \"to compare and contrast the times we are in now and the times that Langston lived through—what’s changed, what’s the same? How far have we come, what more do we need to do?\" Will you make it an explicit part of your goal at I, Too, Arts Collective to feature poets who are \"recorders, responders, rebukers, rejoicers and rebuilders\" pondering these questions?Absolutely. Our summer intensive program will be a social justice and art program. Participants will create art (writing, visual, and performance pieces) in response to a social issue they care about.This is not to say that we won’t also teach the craft of writing poetry. I think it’s important that both craft and social awareness are nurtured. I want our young people to create from a place of passion and skill. I also believe that besides the artistic and creative component of our workshops, we are building world citizens of the 21st century. The need for critical thinking skills and empathy are crucial. Through art making, I believe young  people can develop and practice life skills that will help to create the world in which we want to live. So even if our young people never become professional artists, the life skills that the arts impart and cultivate, to me, are just as important. I say this often, but I really do believe that artists are problem solvers—we understand what it means to revise, to start over even. With each project we work the muscle of perseverance and commit to seeing something until the end. This means that every artist knows that change is sometimes slow. That progress needs to be revisited, reassessed. That there is always work that can be done. In our workshops, we’ll talk explicitly about this relationship between our art making and our activism.Before moving on—I want to stress that I do intend for the space to be fun and full of laughter. Sometimes when we talk about social justice and art, it takes on a heaviness. And yes, there is a time to think critically and challenge the system.There is also a time to celebrate and honor unsung heroes, to reflect on what’s beautiful, what’s worthy of praise. That’s what I love about Langston’s body of work. It is not hopeless even though it speaks of struggle. There’s joy there, there’s an intentional and calculated hope. That, too, is the legacy we want to continue.How can people support I, Too, Arts Collective?We’ve launched a fundraising campaign and I’d like to invite people to get involved by giving what they can. We’re accepting donations starting at $5+ and there’s a variety of perks when you give. You can check out our campaign page here and see our launch video below.Another way to support us is to spread the word and keep up with our progress by following the hashtag #LangstonsLegacy or following us on Twitter: @ITooArtsRenée, thank you so much for launching this project, and for taking the time to talk with us!"},
{"title": "So You Bought A Racist Book For Your Library: Now What?", "date": "Wednesday, August 10, 2016", "text": "My library still has Little House on the Prairie. Several copies, in fact.We have them even though I know how racist and inaccurate they are. And I still buy new copies when the old ones wear out.  I bet it’s the same at your library.  These are part of the compromises we make when we work in libraries.  Often in online discussions, you’ll hear some librarians or authors make it seem like if you recognize racist and problematic content in books you must be the kind of librarian who pulls those titles from your shelves and tears them up in front of your patrons.  But there’s so much more nuance in these situations and that, of course, makes them difficult. Librarian's reactions to the Little House range from  wanting to remove them to finding ways to teach with them.  Even though my library has several copies of Little House on the Prairie we also have several copies of The Birchbark House by Louise Erdrich. I often get to share with people checking out Little House my love for Birchbark and how I think they make wonderful companion reads. More than once I have seen parents and kids head back to the shelves and check out The Birchbark House to go along with Little House.  Is this a perfect solution?  Of course not.  But it’s a direct one with often immediate results.  It’s the kind of solution I don’t think I’ve ever heard from the crowd of naysayers who chime in with “Wow, when did we get so POLITICALLY CORRECT!” and “Wow, I guess you don’t believe in intellectual freedom!” in online discussions, blog comments, and sometimes even in person at conferences and workshops. I have been reminded of this example and these encounters time and again as people brought up justified concerns about books from A Fine Dessert to the more recent When We Was Fierce. I have seen many librarians who were unaware of the problematic content of these titles who now find themselves at a loss for what to do now that these books are on their shelves.  Many librarians pre-ordered When We Was Fierce based on the starred reviews it received from three major publications.  As of this writing, Candlewick has put the book on hold, so that e. E. Charlton-Trujillo could “allow herself a further review of the text.” But many librarians already ordered it.  The question I’ve heard over and over is “I’ve got this thing, now what?”Megan did an amazing job writing about accusations of censorship in a library setting and I urge all librarians wrestling with this question to take the time to read it and consider how it applies to their library and their collection development. Like Megan, I am not giving you prescriptive advice on, “Do this or else you’re a bad librarian!” But I think there are some issues here worth taking a deeper, more considerate look at.  First: if you did, in fact, pre-order When We Was Fierce I ask you to really ask yourself why.  Did you just look at three starred reviews and then look no farther? Did none of the sampled dialogue in the reviews make you somewhat wary?  The Publishers Weekly review quotes this dialogue: “Jive brothers rolled in hard./ They walked intent.... I didn't want nuthin' to do with their truth.” Jive brothers? Nuthin’? Does that sound to you like the way contemporary African-American teens talk?  Honestly? The Kirkus review quotes these phrases: \"He wanna have speak\" and \"We all held our wait.\" When I read those reviews a bell in the back of my head instantly started ringing.  It sounded, to me, like a Saturday Night Live sketch - the imagined and deliberately simplistic way someone who is not familiar with it might think African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) sounds.Read the reviews for When We Was Fierce closer.  There are more warning signs.  In Booklist’s starred review there is an allusion made to the “semi-invented vernacular” but there is no deeper look at what that means. When I read that I wondered: “Why does the author feel a need to invent a vernacular when AAVE already exists?  Is it because the author can’t actually converse in AAVE and doesn’t understand code-switching while using it?” (Edith Campbell touches on code-switching and how it relates to this book in her review.) These were warning signs to me.  What else was troubling? This line from Kirkus’s review: “Only the free verse's frequent apostrophes connoting a dropped letter are stereotypical and distancing.”  How could someone write this, I wondered, and still give the book a positive review?  How could Kirkus still star this book? If you read a professional review, even one that is starred, even one that is overall positive, and it mentions something is both “frequent” and “stereotypical and distancing” that should give you at least a moment or two of pause when it comes to purchasing.  Do you have the money in your budget and the room on your shelves for a book with a flaw that major?  What To Do FirstSo the first thing we can do, as purchasers and librarians who work in collection development, is be more deliberate and wary when we read reviews. Often, we are asked to just look at the stars or even gloss over the content of the reviews. Who has the time to read ALL the reviews?  I know our time is at a premium - I do collection development too and am a final selector - but it’s important, it’s necessary to be critical even of sources that are supposed to be critical themselves. This takes time and it is on us.  And it’s worth it. Ask yourself hard questions: Does this sound true?  Does this sound complete? What biases do these sources bring to this review?  What knowledge or experience is lacking from it? That onus IS on us; that IS what curating a collection deliberately and thoughtfully means. But what if you did order When We Was Fierce (or A Birthday Cake for George Washington, which actually had negative professional reviews so you were given some warning before ordering) and it’s been shipped and processed and is on your library shelves as you read this? I can’t tell you if you should pull it from your shelves or not.  That’s a decision you have to make based on reviewing the material yourself and your own collection development policies.  I would ask, however, that in both the case of When We Was Fierce and A Birthday Cake for George Washington you consider that the publishers have said these books are not ready to be sold.  That is not insignificant.  I would also urge you to take some time and actually review the material yourself - not just rely on the reviews (negative or positive) - and then think about how your patrons might react and interact with such work and about what messages that sends them about the library as a welcoming place for all. Once you have looked at it, read it yourself with a truly critical eye, listened to the voices of people like Jenn Baker and Edith Campbell and Zetta Elliott and Ibi Zoboi and  Kwame Alexander: would you still purchase it? If the answer to that is no - if the answer to that is no and you know that the publisher and the author have chosen to postpone the book so it isn’t released in the form you have then yes, that might be a legitimate reason for you to withdraw it.  As you consider When We Was Fierce on your shelves, I also ask you to think of the Publishers Weekly review that says it “gives voice to the unheard.” Why that line?  Because it is so very, very wrong.  It is wrong to assume that this book is an authentic representation of the voices of African-American teens.  And it is wrong to assume these voices are not part of YA and children’s lit - they are and always have been.  While these voices might be marginalized within YA and children’s lit it is on us, as educators and librarians, to change that. And we can.  We can do it up spotlighting and booktalking and putting face out on our shelves the books that have authentic and humane diverse voices and experiences.  Are these voices “unheard” because they don’t exist or because the majority culture simply refuses to listen?You can show you are listening by making sure your collection has more than just When We Was Fierce or Little House on the Prairie.  And be ready to booktalk those titles and promote them to your patrons. We can listen and we can push forward with truth. That’s what you can do now and always.SOME SUGGESTED TITLES TO BALANCE YOUR COLLECTIONHe Said, She Said by Kwame AlexanderTyrell, Bronxwood, and Kendra by Coe BoothA Wish Before Midnight and The Door at the Crossroads by Zetta ElliottSee No Color by Shannon Gibney How It Went Down by Kekla Magoon Shadowshaper by Daniel José OlderShow and Prove by Sofia QuinteroThe Boy in the Black Suit by Jason Reynolds (everything by Jason Reynolds, to be honest.)Jumped by Rita Williams-Garcia After Tupac and D Foster and Miracle’s Boys by Jacqueline WoodsonLiterally anything Walter Dean Myers wrote, I mean.

{"title": "Feedback Over Fear", "date": "Monday, August 8, 2016", "text": "Elisa GallWe are thrilled to welcome another member to the Reading While White team. Elisa Gall, an  insightful reviewer and reflective critical thinker, works as a school librarian in Chicago.  Her first post is below. Welcome, Elisa!I was participating in a diversity workshop a few months ago when a person of color shared with our small learning group how most of his White friends consider themselves allies, but if you ask him which of those friends he thinks act as allies, it would be maybe one or two of them—and not all the time. The moral of the story (from his perspective) was for me to learn to do the best anti-racism work I can. Let others decide how I do in each moment—and focus my time on productive action. I won’t always be an ally to everyone. I will make mistakes. It’s not an either/or. I can even do important work and mess up at the same time. What matters is how I listen and learn in these instances, and how I keep going after I experience them. When I was first asked to join the bloggers at Reading While White, my first reaction was deep feelings of inadequacy. Who am I to do this writing? I am still learning. I’m going to be exposed for my implicit bias and embarrass the hell out of myself!  As much as I do to work towards awareness for myself and other White people like me, I know that I have unconscious biases of which I am not yet aware. I sometimes feel frozen by shock or fear. I hesitate to chime in because I don’t want to be silent in the presence of injustice, but I also want to amplify voices instead of taking up space or speaking over someone else. I have to constantly check myself: WHY am I doing this? Writing this? Saying this? Feeling this? This is not about hating White people or having a negative racial identity. It is about working to interrupt racism and being open to giving and receiving all kinds of feedback. At times, I have seen myself unfortunately uphold what Robin DiAngelo refers to as the “White Rules of Engagement.” The idea of learning and sharing so publicly on this blog does make me uncomfortable, but I acknowledge that private conversations and indirect feedback only work to keep the structure of racism alive and invisible. At the White Privilege Conference in Philadelphia last spring, speaker Vernā Myers said to the crowd, “This is not the time to be afraid to say the wrong thing. We can’t afford to be stuck in shame, blame, and guilt.” She challenged the audience to reflect: Will I believe what others say about their experiences? Do I know when I am wrong? When I don’t know, do I pretend I know? Do I use my mistakes as an excuse to not engage? She added, “This isn’t about perfection. It is about connection.” Embracing imperfection leads to more gains than losses. In Promoting Diversity and Social Justice, Diane Goodman wrote about all the upsides when people share this mindset: more knowledge, new information, better understandings, heightened awareness of self and others, and authenticity—for people are less guarded, more spontaneous in interactions, and can find greater compassion for each other. I believe that if I am not trying to combat a system of injustice, I am perpetuating it.  But I must remember (to again paraphrase DiAngelo) that I am colluding with racism when I try to be a perfect White anti-racist. I needn’t try to be perfect. I need to be humble. I need to be growth-mindset oriented. I need to be strong, and compassionate, and reflective, and a good listener. Feedback is difficult, but it is vital. I am going to embrace it on both the giving and receiving ends. I appreciate the opportunity to be involved in all of the learning that happens here through this blog. I look forward to working towards increased accountability, for others and myself."},
{"title": "Nice and Neutral", "date": "Wednesday, August 3, 2016", "text": "School Library Journal (SLJ)’s online news service recently offered a curious round-up of the There is a Tribe of Kids discussion. The article depicts an un-nuanced controversy with two sides, perpetuated by “Some” and “Others.” “Some” purchase the book, and are represented in the article by a librarian who decided not to renew her ALA membership after witnessing attacks, some directed at her, on the ALSC listserv. “Others” are represented first and foremost by Debbie Reese, voicing objections to the book.  When I read these listserv comments, I do not see the voicing of objections as the “personal attacks” that others have perceived.  It concerns me to hear of fear of speaking out because of a perception of aggressiveness of “one-side” or “a few,” phrases I find frequently used to marginalize a variety of dissenting views.  Those expressing fear of attack or shaming have called on everyone to be “respectful” and “kind,” as if these concerns are somehow less valid because they aren’t being expressed in a way that makes everyone feel nice.  They have also expressed frustration that public libraries “no longer represent neutrality.” The problem is that the “neutrality” of libraries does not exist.  Storytime Underground has recently demonstrated this, and #Libraries4BlackLives further explodes the neutrality myth.  What does exist is a status quo which, to protect its existence, parades as neutrality.  For libraries to fulfill their role as a place for free exploration of ideas and diversity of thought, to actually “provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current and historical issues”  we must have those materials.  But we don’t have those materials because publishing is a market-driven industry.  If we don’t make the industry listen to and respond to all voices, not just the status quo, we will never have libraries that serve all in the community.  It is clear, for instance by listening to these teenagers of the Unitah and Oorah Nation, that the saturation of stereotypes about people of color and First Nations/Native people in our media today still promulgate racism, in this case, by the sheer preponderance of images or literary examples of non-Native people dressing like Indians. In this video Lavin says: “When you search up “Native Culture”, you’ll see people...you’ll see Whites….I’m not trying to offend anyone here...you’ll see Whites...well, it is kind of offensive to us...you’ll see Whites dressed up as Natives, you’ll see them in headdresses, when headdresses are like the holiest thing, to represent us as higher people. … It makes me so mad.” What I have seen in the discussion of THERE IS A TRIBE OF KIDS is an invitation to think deeply and explore different points of view, a place where professionals can seek to make informed decisions about how and where and whether to use this one particular book, among many, and also send a message to book creators and publishers about what gaps and pitfalls in children’s literature this book exposes, so that they can better create books that will help us do our jobs. Yet, comments on the SLJ Facebook post for their article included responses along these lines:“I think people need to relax a bit”“This PC nonsense has gone too far”“No matter what we write or say, people in the other end will find objection. Silly!!!!”These are common defensive reactions to critical exposure of the status quo, typifying criticism as one side crossing a line (an attack), or just baseless (silly nonsense). If a person chooses to believe that what they know is the only truth, then a challenge to that knowledge will feel like an attack, because this person has nothing else to stand on.  This person feels they are confronted with a battlefield to defend their truth, and will do what they can to dismantle the argument: cut it at its knees, call in the troops, or refuse to engage. If one can see one’s own knowledge as a piece of the truth, then one can enter a field of discussion without fear, trusting that there is more to know.  Venturing into that field, seeing more, and then looking back at my own truth, I’ve seen it behave in a myriad of ways.  Sometimes, it fades or flutters away: still itself but less significant, in the scheme of things.  Sometimes, I see it still there, solid, unchanged, but a piece of something bigger….the tooth that thought it was the whole jaw. Sometimes, it stands obstinately, but I see it standing on top of an enormous lie, and I choose to turn my back on it.  And sometimes...I decide I’m just still right.  But where my Whiteness is at play, that has not generally been the result. I expect that some colleagues will continue to stop engaging, feeling that what was a “nice” safe space for them is changing. But it was never nice, and it was never safe, except for those whose interests are served by the status quo. Our colleagues from marginalized communities have so much more at stake in these discussions than does someone like me, and the only attacks that I’ve witnessed have been the tone-policing of these voices. Like Lavin, people from marginalized communities have the right to be angry.  Expressing that anger when speaking one’s truth, so that others can learn, does not constitute an attack. As Dr. Ebony Elizabeth Thomas says, “Our critiques being mischaracterized as more harmful and unethical than the books themselves signals a total lack of willingness to listen.” These critiques are an invitation, and a challenge, to listen and participate in change that will further equity in our communities, through books for children, through education, through libraries. Come onto the field: the library is open."},
{"title": "The Rocky Unpaved Roads of Good Intentions", "date": "Thursday, July 28, 2016", "text": "by Ibi Zoboi               7.27.16I write for children. I have the very best of intentions.This is a dream career and one that relies on altruism, empathy, love, and mostimportant of all, respect. The same goes for parenting children. However, I ama smother. I have the very best of intentions to keep my children safe and armthem with the necessary tools to navigate life’s challenges. I am raising Blackchildren. I have a tendency to hover, hug and squeeze for a moment too long,and shower them with wet kisses in public. But as they approach their teen andtween years, I have to step back and allow them room to breathe. The same goesfor writing middle grade and young adult novels. I have to step back and allowthe story, characters, and setting room to breathe. That book will go out intothe world with wings of its own and fly, planting seeds in the hearts and mindsof young readers along the way. And like parenting, this all begins with goodintentions. My children attend a wonderfully diverse progressive schoolwhere good intentions are woven into the fabric of the school community—fromtheir social justice curriculum to their over-the-top parent involvement. Theschool has been lauded for their racial and socioeconomic diversity. However,the mostly white teaching staff and volunteering parents paint a differentpicture. I am Haitian-American. I have family in Haiti who are oftenin need of money. Even in a country drowning in good intentions with itsten-thousand non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and constant stream of aidmoney, there are still those who have to rub two sticks together, as they sayin Haiti, in order to make a buck. The shoe company, TOMS, launched an adcampaign last year where white twenty-somethings are shown frolicking throughHaitian countrysides and beaches amongst laughing schoolchildren. THIS ISHAITI, they proclaimed. My children’s school sounds like an ideal work environmentfor a young teacher of color—one that honors social justice work and educatingthe whole child. Yet, for whatever reason, the school seems to be in aperpetual cycle of “trying to find the right fit” when it comes to hiringteachers of color. And as for Haiti, there are Haitians who desperately want towork with these NGOs, not as noble artists in some equal exchange agreement,but as administrators with long-term contracts and housing benefits. However,as the TOMS ad suggests, humanitarian work is healing waters, warm islandsunshine, and grateful, laughing children for outsiders only. My husband, Mr. Z., is a public school teacher. He has goodintentions as well. He has a deep well of patience, and goes above and beyondfor his students, much like many of his colleagues. However, over the course ofhis twenty-year career, I've witnessed how time and time again, his deepconnection with his students is sometimes seen as a threat. The evaluationoften begins with, “You have a great rapport with the students, but…” As aBlack male teacher, his good intentions come with risks. A recent Huffingtonpost video and article about his former school highlighted this dichotomy. Afellow art teacher, a white woman, was featured in the video, shedding a fewtears and speaking of her love for her students and the many hardships in theirlives. The video also showed glimpses of an art show that Mr. Z. helped tocurate. Mr. Z. was not featured in the video. He could not have possibly shed atear for his students and their hard lives, I suppose. In this case, someoneelse’s good intentions are held up as an example of excellent teaching, whileMr. Z.’s was simply “a good rapport, but…”.This is the hierarchy of good intentions that reeks ofWhite-Man’s-Burdenism. There is a self-perceived burden of doing something,making it right, and fixing things for the Other—that this Other cannot helpthemselves, even if this help comes from members of their own community.Make no mistake, members of marginalized groups can alsowear the cape of White-Man’s-Burdenism. In 2010, six months after thedevastating Haitian earthquake, I launched a Kickstarter campaign to conduct awriting workshop for teen girls in Haiti. It was successful. I published abeautiful anthology of their poems. I reaped the rewards of my good intentions.However, toward the end of the workshops and my stay in Haiti, I had to stepback and listen. For many of the girls, it was not their first time participatingin a writing workshop. Their schools have had poetry recitals and contests.Most importantly, those girls could not eat my good intentions. They could notuse them to pay for school or uniforms or much-needed toiletries. I could notpress cold-hard good intentions into their hands so they could go about livingtheir lives after such tragedy. This workshop and resulting anthology was myown accomplishment. It was for my own healing and need to do something,anything. I felt duty-bound to give these girls a voice, but didn’t realizethat they already had a voice. Their writing and thoughts exceeded myexpectations. They didn’t need me to give them a voice. They had spoken loudand clear when I asked them what they wanted and needed: money and opportunitiesto make more money. My anthology and good intentions did not do that for them. Recently, I spoke out online against this sort ofwell-meaning activism. Several fellow children’s writers participated in aBlack Lives Matter initiative. Something didn’t sit right with me when I wasasked to use the name of Alton Sterling, hours after his death, to offercritiques or ARCs of my novel in exchange for donating to the Sterling familyor the Black Lives Matter movement. I had the visceral reaction that this wastoo raw, too soon. I asked that the founder consider removing the middleman andrewards, and have people donate to the family directly. As another fellowwriter pointed out, it was a “mismatch of cause and activity.” But theinitiative continued because, in this situation, direct action trumps mourning.The overwhelming need to “do something” supersedes quiet, reflective time toask “wait, what is happening to us?” Good intentions outweighed perceivedinactivity.  With the recent criticism of e.E. Charlton-Trujillo’s WhenWe Was Fierce, I couldn’t help but to wonder about this heavy burden of goodintentions. When the discussion about the book was first brought up in aprivate Facebook group, I was at my agency’s retreat. Charlton-Trujillo was alsothere. I was one of two Black people at this retreat, and the only Black woman.My dear friends were very vocal about the problems in this book. And at times,I was within arms-length from the author. So we talked. I set the book andeverything I’ve read about it aside to connect with the person away fromscreens and social media, to have a real heart to heart. The beautiful sceneryand overall good vibes at the retreat begged for this sort of exchange. After our conversation, I was reminded of the few times Ihad to approach some of my children’s teachers with, “I know you love yourstudents, but this is problematic.” I truly cannot deny the author’s love,heart, and purity of intentions—it was all there. Having my children inprogressive schools with mostly white teachers warrants that I rely onintuition—to feel a person out, connect with their heart, and gauge where theirintentions may lie. And in most cases, this heart, these good intentions, areshrouded in White-Man-Burdenism—this need to save or help or give voice towithout asking, “What is it that you want? What is it that you need from me, orhow can I help you?”I’ve learned this from my husband over the years. He’srealized that he’s a high school teacher, not a replacement father-figure to hisstudents. He only listens without rushing to action, then asks, “What are YOUgoing to do about it?” or “What would YOU like me to do?” He empowers hisstudents this way. He’s not there to save them from themselves. As an artteacher, he gives them supplies to create mirrors in the form of visual art.These mirrors are outlets and tools for self-expression. These mirrors are notwindows into their hard lives for others to watch with pity. Their perceivedpain and trauma is not fodder for guilt, thus fueling White-Man’s-Burdenism inthe minds of voyeurs. Their art belongs to only them—however beautiful,disjointed, or painful. I’m still learning how to do this as a writer for children.I have to shed the need to save, to write for, or to give voice to. The mirrorneeds to be held up to myself first. When I tell a story, I have to remindmyself that this is about me and others like me first and foremost. I center myown experiences within the story, so that when it goes out into the world, Iwill personally connect with my readers, and they to me. Writing gives voice tothe writer and no one else. The truth within the story will resonate withreaders on its own. Problematic books written by outsiders are a mirror held upto that writer and the group she belongs to. The book says “This is what Ithink of you, or this is how I perceive you.” This voice, this perception doesnot belong to us. That is your voice as the writer. That is your truth, notours. Like the smothering parent that I am, every good intentionneeds to step back and check itself. Loosen that grip, let go of that need tosave or protect or speak on behalf of, and ask instead, “What do YOU need?” or“What would YOU like me to do?”  We need room to tell our own stories. Even if we hurt ourselvesin the process with our own problematic content, we need breathing room to bereflective and unearth those deeply-planted seeds of colonization. We weretaught to hate ourselves and everything about our traditions. Serving us moreself-hate in the form of help, or placing warped, tainted lenses -- not mirrors-- before everyone’s eyes in the form of story, only deepens this wound.  And like those teen girls in Haiti, we would like you togive us money (grants, scholarships, etc.), or create opportunities that willenable us to support ourselves and our families. Money and opportunities aretools for empowerment. Intend to empower us, level the playing field, cultivatetrue equity. Instead of writing our story, let us write it ourselves and getpaid for it. Then we can begin to create self-sufficiency to rebuild ourfamilies and communities. Step aside and let us also stand at the helm of yournon-profit organization or company whose mission it is to help or save us.Don’t stand on our backs and shoulders perpetually reaching down, offering toassist, while you remain standing on our backs and shoulders for all ofeternity. Most important of all, listen. Yes, to the help. Yes, tooffering to assist and doing something so that there is a sea change. But whenwe say, “Ouch! That hurts,” or “We can do it ourselves,” step back and listen.Give us room to breathe. Here are some bite-sized questions:Before Writing the Other, ask yourself: 1) Is there another book like it written by a person fromthat community?2) How can I center my own story and voice withoutappropriating another culture or community?3) How can I discuss [insert issue here] through the lens ofmy own community?                     ----Ibi Zoboi holds an MFA in Writing for Children from the Vermont College of Fine Arts.

{"title": "When Whiteness Dominates Reviews", "date": "Monday, July 25, 2016", "text": "by KT Horning In the past twenty-four hours we've seen thoughtful critical reviews from Jennifer Baker and Edi Campbell about a new book coming out next week by e. E. Charlton-Trujillo, When We Was Fierce (Candlewick). Both reviews offer African-American perspectives on the book that contrast sharply with the praise it has received so far from White reviewers and librarians on social media. Why is it that Whiteness continues to dominate professional reviews? And what can be done to change that? Last week I spoke to School Library Journal reviewers who were nearing the end of an eight-week course on Diversity and Cultural Literacy in Professional Reviews. The group had already heard from experts such as Debbie Reese, Angie Manfredi, Malinda Lo, Allie Jane Bruce, and Edi Campbell, and they had already done extensive reading and participated in online discussions with each other.I think it’s great that Kiera Parrott and Shelley Diaz of SLJ are providing these kinds of opportunities for their team of volunteer reviewers. We need to see more positive steps forward in our profession for our reviewers and for people in our field at large. Because let’s face it, the majority of children’s book reviewers are White, as are most members of book evaluation and a award committees. Our experiences as White people are limited. How can we discern if a book about a child of color is authentic? In order to do our job, we have to seek out and listen to diverse voices. And those voices are not appearing much in the professional review journals.A case in point: When We Was Fierce by e. E. Charlton-Trujillo. The book deals with a group of African-American teenage boys in the inner-city who get caught up in gang activity. I first became aware of this book when I started seeing the advance praise and reviews for it in the professional journals. Publishers Weekly, Kirkus, and Booklist all gave it glowing starred reviews. Normally, this would make me eager to get the book, but something stopped me short -- the lines that the reviews quoted from the book. A sample: “Jive brothers rolled in hard./ They walked intent.... I didn’t want nuthin’ to do with their truth./ Sometimes it don’t matter what you want or intend./ It’s gonna go how it go” [quoted in Publishers Weekly]“He wanna have speak”; “We all held our wait.” [quoted in Kirkus]It’s sort of Black English. But not really. One of the reviews made reference to a “semi-invented vernacular” and right away that waved a red flag for me. Coming from a background in Linguistics, I know that African-American Vernacular English is not “broken English.” It has complex and consistent grammatical and phonological rules, and you can’t just “make it up.” It’s a living, breathing language. If Charlton-Trujillo were creating a form of English for people living in the future, as Anthony Burgess did in A Clockwork Orange and Russell Hoban did in Riddley Walker, I might buy it. But she’s not. She’s putting words in the mouths of characters who supposedly live in the Here and Now. In fact, it’s the raw immediacy of the story that these reviewers seem to be especially high on.In her seminal study, Shadow and Substance: Afro-American Experience in Contemporary Children’s Fiction, Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop cited language as one of the five key traits that define books reflecting authentic Black experience, what she called “culturally conscious fiction.” These are five traits that cultural outsiders can get right, but rarely do. They don’t walk the walk, talk the talk (in this case, literally), and they haven’t, as Virginia Hamilton once said, “lived the life.”But here’s the thing. If I hadn’t had a background in Linguistics that made me sensitive to language usage (and misusage), I might have taken these reviews at face value and simply trusted the judgment of these three reviewers.  I might have completely jumped over this line in the Kirkus review: “Only the free verse’s frequent apostrophes connoting a dropped letter are stereotypical and distancing.” Frequent apostrophes… stereotypical… You know what that conjures up? A Joel Chandler Harris-type fake “Negro dialect.” And keep in mind that this line appears in a starred review. So are we saying that stereotypical speech from an African-American character is not only okay but highly recommended? Can’t we do better than that?Booklist goes one step further and drives its starred review home with a feature interview with Charlton-Trujillo entitled “Teeth, Truth and Tenacity.”  In it the author talks about the language she used:  “Right from the jump, I could hear the music of T’s world that hadn’t existed in YA before.” Hadn’t existed in YA before?  That’ll be news to Jacqueline Woodson, Coe Booth, Kwame Alexander, Jason Reynolds, Kekla Magoon, and many more. And any of them might point back to the work of Walter Dean Myers, Virginia Hamilton, and Alice  Childress, whose book A Hero Ain’t Nothin But a Sandwich was published so long ago that I read it as a teen while listening to the Jackson 5. Charlton-Trujillo goes on to explain her invented vernacular:  “Slang can become dated quick, so I had a unique opportunity to incorporate some slang along with a new vernacular.” Suffice it to say that some opportunities are best not taken.Even though two of the three starred reviews were anonymous, they read to me as evaluations by cultural outsiders. The book is a week or so away from publication and we’re just now beginning to get responses from prominent African-American critics. They see the book completely differently. They are not finding it “[g]raceful, trenchant, moving, and utterly necessary” as the Booklist reviewer did.  They have found it inauthentic, even offensive.  Jennifer Baker and Edi Campbell are offering important insider perspectives that are sadly lacking in the professional journals. White people can and should learn from them. Please read their reviews and think hard about them before you place When We Was Fierce into the hands of a young reader. ****Update (July 26, 2016): Zetta Elliott has added her voice on her blog with this essay: Black Voices Matter"},
{"title": "Challenging Accusations of Censorship", "date": "Wednesday, July 20, 2016", "text": "Those who fight against censorship in our field are typically hailed for their commitment to intellectual freedom and their defense of the rights of children and teens to read and have access to a wide range of materials.Those who challenge racism in our field are often vilified, and sometimes accused of being censors.Last week in his RWW review of There Is a Tribe of Kids, Sam Bloom concluded that “it is not a book I will be personally sharing with (human) kids.” Sam did not say whether he or someone else would or would not purchase it for the library where he works. Still, author Roseanne Parry took Sam’s statement as an “invitation to censorship.”If you don’t agree with Sam’s or Debbie Reese’s review of the book and their decision not to recommend it, that’s fine. We hope you read and reflected on what they had to say before making up your mind, but no one is demanding you agree with them. It’s a big leap, however, to go from disagreement to the suggestion or accusation of censorship.It’s time to talk about the idea that critical analysis of a book resulting in the decision not to use or perhaps even purchase that book is censorship. We need to talk about it in theory, and we need to talk about it in practice, and we need to talk about in the context of challenging racism in children’s and young adult literature.From Theory to PracticeThe principles of intellectual freedom are foundational to the work of librarians, and to our lives as citizens. The work of challenging racism is also foundational to both, critical to the well-being of all citizens and the future of our democracy.Can these two foundational things coexist? Absolutely, even as we acknowledge it’s not always easy to hold them both in the same hand. Let’s be honest, however. The principles of intellectual freedom have an uneasy coexistence with many of our daily decisions as librarians. They provide guiding ideals that our profession and our democracy rely on.  But when we put them into practice, the results are extraordinarily varied both across and within individual libraries because the jump from theory to practice is not necessarily clear-cut.  (There is a reason why our profession has both a brief Library Bill of Rights and a lengthy document offering interpretations of its points.)The Hard Work of SelectionAmong the misperceptions our profession struggles against, especially when facing a complaint or challenge, is that the library is either promoting a specific “agenda” or that anything goes when it comes to materials in the collection. In fact, nothing could (or should) be further from either truth.Selection, as any librarian knows, is—or should be—a thoughtful process grounded in the library’s mission and stated criteria and guidelines for choosing books and other materials. Ideally these are outlined in a board-approved selection policy that affirms intellectual freedom and the Library Bill of Rights.Selection can’t (or shouldn’t) be done by rote.  It requires holding the entire community a library is serving in one’s mind. It requires abandoning all assumptions about that community and striving to understand its many facets. It requires confronting fear. It requires moving into uncomfortable spaces.  It requires balancing budget considerations and myriad, sometimes competing interests to determine priorities and choices.  And of course, it requires making decisions without seeing most of the books or materials firsthand.Selection is also a responsibility that is mired in subjectivity no matter how hard we try to avoid it, because it is a human activity. Even if all other factors are accounted for (and they never can be—even a vendor using some sort of algorithm began with human decision-making), even the most conscientious selector brings bias to the work.Challenging Racism in the CollectionLet’s say a librarian decides not to purchase There Is a Tribe of Kids. Is it censorship? The answer to that question is: I don’t know. You don’t either. Not without talking to that librarian and understanding the thinking behind the decision. Because that thinking is key. Is critical. And to make a blanket statement calling it censorship without knowing how that librarian came to the decision: whether they considered the book in light of their selection policy guidelines and criteria and in light of their budget and priorities, would be irresponsible.It’s likely many libraries will purchase this book. But many individual librarians may choose not to highlight or feature it in displays or programming because of their concerns about racist imagery. Is that censorship?No. In fact, there are many books in library collections that are likely never to disappear, because of popular appeal (the “Little House in the Big Woods” is one example that comes to mind). In truth, we believe it is the responsibility of librarians and educators to be aware of and understand these concerns, starting with popular works that have been around awhile, and NOT to feature or promote them. Let readers find them on their own if they choose.Back to There Is a Tribe of Kids. Let’s say the book is not purchased by a librarian for a library collection specifically because of concerns it perpetuates stereotypes. Is that censorship?Again, to make a blanket statement suggesting it’s censorship when a book is rejected without considering the context in which that decision was made is irresponsible. Some libraries, for example, have statements in their policies saying materials should be free of stereotype and bias. (See the comments of our “Not a Contradiction” post from last fall for a few examples of such language.) And sure, you can argue that whether or not a book perpetuates racist stereotypes is a matter of perception and open to interpretation. And you can argue that library collections will always have things that offend. I can argue those points, too. I believe them. But I’m guessing no one would be up in arms or crying censorship if someone at a tribal library, or at a public library in a community with a large Native population, said they weren’t purchasing the book because of the imagery that’s been called out and questioned. Why should a librarian serving a predominantly White community, or a diverse, multiracial community, be any less concerned with its impact? Librarians reject books for purchase all the time based on a variety of factors. (And too often, outside of large cities, those factors and the general mindset are weighted against diversity.)  We should be mindful of how we make selection decisions. We should ask questions. But choosing not to purchase a book because of criticism that it perpetuates stereotypes isn’t necessarily the same as choosing not to purchase a book with gay, lesbian, or transgender content out of fear it will be challenged, or because it goes against one’s personal or religious values.  No policy supports fear-based decision making. No policy supports decisions grounded in personal bias. No policy (I hope) supports excluding particular groups from representation in the collection. But neither does any policy prescribe what MUST be purchased. Collection development is a responsibility that relies on professional judgment and knowledge. And even as we see efforts beginning to address cultural competency among reviewers in professional journals and on selection committees, the fact is that people of color and from First/Native Nations are underrepresented within the traditional structures and systems in which books are created and evaluated. And too many librarians are oblivious to this. Yet if we are to make truly informed collection decisions--if we are to be truly knowledgeable--we need to understand that fact. We need to listen to and consider the voices of people of color and Native critics in forums where they have a voice. Because I can promise you this: kids will never stop “playing Indian” if they continue to see books and images that normalize and even romanticize it. It isn’t an abandonment of the principles of intellectual freedom if a decision not to purchase an individual book is one made in service to a thoughtful and informed understanding of the library selection policy. And it isn’t censorship to choose not to share or promote or feature a book that is in the library collection. We’ve said it before on this blog: the principles of intellectual freedom are paramount to the work we all do, but context matters, and no text is sacred.Censorship is serious. Racism is serious. Let’s not diminish the hard work of confronting either by brandishing one against the other. Instead, let’s acknowledge that this work being done is messy and complicated and challenging, but also that it needs to be done."},
{"title": "Embracing Discomfort", "date": "Friday, July 15, 2016", "text": "Ernie CoxThe Reading While White team is jumping for joy this week, because Ernie Cox is joining us.  Ernie works as a Teacher-Librarian in Iowa City and was chair of the 2016 Newbery committee.  Ernie's first post as a Reading While White blogger is below. Welcome to Ernie!The manuals for book awards administered by The Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) were recently updated to include a statement on Diversity and ALSC Media Award Evaluation. It concludes with this passage (the entire statement is available in any of the award manuals at http://www.ala.org/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia):“As individuals serving on committees evaluate materials according to the criteria outlined for their specific charge, they should strive to be aware of how their own perspectives and experiences shape their responses to materials. Every committee member brings unique strengths to the table, but every committee member also brings gaps in knowledge and understanding, and biases. Committee members are strongly encouraged to be open to listening and learning as well as sharing as they consider materials representing diverse experiences both familiar and unfamiliar to them.”    When my colleagues and friends here at Reading While White invited me to contribute to this blog I wish I could tell you I was filled with excitement. I felt uneasy, perhaps uncomfortable too. What was the source of my discomfort? The professional discourse in children’s literature has shown us that for many good-intentioned folks it is difficult to “be aware of how their own perspectives and experiences shape their responses to materials (children’s literature and media)”.  That includes me. I’ve also heard what can happen when we listen to other perspectives - new insights into our own gaps and biases appear.  I read through the resources on the RWW site to better understand what this blog was all about.  Scanning through Peggy McIntosh’s piece on White privilege I came across this point:“I am never asked to speak for all the people of my racial group.” That is where the discomfort was for me. I’ve rarely had to speak or write about Whiteness. This might be the ultimate luxury of White privilege - being oblivious to our invisible impact on the world and not needing to say one word about it. Like an award committee’s work, the work of being an ally for a diverse and inclusive profession (and society) is a process.  Unlike an award committee’s work, it is an unfolding process spanning years. A process that will require me to be uncomfortable.  That my discomfort is primarily cognitive is another testament to my privilege. I look forward to getting to know more about myself and others through this blog."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: There Is a Tribe of Kids", "date": "Friday, July 8, 2016", "text": "by Sam BloomFor months now, I’ve been thinking about the dynamic in the children’s lit world centered around whether you can be a fan of an author/illustrator’s work and still be able to look critically at their books. (We saw this at work last fall when beloved illustrator Sophie Blackall caught heat for her illustrations in Emily Jenkins’s A Fine Dessert.) I started (and scrapped) several attempts at a blog post on the subject, until one day in June when I found that Zetta Elliott had brilliantly and succinctly said everything I had ever wanted to say about this phenomenon:  I love my friends. At times, I gush about my friends because they’re brilliant and creative and inspiring. But I am not a “fan” of my friends, and when a librarian comes up to me to express her appreciation for my books, I don’t think of her as a “fangirl.” To me, fans are not in their right mind—they’re fanatics! Their enthusiasm and excitement overwhelm their ability to think critically, and THAT can be a real problem when your job is to objectively evaluate and acquire books. YES! Especially that last sentence. It’s so very true that those of us in this relatively small (and tight-knit) children’s book world have to strike a balance between celebrating the creators of the books we love while also (a) thinking about what the books are saying about the world, and how that affects young readers, and (b) holding the creators of the book accountable when things go wrong.Which brings us to Lane Smith’s latest picture book, There Is a Tribe of Kids (Roaring Brook, 2016). I’m guessing you don’t need an introduction to Smith’s work; suffice it to say his books (especially his collaborations with Jon Scieszka) are perennial favorites that I still return to frequently. (By the way, as much as I love Scieszka he hasn’t always been the most culturally sensitive writer; see Debbie Reese’s take on the unfortunate Me Oh Maya, an entry in the Time Warp Trio series.) The “enthusiasm and excitement” that Zetta mentioned above are definitely there for me when it comes to Lane Smith’s books. But when this title (along with the book cover) flashed across the screen at a Macmillan publishing preview event this past January, I immediately grew leery. It was really the combination of the title, with its use of the word “Tribe” in an obviously playful way, and the shots of the (human) kids from the title on the last two spreads. Minh Lê touches on this unfortunate juxtaposition in his review in the New York Times Book Review: “Some readers may detect something ill-advised, if not sadly familiar, in its echoes of the longstanding trope in children’s literature that uses Native imagery or “playing Indian” to signify wildness, especially since the word ‘tribe’ is so central to this often captivating book.”I understand that “tribe” can be used in reference to a group of goat kids. Smith sets this up in the first few spreads when the human “kid” protagonist is left behind by a group of young goats, the other “kids” from the title. It’s a clever bit of wordplay, but “tribe” is a loaded term, and to me the repartee falls flat. (I’ll talk more about this later; for now I highly recommend you stop and read this Teaching Tolerance piece, The Trouble with Tribe, before you continue. It’s worth it.) Smith shows the child protagonist using play to connect with his new “tribe,” happy to be included. As Lê  writes, “Within the confines of the book, this is a heartwarming finale.”BUT. Take a look at the detail on the left; it comes from the book’s penultimate spread, a visually stunning wonderland that is equal parts Swiss Family Robinson and the Lost Boys from Peter Pan. And yes, it does make for a sweet ending within the confines of this book. But a child of Native/First Nations will not experience this story and these illustrations (kids with feathers or distinctly feather-shaped leaves sticking out from their heads, living a simple, primitive life) “within the confines of the book.” Children of Native/First Nations live in a world that oppresses and colonizes them and has done so for hundreds of years. And here we have a book that implies that it is okay to play “Indian,” to costume one’s self in Native dress, and the bottom line is that this is NOT okay.I believe that Smith’s intention here was to create a kind of childhood utopia, with the giant treehouse and the lack of adult intervention and the closeness to nature and all of that; a paean to being a kid. There’s certainly nothing wrong with that! But looking back at the aforementioned piece from Teaching Tolerance, which reads in part, “To be in a tribal state is to live in an uncomplicated, traditional condition,” it gets a bit thorny. By creating the primitive scene as a sort of unspoiled, unevolved mini-society, Smith is reinforcing the age-old stereotype which led to (again quoting from Teaching Tolerance) “the concept of tribe [as] a cornerstone for European colonial rule in Africa.” And again I’ll harken back to one of Lê’s comments: using “tribe” in the title was certainly “ill-advised.”But here’s the thing: Lê’s mixed review of the book is the exception to the rule, as There Is a Tribe of Kids has garnered 4 starred reviews to date and sits at 2nd place in the Goodreads Mock Caldecott voting. As most reviewers are White, this brings up some questions. Are we all too enamored with Lane Smith to see the problems here? To return to Zetta Elliott’s earlier point, are we able to “think critically” about and “objectively evaluate” books when they are created by someone we greatly admire? If it wasn’t Lane Smith’s name on the front cover, could we more easily see the problems inherent in There Is a Tribe of Kids? I don’t know the answers to these questions, but I do know that this is a book that I personally won’t be sharing with (human) kids."},
{"title": "Admirable Audacity: Speaking, Listening, Doing", "date": "Friday, July 1, 2016", "text": "In his Newbery Award acceptance speech delivered on June 26, 2016, in Orlando, Matt de la Peña told about a girl at one of his school visits who, after getting his autograph, asked, “Ain’t you gonna ask for my autograph, mister?”And he did ask her for it, holding out his arm for her to sign. Telling the story, he said to all of us in that banquet room: “Because maybe hers is the kind of audacity it takes to be someone when you come from nothing. And maybe that’s the kind of audacity we need to assume in the book world in order to finally give young people hero choices that reflect our current population.”I’ve been thinking a lot about that girl, and what we owe her. I mean “we” collectively, the creators, the curators, the collection developers, the editors and publishers, the librarians and teachers. And not just those of us lucky enough to be in that room on June 26. All of us. Because we do owe her. She is the reason we are able to do what we do. Isn’t she?I’ve been thinking about the meaning of “audacity” too.I looked it up. In two different sources. The two primary definitions come down to this:1)  Boldness that is admirable2)  Boldness that is viewed as arrogant or insolentAnd I realized that while the call for more multicultural books is viewed through the lens of definition one, the critiques and challenges that demand the content within those books be authentic and culturally specific are too often viewed through the lens of definition two.We applaud and add our voices to the chorus. Yes, diversity matters!It doesn’t even feel audacious to say it anymore, although the work of getting it done surely is.But when critics dare to question some of the results, they speak and they write as a manifestation of definition one, but are often perceived as embodying definition two.There is something wrong with this. Not some small thing. Some huge thing that too often divides the very people children and teens rely on. Of course there is room for disagreement in critiques of children’s and young adult literature. But there isn’t  room for closed minds. Getting it right—in a single book, in publishing, in libraries and education--is not a proscription but a process, one that isn’t carried out with good intentions alone. There is so much to be gained when those of us who can’t speak from experience listen to those who can, and who do with admirable audacity. (Redundancy intentional.)  As he called out people to thank in his speech, Matt de la Peña acknowledged his editor and publisher, Jen Besser, saying, “Thank you for taking a chance on publishing this book and for fighting behind the scenes to keep CJ’s dialogue authentic.” He goes on to say, “You understood from the beginning that CJ would switch codes if he was at school. But he wasn’t at school. He was with his Nana on the bus.”Right there is an example of what I’m talking about. Besser understood and fought for authentic language. The fact that there was resistance that required a fight  is discouraging. The fact that CJ is a child so real I’m sure I’ve met him, even if I can’t quite recall where, is one encouraging end result of the battle. But my adult response to CJ is not the point. At all. What is  the point, and the joy, is that child readers and listeners recognize CJ as someone THEY might know; who recognize in his world the world they inhabit too in one way or another.Many of us are on a high from the award acceptance speeches we heard at ALA or have read or watched online since the conference. They offered moments that were thought-provoking, and at times transcendent. But will our resulting energized feelings and (renewed) commitment make a difference?Perhaps. But only if we understand that the voices of people of color and First/Native Nations as writers, as illustrators, as commentators and critics, are essential. And only if we listen openly, actively to what they say.We can’t just wear a button or promote a slogan. We have to take meaningful action every day.  Maybe that means finding your own allies in the sphere where you work and fighting to get those voices into libraries and classrooms, or into even into print. Maybe that means taking your limited budget and saying “I will” rather than “I can’t” when it comes to making some selection choices. Maybe it means finding the courage to say “this isn’t ok” when reviewing or evaluating books that reflect thinking that has always been racist even if you’re only coming to understand it now (even if it’s by an author you’ve always admired).  Maybe it means saying “I’m scared” but trying anyway--to listen, to learn, to be an ally.Jen Besser was an admirably audacious ally to an admirably audacious writer.  But most of us are not editors or writers. We are reviewers and librarians and teachers. How can we be audacious? How can more publishers be audacious, too?  Think about that. Think about what you can do. What you’re already doing. Is there room for more? Is there room for different? Because we need more. We need different. Not because there aren’t amazing books. But because we know--we all know--there aren’t enough of them.That girl who held out her arm for Matt de la Peña to sign needs to be seen now. She needs books now. And she is far from being alone.If you attended the ALA Annual conference in Orlando earlier this week, I hope you made it a point to attend the Coretta Scott King Award Breakfast on Sunday morning. I have been going to the CSK Breakfast since the mid-1980s, and it's become, without question, my favorite part of the entire conference.  The speeches are always inspiring, uplifting and eloquent, and are always a reminder of why we do the work we do getting books into the hands of children and teens.This year, Jason Reynolds gave two acceptance speeches, one for The Boy in the Black Suit and another for All-American Boys. Both were excellent, demonstrating his consummate genius with words. His second speech was brilliantly constructed as a poem, the text of which has been printed on the new Coretta Scott King Award blog. Reading the words is one thing, but actually hearing them spoken aloud by Jason Reynolds is another. His delivery was powerful and moving. Luckily, Pat Enciso had the foresight to record it with her video camera, and she has posted it, with Jason's knowledge and permission.Read the words and watch the video. And then get to work. Buy the CSK Award books and get them into the hands of young readers."},
{"title": "An open letter to Patrick Jones and VOYA Magazine", "date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2016", "text": "Dear Patrick,Image credit: Lisa NowlainBack in November, you contacted me to offer feedback on an article you would be submitting to VOYA. That article, in which you “think out loud” on the subject of writing characters of color as a White man, was included in the excellent June issue of the magazine (featuring pieces from a veritable who’s who of bloggers, authors and activists, including Debbie Reese, Edi Campbell, and Sarah Park Dahlen). Months later, after looking at your contribution with fresh eyes and with the help of guidance and education from my friends and allies, I can see that I utterly failed you. In retrospect, here are things I wish I’d thought to say to you then:Truly Listen to the voices of people of color and First/Native Nations (POC/FNN)--that part happens with the brain--reflection and thinking--not the ears. Start by reading the other articles in this issue, especially those by Debbie Reese and Edi Campbell, with an open mind to what you can learn rather than through the framework of what you already know.  For a limited time, anyone can read the entire issue for free here.Thank the people who gave you feedback, as it is hard work, and don’t disregard them.  The woman who asked why you didn't put fried chicken and watermelon in one of your books was asking you to consider that perhaps, rather than writing Black people’s humanity, you were only writing--and hoping to capitalize on--the stereotypes.  Be open to criticism as an opportunity to learn something, not a reason to defend yourself.Don’t turn to White people, including Reading While White (RWW), for approval or justification. That’s the easy way out and reinforces systemic, institutional racism. (For my part, I lost sight of the fact that the RWW bloggers are a team and I should have run your early drafts by the other contributors before responding to you.)Don’t reduce complex arguments to either/or. That certainly isn’t what Allie Jane Bruce did in the blog post you reference. It’s not about whether or not you have the “right” to write about POC/FNN; it’s about the responsibility that goes with writing what you choose (and it’s possible that if you take that responsibility seriously, you may discover you’ll choose to write about something different).Yes, we need more books about POC/FNN, but if that’s your reason for writing them, you are positioning yourself as White savior, no matter how genuinely well-intentioned you are.You write, “Teens will read accessible lit fic when they see their lives reflected in it” and go on to reference your own books as mirrors reflecting reality. But you, as a White writer, are not the person who can best reflect their reality, as your pre-readers’ feedback makes clear. I understand your struggle is genuine, yet yours is not the struggle that matters here. What matters are the struggles and the lives of readers hungry to see their truths authentically reflected in books. The very fact that you think of this as an issue that can be “settled” (when you conclude that, moving forward, “I’ll try to write the best book I can, reflecting the diversity around me, but it won’t have a POC as the main character until I’ve settled the issue in my mind”) tells me you are missing this point. And none of us should miss this point. As a White person, if at any point I decide I’ve figured things out when it comes to race and racism, that’s a pretty sure sign I’ve stopped listening. I want to listen, and learn, and be useful as we all struggle with these issues. I hope and trust that you do, too.As I look at the above list above I see that these are things that I need to do, too. Because while I didn’t make you write this piece, Patrick, I saw it, read it, and told you it was good to go. I am trying to stay quiet and listen to others and learn as much as I can from this experience so that I don’t make these same mistakes again. I feel absolutely sick knowing that something I did led to the publicity your article has created overshadowing the other contributors to this issue of VOYA. How can I now go forward to be a better “Ally for Diversity in Children’s Books,” as the RWW banner reads? By shutting my mouth and re-reading the Twitter commentary generated by this and especially those pieces in VOYA that are so worth celebrating. I didn’t come up with this list on my own, Patrick--this is really a list of things that I learned from reading and really listening to people of color, First/Native Nations people, and my co-bloggers at RWW.  I am grateful to them for educating me, and I thank them for their patience and generosity. I hope that you will join me in doing more and more real listening, Patrick.  Start by reading this excellent piece in Fusion, which cites Justina Ireland, Ellen Oh, and Hannah Gomez, among others.Speaking of the Fusion piece, I was pretty shocked at the reaction from VOYA Editor-in-Chief RoseMary Honnold. According to the article, Honnold wrote that those critical of your piece “need to read [your] article in the context of the entire issue.” I fail to see how this would suddenly make everything better, how it would make the inherent racism of your contribution more palatable. She spoke of your “many admirers and colleagues” and how you are “a highly respected member of the YA library community and the YA lit community,” apparently implying that this places you above criticism.I have a really hard time with this type of response to criticism; it shows a remarkable lack of empathy from someone in a place of power. I hope that Honnold has since read the many, many responses on social media, such as:So, Patrick and the VOYA editorial staff: are you listening? From one who played a part in this, I highly encourage you to open yourself up to the criticism that is rightfully coming your way, and own up to your mistakes.Sincerely,Sam Bloom"},
{"title": "Naming Names: Thunder Boy Jr.", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2016", "text": "I appreciated Thunder Boy Jr. by Sherman Alexie from my first read of it earlier this year. It made me laugh out loud even as I felt buoyed by the meaning this story would undoubtedly have for many children, but especially Native children. I also appreciated the review of Thunder Boy Jr. by Debbie Reese on the American Indians in Children’s Literature (AICL) blog.  It made me stop and think, and it helped me further my understanding of the broader contexts in which Thunder Boy Jr. exists and is shared. I like the book. I like the review. These two things are not mutually exclusive. Reading Thunder Boy Jr. is such a delight. It’s a well-crafted narrative with a distinct, childlike, emotionally honest voice, and full of good-hearted humor, all set against illustrations by Yuyi Morales that are playful, warm, and full of surprises. In her AICL review, Debbie Reese writes: Alexie's much-loved humor is front and center of this story. Because Thunder Boy's dad is a big man, his nickname is Big Thunder. The words \"Big Thunder\" are extra large and bold on the page, inviting readers to boom it out as they read it. That makes it all the more inviting as a read aloud. If his dad is Big Thunder, that means Thunder Boy's nickname is Little Thunder, and that is not ok with him:“That nickname makes me sound like a burp or a fart.” … I look at the illustration of the two kids [Thunder Boy and his little sister] and my heart goes right to my sister's grandchildren and memories of them playing and dancing together at my niece's wedding last week. I think they'll like this book very much. The review expresses appreciation for the book, but also asks questions about whether the fact that the author is Native (Alexie is Spokane) makes the fact that he has written what she also sees as a “Pan Indian” story alright. She states she doesn’t have an answer to that question. I confess this was my introduction to the term “Pan Indian.”  I realized it refers to a lack of cultural specificity that implies there is universal Indian identity rather than many distinct Native cultures. Now I have the term to name what I’ve so often seen and described to teachers and librarians when talking about evaluating books about Native peoples critically. I had not considered Thunder Boy Jr. in this context, because I knew Alexie is Spokane.  But nowhere in the picture book text itself or in an author’s note, the review points out, are Thunder Boy and his family (or Alexie himself) identified as being Spokane. In a follow-up post to her review, Debbie Reese writes about why she thinks Thunder Boy Jr. needs a note to readers—one that identifies the story’s cultural specificity and even provides specific information on Spokane naming traditions. She leads with an anecdote about someone on Twitter who wrote about having kids pick new names after reading the book, and then shares a worksheet her cousin’s child brought home from school last year—a worksheet in which the children were given information reinforcing broad stereotypes about Native peoples and their names before being invited to choose their own names. The underlying implication and takeaway of the worksheet, and, she’s concerned, of Thunder Boy Jr., for non-Natives is that all Native peoples and their naming traditions are the same. She notes that naming traditions are culturally specific, and for some cultures like her Pueblo one, names are conferred in private ceremonies. Activities like the worksheet her cousin’s son brought home not only strip Native cultures of their individual identities, but they reinforce stereotype after stereotype, along with decades if not centuries of cultural appropriation.  As I've noted, 100,000 copies of the book were published. I'm hoping that Little, Brown (the publisher) will include a Note in the next batch, providing a \"do not use this book as an activity for which kids pick a Native American name,\" an explanation for why that is not a respectful activity, and a bit of information about Native naming. If you've got a copy, or if you get one of the 100,000 copies, I hope the information I share here is helpful … Inevitable: Tweet from someone who read Alexie's Thunder Boy Jr. to kids and then did activity where kids picked their Indian names.Fact: Imagine being a Native kid in that class, who already has a name, given to them in ceremony, being asked to make up a new one.Question: Would it help adult readers NOT do that activity if there was a note inside the book about Native peoples and naming?A truth: A white teacher asking a Native kid to choose a new name harkens back to boarding schools where teachers asked Native kids to point to a blackboard to choose a new name.   I found myself thinking a lot about Thunder Boy Jr. and the broader context—the wider world—into which not books but children live and breathe and, we hope, thrive after reading Debbie Reese’s review and follow-up post. What she wrote didn’t change my appreciation for Alexie’s wonderful story, which it’s clear she also values. But it did expand my understanding and, I hope, critical thinking. Her willingness to ask questions that don’t have clear answers, and to share her perspective as it unfolds, and to teach as well as critique, is not only risky, but as remarkable in its own way as the lovely, lively, meaningful picture book about which she was writing."},
{"title": "What to do when \"nonfiction\" centers Whiteness?", "date": "Monday, May 23, 2016", "text": "The other day, I came across a copy of The House That George Built (by Suzanne Slade, illustrated by Rebecca Bond, Charlesbridge, 2012).A play on The House That Jack Built, the book features a sing-songy rhyme on the righthand side of each spread (“This is the lot / that grand, scenic spot, / for the President’s House that George built”) and a more detailed history of the President’s house’s conception, building, and completion on the left.  Painterly watercolors add to the book’s storybook-like feel.Not until more than halfway through does the book acknowledge that our White “Founding Fathers”--the ones who fought so gallantly for freedom--enslaved other human beings to create the President’s House.  And even that information is couched in bowdlerizing language: “By now over one hundred workers--free men and slaves--lived on the construction site in small, temporary huts.  They labored from sunrise till sunset, six long days a week.  But with presidential duties and the house, George worked seven.”  In the Author’s Note, the topic of enslaved people’s labor on the President’s House is similarly relegated to a small paragraph towards the end.  That’s it.I am accustomed to prettified versions of America’s history, but I lingered over this one (which somehow never showed up on my radar screen back in 2012).  Here’s why:  I cannot mentally square the care and precision the creators took to call the building the “President’s House” rather than the “White House” (it was not called “the White House” until the early 1900s) with the revisionist decision they made to frame the book around the idea that “George built” it.Why so careful to get the building’s name right, but so free to credit a slaver with having built it, when the only actual building that George participated in was pounding in some wooden stakes to mark the site?Accuracy is a big deal in anything labeled nonfiction.  I’ve been on enough award committees to know that even the slightest error can doom a book.  The author and editor were probably hyper-aware of this as they made the decision to consistently call the building the “President’s House”.  But what to do when accuracy isn’t the issue so much as White-centricity?  I can already hear the denizens of George-defenders telling me “but it was his project!  He envisioned the house, that’s what the authors meant, it’s supposed to be a metaphor!  Anyways, you have to consider the time--slavery was legal!”  OK, I get all that.  And, I also get that George’s point of view isn’t the only point of view from which we can look at this story.  Where’s The House That WE Built, told from the point of views of the enslaved Black people, free Black people, and immigrants who actually built the thing?I do see some promising signs of change.  More and more reviewers are naming a White-dominant narrative as a problem (Kirkus being a prime example), but we also need authors and editors to consider whether their narratives--particularly their “nonfiction” narratives--are White-centric.Consider, for example, Bold Riders: The Story of the Pony Express (by John Micklos, Capstone, 2015).Over and over, this pithy book presents First/Native Nations people as one of a series of obstacles the brave Pony Express riders needed to surmount:“The route crossed mountains, rivers, and deserts. Winter snowstorms and spring floods might prevent delivery.  Riders also needed to cross land claimed by many American Indian tribes.  Some of these tribes were warlike.  How could lone riders get through?” (p. 13)“Riders spent long hours in the saddle and faced many dangers.  They might get trampled by a herd of stampeding bison.  They might have to outrun hostile American Indians.  Even if all went smoothly, they finished their shifts stiff and sore from their hard rides.” (p. 19)“The brave Pony Express riders had many adventures and faced many dangers.  History shows that the Paiutes were at war with settlers and soldiers along the Pony Express route.  When riders said they had tangled with or escaped hostile Paiutes, they were likely telling the truth.  Sometimes they even had scars to show.  We also know that some riders lost their lives in the line of duty.” (p. 20)The p. 20 quote, in particular, intrigues and troubles me.  Micklos seems to know that something in this narrative is “off”, and is defending his White-centric narrative with “these are FACTS.”  But that’s a strawman argument.  I don’t think anyone would dispute that Paiute people fought White Pony Express riders.The problem is the way the narrative is framed and constructed in the first place.  Why were the Paiute people attacking?  Were they, in fact, attacking--or defending themselves?  Page 13 refers to land “claimed by many American Indian tribes,” but if the First/Native Nations people were there first, wouldn’t it be more accurate to say that the White people “claimed” that land?  Why are the First/Native Nations people described as “hostile” and “warlike”, while the White people are described as “soldiers”?  Why, for that matter, don’t we use the term “invaders” instead of “riders”?  Where are the narratives that are just as by-the-numbers accurate, but centered in non-White points of view?Don Tate’s Poet comes to mind, as does 1621: A New Look At Thanksgiving, and for teens, Howard Zinn’s Young People’s History.  I’d love more.  Leave them in the comments (and publishers, feel free to send us more of the real thing!).Ed. 6/19/2016: Alyssa Mito Pusey, Senior Editor at Charlesbridge and Editor of The House That George Built, responds via CBC Diversity.  In her post, Alyssa models what a productive, constructive dialogue can look like, and also bravely shares her own feelings:For me, it’s a nerve-racking time, in some ways. Authors and editors are being held to more rigorous standards, and I really don’t want to mess up. I certainly don’t want to incur the wrath of the blogosphere. More importantly, I don’t want to produce books that perpetuate racial stereotypes and white privilege, however unintentionally.My fears aside, this is also an exciting and empowering time. I feel like my eyes are being opened, like I’m learning and growing with every article and blog post—Allie’s included. I’m receiving and acquiring more biographies of people of color. I’m asking experts and other readers for honest feedback on questions of representation. And I’m trying with every book to be as inclusive as possible.I’ve got a long way to go, clearly. But I hope to keep on improving as an editor—and to do what I can to help publish nonfiction that accurately reflects our diverse world.Alyssa, a huge thank THANK YOU goes out to you from me and the whole RWW team.  I particularly admire how you make space for your own fears as well as the excitement and empowerment you're feeling, and how you phrase this as a \"yes, and\" rather than a \"yes, but\"--you're excited AND afraid, not excited BUT afraid.  This is a crucial distinction, and something I, as a white person, need to practice, as this type of thinking runs counter to white culture.  Again, thank you."},

I traveled to Chicago for BookExpo America (BEA) last week. One of the main reasons I went was SLJ’s Day of Dialogue on Wednesday. Check the link and you’ll see why; it was an amazing line-up of book people. But as wonderful as those authors and illustrators were (and are), the panels were overwhelmingly White. Yes, there was at least one person of color on each panel, but 20% (or less) representation isn’t enough. And the fact that there was not a single First/Native Nations panelist is unacceptable. Plus, the two keynote speakers and all four moderators were—you guessed it—White. Now, I’m honestly not sure how much of this is on SLJ and how much is dictated by the publishers, but I’m assuming that SLJ will work to do better if they have anything to say about it based on their commitment to cultural competency in their reviews.

{"title": "Free Choice Reading & Tokenism", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2016", "text": "Being in a public library, at this time of year all I can think is “summer reading,” and I know that for many it is the same.   Kids need to read during the summer; kids read when it’s fun; it’s fun when they get to choose their own reading.  But choosing their own reading really means just that; if a grownup is suggesting a book, it’s almost automatically tainted. So having a selection of books that kids can choose from is key.   Ergo: summer reading lists.What is in your summer reading list? Do you have one, or use one? What kind of choice does it offer readers? Last year Edith Campbell assembled a group of colleagues to create the We’re the People summer reading list.  Now in its second year, it gently suggests at the top of the website that you use it to “add to your summer reading list” books that are written, illustrated, and about people of color or First Nations/Native Americans.   However, I think it functions beautifully as a stand alone summer reading list in its entirety, and calls attention to the a “one of each” token representation that sadly still exists in many book lists out there.The title of this list recalls for me the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH)’s “We the People” Bookshelves that were promoted 2003-2011.  The program awarded sets of selected titles to public and school libraries; each year’s “classic” book collection was related to “a theme important to the nation's heritage. ...In addition to introducing young readers to good literature, the Bookshelf promotes understanding of abstract or general ideas through the power of particular stories.”  The first year’s list, on Courage, included Little House on the Prairie and The Matchlock Gun.  Debbie Reese posted a wonderful letter by Jean Mendoza in 2007 about continuing concerns with these booklists, asking that the “We the People” Bookshelf “get in synchrony with reality.”  Some of the final lists in the project showed slight improvement. Besides summer reading lists, many libraries offer free books in the summer, as outreach or incentive for summer reading programs.  My library offers a giveaway book as the prize to approximately 6000 children who read at least 20 days in the summer.  Buying enough paperbacks that will offer the right selection to any kid who stops in one of our 17 libraries is a challenge; we want to make sure that when they browse the prize bin, they feel they are being awarded a prize.   We buy most of these books from Scholastic’s Literacy Partnerships, the arm of the publishing giant through which providers who are giving away books to children can buy very cheap paperbacks.  Scholastic has always offered titles to serve a diverse community, though I still wince when I must seek out the word “multicultural” in the curated sets, and dodge over-used standards and problematic titles.  We don’t rely on Scholastic, as it also does not fully meet our demand for popular non-fiction and graphic novels.  At the same time that I sense its selection is improving, we continue to advocate for and secure funding to raise our price point per giveaway paperback, so that we can shift more of our purchases to other vendors. In its related arm Scholastic Reading Club (through which kids can purchase inexpensive paperbacks through their classroom), Scholastic’s We Have Diverse Books partnership with We Need Diverse Books resulted in a “Special Collection of More than 75 Diversity-Themed Books for Children” list, and there are plans for 8 such lists in the 2016-17 year.  It’s progress, I guess.  Still, I yearn for kids to have the choice wherever they look for a selection of recommended books that will inspire them to read for themselves, for fun, without having to seek the “special” section."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: A Tyranny of Petticoats", "date": "Tuesday, May 3, 2016", "text": "by Megan SchliesmanI like the concept of A Tyranny of Petticoats. This short story collection is subtitled “15 Stories of Belles, Bank Robbers & Other Badass Girls.” In her introduction, editor and contributor Jessica Spotswood writes: “I realized what I really wanted was to edit an anthology of stories about clever, interesting American girls throughout history written by clever, interesting (though not necessarily all American) women.” (p. x) What’s not to love? So yes, I like the concept, and in fact many of the stories, but I’m also struggling with how the theme is explored when it comes to racial and cultural diversity.My first moment of unease came a bit later in the introduction. Spotswood states: “I suggested that we think diversely in terms of geography, historical eras, and our heroines’ races, sexualities, religions, and opinions on all manner of things.” So far so good. Then she goes on, “America is a melting pot. I hoped our fifteen stories could, in some small way, reflect that reality.” (p. xi) The Tyranny of Metaphor While there have been both critics and defenders of the term “melting pot” (and alternates, such as “salad bowl,” that have received some traction), reading it here was a disappointment. I understand the good intentions in using it, but  America—in present and in the past—is a place of vibrant diversity and complicated realities surrounding that diversity, and I think readers deserve explicit acknowledgment of this. “Melting pot” doesn’t begin to cover it.But, ok. Melting pot. There are fifteen stories in A Tyranny of Petticoats. Eight of the stories feature characters of color: five about African Americans, one about a Chinese American, one about Latinas, and one about a character referenced as “brown” with no development of this aspect of her identity. A ninth story is about a character who is Inuit. So, at first glance, promising when it comes to racial and ethnic diversity. And yet, of the fifteen writers contributing to A Tyranny of Petticoats, only four of them, from what I’ve been able to determine, are women of color, and none of the contributors are from First/Native Nations. This is not nearly as diverse as I was hoping given the stated intent to reflect diversity. And while I don’t want to negate the diversity of voices that contributed to A Tyranny of Petticoats, the resulting diversity of stories across the collection was a strange, and at times unsettling mix. Kekla Magoon, who is African American, wrote about an African American teen in “Pulse of the Panthers.” The other three contributors of color are of Asian Pacific heritage. Marie Lu wrote the story about the Inuit girl in Alaska. Caroline Tung Richmond and Y.S. Lee both wrote stories about White protagonists. The three remaining stories about the African Americans, the one story about the young woman who is “brown,” the one story about the Latinas, and the one story about the Chinese American, were all written by White authors. Of these, the story about the Latinas, the story about the Chinese American, and one of the stories about an African American (along with one story about a White character written by a White author) have supernatural/mystical elements. The story about the Native Alaskan has a spiritual element. Let me be more specific:  The one representation of Latino culture in this anthology is a story about the three fates who are living out their current lives as three Mexican American sisters; the one representation of Chinese American culture is a girl who can see ghosts and commune with spirits; the opening story about an African American young woman who escaped enslavement with her father and is part of a pirate ship crew ends with her becoming a ghost of the sea; and the one representation of First/Native Nations cultures is an Inuit girl who saves herself from violent White traders with her own grit and some guidance from the Seal King. One of These Things Is Not Like the Other If I were reading an anthology of the extraordinary that goes beyond courage, grit, and fortitude—one in which mysticism, the supernatural, and perhaps spirituality were a clearly stated scope of the collection—I wouldn’t have been as unsettled, especially if that collection were broadly diverse in intent and specifically diverse in execution, and clarified its scope in terms of both spiritual beliefs and the fantastic (which are two very separate things). In such a collection, any representation of culture would, by nature of the overarching theme, be expected to include something supernatural or otherworldly and perhaps spiritual. I think of the marvelous collection Diverse Energies published by Tu Books/Lee & Low. It was intentionally diverse science fiction and fantasy and it felt (although I have no doubt it wasn’t) effortless. But this is framed and clearly stated as historical fiction, and the inclusion of stories with supernatural, if not spiritual, elements was a strange choice to me. Surely there are plenty of “badass girls” who can be imagined throughout and across U.S. history and authentically grounded in a variety of cultures without resorting to the fantastic. What am I to make of these stories? Are they grounded in any authentic cultural beliefs, or simply spun from their authors’ imaginations?  The same is true of the spiritual element in the Inuit story—is this drawn from cultural beliefs, or the author’s imagination? If it is “authentic,” there is also the question, as Debbie Reese recently noted, of whether it is in fact religious and whether including it might be considered sacrilegious.  There is an author’s note following each story and as a general rule they reveal the thought and inspiration that went into the tales. Following “El Destinos” [sic] Lesley Walton writes, “”I always found mythology to be a delicious combination of magic and humanity….I thought of all those times when one’s cultural and national identity seemed at odds, and I wondered what might it be like to be divine and yet, at the same time utterly human….suddenly I had Valeria, Rosa, and Maria Elana, three immortals sent down to live as Mexican American sisters during the years after the Texas annexation” (p. 83).  Marissa Meyer’s note for “Gold in the Roots of Grass” talks about her fascination with western history and the gold rush, and her joy in doing research, but gives no mention to the Chinese American content of the story (p. 185). In her note following “The Journey” Marie Lu writes of loving Julie of the Wolves and of researching Alaska, loving “the blurred line between history and Inuit folklore….the facts already feel magical” (p. 41). J. Anderson Coats writes of the Mother Carey legend that is part of the opening story, “Mother Carey’s Table,” and of the fact that “about 25 percent of sailors on pirate or privateer vessels were people of color” (p. 19). One of the first things I pay attention to in any anthology is the diversity of contributors, whether or not diversity is in any way the point of the collection. If it lacks racial diversity, I’m more than just disappointed. I’m angry. Because to my mind, from where I’m standing in the twenty-first century, the creators of that anthology failed a major requirement in executing their vision, whatever that vision was. They have failed their vision and they have failed readers. I say this even if I read and like the stories or poems included. The failure for me in A Tyranny of Petticoats is less clear-cut. There are marvelous stories in this collection, including Magoon’s “Pulse of the Panthers,” about an African American teen living in rural California whose view of the world expands when her family hosts a group of Black Panthers from Oakland in 1967; Y.S. Lee’s “The Legendary Garrett Girls,” about two White sisters tending bar and taking no crap on the Alaskan frontier in 1898; and “Pearls” by Beth Revis, in which a young White woman escapes Chicago and an unwanted marriage, finding independence and community both on the Wyoming frontier in 1876.  Two stories, “City of Angels” by Lindsay Smith, set in 1945 Los Angeles (featuring the character with “brown” skin), and “The Whole World Is Watching” by Robin Talley, set in Chicago during the 1968 Democratic convention and featuring an African American woman, have main characters who are lesbian.Again, I don’t want to negate the diversity that exists in this collection. And I’m not suggesting that the answer to “Who can write what?” is to simply “Write what you know” because what a writer knows is not necessarily so easily defined nor is it static. But this anthology definitely fell short for me by not ensuring a broader range of diversity among the contributors. I think this contributed to serious gaps between idea and execution, particularly when it comes to the inclusion of the supernatural in half of the stories that are racially diverse. This is true regardless of the fact that I enjoyed many of the individual stories as pieces of fiction. This misplaced, mistaken exoticism in an anthology of historical fiction feeds into broader cultural stereotypes, and that is something I’m sure was never the intent of this anthology, or of the individual writers. But the “magical” person of color and the “spiritual” Native are, indeed, the dominant representation of racial and cultural diversity here.There is a a second volume in the works, The Radical Element: A Tyranny of Petticoats 2. There are some wonderful authors already contributing--I hope even more diverse voices will be included. It is stated as being a mix of fact, fiction, and fantasy. I’ll also be curious to see how well those combined elements and the writers serve the stated theme of \"young woman throughout history whose voices have been ignored too long.\""},
{"title": "Why Host An African American Read-In?", "date": "Tuesday, April 26, 2016", "text": "Two years ago through my awesome professional learning network on Twitter, particularly thanks to Ebony Elizabeth Thomas, I found out about the National African American Read-In.  This event is sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) and the Black Caucus of the NCTE and has been held since 1989. You can find out more on the NCTE’s African American Read-In site. The more I read and researched about the Read-In, the more convinced I became that I needed to host one at my library!And yet I knew that when someone thought of my small town (population around 17,000 - but that’s being very generous, really) they might ask themselves why I felt an event like this was a perfect fit for my patrons.  According to the 2014 census the African American population of my small mountain town in New Mexico is .07%. For New Mexico as a whole, the African American population is 2.5%. That, of course, was exactly why I thought it was a perfect fit. It is White people’s racism that makes us think African American literature is only for African Americans.  By that same account, it is our work as White people to dismantle this misconception.  No one assumes only White people will want to read Shakespeare or, say, Emily Dickinson.  We are taught those works are universal, they are for everyone. But too often, racism tells us that books by Native people or POC are only for the members of those groups.  We conveniently forget the windows element of “doors and windows” and assume that means minority groups have windows into the White experience. The African American Read-In was the perfect chance for my libraries to open some windows.  And to share some great books - of course. For one week, we designed all our programs for 0-5 around books and songs by African American artists and writers.  We sang and danced to Ella Jenkins songs and read Langston Hughes poems at Toddler Time.  After school, we lined the spaces of our reading circle with books by African American authors and read picture books by Jacqueline Woodson and N Joy out loud. In the second year of our celebration, three local AP English classes visited from the high school and spent an hour reading picture books.  We designed a program for our homeschool book club around Faith Ringgold’s Tar Beach. Because I had a clear vision of how I wanted these programs to happen, getting staff buy-in wasn’t really hard.  Instead of vaguely hand-waving “let’s do something for Black History Month, I guess?” the African American Read-In gave staff some real direction and a framework. From there, it was easier to see why we were doing this - and measure impacts.In each of these programs, we talked to patrons about the African American Read-In and we shared bookmarks we’d downloaded from the NCTE toolkit.  We always had piles of books (for all ages) by African American authors and illustrators on hand and encouraged them to check them out or even just browse through them. One thing I trained my staff on in preparation for these events was that we wanted to be deliberate about these programs.  I didn’t want to present it as an incidental program - I wanted patrons to understand that planning and thought had gone into these events, that our library was choosing to promote and spotlight this work. I agree that we, as White Librarians, need to do more than just talk about and use these books during Black History Month.  But I also love that the African American Read-In takes place in February.  It’s a way to do more than make a display but to put the titles in hands and in action. Every time we saw how children laughed or were entranced by this work, it was a reminder that these books are for everyone during every month of the year. Using them, programming around them, thoughtfully choosing them, watching patrons embrace them made a much stronger impact and meant so much more than just putting them out with a “It’s February, You Know The Drill!” sign. This year, during one of the AP English classes sessions, a particularly intense boy suddenly started waving his hand around, calling me over.  It was such an elementary school gesture for a senior in high school to make, it made me smile.  When I walked over to him, he had two books spread out in front of him, a juvenile non-fiction book and picture book.  “Look,” he whispered, gesturing at them both insistently, “they are both about - about - Gullah.” He was especially proud that he had made this connection and he was grinning at me.I realized this very smart almost 18 year old boy had never heard of Gullah before.  “Yes,” I said.  “Gullah is a language and a group of people.” He was nodding but had already looked away and was reading the notes in the books.  He mostly, I think, just wanted to show me what he’d found.  He was already back to the books.This encounter is why I knew the African American Read-In was valuable, essential even, to my patrons.  Windows matter.  So do White librarians unequivocally standing up for the concept that these books deserve a place in our collection and our programming because they are relevant, useful, and even joyful for everyone. Promoting and programming for the African American Read-In has been eye-opening for patrons and staff, which was another goal.  It’s on White librarians to start the progress and push forward on the idea that books by African American authors, any by Native writers and other writers of color, are for all our patrons: no matter where we’re located.The African American Read-In was our first push forward at my library, but it won’t be our last.  I urge you to look at your community connections and your programs and see how you can participate in the African American Read-In next year.  It’s not too early to start planning now. Here's some pictures from our Read-Ins!"},
{"title": "Hannah and Allie Talk Jewishness and Whiteness", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2016", "text": "Guest Blogger Hannah Gomez and Allie Jane Bruce. Thanks Lisa Nowlain for the images!Allie:  Today we're joined by Hannah Gomez, a librarian, reviewer, WNDBer, blogger, and Deep Thinker.  Hannah, thank you so much for joining us for a conversation on Jewishness and Whiteness and how they intersect (or don’t) here at Reading While White.  We’re all so grateful.  And while this is a me-and-you conversation, I want to name at the outset that Sam is also Jewish--I’m not “the one” Jew on this crew!I just started reading How Jews Became White Folks & What That Says About Race in America by Karen Brodkin.  I barely finished the Introduction, and already I’m like YES.  On p. 3, she differentiates between “ethnoracial assignment” and “ethnoracial identity”--the difference (if there is one) between how the world sees us, and how we see ourselves.  So here’s my question for you: How do these two concepts manifest in your life?Hannah:  Oh wow! I love new terms like that. I definitely think about that a lot, and how concerned I get when people misuse “race” and “ethnicity” as if they’re interchangeable (like how people seem uncomfortable with the word “sex” and use “gender,” even though those, too, are not the same!). Race is what you are, and it’s the biological* thing that you can’t shake - unless you have a LOT of money, you can’t really alter your appearance significantly enough. Ethnicity, though, is culturally based, and it can be chosen or rejected, held onto or forgotten. So I think Brodkin’s terms are similar.I was adopted, so I can’t speak to all my family tree, but from what I know, I am not genetically descended from any branch of Jews. That said, I was raised by an Ashkenazi Jew as a Jew, and as such my ethnic and cultural upbringing were tied to American Ashkenazi culture--at least from my mom’s side. That being said, when I spout out the Yiddish terms that are 100% natural things to come out of my mouth, people find that jarring, because while my racial identity is technically biracial (half Black, half White), I am no Nella Larsen. I can’t pass, so what people see when they look at me is not all that I am. So my ethnoracial assignment, I guess, is Black, mixed, or of color - and in the US, I am assumed to be African American, at least by White and Black people. Latinx people, especially if they hear me speak Spanish, ask if I’m Cuban, Dominican, or something else Caribbean. My ethnoracial identity, though, has more pieces to it, and I didn’t grow up a part of a large African American community. I grew up in Tucson, and my father is Chicano, so my social surroundings were definitely more Chicana/o and Jewish than anything else.I think that’s why I often get, especially from Jewish friends, the “compliment” that “Sometimes I forget you’re Black, because you’re just Hannah to me.”*I know race is commonly described as not biological at all, and a total construction, but that’s a derailment used to excuse racism. Race is real because society made it so, and when I say here that it’s biological, I mean it’s the thing that, for the most part, manifests in your genes with regard to appearance.Allie:  Yikes.  I’m so sorry.  The density of insults-per-words is ridiculously high there--you’ve got “Being Black is bad,” “I’m going to casually erase a crucial component of your identity,” and “I deserve a medal for having said the previous two things.”My mom’s side is Jewish (Ashkenazi, reform) too, but it was a much bigger part of her childhood than it ever was mine.  We did Christmas and Chanukah, Easter and Passover, and I remember eating apples and honey on Rosh Hashana, but that was pretty much it.  She definitely brought some cultural elements into the mix, though; she still has a compulsive need to feed people at every moment.  I refused to try lox over and over as a kid, bewildered as to how anything so bright and slimy could possibly taste good.  When I finally tried it as a teenager, something very deep in my gut said “this is RIGHT,” and I’ve been eating lox ever since.I did a brief volunteer stint in Jackson, Mississippi, at an after-school program, and while I was there I felt a deep homesickness that often expressed itself as a longing for lox, which was not readily available.  Once, I drove half an hour to the one bagel place that advertised itself as having lox.  I was so excited--it was right there on the menu, “lox and bagel.”  I ordered it, repeating myself twice (the girl at the counter had never heard anyone order it before), and waited to savor it… only when it came, it was a bagel with veggie cream cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a piece of lox.  I was so upset.  I traded it in for the right combination: bagel, plain schmear, tomato, onion, and lox (they didn’t have capers), totally aware that I was probably fulfilling a stereotype as I insisted that veggie cream cheese and lettuce simply would not work.I had a lot of interesting experiences in Mississippi, actually.  I was one of a few White volunteers at an after-school program that was 100% Black kids.  The kids were totally stunned when I revealed I was half Jewish.  When I left, a small group came to me and said “Miss Bruce, are you going back to Egypt?”  That’s a sharp contrast to here in New York, where everyone takes one glance at me and immediately knows I’m Jewish.  In retrospect (and with education) I’ve realized that I had no business being at that program in Mississippi; I would have served the world better by spending those months unpacking my own Whiteness.Hannah: I refused to eat lox for the longest time, too! And I still won’t go near gefülte fish.Allie: Me too!  I hate the stuff.  And the maror (bitter herbs) we have to eat on Passover.  I was usually the youngest at Seders, and I always wanted to ask, “Why on this night do I have to eat these damn herbs when I could be eating jellybeans?”Hannah: Your point about unpacking your privilege only after performing some sort of community service or other “service” to the underprivileged speaks to me, too. I worked with low-income kids in a summer school program when I was done with college (and before, but in different settings) and didn’t realize until after I was done what a disservice I did them by assuming they all had internet access at home, interest in applying to fancy colleges, etc.In my family, where my dad is Catholic, my mom is the Ashkenazi one but was raised a secular Jew, so we did the Christmas and Hanukkah thing, took off of school and work for Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, and had a (speedy) Passover seder. In college, I attempted to become more Jewish and even had a fellowship at Hillel and a Birthright trip, and looking back, I realize that it wasn’t really that I wanted to explore religion and theology but just that I was desperate to be accepted as a Real Jew since I couldn’t rely on “looking Jewish.” And I hated that whole year of college where I tried to do that. Now, although I went to Shabbat services with a friend once a month or so (she was converting, and I just wanted to try it out again) last year, I really find that secular Judaism, intellectual Judaism, and cultural Judaism are the only Jewish domains where I actually feel welcome and like my contributions, upbringing, and past experiences are valued without question. I work a few hours a week for our branch of PJ Library/PJ Our Way, and as a college student (prior to Hillel), I interned at our Jewish Federation. Whether I want to try religious Judaism or not, I am generally finding that the stares I get for not looking right, even to other Ashkenazi Jews, makes it not worth the hassle.Allie: And that’s where we get into all this thorny business of race and Judaism and “looking Jewish.”  It’s so bizarre.  You are more educated in Judaism than I, and you’ve spent much more of your life practicing Judaism than I have.  And yet, I’ll bet if we stood next to each other and asked 10 people “which of us is Jewish?” 9 of them would point to me.  I have the complexion (light but tan skin coupled with dark hair) and especially the (dark, thick, curly) hair of a prototypical Ashkenazi Jewish person.I’ve lived outside DC, in the midwest, in London, and in Mississippi, and I’ve never felt more Jewish than I do now--living in New York.  Everywhere else, I was another White person.  Here, I’m (often) a Jewish White person.  I’ve never had this experience before--I present as White AND as Jewish.  The one does not cancel the other out.And here’s an interesting thing we share: The most hurtful experiences I’ve had that relate to my Judaism have come from other Jewish people, and it sounds like that’s true for you too (the ones who stare, or who’ll never really accept you as Jewish because of your Blackness).  For me, it’s the ones who call me a “fake Jew” or a “self-hating Jew” or “the wrong kind of Jew.”  Six days after I moved to New York, I went for a haircut, and the hairdresser (with whom I’d exchanged maybe 2 sentences) ran his fingers through my hair and proclaimed it to be “nice, thick, BEAUTIFUL Jewish hair!”  It’s hard to hear myself called a fake Jew after an experience like that.Hannah: There are parallels here with skin tone politics and intragroup racism in the Black community too, but that’s a post for another time and another blog…I guess what I’ll end with is that every time I look at it, I still come to the conclusion that I feel Jewish and am Jewish, and especially that my politics and ethics and intellect are Jewish, so I can’t not be Jewish. But I still haven’t found a way to be a part of a Jewish community (at least IRL; I have found like-minded internet friends and websites) where I don’t feel like I have to either perform or do a lot of catchup work to understand what’s going on. I don’t know that I’ll ever feel any differently given the many different spaces I’ve tried to enter and then left, but I certainly hope I will someday.Allie: Thanks again for this conversation, Hannah.  Let's continue it in the comments section.  Have a wonderful Passover!!Sarah Hannah Gómez is a former school librarian and currently works as a freelance writer and editor, fitness instructor, and project leader at We Need Diverse Books.

{"title": "Reviewing While White: Unidentified Suburban Object", "date": "Tuesday, April 5, 2016", "text": "By Nina LindsaySpoiler alert.  There is no way to discuss Mike Jung’s second novel here without fully revealing the twist that the industry reviews manage to dance around.  So here we go. Now in seventh grade, Chloe Cho is pretty fed up with the microaggressions that result from being the only Korean American (even Asian American) in her school.  To add to the annoyance of constant comparison to famous violinist Abigail Yang, and ridiculous mispronunciations of her name, her parents ever more firmly refuse to discuss anything about their life in Korea, while her best friend, Shelley, seems to go overboard in helping Chloe explore her roots.  When a new teacher, Ms. Lee, becomes the second Korean American in the school, and assigns a project to explore family history, Chloe finally succeeds in pressing her parents for their story, and it is not quite what she expected.  Her parents, it turns out, are not only not from the United States. They are not from planet Earth. The only known survivors from Tau Ceti Four, her parents escaped destruction in an experimental spacecraft her mother was developing.  Because of their very close physical resemblance to Koreans, they tried first to settle in Korea, but quickly found they stood out there too much because they “did it all wrong, everything from speaking the language to finishing a bowl of noodles. It was very, very uncomfortable” (p. 146).  So they found safety in a place where people don’t know any better: Primrose Heights, a super-white suburb somewhere in the United States.  Chloe’s father assures her that despite “all the stupid crap” she has to listen to, the alternative is worse. To this Chloe responds, “What’s worse than being surrounded by racists all the time?” (p.148-9)Jung is very, very funny.  It’s this humor that allows him to explore the intersections of cultural and individual identity, friendship, and being thirteen with immense clarity through an unusual conceit. It’s when the twist happens, when we enter the surreal, that the emotional narrative starts to feel more real.  It may be, in fact, that White readers have more access to empathize with Chloe through this preposterous lens, since it seems so hard for us to otherwise see racism. A few weeks ago, the Library of Congress announced that it would stop using the term “illegal alien” in subject headings.  It is great news, but tempered by the fact that the replacement phrases are negatives: “noncitizens” and “unauthorized immigration.”   Sometimes seventh-grade humor seems to best way to expose, live with, and struggle against this kind of absurdity.  Chloe does, as she returns to school with her new knowledge about herself, on page 153:I trudged into the building and stopped at the trophy case next to the main office. If you stand at just the right angle you can see your reflection in the glass on the side closest to the front door, and I stared at myself. Kids’ faces appeared over my shoulder, some of them looking at me curiously, then were replaced by others. None of those faces looked like mine, of course. None of them ever had. That wasn’t anything new--people were always treating me like I was from outer space, and I’d never looked like everyone else, no matter how I acted or what I wore. Were things actually all that different now?I can imagine a myriad of reader responses to Jung’s novel, including disquiet or discomfort, but Jung seems to make a safe place to explore them through his use of fantasy or surreality or absurdity ….or whatever it is you want to call this singular story."},
{"title": "The Inaugural Walter Dean Myers Awards", "date": "Monday, March 21, 2016", "text": "The Walter Award winner. L to R: Brendan Kiely, Jason Reynolds,Kekla Magoon, Ilyasah Shabazz, Margarita Engle.On Friday morning, We Need Diverse Books (WNDB) presented the inaugural Walter Dean Myers Awards for Outstanding Children’s Literature at the Library of Congress.  The Walter (as it is often called) was awarded to Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely for All American Boys. Two Walter Honor Books were named: Enchanted Air by Margarita Engle; and X: A Novel by Ilyasah Shabazz and Kekla Magoon.WNDB President Ellen OhEllen Oh, President and CEO of WNDB, spoke briefly about the award and the gorgeous setting for the ceremony, noting, “We walk in the footsteps of giants, many of whom are in this room.” Author Jon Scieszka, the first-ever National Ambassador for Young People’s Literature, spoke about his memories of Walter Dean Myers, noting: \"Walter could do the talk, if he had to, but he was really a doer.\" He then turned the program over to host Christopher Myers, the award namesake’s son and a multi award-winning author/illustrator himself, who spoke about the various fights involved in creating children's literature that reflects our world.  \"We are fighters here, and this is where the fight happens: In an exchange of ideas,\" said Myers.Walter Honor recipient Margarita EngleIn her acceptance speech, Margarita Engle said, “Being misunderstood is a writer’s greatest nightmare. And to be understood is a dream.” After reading a poem from Enchanted Air, Engle spoke about the historically tense relationship between the US and Cuba, noting, “When I was a student, it was easier for a US citizen to walk on the moon than to visit Cuba... I hope [Enchanted Air] will not just speak to Latinos... but also to readers from other backgrounds who might feel like a bridge or a storm for any reason.”Walter Honor recipient Ilyasah ShabazzKekla Magoon shared a question that she and Ilyasah Shabazz have frequently been asked: With The Autobiography of Malcolm X being widely read, why do we need a book about the first 14 years of the Civil Rights activist’s life? As Magoon said, even when things are bad, young people have the power to make a change in their lives, a capacity that Malcolm X exemplifies. As Magoon and Shabazz were set to receive their awards, Shabazz returned to the microphone and delivered one of the day’s most powerful statements, directed at adults who work with children: “When young people are in pain, they don’t always make the best decisions. That’s what happened to my father and that’s why we need adults to see the beauty in, and invest in, our kids.”In his acceptance, Brendan Kiely called for change, both in the world of children's literature and in the larger world.  \"This is one of the most dangerously powerful aspects of privilege--the privilege to look away, to choose NOT to engage.  Just as the statistics clearly expose the injustice in the world of law enforcement, the numbers are starkly apparent in book publishing, too.  We need a more diverse workforce, a more diverse array of book reviewers and books reviewed, and a much larger pool of diverse authors getting published regularly.\"Jason Reynolds added, \"We need stories that appeal to the diversity inside us.  I am not a monolith.\"Walter Award winners Brendan Kiely andJason Reynolds read Bad Boy by Walter Dean Myers.\"The most exciting thing about The Walter Awards,\" said Chris Myers, \"is that we get to define what is is we're looking for.  It's nice to define our own standards, to have a hand in creating our own Canon.\"-by Sam Bloom and Allie Jane Bruce"},
{"title": "The Long Haul", "date": "Tuesday, March 8, 2016", "text": "Image by Lisa NowlainIt’s 2016. It’s 2016 and the increased attention given to discussion of multicultural literature, race, and racism in children’s and young adult literature over the past two years, including the launch and ongoing work of We Need Diverse Books (which looks at all aspects of diversity), and important if sometimes painful discussions of books like A Fine Dessert and A Birthday Cake for George Washington, among others, feels like a turning point of some kind.  Maybe it’s social media and the internet, which has enabled the discussion to extend farther within and beyond the world of children’s and young adult books. Maybe it’s that we’re starting to see effort to create tangible and meaningful change to the status quo. School Library Journal’s commitment diversifying its reviewers is one example of this. So, too, is its launch of Indie Voices, a quarterly review of self-published books reflecting diversity, which builds on the important work of author, activist, and scholar Zetta Elliott, who has been calling attention to the possibilities and importance of self-publishing for some time. And yet this increased visibility comes with an increased sense of resentment, sometimes vague, sometimes overt. Why are activists calling for changes and challenging racism in children’s and young adult literature so demanding, so radical, so angry, so sensitive, so unwilling to give kids credit? And why can’t we understand that change takes time? I want to talk about that one in particular.  That change takes time. It’s true. Change does take time. But it’s 2016. And as we look at recent, welcome examples of change and progress, it’s important to understand and remember that this work—to get more books published that authentically reflect the diverse lives of children and teens, to get those in the children’s and young adult book world who are gatekeepers in one way or another to do something that is not only meaningful but lasting—has been going on for a long time.  A very long time.  Many people reading this blog know that. They know it because they’ve been part of the effort for years. Sometimes decades.  But not everyone knows—or acknowledges—that everything happening today, right now, has grown out of activism that stretches back years. Not a few years. Not ten or twenty. Not even fifty. Nancy Larrick’s 1965 Saturday Review article “The All-White World of Children’s Books” wasn’t the starting point, either. Everything happening today is part of an ongoing effort that spans at least ninety years. Think of Pura Belpré, reaching out to the immigrant communities in New York City in the 1920s, and eventually writing books reflective of her Puerto Rican culture, which many of them shared. Think of Augusta Baker and Charlamae Hill Rollins, both advocating for collections reflecting diversity and the lives of children and teens in the mid-twentieth century. This foundational work took place long before the Larrick article, which articulated a reality with which families of color and First/Native Nations had been aware for years and years.  In 1980, the now-defunct Council on Interracial Books for Children published a checklist for evaluating books for racism and sexism. It was published in their Bulletin and has been reprinted and republished in print and online over the past 36 years. Many others have offered culturally-specific insight into racism in children’s books.  And yet stereotypes and racism persist, not occasionally, but consistently. Add to all of this the numerous books and articles that have been written—and continue to be written—by scholars, librarians, and teachers, not to mention the commitment of activist authors, artists and publishers (Children’s Book Press, Just Us Books, and Lee and Low, to name a few) across more recent decades, and a detailed picture begins to develop of a struggle for change that has more than paid its dues. And sure, we can point to progress, but when we're having some of the same discussions and conversations and arguments we were having ten and twenty and thirty and fifty and more years ago, we can also point to systemic and, yes, willful resistance to change. Yes, change takes time. But the long haul has already happened, and there is still so far to go. That’s maddening, to say the least. If you want a refresher, or want to learn more, about the history of activism around multicultural literature, here are some people and efforts to start reading about (please add your own suggestions in the comments):  Augusta Baker Pura BelpréRudine Sims BishopCouncil on Interracial Books for ChildrenDaniel DuranViolet HarrisCoretta Scott King Task ForceDebbie ReeseCharlamae Hill RollinsBarbara RollockIsabel SchonDoris Seale and Beverly SlapinAnd the \"Kindred Spirits,\" listed to the right, are among many who are ensuring the work continues.Finally, when people of color and First/Native Nations and allies demand more multicultural books, and authentic multicultural books, when they call out racism when they see it, they are doing more than advocating for books, they are advocating for the lives of children and teens. None of us should ever forget that. (Check out the We Need Diverse Books “Looking Back” series for more history.)"},
{"title": "\"The All-Too-Familiar Fog of White Authenticating\"", "date": "Tuesday, March 1, 2016", "text": "Thank you to Lisa Nowlain for our new blogger portraits!A couple weeks ago I presented online to a class at San Jose State University's SLIS program.  The class was Info 263, \"Materials for Children,\" taught by Elizabeth Wrenn-Estes, who asked me to speak to our work on this blog, and my approaches to critical analysis of children's literature. There were a few late questions that I didn't have time to answer, and rather than write an email back to the class, I thought I'd try to answer them here.  Some of you may be able to add other thoughts, and I'm hoping some of the class might continue the discussion.Nina, since so many book reviewers are white, do you think that books written by non-whites will get the same chance at a good review as white authors?Statistically, in reality? No. Because white people don't \"get\" everything in stories by people of color or First Nations/Native people.  I've learned so much from people taking the trouble to point out some very obvious things to me.  For instance, long ago I presented an oral review (thank goodness I hadn't published it) in which I complained the pacing was \"off\" in a picture book because the protagonist, on a journey, encountered four strangers, and it felt like one beat to many to me.  Someone graciously pointed out to me that in many cultures, things in stories happen in \"fours\" instead of the \"threes\" of most European traditions. Malinda Lo went into this from the writer's point of view last month on Twitter. She said \"If you don't explain the context for non-Asian readers they won't get it. But if you over-explain you lose the storytelling tension.\" Numerous reactions prompted her to expand: [View the story \"Malinda Lo on reactions to her post:\" on Storify]Nina, how big of an impact do book reviewers have and do you think that a reviewer’s race has a large impact on what books get more publicity and recognition? Do you think that reviewers try to separate themselves from the race they identify with and look at the big picture when reviewing?Getting any reviews at all definitely has an impact on selling book.  Even a negative review can help sell a book over no reviews at all, though of course it doesn't serve a book as well as a positive review. Given my thoughts about the first question above, I certainly think that the race and background of reviewers, as a whole, has a large impact on the recognition of books. On an individual case, theoretically, if we can each hold ourselves individually accountable to reading with an full understanding of our biases, it shouldn't.  But I think it has an exponential impact as you look at the entire publishing output.  If, collectively, we can gain momentum on our individual accountability, we should be able to shift that overall impact. Kirkus Reviews and School Library Journal are clearly making strides to hold themselves and reviewers accountable, especially since Lee & Low started collecting survey data for the Diversity Baseline Study. So how do you celebrate diversity without normalizing whiteness?In the example I gave above about my cluelessness with a review, I was normalizing Whiteness; assuming that my knowledge as a White person was not based in any cultural or racial context, but was somehow \"normal.\"  When you read for analysis, you should try to locate yourself...your own person with your own perspective...within your mind, and observe yourself reading and reacting to a text.  If you are White, you should examine that reaction and assume that not everyone experiences it that way.  \"It's not all about you,\" is a mantra that works for me.  I do think that normalizing Whiteness has gotten in the way of appreciations of many books by people of color.  It's hard to prove, but I feel like I've seen it enough, in Mock Newbery discussions, for instance, when a mostly White group starts comparing one excellent book with another.  Inevitably, some people \"just feel\" that Excellent Book A (by a White person) does \"more\" for them than Excellent Book B (by a person of color).  It probably does; and that's not the point. This has dangerous repercussions not just for the immediate reception to a book in its publishing year, but on what standards are set in the literature in general. Since my post on Jump Back Paul by Sally Derby, I've been reading more about Paul Laurence Dunbar.   Poet Kevin Young writes about him in his prize-winning collection of essays The Grey Album: On the Blackness of Blackness (Graywolf Press, 2012).  He talks of the famous review by White \"tastemaker\" William Dean Howells, which secured Dunbar's success in the White literary establishment.  This review praised Dunbar's dialect poems in a very particular way remains today the most accessible interpretation, repercussions of which can still be seen in Sally Derby's book, for instance, despite the fact that Black writers, like Young, have been offering alternative interpretations for decades. Young says \"Howells's simple if not simplistic review is still appended to most editions of Dunbar, making it impossible to get to Dunbar without the all-too-familiar fog of white authenticating.\" Or, as students in the Oakland schools African American Male Achievement classes explained to me, it's \"Matrix thinking.\"  Clear the fog, see through the Matrix.  It's not all about you, White people."},

But that doesn’t mean White writers are necessarily absolved from responsibility to reflect the diverse world of children and teens. Yet it’s thorny--we know it’s thorny--when it comes to representing characters and cultural experiences that are not one’s own. It’s can be a challenge to evaluate them, too, when you are an outsider to the experience being represented.Recently Nina and I were talking about two middle grade novels by White authors who brought diversity into the stories by establishing the main characters as biracial (both were Latino/White girls): Moonpenny Island by Tricia Springstubb, and Unusual Chickens for the Exceptional Poultry Farmer by Kelly Jones. We appreciated both of these books, but in our discussions, found we had completely opposite reactions to which book we thought was more successful in terms of how it established and developed the diversity.Nina: Yes! I read Unusual Chickens for the Exceptional Poultry Farmer first. I was impressed at how Jones incorporated aspects of Sophie/Sofecita’s culture and race into the story, but sometimes pieces felt inserted for expressly that purpose. For instance, when Sofecita goes into a “you must have had a hard time when you were young” aside to her Abuelita on page 75, we can tell this is where we’re supposed to learn something.  To me, Sophie’s biculturality never quite felt intrinsic to her as a character except to emphasize her situation as an outsider. It felt like an embellishment.So when I read Moonpenny Island, I was wowed at how Springstubb uses biculturality to actually move the story.  It feel less explicit, yet more present, as it is the wedge between Flor’s parents, and her own divided feelings about island life.  Megan:  And I had almost the exact opposite response.  I read Moonpenny Island first and appreciated Springstubb’s choice to make Flor biracial, but while we are told her mother is Latina, and there is a reference to Flor thinking about how it must feel for her mom to be the only Latino person on the island where they live, I didn’t find there was any deep development of the cultural dimension of their identity. There is an occasional Spanish word or phrase her mother uses, and the reference to Flor’s Dad once trying to learn Spanish. Her mom leaves to take care of her mother, Flor’s grandmother, and is staying with “the aunts.” None of this was unrealistic to me but it felt a little bare bones. And interestingly I saw the wedge between Flor’s parents as being more about money and economics--they’re struggling financially and it creates a lot of stress and tension--and I thought this dimension of the story was marvelously developed and fully integrated.  I agree, Nina, that Unusual Chickens… is more explicit but it also felt more authentic in the way Sophie’s bicultural identity and Mexican American heritage is part of who she is--deep down rather than surface. This is in part because a good portion of the story is told through letters to her Abuelita, and she is referencing family stories she’s been told, but it’s also in things like her awareness of being a brown-skinned child in a predominantly White community. Of seeing the boy riding past on his bike and noting that he is a “white boy.”Nina: You are right that Sophie’s biculturality is much more a part of her character than is Flor’s.  But while Flor’s family’s culture is not deeply developed, I found it to be very firmly interwoven through the book, more than just the references you mention.  I think the first time we understand it is on page 17 when Flor thinks about the way her mother says her name. “No one else pronounces her name that exact way … it’s the way her name is meant to sound.”  We also understand that her mother’s family represents something she’s had to give up by moving to the island, there’s that bit on page 64-65 about how her mother behaves when they ride home to the island from a family visit that was very telling, and spoke to me of culture more than economics.These are much more subtly presented than in Unusual Chickens, and ultimately I think both are valid; each book has such a different overall style, I think both presentations are warranted.  But because I was looking at these, when I read them, from a “Mock Newbery” frame of mind in which one might be pitted against the other, I did think about whether one presentation was better than the other.   I think, for instance, that many young White readers (especially those unfamiliar with Latino culture) may gloss over the passages in Moonpenny Island that I thought said so much about culture, because there’s nothing explicit. And from the opposite point of view, I wondered if Latino or bicultural readers would feel that Unusual Chickens was written towards a White readership, rather than towards them.  This is the point in my inquiry where I have to say, truly, I don’t know. The opposite read might also be true: that a bicultural reader might see through Moonpenny Island as a White writer’s good but ultimately limited attempt, and Unusual Chickens as refreshingly out there.  I appreciated Cindy Rodriguez’s take on it at Latin@s in Kid Lit.Megan: I also wondered how the two books would read for cultural insiders. It’s interesting that you point to that scene in Moonpenny Island in which Flor describes how her mother says her name. Overall, it felt to me like Flor spoke about Latino identity in terms of her mom, rather than in terms of herself. But that scene did stand out to me as a vivid moment where Flor is really connected to something specific regarding their Latino identity as it impacts her.  But you are right that this may be an issue of subtlely, and also of not needing to narrate something that is so deeply ingrained for her.By contrast, Sophie’s Latino identity is something she really owns and claims in Unusual Chickens. She is very aware not only of how it impacts her understanding of herself, but also how others may see her. For example, on page 133 when she goes to her first 4-H meeting: “...I took a deep breath and got ready to answer all kinds of questions as soon as I went in--who I was, when I came here, that I speak English just fine….” (Something I think the author did well are these occasional, small moments where stereotypes and racism are directly acknowledged and challenged.)But your question of what bicultural or Latino readers would make of this versus me as a White reader is important to think about. So, too, are differences in family culture and individual personalities reflected in these stories. Sophie’s is a family where culture and identity and racism have been talked about--clearly. We see examples of it in the letters. We do not get as much evidence of that in Flor’s family, and yet Flor’s awareness of her mother’s unhappiness as being perhaps about more than money clearly came from somewhere.I also think it’s important to acknowledge that these two books are different in every way except what we are discussing--that Flor and Sophie are both bicultural. The plots, the settings, the characters, the tone, and the modes of telling are completely distinct. Nothing about Unusual Chickens is subtle; everything about Moonpenny Island is, and this discussion has helped me appreciate how that subtlety can be seen as extending to the way Flor’s cultural identity is revealed and explored.Nina: And this back and forth has also made me remember that there shouldn’t be one “best” way of writing this. Taking it back to the responsibility of White writers in general, I was curious to check in on how Springstubb and Jones present themselves on the issue.Tricia Springstubb quotes her character Flor on the front page of her website: “I’ve never liked when people say, There’s more than meets the eye. Everything is visible, if we just know how to look. That’s why we’re here on this earth--to see as much as we can.” Then Springstubb goes on to say: “I’m a writer, so looking is my business. I try to see what’s in front of me, but what’s behind and underneath too. I try to work the hardest trick of all--seeing the world through someone else’s eyes. That’s where I discover the stories most worth telling.”Kelly Jones includes this at the end of her “About” section of her website:Curious about Kelly’s heritage?Kelly is a white writer of Irish/Scottish/Welsh-American heritage. “Kelly” is a Gaelic name from her mother’s family; it means “warrior”. “Jones” is a very common Welsh name, and comes from her father’s family.To respectfully write people who are not just like her, Kelly uses resources like Writing the Other: A Practical Approach by Nisi Shawl and Cynthia Ward, and asks cultural consultants for assistance. This assistance has been critical to writing good stories; a million, bazillion thanks to everyone who so generously helped her out!I appreciate that both deliberately state their responsibility to write diversity, in ways as different as they’ve done it in their books."},
{"title": "Thoughts on \"But kids say this stuff!!!\"", "date": "Friday, February 12, 2016", "text": "I frequently debate colleagues (in all spheres and via all media) on individual books’ merits/defects/quality/worthiness/appeal.  With disturbing regularity, I raise a concern that a character has said or done something bigoted or racist, and that the book has not countered it.   With disturbing regularity, I get a response along the lines of “but kids actually did/said/do/say this stuff!”I scratch my head every time--does anyone think I don’t know that some kids play \"Indian\"?  Or that some kids make fun of some accents?  Or that some kids say or do hurtful things because it’s Tuesday?  I was a kid, and I haven’t forgotten a thing.  Also, I teach kids five days a week.Accuracy is not the issue.  When we see something problematic, we need to say, “that’s a problem.”  Unless books name problematic content as such, they condone and perpetuate the problems.Now, we can debate whether specific books name problematic content as such, or whether they don’t.  I’ll have that conversation.  I’ll also debate whether the author has done so seamlessly or clumsily, whether the hand of the author is visible or not.  And I’ll gladly debate whether a flawed execution is a dealbreaker or forgivable.You’ll lose me if I say “This is problematic and doesn’t name it as such” and you respond “Yes, but it’s accurate” (see also my comment on “yes, and” vs. “yes, but” here).One example is the image of Grace as \"Hiawatha\" in Amazing Grace.I'd never deny that some kids played and play \"Indian\" like this.  And I'll always assert that playing \"Indian\" like this is a problem.  And what messages does this image send to Native kids whose teachers read Grace aloud?  According to the American Psychological Association, \"the continued use of American Indian mascots, symbols, images, and personalities establishes an unwelcome and often times hostile learning environment for American Indian students that affirms negative images/stereotypes that are promoted in mainstream society... the American Psychological Association supports and recommends the immediate retirement of American Indian mascots, symbols, images, and personalities by schools, colleges, universities, athletic teams, and organizations.\"  Let's stop talking about accuracy and start talking about impact on kids.Ed. 2/12 7:30am: I should mention that the U.S. 25th Anniversary Edition of Amazing Grace does not include this image.  I think this is a smart move, not to mention the right thing to do.Lastly, take a hard look at that “kids actually do this” phrase.  Who are “kids” in that sentence?  It usually refers to kids who aren’t marginalized along the identifier being stereotyped or mocked.  And that defense then reiterates the centering of non-marginalized kids.  Which is the problem in the first place.Believe it or not, I’m not arguing that we should erase the world’s problems from children’s literature.  I don’t think books have the responsibility to present a problem-free world; in fact, I firmly believe that children's literature (and society as a whole) should be more upfront and direct about injustice and racism.I’m not a fan of sugarcoating the world; I just like to point to the corrosive acid and say “hey, that’s not sugar.”-Allie Jane Bruce"},
{"title": "Diversity in Reviews: Behind the Scenes with SLJ's \"Gatekeeper\"", "date": "Tuesday, February 2, 2016", "text": "By Kiera Parrott Few people like to think of themselves as gatekeepers—leastof all librarians. Yet that’s exactly the position I found myself in a littleover two years ago when I left my job in a children’s library, where I spent alarge chunk of my days finding the right book for the right reader at the righttime, to become the editor of School Library Journal (SLJ) reviews,where I now sit among a privileged minority of “experts,” “tastemakers,” and—yeah—gatekeepers, helping determine what books are good, great, even distinguished. Indeed, review editors can affect the larger conversationabout books, selecting which titles merit professional evaluation—and whichtitles can be ignored. As Peter Parker’s Uncle Ben so sagely warned, “Withgreat power comes great responsibility.” What does all of this mean fordiversity and representation within the pages of our magazine? How do I,sitting in a potentially powerful and privileged spot within the publishingecosystem, ensure that our reviews not only shine a light on a diverse array ofauthors, illustrators, and subjects, but also surface stereotypes, culturalinaccuracies or insensitivities, or other problematic elements in text orillustrations? SLJ publishes over6,000 reviews every year—roughly 300 book reviews in every issue—almost all ofthem written by school or public librarians who work with kids and/orteens every day. Working with a team of three other book review editors, I mustensure that the reviews we publish are not merely grammatically correct andfactually sound, but that they accurately and fairly describe and critique eachwork. In an ideal world with infinite reading time and no deadlines (If thereis a heaven, I’m really hoping it’s this exactly), the other editors and Iwould read every single book we assigned from cover to cover. Realistically,beyond some of the picture books, most of the titles we send to our reviewerswill not be fully read by an editor. As a result, we place an enormous amountof trust in our reviewers. We trust that they accurately describe the plot andcharacters. We trust that they carefully articulate both the positive andnegative aspects of the writing, pacing, characterization, and so on. We trustthat they recognize—and critique—stereotypes, caricatures, or culturallyinaccurate or insensitive portrayals. But do they? And how would an editor whohasn’t read the book know if a reviewer missed something important? These arethe kinds of questions that keep a review editor up at night.   About a year ago, Jason Low of Lee & Low Books asked mewhat our pool of SLJ reviewers lookedlike in terms of demographics. “Huh…,” I said, staring into the middledistance, my mouth slightly agape. “I have no idea. In fact, I don’t thinkanyone has ever asked that question.” Why not? Well, I had a pretty fair guess. SLJ, like many other professional reviewjournals, recruits a fair share of its reviewers from the ranks of the AmericanLibrary Association (ALA) membership, specifically its two youth divisions, theAssociation for Library Service to Children (ALSC) and the Young Adult LibraryServices Association (YALSA), as well as the American Association of SchoolLibrarians (AASL). Anyone who’s ever attended an ALA conference or meeting canattest to the general homogeneity: it’s largely White and female. Still, Icouldn’t get Jason’s question out of my head. Sure, we might not be all thatsurprised by the results, but couldn’t a deeper look at the makeup of SLJ reviewers help us better understandwhere we stood and where we may need to focus our recruitment efforts? Andwouldn’t greater transparency—owning up to those statistics and activelyworking to change them—be one important step in our efforts to bring more andbetter diversity to library shelves and, in turn, young readers? Shortly after my conversation with Jason in late 2014, wesent out a survey to our active reviewer base (at that time, about 350individuals) asking about their racial and ethnic background, age, regionallocation, sexual orientation, language(s) spoken, educational background, andgender—becoming one of the first participants in Lee& Low’s Diversity Baseline Survey. The survey was optional andanonymous. Approximately 250 reviewers responded, offering us unprecedented insightinto their demographic makeup. When the results started rolling in, I’m sorryto say, I wasn’t all that surprised. Largely reflecting the overall statisticswithin the publishing world at large and professional reviewers specifically,at the time of the survey SLJreviewers were largely White (88%), female (95%), and heterosexual (90%). Though sobering, the data was also incredibly powerful forformulating focused goals. Beyond the clear mission to do better overall, wenow had at our fingertips specific statistics. For instance, it wasexcruciatingly obvious that we needed to recruit more people of color.Specifically, we found that we had zero reviewers who identified as NativeAmerican. Not a single person. That blew me away. Here was somethingunacceptable that we didn’t and couldn’t know before sending out the survey—andsomething we could actively remedy almost immediately. Over the following months, we made a conscious effort todiversify our corps of reviewers and target those areas where we knew we wereespecially weak. I’ll be honest, it’s not been as fast a process as I hoped.One of the requirements of being an SLJreviewer is that you must be a librarian. Ideally, a working librarian withaccess to a wide ranging collection, and, even better, regular interactionswith kids or teens. Though the profession is slowly becoming less homogenous,children’s and teen librarians still mostly look a whole lot like me: White,female, cisgender, heterosexual. Despite the challenges, we’ve seen some excellent progress.Anecdotally, I can tell you we’ve recruited over 150 new reviewers, many ofthem from a rich diversity of backgrounds. We’ve reached out to organizationslike REFORMA and local chapters of the Black Caucus to recruit new reviewers.We created a website, forum, and a monthly newsletter for SLJ reviewers, which contains resources, trainingmaterial, and best practices with a large focus on how to evaluate literaturewith an eye towards diversity and representation. We holdmonthly online chats with our reviewers, often using those informal discussionsas a way to talk about diversity and evaluation of literature. And, thissummer, editor Shelley Diaz (recently promoted to lead the SLJ reviews team), will be organizing a free online course forreviewers centered on examining how we look at “diverse books,” how we recognize our own blinders or prejudices when it comes to bookevaluation, and how we clearly articulate both praise and criticism inprofessional reviews. The next step is to gauge our progress: are we any morediverse now than when we first sent out the survey? That’s a relatively easyquestion to answer. We’ll look at the numbers and see how we’ve done; we planto send a follow-up survey sometime in 2016-2017. But there’s another questionthat’s much harder to answer: how are our reviews doing? Are our reviewersbetter equipped to recognize and articulate positive and negative elementswithin text and illustrations? Are they spotting stereotypes and criticallyexamining literature for bias? Are we, the review editors, doing everything wecan to help support our reviewers in this essential work? Are we shining aspotlight on excellent titles from a diverse array of authors and illustrators?These questions are much trickier to answer. And they still keep this revieweditor up at night. Kiera Parrott is the reviews director for School Library Journal and Library Journal and aformer children's librarian.

{"title": "Reviewing While White: Last Stop on Market Street", "date": "Thursday, January 28, 2016", "text": "by Nina LindsayLast Stop on Market Street almost doesn’t need a review here, as for the most part the major review sources did it justice, and it seemed to be doing quite well even before its groundbreaking success at the Youth Media Awards announcements. But the awards it garnered, and the responses to them, are worth reflecting on, and in the midst of Cakestorm, we wanted to turn some attention back to it.   At the blog Heavy Medal I and others talked about the book from a Newbery perspective when the awards were announced as well as a few days later.  I won’t reiterate the many examples in the comments of the effectiveness of the text, but if you browse through them you will also find there some of the criticism Sam mentioned here in Housekeeping and the YMAs.  I grow more and more curious about the responses that criticize this book as an award winner, suggesting the choice was “political rather than based on the actual merits of the books”  or that “diversity trumped quality.” What is it about the book that make people suppose this? One commenter at Heavy Medal said: “...there was a definite message the reader was supposed to get and the author was going to make sure they got it. I think the best stories are ones that speak a truth in a way that is eloquent, lyrical, thoughtful without being didactic. They show a mastery of literary skill and storytelling which speaks to readers of any age. Imo, “Market” doesn’t measure up to that.”This makes me wonder if there isn’t a prejudice against certain kinds of messages within children’s literature.  I don’t care for a heavy-handed message myself, and I think young readers can smell them a mile off.  But being heavy-handed is very different than deliberately crafting a message to an audience in a way that allows interpretation.  That is, in essence, what most writing is doing, and Pat Enciso, in her review of the book at Latin@s in KidLit, unpacks exactly how marvelously Last Stop on Market Street achieves this:“On the face of it, CJ is asking for what kids (and adults) often desire: to be unconstrained and worry-free, to have easy access to pleasure and fun. Stories can create this kind of world for children; and many adults think this is what stories for young readers should do. Instead, Last Stop on Market Street honors the realities that exist beyond the readymade worlds of comfort and privilege.”Is it the delivery of the message, or the message itself that has some people upset?  I noticed a slight in this regard in the otherwise positive SLJ review: “This is an excellent book that highlights less popular topics such as urban life, volunteerism, and thankfulness.”  Less popular how, exactly, and why?   Is there, in our critical industry, a normative type of story for children that creates an “unconstrained and worry-free” world for readers, so that a book that addresses this desire in a different way is seen as less popular, or political, or of lesser quality?The more I read the book, the more I appreciate the way CJ responds, ultimately, to his own questions. The narrative describes what CJ comprehends from his Nana in gestures, showing rather than telling. “Nana gave everyone a great big smile / and a ‘good afternoon.’ / She made sure CJ did the same.” … “A man climbed aboard with a spotted dog. / CJ gave up his seat.”  And “Nana glanced at the coin in CJ’s palm. / CJ dropped it in the man’s hat.” This coin is the one that the driver pulled from behind CJ’s ear as they boarded the bus. When CJ drops it in the musician’s hat, Mr. Dennis calls out “Last Stop on Market Street” and they head into the final transformative pages of their trip. This transactional metaphor--the receiving and giving of the coin as passage--serves as a turning point in the narrative as CJ sees his city in new way, emphasized by fleeting rhymes in a musical rhythm of the last few pages. This is a book clearly deserving of its accolades, and sets a standard in storytelling and illustration as award winners should do.  It is also an important book for what is says, as well as how. As Pat Enciso says in her review:“It is a story where it matters that CJ is a Black child spending Sunday with his grandmother. It is a story where it matters still more that CJ and his Nana ask each other hard questions and make space for complex answers.”So did “diversity trump quality,” with a “heavy handed” message? Or is it the message itself that some people feel is not deserving of recognition?"},
{"title": "A Conversation on A Birthday Cake for George Washington", "date": "Tuesday, January 26, 2016", "text": "Allie:So here’s my question: How does this happen (or almost happen)?  And I'm not asking in a rhetorical, throw-up-my-hands way.  I want to know--how, almost a hundred years after Gone With The Wind came out, does the narrative of happy/smiling slaves still happen?  For that matter, how do smiling Indians still happen?  Smiling Skippyjon Jones?Obviously, they happen because they sell.  Let's go a little deeper, though--why do they sell?  I keep thinking of Roy Wood Jr. on the Daily Show, explaining \"If we want to win an Oscar, we have to make a movie about Black people being oppressed... Creed could have got an Oscar nod if they would have sprinkled a little slavery in it.\"And what are my responsibilities here, as a White person?  It mustn’t be to jump up and down on the creative trio of Black women behind this book.  I need to examine my culpability and my responsibilities, and that always starts with some worldview shifting within myself.  So with that in mind, I think the reason smiling/marginalized people narratives sell is that they allow White people to be in an empowered position with no accompanying shame or guilt.  I have to get my hands dirty and find the part of myself that wants that power sans guilt, and reckon with it.Angie:I agree, Allie, about examining my own responsibilities.  While I definitely think it’s important for White people to call White publishing to task, I also want to tread lightly on how I, as a White woman, am empowered to determine how Black women talk about and approach slavery. (I am specifically speaking about Ramin Ganeshram, Vanessa Brantley-Newton, and Andrea Davis Pinkney.)  I have been grateful that Black voices have led this conversation, with special notes of thanks to Edi Campbell, Allyson Criner Brown, and Dr. Ebony Thomas. I think the most important thing White librarians and critics can do in this situation is listen. So, I’ve tried to do that when it comes to A Fine Dessert and especially A Birthday Cake for George Washington.  Before projecting my OWN ideas, I’ve tried to listen.  I think I’ve learned a lot more that way.Sam:Angie, I completely agree. And yet I feel like this is so hard to do when one is passionate about a subject, as much of the discussion that I have seen involves authors, youth services librarians, teachers, publishers -- obviously folks that care a great deal about children’s literature. But when it comes to a subject such as the way slavery is portrayed in a picture book, we White people really do need to take a step back.Megan:I concur. At the same time, we began this blog because we know our job is also to speak, to do some of the work of challenging racism. To that end, I like your reference to worldview shifting a lot, Allie. Because that is absolutely necessary for change in the children's book world, and in the greater world of which that is a part. And yes to allowing for ownership of a self-perceived mistake or changing of minds without that becoming more fodder for criticism.Nina:I also want to make room for \"ownership of a self-perceived mistake\" and at the moment am trying to respect that.  I also recognize this is a scary time for book creators, so I'm willing to make room for their dismay.  But I hold some discomfort around the way this unfolded, and am concerned at the message behind Scholastic's recall statement:\"While we have great respect for the integrity and scholarship of the author, illustrator, and editor, ....We do not believe this title meets the standards of appropriate presentation of information to younger children, despite the positive intentions and beliefs of the author, editor, and illustrator.\"That's some serious ass-covering going on, which I guess is to be expected, yet seems to be at the expense of the author, editor, and illustrator, while removing any responsibility from Scholastic itself.  As a publisher that makes a heck of a lot of money on its proclaimed commitment to \"providing books, magazines, and educational materials that portray the experience of all children, including those from diverse communities and backgrounds\" I'm not really willing to let them divorce themselves from any responsibility.I'm similarly discomforted by Emily Jenkins' apology for A Fine Dessert, at the same time that I respect and admire it. KT:Why are you discomforted by Emily Jenkins' apology, Nina?  I thought it took courage for her to do that. I found it interesting that so many White people who were champions for the book seemed to disregard her apology and carry on as if it hadn't happened.Sam:And meanwhile, those same fans of A Fine Dessert fought tooth and nail to defend the book’s illustrator, Sophie Blackall. In fact, here we are, several months later, and many are STILL defending Blackall while demonizing Jenkins. What’s up with that? Is it because Blackall defended her work while Jenkins did not? To me this ties into the White Lady tears phenomenon somehow, though I can’t quite put my finger on exactly how this is all working.Nina:I agree it took courage.  I'm trying to locate my discomfort. I guess I want writers to take responsibility for what they publish, before they publish it. Same goes for editors and publishers.  Although (arguing with myself here), I guess Emily Jenkins' was taking responsibility in the best way she could, when she could, and I do respect that.  Where else my discomfort? I anticipated the backlash idea that now this would scare off all book creators from writing about difficult subjects...I was discomforted by that precedent.  But I think I just talked myself out of that discomfort over at the Fuse 8 discussion. Where else? Yes, an immediate reaction was thinking about how the illustrator and editor of the book would feel, since I admire their work as well.  But, truthfully, they also hold responsibility, and at the end of the day I am more concerned with how young readers feel than book creators.I think that's the bottom of my discomfort.  And, yup, they are all White People Problems.KT:Something I haven't seen anyone mention is that A Birthday Cake for George Washington was written by a celebrity author who has no track record for writing picture books for young children. I would love to know more about the background of how this came to be published. Was the book Ganeshram's idea or someone else's?There were many things in Ganeshram's post-controversy note that made me think that her argument might fly had she written a book for teens who might better understand the historical context. But 6 year olds?I like Vanessa Brantley-Newton's illustrations for contemporary stories such as My Three Best Friends and Me, Zulay and The Hula-Hooping Queen. Her characters always have bright eyes and big grins -- that's her style. They work in contemporary stories.  But who thought she would be a good match for a book set in slavery times?So going back to Scholastic's statement, \"...we do not believe this title meets the standards of appropriate presentation of information to younger children, despite the positive intentions and beliefs of the author, editor, and illustrator\" -- how does a book get all the way to publication before this determination is made?Angie:KT, I’m interested in the celebrity angle of it too, especially because I read other writing from Ganeshram that seems to take more seriously the issues with Hercules and Deliah’s enslavement--and Hercules’s escape too. Imagine if the text spent less time on authentic mixing bowls and the hunt for sugar and looked at the information Ganeshram has here:“Hercules decided his own fate soon enough. On his master’s 65th birthday, February 22, 1797, Hercules escaped in the wee hours, leaving his son Richmond behind.”  Why do we, as White readers, shy away from that story?  Why do we want a story where Washington puts an arm around Hercules and praises him?  I think that’s something everyone should consider when they’re processing their fierce feelings about this book - why do you need to make Hercules’s story more palatable to you?  Why do you feel the need to bemoan “censorship” and wring your hands thinking about “the children” when, at the very least, we know this book was not telling children the full truth of Hercules and Delilah’s lives as even Ganeshram’s own research showed? Megan: These are questions that, as Allie notes, are more than rhetorical.  Ones I hope authors, illustrators, editors and publishers are not just asking themselves, but talking about, reflecting upon. Just as we need to reflect on it--all of us who are gatekeepers once books are published as reviewers and critics and selectors.  This may feel like a time of crisis and uncertainty, but it’s also one of opportunity. Opportunity that too many people -- too many young readers -- have been waiting for someone to grasp onto for far too long.I also agree with you, Nina, that it is a scary time for book creators. It’s not just about their livelihoods, what they are doing, but it’s their creative lives, and they wouldn’t be writing or illustrating if that creative expression weren’t essential to their identities.  There is no joy or pleasure for any of us in looking at someone’s work and negating it in some way. None. I also don’t want to suggest that this is a single “right” way to depict an experience. I’m not suggesting that every book with enslaved characters, for example, show those characters in constant misery. (Per Allie’s opening salvo, too often that is the trope in Hollywood). What I think we are suggesting, or what I’m saying anyway, is that I don’t want to see reality ignored. I want to come away from a book, no matter how young the audience, with the sense that the brutality of enslavement is understood, even if it isn’t the primary focus of the story. Obviously what is conveyed will differ based on the book and the audience. But I think, as an example, of Shane W. Evans’s Underground. In just a few words and powerful images, he conveys a palpable sense of fear, and underneath that is agency and determination, and at the end, such relief. It isn’t graphic in terms of the physical violence of slavery, and it doesn’t spell out the psychic violence, but it’s there all the same.  Sam:And White folks, can we please agree not to use some version of the “But slaves were happy sometimes!” argument in these situations? There’s something about a White person defending the Happy Slave trope that is deeply disturbing. Like Megan, I’m thinking back to Allie’s comments at the beginning about how this goes along with White guilt.Angie:For sure.  And it’s also a deeply disingenuous derailing argument: “I guess you think slaves never felt joy, so you must be the racist!” There are several books about enslaved people that show the complex realities of their lives -- Poet: The Remarkable Story of George Moses Horton by Don Tate or Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom by Carole Boston Weatherford and Kadir Nelson just off the top of my head.  NO ONE is saying that picture books can’t, or shouldn’t, deal with slavery or other hard topics.  Instead, we’re asking that there is actual nuance and honesty in these stories and images. Tell the truth -- not only can kids handle it, but many of them already know it.  Stop assuming all audiences for these books will be White kids in White classrooms with White teachers.Allie:I know that some of the conversation around both of these books has been a feeling of can’t-win: “We can’t show slaves happy!  We can’t show slaves constantly miserable victims!  What to do about slavery?”I truly don’t know.  I think it would be nice if we had more contemporary, sci-fi, and fantasy books about Black, Native, and Latino people, though.  Not to mention historical fiction that’s not centered on slavery or segregation.  This timeline of Black YA History is a powerful visual representation of the single-story problem.  I love, for example, If I Ever Get Out of Here by Eric Gansworth.  It’s historical fiction about an American Indian boy, set in the 70s.  Lewis (Gansworth's protagonist) spends a memorable chunk of the book wondering if Paul is dead.  I want more like this.Recently a parent (a friend of mine, not someone from work) asked me to recommend something for her history-loving kid: historical fiction that features diverse characters, is not racist or otherwise problematic, is not overly violent or scary, and that her child--who is struggling to advance beyond the Amelia Bedelia level--could actually read.  I couldn’t think of a dang thing.  Anyone?Nina:Sorry Allie. But I think I have an answer to your first question, our refrain, “How does this get published in the first place?”  White people don’t speak up enough when we see it, out of fear of hurting feelings or being branded “politically correct,” and we silence people of color and First/Native Nations when they do.  We have to get comfortable with asking uncomfortable questions about books, and making space for diverse opinions.  This isn’t just about one book, or two books.  This book got published because of everything before it.  Maybe it can be one in a chain to make a real shift in children’s book publishing. Megan:And this takes me back to Allie’s shifting worldview. Discussions happening in the children’s book world in recent months have been uncomfortable, to say the least.  Sure, we can creep along the continuum of incremental change, and in twenty-five years be having similar discussions, and still be talking about dismal numbers in terms of representation of people of color and First/Native Nations. Or we can acknowledge and embrace discomfort and upheaval in the hopes that as a whole when the ground settles we’ll have moved a little more than a mere increment.I know there are people upset about the book being pulled from the market and they speak to its importance in generating open discussion and serving as a learning opportunity. But to me, that decision, for better or for worse, is one form of upheaval, and I find it presents as much of an opportunity to talk and learn and ask questions as the book itself. In a way that decision, whatever is behind it, is leading to more critical questions than otherwise might have been asked within publishing. I hope so, anyway.Allie:We started this conversation almost a week ago, and a lot has happened since then.  PEN/NCAC issued a statement that Scholastic's decision to recall the book is censorship; yesterday, Scholastic responded that it is not.  I suspect that we haven't seen the end of this story.  But whatever happens, we White people need to listen first on this one; and when we do speak, we need to remember to focus on ourselves and our responsibilities.  Let's hold each other accountable to that."},
{"title": "No Text Is Sacred", "date": "Tuesday, January 19, 2016", "text": "by Megan SchliesmanPartI: Context MattersLetme be perfectly clear from the outset: I think the principles of intellectualfreedom we hold as rightfully essential in our work as librarians and teachersare sacred, but no individual book can be considered in light of thoseprinciples abstractly. Context matters.Isay all this as someone who spends a fair amount of her job thinking aboutintellectual freedom and censorship, speaking about them, and considering whatit means when books are challenged.Andwhen books are challenged (and before that, when chosen for inclusion in alibrary or classroom), context is everything.Ina perfect world, every book challenge and potential censorship situation wouldhave an outcome that sees the title in question remain on the shelf or in theclassroom. But that would not only require every individual withdecision-making authority to fully understand and embrace the principles ofintellectual freedom, it would require that we, librarians and teachers, never makea mistake.Andsometimes we do.Weare human, and fallible, and regretful things happen for many and varied reasons. Thesolidly middle or high school novel ends up in an understaffed K-5 library withno library media specialist and a part-time aide. The outdated novel consideredracist by many is still being taught in a fourth grade classroom by a teacherwho is unaware of, or doesn’t care about, the criticism.Arethese typical of most book challenges? No. But let’s not ignore the fact thatthese kinds of situations happen.  And let’s not forget the fact thatevery book challenge, every attempt at censorship in a  school or publiclibrary or classroom, is about a specific book or books in a specific context.That is how they occur, and that is how they are, or should be, handled.Nobook belongs in a library collection or classroom on principle, it belongsbecause of what it specifically has to offer, something hopefully guided byselection criteria and guidelines in policies and procedures that affirmintellectual freedom and the need to build collections responsive to the needs(not just assumptions about the needs) of the specific communities they serve.PartII: In Defense of What?Ifound the news that Scholastic has pulled the picture book A Birthday Cake forGeorge Washington,  having reconsidered the book in light of criticismand recent discussions about the depiction of African American enslavement ingeneral, and the story it tells in particular, shocking. But not, perhaps, forthe reasons one might think.  Ifound it shocking because it was so unexpected. Not because I thought it waswrong.  I don’t know that I can label this decision right or wrong.  ButI do know this: Publishing is a business, and in that, it is, like it or not,different from the world of libraries and public education. The same rules donot apply when it comes to the principles of intellectual freedom.I’veread concern and dismay at the censorship implications of Scholastic pulling the book.DoI think this sets a dangerous precedent? Will the next book to be recalled by apublisher be a picture book about a transgender child or a girl with two dadsor a Muslim family coming to America?Ihonestly don’t think so.  Thishas happened to a specific book for a specific reason. Again, context matters.The specifics matter. Sure, there might be hue and cry about another book. Andit might be hue and cry that is from cultural insiders who are critical of itsportrayal of their experience. That’s important to listen to (and important to get insight into before a book is ever published). But I don’t thinkScholastic or any publisher is going to pull a book based on generaldisagreement or disregard for its content.Andthen there is this: There is and always has been censorship in publishing. Itis part of the gatekeeping role, like it or not. Decisions about what does anddoes not get published are made every single day. And yes, I’m saying this withsome judgment, because part of the reason RWW exists as an ally for diversityis that for far too long too many of those decisions have  minimized theneed for greater and more authentic diversity in children’s and young adultliterature.Truthfully,I am far more concerned about the voices I’m not seeing at all thanScholastic’s decision to pull this specific book for the specific reasonscited.ButI also say that there is censorship in publishing with some understanding: theycannot publish everything (nor would we want them to).Soreally, what is shocking to me about the decision to pull A Birthday Cakefor George Washington, a book that I have no doubt was created with goodintentions on the part of everyone involved, is that it seems so counter to thetypical corporate, business-based decision in publishing. The book had alreadybeen printed. It was available for purchase. Being reviewed in journals andonline, for better and for worse.  Why pull it? Because let’s face it, the book probably would continue to sell. Check out the screen shot below 1/18/2016--Martin Luther King , Jr. Day:Instead, thedecision felt like a human one. One that acknowledged the capacity we all haveto be fallible. To say we have listened and learned.I hope that is the case, but I'm aware that could be my wishful White thinking. It might have been a business decision, pure and simple, that calculated the financial cost and deemed it acceptable to avoid more negative publicity. It might have been a decision that wouldn't have been made were the creators well-established White people rather than people of color. In the meantime, wecan ask questions about this and about other books and what went into creating them. I think we should. But let’s also acknowledge that change is a process, a journey. Thereis no perfect end, just the work of moving forward, which can be messy and murky and painful even as we try to keep hope for the direction we're heading high."},

Please check those out, but remember that they are all living documents and could change at any point. So if you have questions, comment on the specific page or email us by clicking on the “email” link in the Reading While White blogger profile.Most of you are aware, but in case you missed it, the Youth Media Awards were announced this past Monday at the ALA Midwinter Meeting in Boston. As a member of the Coretta Scott King book jury, it’s hard for me to comment too much due to confidentiality, but I will say I was THRILLED with pretty much every result. Kudos to ALL the committee members for their service. One thing that is guaranteed every year is the Monday- (or, in this case, Tuesday-) morning quarterbacking that inevitably shows up after the announcements, especially where Newbery and Caldecott are concerned. It’s one thing to sigh wistfully, thinking of What Could Have Been. There is passion involved in this type of reflection, and sometimes thoughtfulness, and – normally – no committee-slamming. But then you have the ugly side of the second-guessing. We’ve seen this in display over at Calling Caldecott (and to a lesser extent Heavy Medal). The argument some commenters are making is basically that the committees “decided to promote diversity over quality.” In perhaps the most odious of all of the comments, Telly wrote: “In my opinion, judges are going a little too far [to] showcase diversity. How likely is it that, out of everything released in 2015, 3 of the 5 winners happen to have non-white protagonists? I just picture a bunch of smug white librarians patting themselves on the back for these picks. At least if you’re going for diversity, try not to be condescending and have all those books be about civil rights, racial struggles, poverty, etc. It’s just so transparent.” You’d think I would have made myself immune to this type of thing, seeing as how we live in the Age of the Internet, and yet this kind of self-righteous bullshit still triggers my gag reflex. Never mind the fact that committee members work tirelessly, using the award criteria (which are forever burned on their brains), to come to their respective decisions. No, what is especially troubling about Telly’s comment here is something I’m seeing across the board: the way that Telly (and CJ, and Emily) seem genuinely troubled by the success of authors of color… because apparently diversity and quality are mutually exclusive, and anyone who disagrees with their flawed perspective is “superior” (and not in a good way). In our profession where we love our authors and illustrators to a fault (I have a lot more to say on that subject, believe you me), we get catty as all hell if – God forbid – more than half of the award-winning books are from authors and illustrators of color and First/Native Nations. For now I have promised myself that I won’t engage with commenters like this, and instead focus on the good things coming from Monday’s announcements, because, as Nana so wisely observes in our new Newbery winner, “Sometimes when you’re surrounded by dirt, CJ, you’re a better witness for what’s beautiful.”"},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: Walk on Earth a Stranger, and, In the Footsteps of Crazyhorse", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2016", "text": "by Nina LindsayRae Carson's Walk on Earth a Stranger was on the National Book Award longlist for Young People's Literature, and it came to my attention as Debbie Reese started posting her thoughts while reading it.   It made we wonder what made the book stand out to the NBA committee.  The Booklist review noted \"world building\" and \"carefully constructed, well-researched aplomb\" in a book with \"a lot going on...from slavery, animal cruelty, and Indian bashing to heart-stopping medical procedures and gender and class issues.\"  Sounded like a fascinating read, if nothing else. I bit. The book certainly delivers a well-constructed and wordy escape.  And it's romantic, in many senses of the word.  We know for sure exactly what kind of book this will be by p.47, when protagonist Leah  (\"Lee\") refuses childhood friend Jefferson's awkward marriage proposal: \"He pauses. Turns. Sadness tugs at his eyes as he say, 'Seems like I've been waiting for you to come around my whole life, Lee. But a man can't wait forever and stay a man.'\"  But the underlying romanticism in this book is the romanticism of the West, and to fully enjoy it the reader has to buy into the White man's pursuit and claim of land and gold as a noble cause. I think we're expected to excuse Lee for going along with it because she's a young woman trying to escape the clutches of an evil Uncle and of society's gender roles.  Oh, and she has this special power, that lets her sense gold.  So, she can't really help it.Lee’s heartthrob and best friend from childhood, Jefferson, is \"half Cherokee.\"  You must read Debbie Reese's conclusive post on this book for a full unpacking of the problems with how Carson portrays First Nations/Native people.  I find it particularly unnerving how this is delivered under a veneer of “respect.”  Lee is carefully and deliberately characterized as non-racist for her time as seems reasonably possible, by pointing it out in others:  p.59 \"It takes a moment for me to realize 'boy' refers to his slave.\"  Or p.232 \"Mama used to say that Jefferson had a noble dignity about him, which was her way of pointing out his Indian blood while pretending to be polite. He doesn't seem noble to me. He's just Jeff.\"  Debbie Reese does an excellent job of outlining how Carson, in what seems like an intent to assign blame across the board as if even-handedly…”gives us Indian people as a group who are horrible, versus specific White individuals who are horrible.”    They remain a “group” in this story, not individuals.   And Jefferson, while individual, seems mostly device.   When Lee says on  p.235 \"I don't know what to think about the Indians. Seems to me we don't really know anything about them. We don't even know what we don't know,”  it seems clear Carson doesn’t know either, and this echoes like a sloppy excuse. Joseph Marshall III’s In the Footsteps of Crazyhorse feels like a book I’ve been waiting for for a long time, and I was pleased to see it on School Library Journal’s Best of 2015 list. With a simple setup and straightforward prose, young Jimmy goes on a road trip with his Grandpa Nyles and listens to stories about the Oregon trail, and the famous battles that Crazy Horse took part in, and which are generally told in books for children from a radically different perspective.  I don’t recall reading a book for children that lays out the horrible details of these battles in a way that doesn’t “other” the Lakota and other First Nations.   Stop by stop, Grandpa Nyles takes Jimmy to visitor centers and historical markers to read  the information there, and then tell him “the way it was.”  At “Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument” Grandpa Nyles describes the onset of the Battle of the Greasy Grass:“Everyone at the south end of the village could hear the guns now. So much gunfire was not good and usually meant danger. So much gunfire usually meant enemies. It was better to think that and do something than to wonder and be confused. Enemies attacking were nothing new to the Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho people.” p.93This is such a different perspective on events than I have read in most books for children, in which Indians suddenly appear to battle. Throughout, Grandpa Nyles painstakingly elaborates instances of bravery and courage within an authentic context: not sensationalized, not stereotyped.This book is labelled fiction, and it’s set up as a novel.  While the language is fluid and accessible, I found it light on character development and plot as commonly read for in our industry, and was feeling disappointed in that regard.  But about half-way in I realized I was reading it wrong.  It’s a history book, told in story, and one that provides a much-needed perspective lacking in most of children’s literature. Held next to Walk on Earth a Stranger it feels like a balm, and Carson’s novel’s raking othering of Indians in service of the romance of the West stands out even more starkly in comparison."},
{"title": "Are We Privileging White Voices in Criticism?", "date": "Tuesday, December 29, 2015", "text": "Sometimes I think White people working in children’s and young adult literature want to believe that in our little corner of the world, we’ve worked it all out. “It” being racism. Sure, we need more diverse books, but that’s just a matter of time and effort. Otherwise, we’re good, right?  And if you don’t read the voices of people of color and First/Native Nations critics in our field, you might be able to go along believing that illusion, or you could if it weren’t for the fact that a lot of discussion around a handful of books has drawn attention to the fact that White people, too, are asking questions and calling out racism where they see it. I know White voices are privileged in the creation of children’s and young adult literature. I work at the Cooperative Children’s Book Center where we keep track of the number of books by and about people of color created each year.  I always say those numbers tell just part of the story, but it’s an important part. The other part of the story is, of course, the terrific books that come out each year by First/Native Nation authors and artists and authors and artists of color.  But oh, how we need more of them. I don’t sense great disagreement on this point among those in the field. But are we also privileging White voices in criticism? Of course there’s no simple answer to that question. For one thing, it depends on who “we” are.  And I know there’s irony in asking that question on a blog created by White people. It was something we struggled with when developing Reading While White. We owe our existence to the voices of people of color and First/Native Nations within and beyond the field of children’s and young adult literature from whom each one of us has learned. We believe we have a responsibility to challenge racism--it is work that is demanded of all of us. But we have no desire to be heard over their voices, or in lieu of them. I’m still learning to understand the broader context of racism that informs the perspective of people of color and First/Native Nations individuals writing about children’s and young adult literature, and I know there are other White readers and critics doing the same. Yet when I look online, where much of the discourse in our field is occurring, I also see many White voices that are dismissive of people of color and First/Native Nations critics; sometimes it seems like what those critics have to say is summarily rejected. It’s not essential that we all agree with one another. I read books all the time that have starred reviews or end up on best-of-the-year lists and ask myself, “Really?”  Tastes differ. Absolutely. But when it comes to the critical issue of combating racism in children’s and young adult literature, it’s more than a matter of taste. It’s a matter of knowledge and experience, and we need to be willing to listen to one another, and especially to the voices of those who are speaking from positions of knowledge and experience that those of us who are White do not have. That doesn’t mean White people can’t speak or don’t have valuable things to say, but let’s speak from a place of understanding that acknowledges we may not know everything.Instead, too often, the reaction is to dismiss a critical response to a book by calling it, or the person writing it, angry or strident or picky or censorious or politically correct when First/Native Nations critics and critics of color point out passages or portrayals they consider problematic. When White critics add voices of agreement to what is being said, we are dismissed as having been manipulated by guilt. And if the book in question is written or illustrated by someone White, reverse racism may be added to the mix of accusations against all of us.That isn’t showing understanding, or knowledge, or even a willingness to engage. That’s showing a desire to shut the conversation down. And that privileges Whiteness, too, because shutting the conversation down assumes it isn’t important, and that concerns about racism don’t matter. So at the heart of this post is this question: \"Am I privileging White voices in criticism?\" Because it's up to all of us who are White to ask ourselves that question.I hope White readers of this blog will take a look--or another look--at some of the blogs we link to. These are some of the voices of people of color and First/Native Nations individuals who are passionate about children’s and young adult literature—just like you, just like me. They represent a multiplicity of perspectives, experiences, opinions and responses to books and to our broader field. Read what they have to say, and at a moment you find yourself feeling angry, or upset, or insecure, or uncertain (and yes, you will have them; I know I do), take a depth breath and ask yourself, “What can I learn from this?”In doing so, you may not change your mind, but you might find you have questions or comments that don’t begin or end with dismissing the criticism outright. You might even discover that you do, indeed, have something to learn. Because all of us do. And we are privileged to be able to learn from one another.  Megan Schliesman"},
{"title": "A White Man on the Coretta Scott King Book Jury", "date": "Tuesday, December 22, 2015", "text": "As many readers know, the Youth Media Awards (YMAs) are like a less pretentious version of the Academy Awards for Young Adult and Children’s Literature. (By the way, the YMAs are coming very soon—click here and bookmark to watch live on Monday morning, January 11.) For as long as I’ve been paying attention to the YMAs, the Coretta Scott King (CSK) Awards have always been my own “Best Picture”; though announced near the beginning of the ceremony, everything else is, to me, a bit anticlimactic. So to say that I’m chuffed to serve on this year’s CSK book jury is a major understatement. But not only is it a thrill to be part of it, it’s also a privilege.If you haven’t read it yet, now is the perfect time to go take a look at Amy Koester’s excellent guest post at Heavy Medal, The Privilege of Serving. In it, Koester writes, “When a reader does not recognize their own privilege, deep, honest discussion simply isn’t possible.” That really resonates with me as I read books for CSK, whose #1 criteria (as listed on the award website) is to “portray some aspect of the black experience, past, present, or future.” As a White male, do I know what exactly the “black experience” is? Honestly, no; how could I? All I can do is read all the eligible books, do some research, and focus on listening during our forthcoming awards discussion. Nobody has more privilege than White men. And generally speaking, this privilege manifests itself in White men controlling discussions and talking far more than listening. Black women, on the other hand, too often find their words silenced (the term “intersectionality” was originally coined in reference to Black women and the way they were/still are discriminated against based on race AND gender). The CSK jury consists of seven members; four are Black women (the remaining two are White women). I’ve served on two award committees prior to this year, and I’m guessing my former Newbery and Sibert mates would agree that I’m good at talking. The listening part has not always come so easy. In an award discussion, every committee member’s voice is crucial to the act of coming to consensus. But with all the crap women have to deal with (especially women of color), isn’t it the least I can do as a White man on the CSK jury to let someone else do most of the talking for a change?"},
{"title": "All I Want for Christmas....", "date": "Wednesday, December 16, 2015", "text": "Has anyone been into a bookstore in past weeks to browse for suitable gifts for the children in your lives, and had a little trouble? Or how about this one: a parent called me last week wondering how to find, in our catalog (so she could place a hold; it's how she most conveniently uses the library) Christmas books that were \"just about Christmas,\" which for her meant no Santa, no presents.  We had them for her, of course, but the glut of Christmas books available was just impossible for her to negotiate online.Allie's review of \"An Invisible Thread Christmas Story\" was a perfect illumination to me of the problem I always face at this time of year in particular.   Publishing seems to be, in this day, more and more profit-driven at its bottom line. Christmas books sell, and bookstores exist on narrow margins. I get it.  The problems Allie pointed to in this kid's version of a New York Times bestseller suggest that the only motivation behind this book was money, and that it was therefore written to attract a very particular buying market.  I'm sure I'll hear the line that it is subsidizing \"worthier\" books, but that seems like a deal with the devil to me, or at least a pallid excuse for selling the \"White Savior\" story in this way.   This isn't limited to Simon & Schuster, by the way; we see exactly the same problems on our Thanksgiving shelf, etc. I understand marketing forces and the need, sometimes, to just make some money... especially for authors and illustrators, for whom it is generally scarce. But it concerns me when the sheer volume of \"marketable\" holiday books trade on goodwill to entrench stereotype, and drown out other voices and perspectives.   KT often quotes the poet Alexis DeVeaux: \"Buying a book is a political act.\"  This goes for our library collections as well as personal purchases.  When I manage the forethought to order the book I really want to buy for a present through my bookstore, or manage to find a title on the shelves I actually like and that has a character of color... I delight in not only my little \"ka-ching\" for that title, but the fact that I didn't buy what the publishers' sales departments shoved in my face.  I know that bookstores notice too the books that are being requested, and purchased, especially in this season they count on to land in the black.Do you have a favorite book for children you purchase at this time of year, or a new favorite? We Need Diverse Books has a holiday list; are there others you've found helpful?"},
{"title": "The Duty of Professional Reviews", "date": "Friday, December 11, 2015", "text": "You can’t read all the books.I know.  You have the best of intentions.  Heck, you WANT to read them all. You have piles dedicated to this very purpose and you know that it is an important part of your job as a youth librarian.  I am there with you.  No matter how fast I read (and I’m a pretty fast reader) I still feel the overwhelming crush of all the books I am not getting to.How can you know what to buy?  What to recommend?  How can you ever know enough?  Well, I suppose the philosophical answer is you can’t.  You can’t but you keep trying because, well, what else is there. But the more tangible answer is that, as librarians, we can look to reviews.  We have numerous professional resources that, with their larger staffs of writers, cover more than one single person ever could. I am writing today for these reviewers.  I, myself, review for School Library Journal and it is a dream to someday be a Kirkus reviewer.  I do not take my reviewing assignments lightly because I know that thousands of librarians across the country will be using them to make and justify purchasing decisions. Many librarians can't get advance review copies of titles (and no librarian can get them all!) so the reviews are often the only guide they have for assessing content. In times of limited budgets, in conservative climates, reviews are often the difference between “I can absolutely justify needing that on my shelves” and “I have to pass for another Rick Riordan book.” Some institutions require at least two positive reviews to purchase material. If you are a reviewer, I am asking that you too remember this responsibility when you are critically evaluating titles. I specifically want to look at the professional reviews for Katie M. Stout’s 2015 title Hello, I Love You.  This is a YA book about an American girl who, on the run from her personal problems, enrolls in a boarding school in Korea.  Once there, she falls for a Korean pop star.  From this premise, this sounds like a book with tons of teen appeal: boarding schools, K-Pop, a diverse love interest, a look at another country and culture, the fish out of water heroine.  I can see plenty of librarians interested in adding it to their collections based on those factors.  But when you look at the professional reviews, a troubling thread is revealed.Publishers Weekly hints at the trouble with this:“Grace's stubborn cultural naiveté, while not necessarily unbelievable, grates from the start.”School Library Journal is more precise:“By setting the tale in Korea, Stout has an opportunity to open a window into Korean culture for her readers; sadly, the opportunity is often missed. The book too closely follows Grace's first person cultural ignorance, and an unfortunate a number of stereotypes are perpetuated.”But Kirkus, as always, cuts right to the chase and says:“Stout's depiction of Korea is often shockingly insensitive and riddled with errors and inconsistencies. Grace thinks crowds of Korean people smell like garlic, is nauseated by Korean food, and obsesses over the horrors of squat toilets. A Korean character incorrectly describes Hangul, Korean writing, as a syllabary rather than an alphabet. In the end, the plot is a variation on the classic \"White Savior\" story (think Dances with Wolves). It's deeply unfortunate that a novel set in Korea with many characters of color is primarily about its white protagonist's journey of self-discovery. Skip this embarrassing example of clueless cultural appropriation.”These three reviews, especially when taken together, clearly expose some real troubling content within the book.  It was glaring enough that, to some degree, every reviewer felt like it warranted a mention in their review. Look - I haven’t read Hello, I Love You. That is why this is not a review of that book. But these three professionals have.  And they are giving me valuable information on if I want to buy this book for my library. And beyond that, they are also giving me valuable insight into how this book handles race and Korean culture. Have you ever read a book that had problematic content and then thought, “Wow, I wish there had been some mention of that in the professional review before I bought it!”  I have. But the reviews for Hello, I Love You make me feel some hope that we’re moving forward - that we’re moving towards a world where these kinds of critical comments about problematic elements of books are not only welcomed but required for reviews to be considered successful and useful. When I read these reviews I felt like I could make an informed decision about purchasing for my library that was backed up by librarians who take our role in selection seriously.If you’re a reviewer, you have an obligation to comment on these things, from microaggressions all the way through to the more blatantly obvious examples like the ones described in Hello, I Love You so that people can use your review to make an informed purchasing decision.  If you happen to be an editor for a professional publication, please consider letting your reviewers explicitly know that you welcome and encourage this kind of introspection.

{"title": "Reviewing While White: \"An Invisible Thread Christmas Story\", aka, \"A White Savior Christmas\"", "date": "Thursday, December 3, 2015", "text": "by Allie Jane BruceIn 1986, then-six-year-old Maurice Mazyck stood on a Manhattan street, asking strangers for money and food.  Laura Schroff, who worked in advertising, bought him a meal.  She continued to buy him meals every week for the next three years.  The two formed a mutually-valued relationship.  Forth they went, together.In 2012, Laura published their story in a book for adults called An Invisible Thread (Simon and Schuster, co-authored by Alex Tresniowski).  An Invisible Thread was a #1 New York Times bestseller, is available in 12 languages, and is on its way to becoming a film.  I have not read An Invisible Thread, but apparently Mike Huckabee liked it a lot.And in 2015, An Invisible Thread Christmas Story (Simon and Schuster, extracted from An Invisible Thread, written by Schroff and Tresniowski, illustrated by Barry Root) appeared in my office.  Joy to the world.Here's a bullet list of what I caught in An Invisible Thread Christmas Story:It's a White savior story.  A White Lady Bountiful (Laura) swoops in and saves a poor, hungry Black boy (Maurice) from the wicked, wicked streets.  White savior narratives are inherently problematic because they erase the fact that White people are at the root of the oppression of people of color and First/Native Nations people in the first place.  There is a supreme irony in telling a story, even a nonfiction story (based on an isolated event), that inverts the larger truth and portrays people of color and First/Native Nations people as unable to fend for themselves and White people as generous saviors.The story purports to be first-person (\"I/me/my\") from the point of view of Maurice, yet all three of the book's creators are White.  In a time when we're engaging in debates about #ownvoices, cultural appropriation, and authenticity, this feels beyond wrong.The text never names the fact that Laura's ability take Maurice to meals, have him over at her apartment, and bring him on a family vacation--without fear of being misunderstood or arrested--is afforded to her by her Whiteness. If a Black man approached a six-year-old White girl on a Manhattan street and said “Can I take you to get something to eat?”, as Laura does to Maurice, he would very likely end up in jail.  By contrast, Laura's actions are held up as the epitome of kindness (so much so that the book includes backmatter on Small Acts of Kindness, eg \"If you have a chart of family chores, add 'kindness' to the list.\")It's really, really materialistic... Four pages are devoted to presents and wrapping paper...The text never names the fact that Maurice is Black and Laura is White, nor that their races are linked to their unequal socioeconomic statuses and the inequitable amounts of wealth and resources to which they have access.Feel free to add anything I missed in the comments.In my research into An Invisible Thread (which, again, I have not read) I learned that Laura Schroff also comes from a troubled family.  But, Laura's troubled family is positioned differently in our society's power structure than Maurice's troubled family is positioned, because Laura's is White, and Maurice's is Black.When he arrives at Laura’s sister’s big, beautiful house, Maurice thinks “This has to be the luckiest family in the world.”  Yes, we White folks are very lucky.  Nothing else.  Not smarter.  Not more moral.  Not more capable.  Not more deserving.  Just luckier.  And the creators of An Invisible Thread Christmas Story capitalize on that luck.  They choose to ignore the systems and structures that keep White people “lucky”, and they profit on a narrative that portrays a lucky White person as a generous, loving, savior and a Black person as a grateful recipient of White generosity.  This is no act of kindness.  This is, quite simply, an act of racism.The only thing that White dominance requires to keep on chugging is for White people to do nothing to interrupt it.  Let’s interrupt it.  Let’s recognize this White savior story for what it is, and reject it."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: See No Color", "date": "Tuesday, December 1, 2015", "text": "by Megan SchliesmanIn SeeNo Color, author Shannon Gibney explores the myth of colorblindness in thecontext of transracial adoption in a story about Alex(andra), a biracial teen who was adopted by Whiteparents as a very young child. Alex hastwo White siblings, a brother who is also in high school and an eleven-year-oldsister.  For her family,Alex is simply Alex, the sister and daughter that they love. There are so manysmall ways in which Gibney conveys that love, and the familiarity and knowledgethat are part of being a family, through Alex’s eyes. But nomatter how much her parents wish it were otherwise, Alex’s experience in theworld is different than the rest of her family’s. They love her, and theygenuinely believe that is enough. Of courseit isn’t enough. It isn’t enough when she has been reminded over and over byoutsiders that she is different from everyone else in her family. It isn’tenough when, despite looking Black, she not only doesn’t feel comfortable withother Black kids at school but feels judged by them. It isn’t enough when shefeels different from the rest of her family.Alex’s parentsare not only hesitant but ill-equipped to talk about race. When her dad pointsout, “you’re only half black,” Alex assumes he’s trying to minimize herBlackness, as if there is something wrong with it.When Alexstarts dating Reggie, a Black player from another baseball team, she lets himbelieve her parents are a mixed-race couple. It sets the stage for a series ofsmall lies she keeps telling to steer him away from meeting her family. Shedoesn't want him to know she's adopted by White parents; she can't evenarticulate why. DatingReggie is eye-opening for Alex, not just because it’s the first time she’sreally fallen for someone; it’s also the first time she’s spent time sociallywith Black people. There is a vibrant sense of warmth and energy between Reggieand his mother, and an undeniable difference culturally. When Reggie’s mom says“nigger” in the context of a funny exchange between her and Reggie at thedinner table, Alex drops her fork in alarm and has to go to the bathroom torecover.It isalso at Reggie’s suggestion—because Alex complains about how hard her hair isto manage—that Alex makes her first trip to a Black hairdresser, the same onehis aunts go to. Her mom drops Alex off into a community of Black women that isforeign to their family. The woman working on her hair tries to ease Alex'sanxiety and get a sense of what Alex wants. The problem is that Alex isn't sureherself. She emerges with relaxed hair. She hates it.Alex hasalso discovered a series of letters her Black birth father wrote her over anumber of years (he tracked her down because she’s been in the news for herbaseball skill). She can’t believe her parents have withheld them from her. Itdoesn’t matter to her that her birth father was in violation of  therules by trying to contact her while she’s still a minor, or that her parentssaved the letters (clearly a point of disagreement between them), intending togive them to her when she was older. She wantsto meet him.Gibney, amixed-race transracial adoptee herself, skillfully and courageously navigatesthe emotional terrain of Alex’s story, going to hard and challenging places.The result are some scenes that are unforgettable to me, such as Alex’sdiscovery of her adoption papers (she looks hard for them), which include howmuch the adoption cost, and the realization that she was labeled “specialneeds” because she is mixed race, and therefore it cost less than adopting aWhite child would have. Alex’s pain at the discovery of these facts ispalpable, and she has no one with whom to talk about them.Alex secretlytravels to Michigan to meet her Black birth father, who has turned his lifearound since she was born. She meets his Black wife, who welcomes her; meetsher younger half sister, who immediately makes Alex try to feel at home. Butit’s not home. Not family. Theirs is a different family culture; differentvalues; different rules. She will probably go see them again, but they cannotsolve this puzzle of identity, which is as much about feeling as fact.It’s onlywhen she goes to the library to research more about adoption that things begin toshift for Alex. And it happens by accident when a young Black woman shelvingbooks overhears Alex’s hesitant inquiry and later approaches her offering tohelp. It turns out she, too, is a transracial adoptee. She understands what Alexwas really trying to ask, and shows her a web site about transracial adoption where,finally, Alex begins to find affirmation for what she’s been feeling.I do havesome quibbles and concerns with See No Color. I found thesetting of Madison, Wisconsin, to be generic rather than specific in execution,but that’s because I live here. Alex’s sister Kit, the only one in her familywho seems to understand Alex’s need to talk about race and identity, isunbelievable to me as an eleven-year-old. Many adults aren’t as insightful andmature as Kit. An even bigger concern for me was the storyline with Alex’sbirth father, which felt more plot device than organic to me, especially incomparison to the rest of the story.But the emotionalauthenticity of See No Color ultimatelydefines this novel that breaks new ground in young adult literature aboutadoption, giving visibility and voice to dimensions of that experience that havenever been so honestly articulated. I hope we see more books moving forward;Gibney’s novel, as fine and as illuminating as it is, cannot speak to theentire spectrum of experience, nor should it be expected to."},
{"title": "What Makes A Classic?", "date": "Tuesday, November 24, 2015", "text": "This post has been in my mind a long time, even before we started talking about it in comments to our early October post, \"Not a Contradiction,\"  or heard of the Amazing Grace Solution.  I've been thinking of the place that classics have in a library collection, of what that term means, and of how and when it gets used.  I think it is true that a good library collection has books from across many decades, and these will, by necessity, reflect changing attitudes and values. That's part of the reason for having them in the collection.  But how do we choose which books stay on the shelf for all that time? Whose attitudes, whose values, determine a set of \"classics\"?When I think of what makes any single classic last on the shelf, there could be several reasons.  Some have been enshrined in popular media, whether people actually expect the literary tome they encounter with, say Pinnochio or Gulliver's Travels.  There are some titles I suspect hang on simply because teachers keep on using them, such as Amazing Grace. Then there are award winners, and some books that simply seem to have perennial child appeal, like Harriet the Spy.  Finally some seem simply to \"exist\" as classics:  Treasure Island, The Wind in the Willows, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Alice in Wonderland, The Jungle Book...   who canonized these, and with what in mind? \"What Makes a Classic?\"...or, \"Who\"?  In almost each of these cases above, the status granted a book comes from an establishment (educational, library, or wider literary critical circles)  that is overwhelming White. While I think we hope our classics represent our literary \"heritage\" in some way, I question the self-fulfilling loop of a limited perspective.This is, of course, what we are talking about in general when we ask where is the diversity in children's literature, and our awards.  But I'm also thinking specifically about branch public libraries, in which an adult comes asking for some classic children's books, or requesting a specific one, and the indignation that can come along when we don't have something ready for them to match their expectation.  (Perhaps this goes for bookstores, too.)Where does this question come from, and what is it in the classic in someone's mind that makes it a classic? I can accept, as a generalism, that all classics have excellence and appeal in their aesthetic and technical delivery...  something in the writing that made them connect with an audience in a strong, broad, and lasting way.    My question is, when an adult is looking for a classic to share with new audience, what IS it that they want to share?  Is it the actual message in that book?  Is it the experience the adult had reading it, that they would like to replicate? Does the adult hope to recapture that experience for themself, by sharing it? It probably is all three, and more, but I don't think we often ask ourselves these questions.   I think that if adults can recognize, and place to the side--for later, for themselves--the nostalgia of their own experience, and rather focus on what it is they hope for the child they are sharing the book with... some classics might not seem so classic. And perhaps that classic is still exactly right, but I don't think we can know unless we re-examine them.  Being asked to question your own cherished memories of a book is not a pleasant experience, similar to Megan's experience On Letting Go. The 25th Anniversary edition of Amazing Grace has been reprinted in the US without the image of Grace posing, stereotypically, as Hiawatha.   The UK 25th edition retains this picture.  In an interview in the Guardian, the reporter leads off with: \"Mary Hoffman’s groundbreaking Amazing Grace gave us one of the first black heroines in a picture book.\"  Now, I can't speak to the British picture book scene in 1991 when Amazing Grace was first published, but here I recall some remarkable picture books like Mirandy and Brother Wind or Flossie and the Fox that had been acclaimed here just years earlier, and these are simply the ones that spring to my mind.In the interview, British author Mary Hoffman says (I am cutting and pasting, I recommend reading the whole interview):When I was young, it was quite common to be told there were things you couldn’t do because you were a girl ...   So I decided right from the beginning that Grace would be a black girl, just to add to the challenges she might face....  I based Grace on me.....Picture books still have a long way to go in showing the diversity of our culture and the variety within families. Things are better than they were 25 years ago but they won’t really become fully inclusive until more books are written and illustrated by members of the BAME [i.e. \"POC\"] community themselves.I got a little flak for writing about a black child when I was myself white but I didn’t mind. What was important was that someone should write that book and no-one else was doing it. It was also ironic since one of the points of the book is that all stories are for all people.Twenty-five years later, I still believe that.This speaks both to what made Amazing Grace such a meaningful book for so many, and to why it remains problematic.  What makes Amazing Grace more well-known than, say Mirandy and Brother Wind?  Money. More people have purchased the former, and requested it in libraries, meaning libraries will keep it on and replace it, more, and from what I can tell the reason people keep requesting it is simply because they hear of it from a person or place they trust. I cannot see what can possibly be behind the motivation to reprint Amazing Grace except for money, especially as the Hiawatha picture has only been removed in one country. This points to it being a market-driven decision, rather than an authorial or editorial one.  While I'm certainly glad that American audiences won't have to see the Hiawatha picture (well, depending on whether their libraries replace all their copies...hear that ka-ching?), I also wish some of the market attention that Amazing Grace gets could get spent on more and various books.If you haven't read Amazing Grace in a while, I encourage you to revisit it, and think about Mary Hoffman's statement in the interview that one of the points of the book is that \"all stories are for all people.\"  Look at the stories that Grace enacts through the book:  Joan of Arc, Anansi the Spider, the Iliad, [Treasure Island or some other pirate story], Hiawatha, The Jungle Book, Aladdin, and ultimately of course: Peter Pan.  All Stories?  Really?  Whose stories are these exactly? Whose tokens? Whose classics?With the 25th Anniversary Edition of Amazing Grace as just one example of a classic made classic within many of our own lifetimes, I wonder:Who is using this new edition, and why? What other books might serve the same purpose?What is it that makes this a classic? Who made it so, and why?"},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: Home", "date": "Thursday, November 19, 2015", "text": "by Sam BloomHome (published by Candlewick Press) is Carson Ellis’s first book as both author and illustrator, and it is generating a fair amount of Caldecott buzz, as evidenced by its standing on the Goodreads Mock Caldecott list (12th out of 69 books as of November 17). And understandably so: it’s an auspiciously beautiful debut. You can tell just by touching this book: Ellis and her editors at Candlewick Press obviously took great care in its design. The paper is a lovely cream, nice and thick, pleasing to the touch. The bibliographic information tells us that Ellis hand-lettered the entire book, which is pretty impressive to me (my handwriting is abysmal). Turning to the first spread, we see two horses racing away from a small country home with a dove flying away from the house (a dove that the observant reader will find in nearly every illustration). This lovely scene is more than a little reminiscent of the work of Alice and Martin Provensen. (According to Erin and Phillip Stead’s excellent Number 5 Bus series, where Ellis spoke at length with Mac Barnett, the Provensen-esque art seems to have been a conscious choice.)A bit later in the book, a full page spread shows a large boat headed for shore; judging from the wash hanging on a line, the lookout gazing through an eyeglass, etc., it appears that the boat is looking to land and perhaps set up roots. But there’s someone already on the land: three people (clearly meant to be from First/Native Nations) wait at the head of the long, earthy slope, looking toward the approaching boat. The text reads, “Some homes are boats. / Some homes are wigwams.” A flock of birds ascends overhead, including the ubiquitous dove. Now, if I’m not very much mistaken, the dove is usually a symbol of peace. So what is going on here? Is Ellis making a political statement? If so, what is it? Is she trying to show peace between the (mostly) White members of the boat’s crew and the people of Native/First Nations on the land? But that would be revisionist history to the extreme! And about that crew: would there really be people of color out on deck, dressed in clothes just like the White sailors’? Or would they be in chains down belowdecks? I’m puzzled… and I’m an adult who studies children’s books as a part of my vocation. What of the child who sees this? What will they surmise from this baffling illustration? And what if the reader is a child of Native/First Nations, or a descendent of the Diaspora--how will these images register?Turn the page and you’ll see another full page spread, this one apparently meant to take place in the Middle East. A shirtless man (with brown skin) stands holding a scimitar, guarding something, perhaps the ladder down to the “underground lair” featured at the bottom of the illustration. There is even a lamp (ala Aladdin and Robin Williams) on a table, where some nefarious-looking (also brown-skinned, natch) men are counting coins. Again: what is going on here? Does Ellis realize the misconceptions that she is reinforcing with this spread? In a country where Arabs receive death threats after pretty much any terrorist attack, how is this a good idea?The homes themselves are pretty amazing. For instance, the “Japanese businessman” stands in front of a radical, stone-looking, geometrically fascinating piece of work. And… oh, wait. The “Japanese businessman’s” eyes are closed… it almost looks as if he is squinting. Yeah, that’s a pretty offensive stereotype too. Oy. And then there’s the white-toothed, smiling, poor-but-happy Kenyan blacksmith. Oy vey.I’m embarrassed to admit I glossed right over all of this on my first read. I am a White man with all of the privileges that come with the position, so to speak, and I often miss things that I really should see in books. I’m getting better, but I’m still numb to so many problematic things.I have to do better. We all have to do better.In all the recent discussion on A Fine Dessert, this was a popular excuse for the book’s defenders: “I didn’t notice this, the kids I was reading to didn’t notice this [bonus points if said kids were not White!!!], so it can’t really be that harmful, right?!” Wrong. It still hurts, folks.In January, Julie Danielson interviewed Ellis for Kirkus. Ellis mentions a few people in the interview: her editor at Candlewick, Liz Bicknell; and Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen, who provided “mountains of feedback and support” during the making of Home. I’m familiar with these three folks, especially Barnett and Klassen, who consistently produce top-quality, wisely created books. And I believe that Ellis is ultimately the responsible party here, but I wonder if Bicknell, Barnett or Klassen ever questioned Ellis on some of the problematic parts of the book. I wonder if anyone else along the way saw anything wrong here.Debbie Reese reviewed this back in the Spring. That review was an eye-opener for me. I’m grateful for Debbie’s persistence in pointing out the problematic content in children’s books despite comments like this. (On a related note, don’t use this book to teach your kid/your class point-of-view. Just don’t, okay? I’m sure we can brainstorm a ton of infinitely less problematic titles that could do just as well in that regard.)As beautiful as this book is, as talented as Carson Ellis undoubtedly is, there is more than enough troubling content in Home to cancel out the aesthetically pleasing bits."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: Up and Down with \"Over the Hills and Far Away\"", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2015", "text": "by Megan Schliesman I was excited when I first picked up Over the Hills and Far Away: A Treasury of Nursery Rhymes from Around the World, a collection compiled by Elizabeth Hammill and illustrated by more than 70 artists.  Excited because it’s a hefty, substantial and visually arrestingoffering that was making an intentional effort at multiculturalism, and indoing so would hopefully offer something fresh in poetry collections for youngchildren.In her introduction, Hammill states she sought to create a \"genuine intercultural experience\" and the opening piece is a strong start of moving beyond the norm: a poem from the TohonoO’odham. But right away I had a question that I could not answer on my own: Who are the Tohono O’odham?I'm sorry I didn't know the answer myself, but I'm also sorry the book made no effort to enlighten me beyond the visual cue in the illustration: indigenous individuals in a desertlandscape. I used Google to find out more about the Tohono O'odham, a Native nation in Mexico and the American southwest, and I was happy to discover from the brief bio in the back for the artist, Michael Chiago, that he is Tohono O’odham. I know Native voices have often been misrepresented in anthologies so the fact that Chiago gave permission to use his painting was reassuring to me, especially as the verse was not specifically sourced in the end matter.The second verse is labeled“African Lullaby (Akan)” in the table of contents. I looked online to discover thatthe Akan people are from the Guinea coast of the African continent. The illustratorfor the Akan verse, Meshack Asare, is a noted children's book creator from Ghana, where the Akan are an ethnicgroup.I appreciated the thoughtful verse/illustration pairings like those above or that of the Tsimshian “laughing song.” The poem is illustrated by a Tsimshian First Nations artist, Bill Helin and came from his own family.But there were also things about the volume that left me disappointed, uncomfortable, and a couple of times dismayed.Early on there is a page spread featuring the juxtaposition of an “English” lullabye with whichmost of us are familiar: “Hush-a-bye, baby, / On the tree top” and a “Chippewa” lullabye.  Again, there was nospecific source cited in the end matter for the “Chippewa” verse.  But the truly jarring and upsetting element was theillustration spanning the spread and the two poems. Northumbrian artist OliviaLomenech Gill depicted a tree in the center of the spread branching out to eachof the poems. There is a Native mother with her child on a cradleboard belowthe \"Chippewa\" verse on the right. On the left? The Mayflower ship, with “Mayflower 1620-1621” written in script abovethe “Hush-a-bye” lullabye.Let’s just think about that a moment. The event that symbolicallyrepresents the arrival of Europeans on this continent, which in turn led to thedevastation and decimation of Native populations through brutal events thatcontinue to resonate and dramatically impact the lives of contemporary Nativepeople today, is paired with the historical image of a Native woman and her child in peacefulrepose. I’m sure it was innocent, and even well-meaning, this Britishartist joining the two things. The baby hanging from a cradle in the treetop intentionallyechoes the depiction of the baby in the cradleboard.  But the end result is far from innocent; it's a painful pairing of images.Near the volume's end, I came to a page spread with three poems related to ghosts and skeletons. Two were labeled “African American,” and the first one went like this:                                          W’en de big owl whoops,               An de’ screech owl screeks,             An’ de win’ makes a howlin’ sound;  You liddle woolly heads                      Had better kiver up                                    Caze de “hants” is comin’ round.              I was so appalled that I searched for source information.  While this poem is not specifically sourced (only a relatively small number of the poems are; general sources are listed from which, presumably, the others came), I found online that it is from a 1922 book called Negro Folk Rhymes, collected by Thomas Talley (one of the general sources cited--why the poem wasn't specifically attributed to this collection I don't know). I did additional research and learned Talley was an African American chemistry professor at Fisk University and also a collector of African American folklore. I am not a scholar, and cannot speak to the issue of authenticity, or to the politics of publishing and race at that time. What I do know is this: that language and that imagery (“liddle woolly heads”?) reinforces hurtful, damaging stereotypes that have been used to demean and dehumanize African Americans for generations. Was that the intent here? Of course not. Does that render it harmless? Hardly. The choice to include it in a collection for children makes me angry and boggles my mind.I also had to wonder about the overall lack of balance regarding cultural diversity in the collection, and had questions about the cultural labels. Over half of the 148 entries are listed as \"English,\" perhaps not surprising in an anthology grounded in nursery rhymes but also curious in a volume with \"A Treasury...from Around the World\" in the subtitle. Other poems labels include (but aren't limited to) Scottish, Welsh, South African, Australian, Maori, Yiddish, and Trinidadian. Poems from North America include labels such as American,Chinese American, African American, Anglo American, and the names of various First/Native nations. And there are several labeled simply \"Latino.\"The deeper I read, the more the labeling made me uncomfortable. American versus Anglo American versus African American? Ok.... From this do I presume all the poems labeled English are Anglo in origin? (They looked to be.) Where are poems reflecting the multiethnicity of British identity?  What about those labeled simply American--how do we interpret that label culturally? There is mixed messaging here. Additionally, was there no way to trace the handful of \"Latino\" poems to specific countries or regions? If there wasn't I wanted to know why.I ended up wishing that rather than the labels, which I'm guessing were based on what was revealed in the sources consulted but collectively left me twitchy with discomfort, each poem had included a brief note on the page, which was done with the Tsimshian \"Laughing Song,\" that told what was, or wasn't, known about its cultural origins. Not what the compiler knew but what could have been discovered with additional research (such as the fact that \"Ojibwe\" is generally the preferred term today for \"Chippewa,\" or that in the source for one particular poem , the marvelous Pío Peep: TraditionalSpanish Nursery Rhymes, compiled by Alma Flor Ada and F. Isabel Campoy, it's noted that the verses are widely known across Latin America.)Conceptually, there are good intentions behind the creation of Over the Hills and Far Away, and there are marvelous moments within it. But I began to realize that this \"around the world,\" \"intercultural\" book--as is so often the case--presents diversity as something that is is an add-on to Whiteness and western culture, which dominate the selections. I couldn't help but contrast this volume with the 1992 book This Same Sky: A Collection of Poems from Around the World, edited by Naomi Shihab Nye, which privileges non-U.S., and often non-western voices, and another poetry anthology out this year, Please Excuse This Poem: 100 Poets for the Next Generation, compiled by Brett Fletcher Lauer and Lynn Melnick. Please Excuse This Poem, an anthology for teens, is also clearly intentionally multicultural yet never states this as its intent. The end result feels effortless and genuine, rich and authentic: a true reflection of who we are.It's true Over the Hills and Far Away is a very different book for a very different audience, comprised largely of poems I'm guessing are in the public domain. But Hammill was clearly open to broadly interpreting the definition of \"nursery rhyme,\" which is wonderful. Was it truly impossible to find more culturally diverse and authentic offerings that more widely span the globe? For me, Over the Hills and Far Away sometimes shines but overall falls short of, and in some ways seriously undermines, its best intentions."},
{"title": "What Does Thanksgiving Make You Think Of? ", "date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2015", "text": "No one, not one single person or family or toddler, is going to storm the doors of your library — be it public or school — and demand that you do a special Thanksgiving storytime.  Literally no one.  And yet.  And yet you, as a librarian, might feel compelled to offer a program along these lines.  Maybe because you’ve always done it.  Maybe because it’s easy and quick to pull together.  Maybe because all the teachers in your school are doing units on it and you want to support them.  Maybe because you think your patrons, the majority of your patrons that is, don’t really think about it as a “holiday” but as a more secular tradition.  But I want to urge you to stop and consider why you’re doing these programs and the messages they send to all your patrons, especially your Native/First Nations patrons.Chances are pretty good that, unless you are reading this from a reservation, you are reading this from occupied and stolen land.  In many cases, even if you are reading it from a reservation you are not on the true ancestral homes of the people who reside there but on government-created settlements.  You are on land that people were killed for. Can you sit with that for a few seconds?  Can you really? This is something I am acutely aware of in New Mexico, where we have 22 recognized tribes. I grew up playing with Native kids, I work with Native people, I serve Native children. Maybe, in other places, it’s a lesson you don’t have to think about as much. But it’s still true.Many years ago, I decided my library would stop putting up grinning turkeys and making displays with puns about FEASTS and GOBBLE.  We don’t have pilgrim coloring pages, we don’t make stacks of books that look like turkeys.  Let me assure you we still have piles of Thanksgiving books — picture books and non-fiction too.But November is also Native American Heritage Month. So at my library, instead of another story about sharing maize, we make a conscious effort to spotlight and celebrate books by Native American authors. You can too — and you can even tie it in with that “classic” Thanksgiving you might be reluctant to let go of. What do you think of when you think of Thanksgiving?I am sure many will have the same answers about family, community, and tradition.  If those are the things that are truly important to you about Thanksgiving, why not share messages about that through the works of Native authors?  This is a way you can help your patrons understand that Native Americans are still with us today — not just forgotten noble savages of the long-gone past bringing white people corn. If Thanksgiving makes you think about tradition and community, why not share Jingle Dancer by Cynthia Leitich Smith?  This picture book is about a young Muscogee Creek girl who is trying to find enough tin jingles to make her jingle dress special at a powwow. Readers get to meet the people in Jenna’s life and community and learn about the specialness of the Ojibway tradition of jingle dancing.If Thanksgiving makes you think about family and tradition, why not share Kunu’s Basket by Lee DeCora Francis?  In this picture book, Kunu becomes frustrated when he finds making a pack basket isn’t as easy as he imagined.  All the men on Indian Island do it, why can’t Kunu?  His grandfather helps him learn patience and practice in this story about Penobscot Indian Nation in Maine.If Thanksgiving makes you think about happiness and family togetherness, why not share Sweetest Kulu by Celina Kalluk? Throat singer Kalluk shares an Inuit welcome for a baby in this tender, wondrous picture book full of arctic animals and Inuit traditions.If Thanksgiving makes you think about cooperation and people coming together in peace and forgiveness, why not share with a class Hiawatha and the Peacemaker by Robbie Robertson? This longer picture book tells the story of how Hiawatha and the Peacemaker brought peace and united the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy in a model that would inspire the formation of the early American government.If Thanksgiving makes you think about thankfulness and gratitude, why not share Thanks to the Animals by Allen Sockabasin? Little Zoo Sap has fallen off the sled in the cold winter forest, but the animals all keep him warm.  When his father Joo Tum finds him, he thanks the animals for saving Zoo Sap in this story from Passamaquoddy storyteller Sockabasin.I’ve read Thanks to the Animals to kids several times during the Thanksgiving season and taken it to school visits when teachers requested a “Thanksgiving storytime” as outreach.  Not once ever has a kid or teacher said, “But this isn’t Thanksgiving!  I demand more pilgrims!”  Instead, they love hearing about Zoo Sap and all the animals.  Children understand the message of thanksgiving in the book and, like Joo Tum, they enjoy thanking the animals.  I also get a chance to discuss the Passamaquoddy tribe with the kids, which can be a great way to encourage adults to remember that Thanksgiving isn’t just about the same old story.We, as librarians and educators, can be leaders in changing and expanding that story. We shouldn’t only celebrate and promote these works for one month.  We should make them fundamental texts we are excited to share with patrons all the time.  The works of Native authors and illustrators are worth our spotlight every month but, particularly in November, we can use this month, this holiday we “celebrate” without a second thought, to really help our patrons go beyond the same old story, the same old displays, the same old lies.Additional Resources American Indian Perspectives on Thanksgiving from the National Museum of the American IndianHarvest Ceremony: Beyond the Thanksgiving Myth from the National Museum of the American IndianClassroom Lessons from the National Museum of the American IndianCurriculum Guide for Jingle Dancer from Cynthia Leitich Smith Teaching Guide for Kunu’s BasketMore info on Celina Kalluk, including a video of her throat singingExcerpt from the song and book Hiawatha and the Peacemaker Allen Sockabasin reading Thanks to the Animals in Passamaquoddy"},
{"title": "Thinking About Thanksgiving", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2015", "text": "What does this cover say, in a Thanksgiving display?In many libraries, because of space, the \"holiday\" books are stored in the back and brought out for each holiday, put on display in a place people can easily find them.  Whether intentionally or not, the way we display these supports the marketing of holidays, and October through December becomes an almost relentless push of Halloween, Day of the Dead, Thanksgiving, and Hannukah-Kwanzaa-Christmas displays in many libraries.  With the exception of Christmas, for which I think there are officially enough books published to saturate the demand, these displays in many libraries are fully depleted for each holiday, and when the books are returned are likely stored again, without weeding.  So, when was the last time you really looked at your Thanksgiving books?The story of  Thanksgiving that is commonly mythologized on school stages, with \"Pilgrims\" and \"Indians\" having a friendly potluck, is just that: mythology.  Oyate shares its resource \"Deconstructing the Myths of the First Thanksgiving\" on its website.   They credit the research done by Margaret M. Bruchac in collaboration with the Wampanoag Indian Program at the Plymouth Plantation, which also underpins her book co-authored with Catherine O'Neill Grace, 1621: A New Look at Thanksgiving.  Please take a moment to read through one of these resources, now, if you haven't before, as me summarizing the myths for you here would miss the point.  The upshot is that Thanksgiving is not a happy time for everyone, it didn't happen the way it does in the school play, and it is a time of mourning for many First Nations/Native people. Many Thanksgiving books on the market now attempt to be factually correct, yet still walk a strange line...following the traditional \"First Thanksgiving\" narrative thread from the White colonists' perspective, and just shifting the language so as not to be caught in an all-out lie.   Robert Merrill Bartlett's The Story of Thanksgiving was revised in 2001, the same year 1621: A New Look at Thanksgiving came out, yet still traces and holds up the myth of the first Thanksgiving: \"..two men name Squanto and Samoset appeared and made friends...\"  \"the Pilgrims wanted to celebrate their harvest...they held their first thanksgiving. They invited the Wampanoags to join them\" ... \"Today Thanksgiving is a happy time.\" (This book appears to be now, thankfully, out of print.)Other books don't even try, and people still ask for books like Arthur's Thanksgiving, where kids dress up as Pilgrims and Indians and put on a play...because that's what some of us remember doing at Thanksgiving and Thanksgiving is about \"tradition.\"  I'm doubtful though, that children appreciate being sold a lie. As 5th grader Taylor M. wrote to Debbie Reese, after reading the  Suppressed speech of Wamsutta (Frank B.) James:I thought about all the way back to Kindergarten, right before Thanksgiving break we would always get these coloring worksheets of the happy little Pilgrims and Indians giving each other things. Up until now, I didn’t really realize that that’s not how it happened. Showing the happy little cartoon Indian was a lie. I think Kindergarteners and young children should know what actually happened, not with gruesome details, but they should know more of the truth. How much truth does your Thanksgiving collection tell? When is the last time you evaluated each book for accuracy? Sadly, I have found I can't reliably trust professional reviews to evaluate Thanksgiving books, or most children's books with First Nations/Native content; I depend on the resources from Oyate and Debbie Reese's blog to help me parse the presentation, and ask questions when I can't tell for sure myself.   I wish more reviewers would do this, and I challenge you to try it, this month.  I can pretty much promise you librarians there is something in your Thanksgiving collection that is worth weeding, so this is good and easy practice.It is possible to have broader collections that allow for the many ways in which people approach this holiday, and tomorrow you will hear from Angie about how to develop your Thanksgiving display after your weeding.   To get you started:You can buy Oyate's full resource \"Thanksgiving: A Native Perspective\" as a stand alone, or within their book \"A Broken Flute,\" which includes many helpful articles and reviews of books you probably have in your library, but may never have really looked at through a First Nations/Native perspective.  If this is the first time you are checking out Oyate, make sure to explore everything in their \"Resources\" section.At American Indians in Children's Literature, Debbie Reese gathers links to her \"Posts About Thanksgiving\" on the left sidebar, just scroll down.And while we're on the topic of marketing holidays, check out Aya De Leon's blog post \"Queridos Gringos\" and take a look at your Day of the Dead materials before they go back into storage."},

Some readers may be ready to put this whole thing behind them, but manyothers are just starting to scratch the surface, and still more are trying to make sense of the whole situation.This is more than just people arguing about a single picture book. This conversation is just one piece of a bigger discussion that must beongoing, around issues that people of color and First/Native Nations havebeen raising for decades. The following (based on a very smart person's Facebook comment) is something that really resonates with me and, I think, sums the situation up beautifully:What's hard for white people, Ithink, is realizing that we can do things that are racist and sexist. Few meanto, and the challenge is in listening and learning and knowing that is the bestyou can do. Getting it right all the time is impossible. But being open andhumble is possible, even if it is very often uncomfortable or even painful. Ikeep reminding myself that facing that pain is less than what others haveendured.

What a feeling! I can’t tell youhow honored and happy I am to be here today, sharing this moment with such awonderful group of authors— congrats, Paula,Padma, and Vivek—and celebrating with aconferenceful of book lovers and people committed to the exploration ofcultures, identity, diversity, and the myriad ways in which we express thesethings. Thank you to the South Asia Book Award committee—especially RachelWeiss, for her tireless work putting this all so gracefully together, and KevinKing. Thank you to The South Asia National OutreachConsortium: SANOC. And a shoutout to DJ Rekha, whoseparties Basement Bhangra and Mutiny, in the late 90s in New York City provideda spark that partly set me off on my writing journey. And a huge thank you to my very patienthusband Bernard, my little bachoodis Leela Marie and Zoé Rani…and, especially, to the very special people who sinceI was a child encouraged my writing path and whose own journey was the maininspiration for me to want to get to know Bombay better: So this is for you, my Mommy-ji, Bapuji,and dear, dear brother, Raj.If as a child growing up in Wilbraham,Massachusetts—home of Friendly’s ice-cream!—and even later, as a much! biggerchild in New York City, I could have imagined that such a thing as the SouthAsia Book Award could exist, this kind ofcelebration of diverse voices from the diaspora...If my parents could have imagined itin their first days in the USA, when they were the first from both sides of thefamily to immigrate, where we were the only South Asians in our entire area,and were regularly asked what ‘kind’ of Indian we were—Cherokee? Apache?...Well, I guess I wouldn't have had somuch to write about later!One of the reasons I wrote my firstnovel, Born Confused [prequel to Bombay Blues] was to fill a holeon my childhood bookshelf with an Indian-American heroine. Heroines.Heroes. With an exploration of ‘brown’.And, many years after that, one of the reasons Irecently wrote Bombay Blues was to move beyond, below the skin and astrictly cultural framework.With an exploration of ‘blue’: the mood,the hue, the music.The wild blue yonder.And toforge my own connection with this motherland—Bombay:city of my mother’s birth, my brother’s, and the one where my parents met andmarried in an out-of-caste love marriage. A metropolis American-born me barelyknew—yet that was, is, literally, in my blood.The title Born Confused comes from the termABCD—one that in many ways clarified my writing path. It stands for AmericanBorn Confused Desi—desi meaning a person withroots in South Asia— and is a moniker South Asians ‘from’ South Asia have forthese second and now third generation Americans who are purportedly “confused”about where they come from. Where their roots lie.In fact, there are two versions of thisalphabet both quoted in Born Confused.The first:American Born Confused Desi EmigratedFrom Gujarat House In Jersey Keeping Lots of Motels Named Omkarnath PatelQuickly Reaching Success Through Underhanded Vicious Ways Xenophobic YetZestful.And:American Born Confused Desi EmigratedFrom Gujarat House In Jersey Kids Learning Medicine Now Owning Property QuiteReasonable Salary Two Uncles Visiting White Xenophobic YetZestful.So… zestful, I’ll take! But I have yetto meet an Omkarnath Patel. If there’s one in the room tonight, please makeyourself known!What I wanted to do through my characterDimple, across both books, is turn that C for Confused to a C for Creative.American Born Creative Desi.This seemed to me to be a more accuratedescription of the South Asians who peopled my world—the ones I met in New YorkCity, in the thriving music and arts scene there, but also the ones in my ownhome. These flesh-and-blood humans who were in fact shaping and creating theculture as they went along. As we went along. Like somany of the people who are in this room tonight!It seemed to embody the idea that thisNeither Here Nor There space is, in fact, a You Are Here.A viable identity, a truth in its ownright.A WE are here.And…now…here we are!A hyphenated identity—well, we are all of multiply hyphenatedidentities, if you go far back enough (for example, Latin-American,Indo-Chinese, Afro-Caribbean). But not only culturally: As well as in the senseof being composed of many parts we often struggle to bring together. Double,triple lives we strive to balance, harmonize (for example, having one lifeoutside of the home, one in it, in terms of society, sexuality, family,whatever it may be). We as humans are always-evolving jigsaws, constantlyfitting the pieces together, making and unmaking and remaking ourselves….And this hyphenated identity, I’ve cometo realize, doesn't mean that you're 50-50, half of each, not quite either.You can be 100-100.200-200!Zero!INFINITE.The city we all live as humans isMULTIPLICITY.A hyphen doesn't have to be a border: Itcan also be a bridge.It can also be a bridge.And it’s on the bridge—In the blur—The in-between—-Where life—the journey—truly occurs.Events shape this journey. This history.Herstory. People do, grand actions to little ones, too. But language does aswell: Language shapes history. Imagination makes reality. We can dream things into being,speak them into being. Write, debate, discuss—read them into being. Andit is wonderful that more and more voices are being heard andcelebrated—because only then can we come close to representing the diversityand richness of human experience, to even approximating a kind of truth:By revealing and reveling in ourmultidimensional selves.Because there are innumerable, untold (onlysome told) ways to be South Asian. Male. Female. Human.Our stories are our arsenal, our fuel.Our example:Of other ways to be.Alternatives.Coulds.Possibility.We’re a powerful chorus when we bringour voices together. When we make ourselves heard.Because we are all, in fact, a whollydifferent kind of ABCD: All Born Creative Dreamers. And we are creating,scripting our own stories to realize our own dreams, expand and define our ownspace.Our own spacES.And, all of you: Your stories AREstories. Never forget this.Never underestimate the value of yourown story.

Hearing that racist bullshit hurts me!!  Stop it!!!Person C: Gosh, Person B, why couldn't you be KIND in how you said that?Person A: [Hits someone with their car, intentionally or not.]Person B: Hey!!  You just hit me with your car, and... shit, this hurts, look, my leg is broken!!  Stop the car!!!Person C: Gosh, Person B, why couldn't you be KIND in how you said that?This is an expression of White fragility, which can take many forms.  Person C could also say, \"Why are you tearing that driver to shreds?\", or crack a joke that Person B is supposed to laugh at, despite the pain she's in (followed by a smiley face), or--here's the kicker--say \"How dare you bring race into this?\"  In my metaphor, that would be \"How dare you bring her driving skills into this?\"White people, we *have* to get tougher.  We have to learn to bear the discomfort of race-related criticism, and challenge ourselves to consider--no matter how someone informs us of the fact--that if we're being criticized, we should focus on apologizing for and learning from our words and actions, and not on the manner in which we're being educated.  Here are some tips that have helped me work through the discomfort when I've been called in on things:1. First, I take deep breaths, from my belly.  If I've been called on something in a public space, I try not to cry, lest my tears become a weapon (NB-I don't always succeed, more coming).  I try to get my throat to loosen up.2. I remind myself that the person educating me is doing so at risk to him/herself.  I need to thank them for that.3. I remind myself that White culture and White dominance WANT me to feel paralyzing, unproductive guilt and shame rather than a galvanizing desire to accept my imperfections, learn from them, and do better next time.4. I say, \"I'm sorry.\"  I do my homework.  And then I follow up with a more complete apology.We've seen some great examples of this in recent days.  And some not-so-great.I thought about ending with a funny GIF, but this really isn't funny.  This is about how we prioritize the pain experienced by human beings.  Studies have shown that White children as young as 7 believe that dark-skinned people are less susceptible to pain than White people and that White people feel less empathy for Black people experiencing pain than White people experiencing the same pain.  This translates directly into greater and better access to health care for White people.All this could make a conversation about children's literature seem, by contrast, trivial, but this is how we train our children, especially White children, to perpetuate--or interrupt--the status quo.   We are their gatekeepers to a better education.  And right now, we're not prioritizing White people's pain over equal pain expressed by Black people (as was done in the study I cite above).  We're prioritizing White people's discomfort with *the manner in which we are being informed of the pain we're causing people of color and First/Native Nations people* over the pain we're causing people of color and First/Native Nations people.  And that's just plain bullshit."},
{"title": "On Letting Go", "date": "Saturday, October 31, 2015", "text": "It's never easy discovering a serious fault with a book I originally appreciated greatly.It's never easy, and yet...what do I have to lose, really? What am I giving up when I can admit something may not be as wonderful as I originally thought?And so it is with A Fine Desert: Four Centuries, Four Families, and One Delicious Desert. I liked so much about it from the outset when I read and discussed it with colleagues last spring.  I still like so much about it: The small details, the big arc, the way it looks at continuity and change from such a child-friendly perspective.As for the much-debated way it handles the blackberry fool made in 1810 by an enslaved woman and child? I confess I glossed over much of it. The only image that gave me pause initially was the one in which the mother and child are closeted away eating the treat together. I remember asking, \"How is a child reader going to make sense of that scene without any explanation?\"  This idea of an unmediated experience with that part of the book was particularly worrisome to me. But while I did think briefly of children of color, of Black children, and wondered if it would generate a sense of shame or confusion, I read the author's and illustrator's notes, and let my vague sense of discomfort go.After all, there is so much wonderful in the book, in both the writing and the art. That contemporary family and community at the end brought it all home for me.  Yes, this is the world we live in, and I love it. So I've enthusiastically featured A Fine Desert in several talks to Wisconsin librarians.Fast forward to now. I've had ample opportunities to read various articulate opinions on the depiction of this enslaved woman and child. I've had ample opportunities to think. To consider. To learn.And I've changed my mind.I cannot ignore the voices of those who have helped me understand something I didn't consider before: No matter how thoughtful the intent was in depicting this mother and child, the end result is that it can be seen as perpetuating painful imagery of \"happy\" slaves.Am I ashamed I didn't see this myself? Yes. Because it's the kind of thing I'd like to think I wouldn't miss.But I'm not so ashamed that I'm going to dig in my heels.I can let go of A Fine Desert. Did I come to this decision easily? No. Am I sad about letting go of the book? Yes.But it's a small sadness.Yes, I still appreciate many other things about A Fine Dessert, but I can also accept that this is a fault it cannot overcome for me when it comes to recommending it to librarians and teachers."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: The Amazing Age of John Roy Lynch", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2015", "text": "by KT Horning John Roy Lynch is hardly a household name but he should be. Born into slavery in Mississippi in 1847, by age 22 he was appointed Justice of the Peace by the governor of Mississippi and that same year he was elected to the state House of Representatives. At age twenty-five, he was elected Speaker of the House in Mississippi and later that year he won national office as a member of the U.S. House of Representatives.And he truly did live in an amazing age, as referenced in the title of this new picture-book biography by Chris Barton with illustrations by Don Tate.Most of the children's nonfiction books dealing with African Americans that we see these days are historical, and, of these, most are either set during slavery times or during the U.S. Civil Rights Movement.  They are important stories to tell, to be sure, but the steady stream of them year after year contribute to a body of what one of my colleagues on the Coretta Scott King Award Committee once referred to as \"a literature of despair.\"  Because he was born in 1847, the first part of Lynch's story does take place during slavery times, but the narrative moves quickly to his life during the Reconstruction era where he learned to read, bought land, studied law, became a noted orator, and got elected to public office. The twelve years that followed the end of the Civil War did indeed make for an amazing age -- not just for Lynch but for African Americans throughout the South. From the author's note, we learn that there were sixteen African Americans from Southern states who served in the U.S. Congress from 1870 to 1877. For comparison, from 1902 to 1972, there were zero.My question as I was reading this book is why have I never read anything about this man before? Or, for that matter, any of the nearly two thousand other elected officials?  It made me think of an episode of African American Lives, the PBS series about genealogy created by Henry Louis Gates, that I saw several years ago. I remembered seeing comedian Chris Rock break down and cry when he learned that his great-great-grandfather had been elected to  the South Carolina House of Representatives during this same era. He explained his emotional reaction: \"If I had known this it would have taken away the inevitability that I was going to be nothing.\"The man and his story are amazing, and it's a story all children should know. But what is equally amazing is the telling. Chris Barton pulls no punches when writing about the White resistance to change. He doesn't attribute racist actions to one bad slave owner or overseer as is so often the case in children's books depicting slavery.   Speaking of the vindictive wife of Lynch's owner, he writes: \"She was not alone in rage and spite and hurt and lashing out. The leaders of the South reacted the same way to the election of a president -- Abraham Lincoln -- who was opposed to slavery.\" Barton describes the scene after Emancipation: \"Freedom, however, soon turned sour. Mississippi whites passed laws to make Mississippi blacks into slaves under different names: 'Apprentices.' 'Vagrants.' 'Convicts.' \" Later on, he refers to members of the KKK as \"white terrorists.\"I can't recall when I've seen a book for children that is so deliberate about calling out racism for what it is. And he does it with such clear, simple language, making this complex period in history accessible to young readers, just as Don Tate's clear stylized illustrations do.  Even though the illustrations use a cartoon style, there are no happy, smiling slaves here. What we see instead is the pain and suffering they endured and later, the look of pride and determination on the face of John Roy Lynch, a free man. I have to admit, I was initially taken aback when I read about Lynch's father, an Irish overseer, \"loving\" Lynch's mother, an enslaved woman. These relationships could never really be equal. And loving? Hmmm. So I went directly to the source: Lynch's own autobiography,  Reminiscences of an Active Life, where he did characterize his parents' relationship as a loving one and described the struggles they went through to try to get married.  So if their love was a myth, it was one John Roy Lynch believed himself. Although Lynch's story as presented here ends with Reconstruction, a detailed timeline at the book's end fills out the rest of his life, side-by-side with events occurring on a state and national level, such as the U.S. Supreme Court striking down the Civil Rights Act of 1875 eight years after it passed.Taken as a whole, Chris Barton's book can serve as a model for White authors who choose to write about African American history for children.  He obviously respects the intelligence of young readers and he refuses to sugarcoat the uglier aspects of our history. And in bringing this story to light, he presents a truth that takes away that sad inevitability that Chris Rock and many others have grown up with.   Like John Roy Lynch and his age, they are filled with \"amazing promise and potential.\""},
{"title": "On Safety and Comfort... Or Rather, Safety vs. Comfort", "date": "Tuesday, October 27, 2015", "text": "As a White person, I hear a lot about \"safe spaces\".  We White people are always stressing about how to make something \"a safe space\", or thanking each other for creating one.  A noble intention if ever there was one; and yet, as Brendan Kiely points out:\"...there are, without a doubt, many of us who wake up with good intentions, but as we proceed with our day, impact others in devastating and destructive ways—and it is the impact, not the intention, that lasts. Therefore it is the road from those intentions to those impacts that we need to be critical of, that we need to better understand, that we need help deconstructing so we can lessen, avoid, or even stop, each other from delivering those harmful impacts.\"I've been trying to examine the road from good intentions to harmful impacts ever since I read those lines, and that has led me to question the notion of a safe space.Question 1 - Safe for whom?  Whose experience of \"safety\" are we concerned with?Too often, I believe, a space is deemed \"safe\" or \"unsafe\" depending on the experiences of White people in those spaces.  When we think about safety, let's de-centralize Whiteness.  And that leads me to ask...Question 2 - What do we mean by \"safe\"?Safe should mean, \"I won't get attacked for what I say\" or \"I won't get fired for what I say\" (pausing here to note that many, many people have been fired for doing anti-racist work; this concern is real).  I think we White people are seldom actually worried about those things when we talk about \"safe spaces\".  Sure, sometimes, we are.  But unless you go \"old-school racist\" (what we here at Reading While White refer to as bigotry) or hard-core anti-racist, we White people are pretty much safe from physical attack or job loss as a result of a conversation about race.But even though our spaces are, mostly, safe, we get uncomfortable so easily.  I get uncomfortable when people challenge me, or rather, accurately describe something I've said as problematic, without conforming to the White norm of apologizing a million times first, or taking me aside and telling me gently and privately.  I may react to such situations by-Saying \"well, just to play devil's advocate...\" which is really just a passive aggressive of saying what I truly think, without having to own it--why would anyone want to advocate for the devil?-Saying \"hang on, let's pause and take a deep breath and look at this calmly,\" invoking the White luxury of reacting intellectually, rather than immediately and emotionally, to racism.-Launching into an angry tirade, describing how I've worked hard to get everything I've got/got passed over for a promotion because of affirmative action/am marginalized along another identifier, as if any of that erases my Whiteness.-Burst into tears.  This is really real.  Watch for another post from me in the future devoted entirely to this subject.All of these are tactics I can use as a White person to, intentionally or involuntarily, thwart someone's attempt to interrupt White privilege.  All of these actions demand that energy be expended to comfort me, or play by my White rules, rather than actually acknowledge and discuss the problematic nature of whatever it was I said.  And these actions are especially frustrating for people of color and First/Native Nations people who find themselves in the position of having to take care of someone who just said something problematic.Let's face it.  Usually, when White people talk about a \"safe space\", what we really mean is \"a space that is comfortable for me.\"  Or, to take it a step further, \"a space in which other people censor themselves to protect me.\"  To paraphrase: \"A space that is comfortable for White people and unsafe for everyone else.\"So let's stop worrying so much about creating comfortable spaces and worry more about whether our spaces are truly safe for all.  Yes, be careful before you say something that might get you fired.  But creating a space that is truly safe for people of color and First/Native Nations people often necessitates making that space uncomfortable for White people.The world needs more uncomfortable spaces.  I hope Reading While White becomes one of them."},
{"title": "A Matter of Trust", "date": "Thursday, October 22, 2015", "text": "In their novel All American Boys, Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely confront racism head-on, tackling police bias and violence and White privilege, in a story that moves back and forth between the perspective of two teens, one Black, one White. This novel by two authors, one Black, one White, has me continuing to think about the question of who writes what, and reflecting on what it means to me as a reader. Never, for one minute, did I wonder about the authenticity of Rashad Butler, the book’s African American main character, and his family and Black and Latino friends. By contrast, I don’t know what to make of the portrayal of Kara in A.L. Sonnichsen’s Red Butterfly, about a Chinese girl living with her adoptive White mother in China. The novel adds unusual and weighty complexities to an adoption story (which is never an uncomplicated topic) when Kara discovers her mother has never officially adopted her; it’s why they live a life of such seclusion in China, and also why they’ve never been able to go to the United States, where her adoptive father is—her mother has no papers for Kara, an infant she found abandoned while living in China. When the authorities finally discover them, Kara is sent to an orphanage, and eventually to a another family in the U.S., all while experiencing understandably conflicted feelings about her White mother, who loves her and whom she loves, and her new family. What is the principle difference between these books when it comes to evaluating them for me? In short, All American Boys co-author Jason Reynolds is Black.  A. L. Sonnichsen, the author of Red Butterfly, is White. She grew up in Hong Kong, spent time in China as an adult, and adopted a child from China after a lengthy time fostering her. She did not approach this story ungrounded or uninformed. Still, how do I know if her portrayal of Kara and her situation is accurate and authentic culturally, not to mention emotionally? (I mean that as genuine question, not one weighted with judgment: I really am not sure but I am struggling.) Which brings me to a simple truth: If I am reading a fictional book focusing on the experience of someone who is African American, or Chinese, or Puerto Rican, or Lakota and the author is writing from the perspective of a cultural insider, I don’t question the authenticity of that portrayal. (Although there have been authors who make claims of Native heritage in particular that are spurious, so we can’t always take everything stated as true.)  I take what I am reading first and foremost at face value, as one story that offers one perspective from a reliable source. But if the writer is not African American or Chinese or Puerto Rican or Lakota, I want to know what gives her or him the authority to write that character and situation. Asking the critical questions of “who can” and “who can’t” doesn’t change the fact that, always, someone will.  For me the question of “can you write” or “should you write,” the complexities of which have been explored probingly and eloquently on this blog and elsewhere, comes down to a matter of trust when I have a book in hand.  And what I care about at that point is whether the author had the knowledge and understanding and experience to write that character and situation reliably.  It might be incredibly literary, but that doesn’t mean it’s right.To answer that question, I start from a position of skeptical.  In other words, I don’t give my trust away easily. I try not to anyway.It’s a matter of trust for children, too. As an adult, I know to ask questions. I’m still learning to probe more deeply, but at least I know to be skeptical. (Though I think I’m not always skeptical enough.)  Children don’t know to ask unless they’ve been taught to do so. Or they’ve learned to ask because they’ve seen essential aspects of their own identity misrepresented, misunderstood, whitewashed. The matter of trust becomes profoundly important when we think of those children.  As a parent, I remember the trust it required that first time I sent my daughter off to school when she was starting kindergarten. It was a little terrifying.  Now I try to imagine being the parent of a child of color or First/Native Nations child. What layers of fear surround the school experience for them that I can't begin to understand, other than in an effort to be an empathetic outsider? I imagine some of that fear comes from wondering what might be said or done as their children begin to move through school—what expectations will or won’t be placed upon them, what judgments will or won’t be made, what opportunities will they or won’t they be given because of racism. And I imagine at least some of that fear may come from wondering what it is they'll be asked to read and see. What depictions of experience reflecting or denigrating or negating their racial and cultural identity will they be shown, generally with innocent or even the best intentions? I imagine all of that. And I’m writing about it here. But my empathy has limits. It can even be wrong. So what I can’t imagine is making the leap from such thinking to building an entire book around an experience I cannot truly understand from the inside out.   I’m not a novelist. But I am a reader and critic. And I confess, more and more I find myself not knowing what to do with books by White authors featuring primary characters of color.  I’m not sure anymore what it will take for me to trust that they’ve done it well, and by well I mean accurately, authentically, so that a cultural insider will say “Yes, this works.” (And that’s not to assume a homogony of opinion among such readers.)None of this means I won’t be moved or entertained by what they’ve written.  And then I’ll wrestle with what I know and what I feel I need to find out in order to decide if I can feel confident recommending it to teachers and librarians. I won’t always get answers or assurances.  I’m not convinced it’s absolutely impossible to write responsibly outside one’s own culture. But in general, my skepticism is growing regarding whom to trust."},

Put simply, the novel is about two boys,one black, one white, who must decide what role they will each play in theircommunity after the black boy is brutalized by a white cop and the white boywitnesses it happen. And while the story is told in alternating chapters fromthe two boys’ points of view, it is also about the effect the violentinteraction has on the families, friends, teachers, and other community membersaround the two boys. For the last three weeks, Jason and I have been doing nearlythree presentations a day to middle schools, high schools, libraries,bookstores, and non-profit organizations in cities across the country. At eachevent, we have to be clear, concise, and direct, because everywhere we go, nomatter the demographics of the community we’re speaking to, we’re talking aboutpolice brutality, racism, institutional racism, and white privilege. We feelcommitted, and we try to remain as humble and honest as possible, because it isa hard conversation to have, but we have been invited to these places to haveit, so we’re going for it. As I sat on the stage in DC, and looked out over the crowdof 300 students in the auditorium, I was reminded of the courage and honesty ofthe kids who deal with all of these issues in a real way everyday. They askedtough questions: “Why are more people of color the victims of policebrutality?” “Why does it feel like my neighborhood is under Marshall law?” “Doyou think Black Lives Matter or All Lives Matter, and why?” We’ve been answering these questions everyday, and by beingforced to speak about it all so often and so publicly, I’ve grown used toanswering these questions as quickly and directly as possible, while stilltrying to be thoughtful and conscious of context and impact—but I know I needto try much harder to be more thoughtful of both. This particular DC school’s population was very diverse (inthe true sense of the word), and while I do not have the actual statistics ofthe demographics, a scan of the crowd gave me the impression that there was abroad mix of black, white, Asian, and Latino students—and we were conscious totry to answer questions from kids of all backgrounds. We always carve out asubstantial portion of our presentation for questions, because no matter wherewe are kids always have tons of questions. And at this event, I saw a white boyin the third row with his hand up for nearly the entire time. Before we left, Ithought I should call on him. When I did he asked, “Do you think you will turn awaywhite readers from your book by having a white cop beat a black boy in thefirst chapter? Are you afraid that by writing a book like this, you will turnaway white readers from your book, or even turn away more white people from thewhole Black Lives Matters movement?”I was stunned. I’d thought about people not liking the book.I’d thought about the danger of someone hearing about the book and dismissingit before reading it—not realizing the complexities and nuances Jason and Itried very hard to add to all the characters’ lives in the novel, copsincluded. But I’d never thought that the book might do danger to the verypeople I claimed to be working with in the Black Lives Matters movement. I hadto take a breath. I’m so glad I did, because if I’d just answered straight fromthe gut, I’d have said something dumb, no matter how factually correct, and Iwould have done exactly what he was warning me about.After the breath, I gave him the short, most honest answer Icould after he made me reflect on it. “Yes,” I said. “But I’d like to explain.”I don’t know where the question was coming from. He couldhave been the one kid in class arguing that All Lives Matter. He might have hada police officer in the family. He might have been arguing that by talkingabout race, we make it all much worse. But he also might have been genuinelyworried—maybe he was struggling with how to talk to other white people aboutall these difficult topics, too?I wanted to address his question honestly, but not in adefensive way, not in a condescending way—I was talking to another whiteperson, someone I hoped, if he read Quinn’s narrative in the novel, might feelinspired to further educate himself about the tentacle-like effects of whiteprivilege as they reach out in all directions around him, even if he is in avery diverse community.As a white man, I don’t believe I should take an “us” versus“them” approach to other white people. How can I? Because I’ve begun to thinkand feel more critically about my own white privilege than I used to, have Isomehow abandoned my whiteness? No. The white boy in the third row is also me. How do I sitin his shoes, shoes that I can most easily slip into, and dialogue with the manon stage imploring everyone to recognize why the Black Lives Matter movement shouldn’tbe seen as a threat to our community and country, but instead is simply anotherstep in the long march for social justice and equity?I took a little longer than usual answering his question. Iexplained that we tried to recognize the humanity of all the characters in thebook, including the police officers, and we tried to be as crystal clear andhonest about the fears all these characters have, what each of them wants toprotect, and how the recognition of those fears and the decision to confrontthem shape the narrative arc of the book. In a sense, we hoped that we couldwrite a book that didn’t push anyone away, but rather recognized and honoredthe nuances and complexities in the fictional community in the novel, as a wayto recognize those same nuances and complexities that exist in the real world.I don’t think there are many people in the world who wake up in the morning,twist their moustaches and contemplate their evil, villainous plans for theday. But there are, without a doubt, many of us who wake up with goodintentions, but as we proceed with our day, impact others in devastating and destructiveways—and it is the impact, not the intention, that lasts. Therefore it is theroad from those intentions to those impacts that we need to be critical of,that we need to better understand, that we need help deconstructing so we canlessen, avoid, or even stop, each other from delivering those harmful impacts.I believe, at the end of the day, there are more of us whowant to lessen that harmful impact, and we all need help (especially those ofus who are white) holding each other accountable. I’m grateful for my wife, myfriends, and my family, who all help me in this, and I’m grateful too to allthe people I’m meeting while out on the road talking about All American Boys. For example, elsewhere on the tour, at another festival, amiddle aged white man walked up to me and Jason and told us that he was thefather of two black boys he and his white wife had adopted.  He told us that he was reading All AmericanBoys with his sons and, in effect, he explained that it was just one more smallpiece in his on-going process of trying to better understand his own life incomparison and contrast to his sons’ lives. “When I heard my sons talking to meabout their lives, I had to listen,” he said. “So I’ve been listening andlearning and after years of doing this I feel a little more like a whole man.” Those words nearly broke my heart. I could have sobbed inthe convention hall. Instead, I swallowed them as a reminder that I need to doa better job, too. That I’ll always need to do a better job. That there is noarrival point. I’ll never arrive at some point where I’m outside the system ofsystemic racism—I’ll always be in it, and because I am, I have to do the bestjob possible calling people into the conversation that recognizes it, in orderto do the work to try to deconstruct it. I’ll always need to do a better job“calling people in” rather than “calling people out.”So, thank you white boy in the third row. Thank you for callingme back in.________________________________________________Brendan Kiely received an MFA in creative writing from The City College of New York.

{"title": "Some Swoon-Worthy Women in Children's Literature", "date": "Sunday, October 18, 2015", "text": "I confess that the recent article in NY Magazine about crush-worthy men in children's literature had me flashing back to that subway incident of five years ago.  I was filled with rage, and let it out on Twitter:Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit, but I was angry.  This sort of thing happens every time a mainstream media outlet decides to write about children's literature: Someone skims the surface and deems themself expert enough to write about us.  This one struck a nerve with me, though, because I see this adoration within the field as well--and it translates directly into more money and opportunities for White men.Good-looking men in this field, particularly White men, go straight to the top and cash in.  (Christian Robinson was the only man of color named in this article--where the heckedy heck was Christopher Myers?  Gene Luen Yang?  Matt de la Pena?  Kadir Nelson?)  It's true of authors, illustrators, and librarians.  And I can count the number of times I've heard one of these hotshots name his White-man-privilege in public on one hand.So, let's balance the scales a bit, shall we?  There are women in this field who should be rockstars, and women of color and First/Native Nations women have to work the hardest to get an iota of the recognition that some of these dudes get for showing up.  I mean--have y'all read Zetta Elliott's books?  Go read Bird and A Wish After Midnight and Room In My Heart (I'll still be here when you get back).  Let's throw a parade every time Grace Lin comes to town.  Coe Booth and Jenny Han deserve followings on par with the John Green devotees.  How about we crowd around Rukhsana Khan or Cynthia Leitich Smith at the next party?  Let's feature illustrators Vanessa Brantley-Newton and Julie Flett on bookmarks, pamphlets, calendars, and blogs.  I want to see lines wrapping around the block for Kashmira Sheth and Kat Yeh. And Yuyi Morales--well, everything about her just makes me swoon.Let's give it up for the women of color and First/Native Nations women who make this field great, who work twice as hard for half as much.  Who am I missing?  List it in the comments."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: First Man", "date": "Thursday, October 15, 2015", "text": "by Sam BloomIn late 1909, Robert Peary and Frederick Cook feuded bitterly—and publicly—over whom had first “discovered” the North Pole. At that point in time, Matthew Henson was a virtual unknown; after all, he was a Black man living in the U.S., so why would the fact that he actually beat Peary (a White man) to the Pole count for anything? As Simon Schwartz writes in the introduction to his latest work imported for readers here in the U.S., First Man: Reimagining Matthew Henson (translated by Laura Watkinson and published by Graphic Universe), “Western culture seems to be based in an objective view of history and the world in which we live” (p. 4). A good point, but regrettably it’s Schwartz’s very own “objective view of history and the world,” and his stereotyped depictions of Greenlandic Inuit, that sinks this graphic novel.I’m a pretty voracious comics reader, and I’d never read anything from Schwartz, so I was thrilled to see a new title from the German author/illustrator. Plus, I was woefully unversed on the life of Henson, so I started First Man with a great deal of anticipation. I soon learned that Henson was quite the adventurer: sailing the seas as a teenager; accompanying Peary on a surveying expedition in Nicaragua (to investigate the feasibility of a shipping route between oceans that would eventually become the Panama Canal); acting as Peary’s “faithful black servant” on many journeys to Greenland and attempts at the North Pole. It was on these trips to the far north where Henson made a lasting impression on the Inuit, who dubbed him Mahri Pahluk (“Matthew, the Kind One”). This fact, according to Schwartz’s introduction (pp. 4-5), led him to create First Man.I absolutely burned through my first reading, gobsmacked mostly by the brilliant job Schwartz does portraying the “historical injustice” of “Henson’s lack of recognition” in the history books (p. 4). It’s obvious that Schwartz is passionate (almost to a fault) about his subject; anything resembling a flaw in Henson’s persona gets swept under the rug, while Peary conversely is raked through the coals (for example, both men had affairs in Greenland, but only Peary’s doings are shown here). But though I was emotionally gutted on my first reading, it was during my second time through that I began to feel really and truly queasy.When you’re a member of the dominant culture, racism can be hard to spot at times. This is what I told myself after finishing that second reading; I was trying to justify how I had not been previously able to see the stereotypes that Schwartz perpetuates here (and that we see over and over again in literary depictions of people of First/Native Nations).Throughout the book, Schwartz uses Inuit-inspired art to symbolize Henson (and other characters). (Schwartz does not include any notes of whether he vetted the art, or anything involving the Native Greenlanders, with a person of Greenlandic Inuit descent.) On page 51, a grizzled, elderly Native Greenlander is the first to refer to Henson as “Mahri Pahluk,” a look of wonder in the old man’s eyes. As everyone else goes about their business, the “shaman” (as he is later referred, on page 80) uses his staff to draw a mystical-looking picture in the snow, an image that implies he believes Henson has some kind of powers (and that echoes the “mask” Henson wears in the Inuit art sections of the book). Later, the “shaman” leads Henson to “massive meteorites that are sacred to the Inuit” (p. 155), where Henson has a supernatural experience. All the while, Henson grumbles that he doesn’t know what is going on, apparently following the old man because of the squiggly lines of mysticism emanating off of his body. This exotification of Inuit culture is all too familiar in children’s literature.In Nina’s review of Jump Back, Paul, she discusses the inherent problems of an outsider writing dialect. Here, Schwartz uses what I thought of as “Inuit storyteller voice”; the results are predictably insulting. After the scene with Matthew, the old man and the meteorites, “[T]he devil Tahnusuk drove the first wedge into the group” (p. 64). Eventually Peary discovers the meteorites and arranges to have them shipped back to New York; the “Inuit storyteller voice” reads, “And while the Oopernadeet [Americans] dragged away the three sacred stones, the Raven cast out the shaman for his betrayal and gave him to the devil Tahnusuk” (p. 81); in the next panel we see the old man falling to his death from a high cliff. On pages 94-95, describing the Americans’ arrival at what would be the expedition in which Henson reached the North Pole, Schwartz uses a two-page spread with Inuit-inspired art and the “Inuit storyteller voice,” including the cringe-worthy line, “The breath of Tahnusuk clung to the visitors” (p. 94).The book ends in 1962, with a group of Greenlandic Inuit kids sitting around reading a Superman comic book (to Schwartz’s credit, the kids are dressed realistically and without stereotype). An old man makes the kids put away “that garbage” so he can slip into the “Inuit storyteller voice” and share Mahri Pahluk’s tale—as the group sits on an ice floe in the shape of the tracing the “shaman” had made in the snow when he first met Henson—“And among those same Oopernadeet, there was also Mahri Pahluk… who was the first man to defeat Tahnusuk but who could not escape the Devil’s gaze” (p. 152).In his introduction, Schwartz admits, “I am not a historian but a graphic novelist” (p. 5). That’s all fine and dandy, but some of Schwartz's choices at revisionist history did leave me scratching my head. A timeline in the backmatter clears up some things, but not others, leaving a blurry line between fact and fiction. The sacred stones really did exist, and Peary actually did have them shipped back to New York City. But did the Inuit really admire Henson enough to trust him with the knowledge of those same stones? Was there really a “shaman” who jumped (or was pushed) off that cliff? Do the Inuit really believe in “Tahnusuk,” the devil that is referenced repeatedly by the “Inuit storyteller voice”? And did the Native Greenlanders really live in tipis, as Schwartz depicts here? I am not sure of any of these things, but if I were Simon Schwartz, I would have been absolutely certain to find out (and then name my sources). While I agree that Henson’s story must be told, how unfortunate that in doing so Schwartz perpetuates stereotypes of the very people whose respect toward Henson was the impetus for this story. You see, people of First/Native Nations have had their stories ruined by those outside of their culture for far too long; by continuing that sad tradition, Schwartz leaves his young readers out in the cold."},
{"title": "National Book Awards: A Very White Longlist", "date": "Tuesday, October 13, 2015", "text": "Oh, National Book Award, you are breaking my heart! When the longlist of National Book Award finalists was announced a few weeks ago, I was struck first and foremost by the lack of diversity on the list.Okay, so there's one book by two African-American authors, there's one book about a gay kid, and beyond that it's White, White, White, White, White, White, White, White, and White.I'm not trying to take away from these books. I appreciated  the atmospheric weirdness of Bone Gap and am looking forward to Steve Sheinkin's biography of Daniel Ellsberg, which I hear is amazing. I always enjoy a good M. T. Anderson, and am interested in seeing not one but two first novels  represented on the list, so I will definitely take a closer look at those. And I will no doubt be reading the others, just to keep up with current events.  Walk the Earth a Stranger, for example, has been heavily criticized for its treatment of Native peoples on Debbie Reese's blog, American Indians in Children's Literature. I feel obliged to give it a read.But what I really want to be thinking and talking about instead is All-American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brandon Kiely and Shadowshaper by Daniel José Older and Everything Everything by Nicola Yoon. These are the books everyone is buzzing about.  Why are none of them on the long list? The National Book Award works differently from most other awards in the children's and young adult literature world. Publishers have to nominate titles for consideration, and there is a submission fee of $135 for each book submitted.  That really limits the number of books any one publisher can afford to submit, and it also closes out many smaller publishers who can't afford to shell out the money for a submission, not to mention what they would have to pay should a book become a finalist. In that case, they would have to pay $3,000 into a promotional campaign and pay for their authors to attend the ceremony.  The chairperson of each judging panel may request a book be submitted for consideration, but with these, the publisher must still agree to all of the above payments.  So I wonder: were books by authors of color even submitted by their publishers? If not submitted, were they requested? Or were they submitted and ruled not worthy of being on the longlist?  There's no way of knowing, really, although G. Neri, a judge on this year's panel, may have offered some hints in when he revealed his Top 25 favorites that didn't make the list. His extended list is only a little bit more diverse -- he includes a handful of books by authors of color. But even so, his is still a pretty White list, especially if you add in the ten finalists. Last year the diversity represented in the NBA shortlist was thought to be so notable that I was asked to blog about it.  I didn't actually find it quite as unusual as the people over at The Conversation did, given that most of the books were still by White authors, but the end result was that Jacqueline Woodson won the award for Brown Girl Dreaming, a shining moment that was tainted by the racist joke Master of Ceremonies Daniel Handler made right after she accepted the award. Jackie wrote a beautiful opinion piece on this for the New York Times, called \"The Pain of the Watermelon Joke.\" Brown Girl Dreaming went on to win the Coretta Scott King Award, a Newbery Honor, and a Sibert Honor. Now it's almost a year later. Are we any wiser?  I'm not sure we are if this letter to the editor at Horn Book is any indication.  Do our books -- and book awards -- reflect any more diversity?  I don't think so.I'm not saying that I think an author of color should win the National Book Award every year. But I do think they should have at least a few more places at the table, especially when they are writing such excellent books as All-American Boys, Shadowshaper, and Everything, Everything. What would it take to get them there?Tomorrow we'll learn the names of the five finalists in each category. I'm not sure I can muster up a whole lot of enthusiasm. Chances are, I'll be busy reading The Green Bicycle by Haifaa Al Monsour. My bookstore just emailed to let me know they have it on hold for me. I can't wait to read it.UPDATE 09/14/2015: And an Even Whiter Shortlist  The NBA finalists were announced this morning.

{"title": "Guest Blogger: Ibi Zoboi", "date": "Monday, October 12, 2015", "text": "ReadingWhile White is pleased to host occasional guest bloggers who offer their ownperspectives on race and books for children and teens.  READINGWHILE BLACK Or, ForColored Children Who Considered Literary Suicide When the Rainbow Wasn’t Enough               by Ibi Zoboi “I don’tlike to read” is a something I hear very often in New York City public schools,which I’ve learned to translate as, “I don’t like to read what my teachers makeme read.” Which, in fact, does not always mean, “I don’t like to read booksthat don’t reflect my experiences.”I once askeda class of Brooklyn ninth graders, many of whom were avid readers, if they’dlike to see a Twilight or Harry Potter set in the ‘hood. They all shouted no. Ididn’t ask them why. I already knew the answer.Mychildren’s school has an annual book fair. I have a hand in selecting thetitles sold there, and of course, I pick out a wide range of diverse books thatreflect the school’s demographic (which isn’t very many). I handed a copy ofChristopher Grant’s Teenie, with a beautiful black girl on the cover, to abeautiful black girl. She scrunched up her face and shook her head, as if I’djust handed her a plate of chocolate-covered Brussels sprouts. She’d alreadybought two John Green novels—neither of which had any black girls on the cover,or in them.As I’mwriting this, my almost 11-year-old comes over to announce that she’s justfinished reading Edwidge Danticat’s new YA novel, Untwine. She tells me to readit soon so we can discuss. Yesterday, my almost 13-year-old returned JulieMurphy’s Dumplin’ to me. “How was it?” I asked. “It was interesting,” she said.“It’s not as vanilla as the other book. It’s not vanilla at all.”  By vanilla,she means white. Not just white people, but a white feel, a white tone. A bookcan have only white characters and feel very much not-vanilla—there’s somethinguniversal about the voice, the characters, and the themes. She’s probably heardme say this about books. And maybe, in some indirect way, I’ve taught mydaughters how to read like this. Because their mother is a children’s bookwriter, and has to read the canon as part of her job, my daughters are privy tomost of the award-winning, bestselling, and even some of the obscure, andunder-the-radar children’s books. This sets them apart from their peers, andmaybe their ELA teachers, too. I tell them they’re privileged in this sense.They’re little black girls who love to read, and own books, and have parentsand grandparents who read. This is their black privilege.Blackprivilege includes the art of biculturalism. The very nature of being black andconsuming media inundated with the white experience warrants biculturalism. OurFriday Family TV night line-up confirms the range in what we canappreciate—from Blackish (a hit or miss in our house), Fresh off the Boat, andeven The Goldbergs (with its many references to black music) to the veryvanilla The Middle. This is howwe read. My daughters and I can enjoy Laura Ruby’s Bone Gap for its voice andsetting and characters, as much as we can find truth in Renee Watson’s This Side of Home. I’ve been trained to do this all my life as a student, though,without having a Renee Watson or Jackie Woodson to balance out the Shakespeare,William Golding, Stephen Crane, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. The veryfirst black author I read was Alex Haley. I read Queen in the eleventh gradebecause Halle Berry starred in the TV adaptation. I discovered the mirror inAlex Haley’s books in a roundabout way—through a Hollywood movie star wholooked like me (according to the cute boys in high school).  As a result, I discovered a whole world ofslave narratives that provided mirrors within mirrors which allowed me to seethe full trajectory of my existence. They were the history lessons I’d neverlearned in school. Because of Alex Haley, I was able to contextualizenineteenth century feminism via the Bronte sisters and Charlotte Perkins Gilman.Edgar Allan Poe stories paled in comparison to my understanding of the horrorsof slavery. Later in college, while working in bookstore, I sought out blackwomen poets to better appreciate Emily Dickinson. Not the other way around.Now, as anadult and a children’s book writer, I can immerse myself in Laini Taylor’sbooks knowing that while this sort of grandiose mythological world-building isvirtually absent in books featuring characters of color, there are still themagical worlds of Wole Sonyika, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and Toni Morrison that have yet to make their way into YA novels. YA authorMeg Rosoff recently stated that every single book out there in the world canprovide narrative context for all marginalized readers. This has been thethinking since the advent of the written mode, and it’s why Beowulf is stilltaught in high school English classes, even in predominantly black schools.Whiteness and Western mythology as a default narrative was the only way inwhich colonialism was allowed to take root and spread throughout theworld—beginning with, what some could consider, the holiest of all books. Mymother-in-law was an English professor and I once asked her what she read as achild growing up in Trinidad. She read British classics way before she read anyHarlem Renaissance writers. My husband is, and has always been, an avid reader.He actually owned books and made frequent trips to the library growing up inTrinidad and Liberia. He’d never read a book about black boys. Yet, hediscovered the magic of story in Frank Herbert’s Dune and in the works ofMarion Zimmer Bradley, Isaac Asimov, and Phillip K. Dick. He’d read OctaviaButler without knowing that she was a black woman. This sort of literary biculturalism is why we have an Octavia Butler (a Ray Bradbury fan) and a Toni Morrison (a William Faulkner fan). An outlier, in this case, would be Zora Neale Hurston whose literary foundation is within the black southern oral tradition. When there is no precedent for our existence in the world of books, we find a seed of validation within white narratives. It’s not an outright mirror, but tinted windows maybe, out of which we can see our muted, somewhat distorted selves.Whatspecificity in diversity or literal diversity does is sharpen that reflection.Indeed, every book can and should be a window. This is how we learn about theworld. But we are not houses unto ourselves. What exists for my public schoolstudents who are reluctant readers or who read below grade level, are onlymirrors. They look to each other for validations of themselves. They find it inmusic mostly. Yet, if whiteness remains the default narrative, I can’t help tothink that white supremacy has a hand in deciding which mirrors they see. Likea house of mirrors, their reflections can be distorted in order to suit thewhims of institutional racism. I think they know this instinctively. Maybe theydon’t trust books like they don’t trust standardized tests to accuratelymeasure their brilliance.There’s acertain truth that only a writer telling her own story can bring. From thatdeep place of lived experience comes validation—a clear, sharpened focus on thespecificity of human existence. What reading widely in children’s and YAliterature has taught me is that there is indeed specificity in the whiteexperience. Some of my favorite books are about incest in rural Australia,fairy wars in a modern-day industrial town, a time-traveling homeless man in1970s Manhattan, and a personified pagoda. With over three-thousand children’sbooks published each year by white authors, there is room for specificity. Mychildren and I absolutely have to read widely to understand the full spectrumof the human experience. And within the books that feature children and teensof color, we’ll hopefully find validation. While theywere reading Renee Watson’s This Side of Home, my daughters would shout out,“Facts!” As in, Renee was laying down some real truth in that story. Now theycan understand how gentrification further marginalizes the people in ourneighborhood. And because we’ve read and loved The Hunger Games, we cancontextualize how there is a larger system at play—how The Capitol reinforcesinstitutional oppression. Maybe we live in District 11 or 12 and fertile farmland or coal are now hot commodities, so the Capitol residents want to move in.Biculturalliteracy needs to be intentional. It’s intellectual survival, especially inthis age of Common Core and high stakes testing. A queer black boy absolutelyneeds to see himself within the pages of an empowering picture book, while alsomaking personal connections to Where the Wild Things Are. And hopefully, withsome sharp critical thinking skills, he will gain a better understanding of howand why he is marginalized as a queer black boy in the first place. This iswhat the Common Core proponents are asking of our students: text-to-self andtext-to-world connections. But whenthere’s no reflection of the self within any text, then there’s nounderstanding of the world as a truly validating and safe place. The worldbecomes cold and dangerous, and readers who don’t see themselves reflected inanything around them imagine themselves to be monsters. So they becomeapprehensive. They don’t try, they don’t push. And this sort of unrealizedpotential fails us all. “…If youwant to make a human being into a monster, deny them, at the cultural level,any reflection of themselves.” -Junot Diaz _______________________________________ Ibi Zoboi holds an MFA in Writingfor Children from VCFA.

{"title": "Spouting Off While White", "date": "Sunday, October 11, 2015", "text": "I was just getting ready to turn in last night when I began to see a new fury erupt on Twitter. First there were subtweets flying back and forth among people I follow. Apparently some unnamed author had made a comment saying we don't need diverse books because kids of color can find themselves in newspapers, on television, and in movies. It was such a bizarre statement that I wanted to know where it came from. I needed context.Unfortunately, many people were complaining but they weren't naming names or providing links.But my Twitter feed was lighting up with outrage. I noticed a reference to queer Black boys, and knowing how few children's or young adult books are out there about queer Black boys,  I figured the anonymous author who started it all must have been referring to a new picture book called Large Fears by Myles E. Johnson and Kendrick Daye. It had been featured on Huffington Post a few days before in an article called \"This Book Is Creating a Space for Queer Black Boys.\"  I had found out about the book from Edi Campbell, who had posted a link to the Huff Po article on Facebook.And sure enough, a few minutes later, a link came up from Edi's Twitter account that referred to a blog post she had just made in response to the author who had made the outrageous claim. And Edi had the courage to name her by including a screen shot of the Facebook post that started it all.It was Printz Award winner Meg Rosoff who had made the comment. Her claims are ridiculous, showing just how out of touch she is with children's and young adult literature. Anyone who has been paying attention knows that there are not  \"hundreds and ... thousands\" of books about kids of color, certainly not Black boys, and even less so about queer Black boys. In fact, the only one I can think of Finlater by Shawn Stewart Ruff. And now, of course, Large Fears.  Both books were self-published. What does this say about there being space for queer Black boys in the book industry?So what Rosoff must really be saying is that \"marginalized young people,\" including queer Black boys, should find themselves in White narratives. That is the epitomy of White privilege -- the notion that White perspectives are not only universal but should be. And she makes it even worse when she goes on to suggest that if queer Black boys want a mirror, they should turn to newspapers, magazines, and movies. Where... what? They'll see themselves bullied and brutalized at school?  They'll see other Black boys being shot and killed by policemen? They'll see ordinary young Black men getting killed on the streets?  Has Meg Rosoff  been keeping up with current events?Thanks to Edi Campbell for being courageous enough to name names in her swift response. And to author Justine Larbalestier, too, for calling out a fellow White author on Twitter. And to Ceilidh, co-editor of Bibliodaze, for responding this morning with her essay \"The Unbearable Whiteness of Meg Rosoff.\" And to Debbie Reese for keeping us all up to date with the latest developments. I wish I could say this was an isolated case, but it isn't. There are plenty of White authors, teachers, and librarians out there who spout off like this in private or even in public when there are only other White people around. It's time for White people to stand up to them whenever we hear comments like this -- not to shut them down necessarily but to engage them in discourse. They may not be open to listening, but there are likely others in the group who will be. Meg Rosoff don't need our protection. She needs to be challenged, as editor Laura Atkins did so well in the Facebook exchange shown above.  Too often we are willing to allow bigots to remain anonymous, or to write such comments off with \"Well, you're entitled to your point of view.\" And that's that. Let's move on to talk about something else.No, let's not change the topic. Let's talk about this now. And let's keep talking about it until there are so many books about queer Black boys that such conversations become unnecessary.Update: Check out these great open letters to Meg Rosoff from Linda Sue Park, Kaye, and  Sarah Hannah Gomez. And this insightful essay from Camryn Garrett. Also, Edi has made the whole ongoing Facebook post that started it all public."},
{"title": "Reviewing While White: Jump Back, Paul", "date": "Thursday, October 8, 2015", "text": "Welcome to “Reviewing While White,” an occasional series of reviews by our core contributors.  Some of our reviews will seek to spotlight positive examples of books to which we wish to draw attention. In the spirit of Debbie Reese’s charge, others will criticize books which we believe perpetuate White dominance. All Reading While White core contributors stand behind the reviews published under the Reading While White byline. Reviews reflect our individual positions, not those of our employer, or other reviewing bodies or committees to which we contribute. by Nina LindsayI have not read much of, or about, Paul Laurence Dunbar.  So when I received Jump Back, Paul: the Life and Poems of Paul Laurence Dunbar by Sally Derby, with illustrations by Sean Qualls, published by Candlewick Press, I dug right in.   The biographical narrative (interspersed with Dunbar’s poems) is presented by a fictional narrator in a “Grandma” voice, which felt awkward to me at first, though I tried to go with it, noting that Derby cites this voice as the inspiration that shaped the narrative.  Derby grew up in Dunbar’s home town of Dayton Ohio, had a lifelong admiration for him, and expresses the hope that her book “will restore some of the recognition Dunbar deserves,”  while acknowledging “it is always somewhat risky to write about someone whose culture is not your own.” (p.119)   I moved ahead, marking questions about where Derby was heading with her arguments, so that I could check back at the end to see if they were resolved.  But then I read, on page 10, in regards to rough treatment from Paul’s father Joshua: “It wasn’t like Joshua was heartless. I’m not excusing the beating, but life had treated Joshua rough.  Raised a slave, how could he know what family life could be like?”  In case you didn’t catch the microaggression: in that last sentence, whether intended consciously or not, Derby suggests that Black people born into slavery could have had no concept of family life.   Sucker-punched, I read on through to the end, marking even more questions for follow up, and finding none of them answered in Derby’s text or aftermatter. So I gave myself a mini crash-course in Dunbar, reading through the sources that Derby indicates she consulted the most. I was surprised to feel I was reading about a completely different Dunbar than the one Derby presented.   Dunbar was born in 1872, to parents who were formerly enslaved.  Derby relates his parents’ story and his early life. “His mama, now, she liked telling about life in the slave cabins--everyday goings-on, especially the funny ones. Even when Paul was grown, he liked to listen to old folks talking about their lives, and sometimes he’d turn their memories into poems.”  (p.4) This becomes an opportunity to share some of Dunbar’s famous poetry in dialect.  But by repeatedly interspersing these with stories of his childhood, drawing direct comparisons with the subject matter, and including suggestions such as “If you’re wondering what it was like growing up back then [during Paul’s childhood], you read Paul’s stories and poems, you’ll get a  good idea,” (p.15)  Derby lays a misleading suggestion that the experience of these poems came from Paul’s own childhood, rather than from stories told to him.  Paul’s childhood was a generation removed from the childhoods presented in his dialect poems, and it was a crucial generation, as it spanned Emancipation.She moves on through his youth and young career to his success as a poet, and continues to include his poems both in dialect and in “formal” English. The difference in the reception of these two styles is the central argument of Dunbar’s work. His poetry in dialect (and his Broadway minstrel writing) was what made him famous in the White literary establishment, and this was a topic of debate among his peers, yet Derby only brings it up, late in the narrative, as a point of contention between Dunbar and his wife Alice (p.88-89), almost entirely avoiding it, and certainly marginalizing its prominence in his career. Why?In her author’s note, she speaks to the Grandma voice that inspired her, and talks of how she argued with this voice. “I’d say, ‘I don’t know what to write here. Some experts think one thing and some think another.’ And she’d answer impatiently, ‘Those people wrote their own books. This one’s yours. You need to write what you think.’  So that’s what I did. With Grandma’s help.” (p.104)  Yet we’re never clear on what Derby thinks about Dunbar.  She doesn’t offer much in explanation of his poems, as if intending for Dunbar’s work to speak for itself.  In Chapter 6 she starts to get into Dunbar’s political commentary, and then excuses herself at the start of Chapter 7 “There, now, I guess I strayed away from my story a little bit, didn’t I?” (p.79).  In other words, his political views are not central to understanding him, in her estimation.On page 98, Derby’s “Grandma” says, regarding Dunbar’s famous line “I know why the caged bird sings”: “You don’t have to be black to understand the longing in that poem, to feel its sadness.” (p.98).   Here Derby seems to be justifying herself, acknowledging that she can appreciate and understand Dunbar even though she’s White.  Does she also realize the many microaggressions that reverberate from this statement, stripping the very importance of Blackness from the appreciation of Dunbar’s poems?  Did she consider what a Black child reading this line would hear?It’s as if Derby is hiding behind a fictional voice she hopes will lend credence to avoid writing about what she doesn’t want to touch. She avoids the uncomfortable questions regarding race, class, and White privilege in the literary establishment that were central to Dunbar’s story as a writer, and are not inaccessible to a young reader. We are left with what feels like a “White polite” version of Dunbar. That this was clearly thoroughly researched and painstakingly written, and that Derby clearly admires her subject, makes the whole endeavor even more frustrating to read."},
{"title": "Presenting While White", "date": "Tuesday, October 6, 2015", "text": "--by Angie ManfrediFor an extrovert like me, there is nothing quitelike standing in front of a group of your peers and colleagues and presentinginformation.  Ever since I have been in library services, back to when Iwas a paraprofessional without a college degree, I have loved presenting andsharing information at workshops and conferences. Hard to believe, but I have beenpresenting for fourteen years.  I hope that over that time I have helpedothers learn and grow.  I know that, as a presenter, I am constantlylearning and challenging myself.  I want to be better.  I want to beengaging.  I want to be constantly innovating.  A few weeks ago, I traveled up to Wyoming topresent at the Mountain Plains Library Association/Wyoming Library AssociationConference.  (I have a personal goal to present at every state andCheyenne is only a day’s drive from my home.) One of my presentations was aboutthe We Need Diverse Books Campaign - helping recommend titles for librarians toadd to their libraries.  But I also wanted to take this presentation tothe next level and discuss what I feel is a fundamental duty for librarians andeducators: demanding more from the literature we put on our shelves and askinghard questions about it.I expected a few things out of thispresentation.  I expected that my audience would be largely White and thatturned out to be true.  I expected that the conversation would make somepeople uncomfortable, both in the books I was presenting and the statistics Iwas sharing.  I anticipated this and addressed it directly with myaudience. Sure enough, I could see many people averting their eyes from my gazeand shifting in their seats.  At times, the discomfort in the room wasalmost palpable. And, to be frank, I expected that there would besome people who walked out. That happened all right - but it happened at a rateI didn’t expect.  In all my years presenting I have never had as manypeople walk out as walked out during this presentation. I started with a roomof about 30 people and by the time it was over, about half the crowd had walkedout.  It was a distinctly jarring experience to watch so many peoplestream out of the room as I talked for two hours. I know that some of thepeople who walked out were tired of the conference (it was the last session) orjust didn’t like my style of presentation.  There are always reasons forpeople to walk out and they always do.  But the sheer number of people ina mostly White crowd who walked out combined with the palpable discomfort inthe room - what happened in that room was something bigger than the usualwalk-outs.It was the big, White elephant in the room - theunspoken and uncomfortable truth so many of librarians and educators live with. There are more children’s books about elephants than there are childrenof color.  We all know this.  How can you not know this if you selectchildren’s materials or if you work with them?  Surely you’ve noticedthere are more books about teens with terminal illnesses than books aboutMuslim teens. We know it. We just pretend we don’t.  I, personally, amdone with pretending.  I have decided that I will start takingaccountability for my Whiteness..  And one way I will do that is by usingthe opportunities I have to speak the truth.  If this means that half ofthe crowds I’m presenting in front of walk out, I can live with that.  Iwill talk about race and racism in our industry, I will call on other Whitepeople to do the same and to be accountable for their privileges and theirmistakes  I will try to connect with and boost the voices of my peers ofcolor and I will let them know that their voices count and they are not alone.As much as anything, this was my goal with my presentation at Mountain PlainsLibrary Association/Wyoming Library Association Conference.  It was hardto see people walk out.  But it was also incredibly rewarding to haveconversations with my peers of color afterwards and to see that I was gettingthrough to some White people in the room, who were writing down my suggestionsand nodding in agreement.And maybe, just maybe, I gave the people whowalked out a few things to think about.  Maybe they took one thing I saidand it’s starting a thought inside them that will be hard to shake the nexttime they see another elephant book.  I am here to have the hard conversations. Are you?"},
{"title": "Not a Contradiction", "date": "Wednesday, September 30, 2015", "text": "All of us working onReading While White are active believers in and promoters of intellectualfreedom. And none of us find it contradictory to suggest that librarians thinkabout stereotyping and bias when they are doing the hard, essential work ofcollection management.Because here’s thething: for too long, selection decisions have been made with too little regard,and sometimes no regard, for stereotyping and bias. How do we begin to respondto that? How do we take responsibility for educating ourselves as a professionand as individuals to think critically about that aspect of the work we do inregard to book evaluation and collection management decisions?There are a lot ofthings we can do, but one thing we must do is include statements in ourprofessional guidelines that encourage and even demand we consider stereotypingand bias as part of what we look at when evaluating materials and making collection decisions. This is part of the broader framework of challengingracism across all aspects of our profession. Will we eradicatestereotyping and bias in our collections if we do this?  Of course not.Will we be snatching books out of young reader’s hands? Please. Every librarianknows that collection development and weeding decisions are made takingmultiple factors into account. Every librarian knows the collection they aremanaging is going to have things they and/or others find objectionable. But every librariancharged with collection management also has a responsibility to evaluate and selectmaterials and assess the collection thoughtfully, usually according to specificcriteria outlined in their library (or school) policies and procedures. When weas a profession incorporate language that encourages us to considerstereotyping and bias as part of our decision-making, it does not suggestspecific kinds of books be excluded. It simply codifies a criteria that willmake us more responsible and responsive to everyone in the communities that weserve. Acting on thatresponsibility demands more of us, as individuals and as a profession. Where are we turning to for professional recommendations? Are thoseresources culturally competent? If they aren’t where else can we turn to findout more?None of this isnecessarily easy; not for the individual librarian making collection managementdecisions; not for reviewers and review journals, not for many award- andbest-of-the-year list committees and others. But that doesn’t mean it isn’t theright thing to do. More important, it’s the necessary thing to do."},
{"title": "Open Your Eyes", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2015", "text": "At some point during my first full year teaching 3rd grade in Indianapolis, a veteran teacher said something that has stayed with me for nearly two decades. The topic of conversation was the racial make-up of our respective classes, and this teacher—who I respect greatly, by the way—said, “I don’t even notice whether my students are Black or White. They’re just kids.”I can still recall my reaction to this comment; I wondered what was wrong with me that I couldn’t be “colorblind” to the kids in my own class. I felt guilty that I could have told anyone the exact number of Black and Latina/o kids in my class. And so I kept my mouth shut, feeling a sinking sensation in my gut: I had SO MUCH to learn.Well, yes… I DID have a lot to learn (still do, in fact), but one thing I’m certain of: the notion of “colorblindness” is a hugely flawed one. In a recent post on the open book (Lee & Low’s excellent blog), Tu Books Publisher Stacy Whitman points to research showing that the approach is damaging for children of all races, writing, “[N]ot addressing difference does not make children colorblind—it only encourages them to absorb the implicit racial messages of American society.”That is a pretty huge deal. And think about it: this slow and insidious poisoning of our children (sorry to pull a Mrs. Lovejoy, but it’s true) is happening across America simply because most White people are too “polite” (i.e., wimpy) to take a risk. Because it is risky to bring up race as a White person—most of us simply don’t know what to say. I will readily admit that I struggle to have conversations about race with anyone, be it people of color and First/Native Nations or other White people. But that is no excuse not to try, or to simply ignore race—if I close my eyes, it will disappear, right? Nope. And make no mistake, the “colorblindness” is yet another manifestation of White Privilege. I can afford to not think about my Whiteness. But think of how devastatingly easy it is to find proof of just how often a person of color and First/Native Nations is reminded of their race (and that link is just the tip of the iceberg). The idea of a colorblind/Utopian society where we all eat Bon Bons and ride on shiny unicorns is something we White people really need to put to bed. It’s up to us to take that risk, to start the conversation, and not just to hear what is said, but also to see who is doing the talking. So pull up a chair, open your ears and your eyes, and let’s start a conversation."},
{"title": "\"Do I have the right to write about ______?\"", "date": "Saturday, September 26, 2015", "text": "A question that flies around the Children's Literature field quite a lot:\"Hey, ________.  You're ________.  Do I have the right to write about ________ people?\"I will address this as I see it applying to White people (like me) because really, it's not my place to tell people of color and First/Native Nations people what constitutes appropriate writing.  So let's suppose that the person doing the asking is White.This is the wrong question to ask.The answer is easy.  Yes, you have the right to write about whatever you want, in the USA, at least.  The constitution guarantees free speech (although, and this is key, it does not guarantee consequence-free speech).  So, yeah--we White people can write pretty much whatever we want and nobody will send us to jail for it.But either or both of the following might be true:1) You might drown out or overshadow (effectively silencing) marginalized people who justly want to tell their own stories.2) You might get some stuff wrong and evoke criticism from people whom you misrepresent.And nothing you do can alter either of these truths.  Not even asking permission from someone from the culture about which you're writing.Let's face it--often, those who ask for permission from marginalized people are really asking for insurance and the ability to, in the event of criticism, point to the permission-grantor and say \"But!  Look!  __________ said I could, and she's _________!\"And even if someone asks for permission with the best intentions, wanting nothing more than guidance from an expert, the time that __________ has to spend pondering the question (and how in the world to answer!) is time away from __________'s job/family/friends/garden/gaming.So, White people:  Please stop asking people of color and First/Native Nations people this question.  It's the wrong question to ask.Instead, ask yourself, and your White friends/colleagues:\"What do I have the responsibility to write about?\"And the answer is: Your Whiteness.White people, we have to look at White culture, White norms, how we enact them, and how we oppress people with them.Some starting places:-Robin DiAngelo on White Fragility and White Women's Tears-Kenneth Jones and Tema Okun on White Supremacy Culture-Gail K. Golden on White Supremacy As AddictionAnd after we've done that for the next 500 years or so, we can re-visit that first question.One final thought, and then I'm done:As a teacher, I have, indeed, seen many books for children written by White people about marginalized people that are exceptionally well done.  These are books that are exhaustively researched and thoughtfully written with a child audience in mind.No, they are not all problematic.But as a teacher who tries to have honest conversations with kids about race, what I really need is a book that gives a detailed and developmentally-appropriate explanation of Whiteness, White culture, and White dominance.  I'm still waiting for that one."},
{"title": "Thanks to Debbie Reese", "date": "Thursday, September 24, 2015", "text": "In her post the other day, Megan mentioned a recent exchange on Debbie Reese's blog American Indians in Children's Literature.  In my home and at work AICL is a frequent topic of conversation. I try to check in on it on a regular basis to see what's new. Sometimes I go there to see if Debbie has reviewed a particular book I have questions about. And other times I first hear of an ongoing lively discussion on AICL via Facebook or Twitter.Debbie gets people talking. And she gets people thinking, too.Debbie ReeseIt was thanks to Debbie that we were initially inspired to create this blog. At the ALSC Day of Diversity last January, during a question-and-answer session, she called on all of us to raise our voices and join in the ongoing discussion of diversity (or lack thereof) in children's books, saying,  \"I can't do this alone.\" So, thank you, Debbie, for putting out the call to action. I'm sorry it took so long for some of us to respond.I want to tell you something else about that day that has always stuck with me. You probably won't ever find it in any recap of the day, so you would only know this happened if you were there.After one of the sessions, people lined up at a microphone to speak. Some had comments, some had questions for the panelists who had just spoken before. Debbie had been about third or fourth in line, patiently waiting her turn, and just when she got up to the microphone, a White woman hopped up from her seat and jumped in front of Debbie to take the mike. I don't remember what she said, all I can remember is feeling shocked that someone would be so rude.It probably shouldn't have surprised me. White people have been \"taking the mike\" from people of color for generations.But isn't that what we're doing here on this blog? I hope not.  We envision Reading While White as an opportunity for White people to add their voices to the discussion of race in children's books in addition to and not instead of those voices like Debbie's, and Zetta's, and Sujei's, and others you will find on our list of Kindred Spirits. We hope you will read their words and think about them.White people have a hard time discussing race. I know because I am a White person and it's hard for me, even though I have been discussing race for many years. I see other White people struggle in these discussions. We worry about saying the wrong thing. We get defensive on behalf of the entire White race. (\"But that's not me!\")  We often get upset when confronted with something that challenges what we think we know about history or social relations. Zetta Elliott recently sent me this definition of cognitive dissonance that describes this feeling perfectly:I often experience cognitive dissonance when I read Debbie's blog. I can find myself getting angry, especially when she is critical of a book I love or an author I admire. It hurts. But I try not to take it personally so I can open my mind and learn from Debbie's perspectives. I try to hold my defensive feelings in check.  It's not always easy but it is ultimately worth the effort.When it comes to discussing race and racism, I think we White people need to develop a thicker skin. That's how we'll learn and evolve, thanks to people like Debbie Reese."},
{"title": "Lessons in Reading While White", "date": "Tuesday, September 22, 2015", "text": "There are lessons I’ve learned about how my Whiteness informs the way I read and respond to literature that slowly insinuate themselves into my psyche and my understanding, and lessons that hit me with force.In a recent post on American Indians in Children’s Literature (AICL), Debbie Reese shared a quote from an anonymous commenter:“I find the idea of a reader -- particularly a child -- having to wait to see herself humanized an inherently problematic one. Yes, it might accurately reflect the inner journey many white people take, but isn't the point that our dehumanizing views were always wrong?”I’ve been thinking about that ever since. Wow.One dimension of challenging racism is sharing the experiences of those learning to see it and respond to it (although at this juncture in our history, I think it’s even more important that the voices of those underrepresented for too long are amplified). But the way that story is told matters. Of course it does.  Near the end of another post, Debbie Reese recently wrote, \"the work I do here on AICL and elsewhere privileges the children who will read what writers write.\" Another wow. Privileging the child as reader. And of course implicit in this is all children -- First Nations/Native children and children of color, not just White children. That's a thought I want to carry with me, too. I think it struck me profoundly because while I'd like to think it's stating the obvious -- isn't that what we all should be doing? -- so much of what I see and hear tells me otherwise.So now, going forward, I have two new things to carry with me as I read while White.But how do I make sure I'm privileging all children, or at least trying?  It begins with an essential awareness that I must bring to all of my reading: that I am White, and because of this there are many things I don't understand. I can try to understand; I do try -- in part by reading as many books written by people of color and First Nations / Native authors as I can; by reading critical commentary from those who are cultural insiders; by engaging with what's happening around me. But this is external knowledge I'm working to internalize; not understanding rooted in my existence as I move through the world.The truth is this: I am always going to be discovering yet another way I do not get it because I am White. And I have a choice: be paralyzed by shame, become defensive (and sometimes I do), or ask myself when I’m feeling uncomfortable or challenged: What can I learn from this?  I read a lot of books in the course of each year, looking for outstanding ones to share with teachers and librarians. But I can't do this responsibly if I don't evaluate books for racism as part of my assessment. Only then can I begin to privilege every child. It's my responsibility to learn what questions to ask. I won't ever learn them all, and there won’t always be a single answer or definitive opinion when I ask the ones I do know, but every effort I make to find answers is going to give me more knowledge to carry with me into my future reading.I'd like to think I have a good foundation, one on which I'm continuing to build, but I still can't always articulate why something I'm reading makes me uncomfortable. This isn't for the reasons Nina discussed in her post last week -- not because of the backlash that always seems inevitable -- but rather because my sense of something being wrong, or not quite right, is too vague.  I'm still learning.At other times, I completely gloss over things that others find problematic. Sure, this can be a matter of opinion. It can also be a matter of not knowing enough to see what's there. I'm still learning.And sometimes, I'm simply dismayed.  Really? Someone just said, “Let’s powwow”? Really? Pidgin English?  Really? A diverse classroom in which there isn't a single brown-skinned child who is dark rather than light? Whenever I encounter something unsettling like this in a book that I appreciate for many other reasons, I struggle with how much weight to give it, especially when it's a single line or brief scene in the context of a lengthy novel. It seems so small. But I am White. Who am I to say that it's small, that it's any different, or less damaging, than the glaring omissions, the misrepresentations, the dehumanizing that are all still far too prevalent?Book to book, publishing year to publishing year, painful moment to painful moment, the weight of these things should be unbearable for all of us."},

With MacMillan and Scholastic coming on late (among others), things are looking up.In related news, Mira Jacob writes, “We are ready for a publishing industry that represents the world we live in, and it will ignore us—writers and readers of color—at its peril.” An insightful and hilarious piece of writing about the troubling trend of whitewashing books.Finally, Chicago school librarian extraordinaire Elisa Gall shares a thoughtful take on a picture book that is getting a lot of buzz (and starred reviews), Emily Jenkins’ and Sophie Blackall’s A Fine Dessert. Not to play spoiler, but let’s just say Elisa is less taken with the book than many others.Until next time!"},
{"title": "On Being a Non", "date": "Friday, September 18, 2015", "text": "Terminology nearly always figures into diversity discussions, especially when White people are involved. We want to say the right thing -- and the right thing always seems to be changing.  Other times I've noticed that White people will latch onto a discussion of terminology to divert the real discussion. I can't tell you how many university meetings I've had to sit through where we've spent an hour trying to define diversity so that we don't actually have to talk about it.The writers on this blog talked a lot about word choice before we launched so that we'd all be on the same page. Do we capitalize the B in black and the W in white?   Latino/a or Latin@? What term do we use for American Indians or Native Americans? (Our friends and fellow bloggers Debbie Reese and Cynthia Leitich Smith advised us to use First/Native Nations.) We all agree that it's important to let people self-identify and name themselves. Words are important.There's one term that always trips me up: non-white. I know, I know, it's a quick and easy term that designates everyone who's not white, who doesn't benefit from White privilege. etc. But I feel uncomfortable calling anyone a \"non,\" defining people by what they are not.I've been called a non only once that I know of. Back in 1989-90, I served on the Coretta Scott King Award Committee in one of two slots designated for a non-Black member. So for two years I was a non-Black on the committee. I can't say it bothered me. In fact, it was really more of a novelty for me to be a non. But it did make me have to stop and think about my own race, something I don't usually have to do on a daily basis. It placed me in an \"other\" category where I am not used to being. I'm not sure how I'd feel if I'd had a lifetime of being other, or of being a non, of being defined in contrast to something I'm not. I reckon it might wear on me."},
{"title": "Making Space for Speaking Out", "date": "Thursday, September 17, 2015", "text": "I’ve been a librarian for nearly twenty years. From the start, I’ve felt most invested in supporting diversity and quality in, and access to, books for children.  In my years discussing books--on award committees, in book groups, on the blog I co-author, Heavy Medal--I’ve been frustrated at how difficult it is to discuss race and privilege in children’s books. When the conversation starts to go somewhere uncomfortable, a backlash seems to seek to separate the “political” issues from the “literary” ones, as if they were different. I’ve sensed this since the 90s, when I was first studying children’s lit, and “political correctness” successfully quieted discussions of cultural authenticity in children’s lit, by aligning this questioning with censorship.  I don’t know that I fully understand what happened then, but I know I didn’t understand how to push back. I knew only that I felt cornered, and that something was not right.  When I went with friends to see James Cameron’s Avatar in 2009, I went for pure entertainment, getting myself in the mood for cheap thrills and expensive effects.  But instead I was floored by the racism and colonialism that the entire storyline depended on, and asked viewers to buy into from the very start.  I writhed through the whole movie.  Perhaps I should have walked out.  But I stayed with my friends and hoped they wouldn’t notice when I didn’t share in the conversation following the film.  I didn’t want to ruin the high we’d each paid eleven dollars for.  However, I was drawn out, expressly for my silence, and as I started to detail why I was offended by the film, I could feel the mood spoil.  It was not fun, and I’m not sure anyone really wanted to head there with me.  But I was among friends, and as painful as it was, and whether or not they agreed with me, everyone made a place for it.  That was the first of several transformative experiences for me as I've started to understand better why these discussions can get shut down.  It's particularly difficult online.  Time and again, in reading for Heavy Medal, I've self-censored when I see racist perspectives in children's literature because I feel like I just can't deal with introducing it into the discussion.  Sometimes I try, and flounder. Often, I don't yet understand what I'm reading, only that it is off, and I need a community of colleagues to help figure it out.  Dana, in a comment to Allie's post, says: \"I hope this will be a safe place for me to ask white questions with the full intent of educating myself.\" That is my hope for this blog too. I expect to be challenged, and I expect to be wrong sometimes, but I'm tired of not speaking out, especially now that I recognize the privilege and White fragility that has counseled me to check myself in the past. I hope this blog is a place to hold up diverse voices in the field, but I also hope it is a place to start dismantling the very entrenched Whiteness in how we evaluate children's books, and some people will find that dangerous. We risk skirting vital work if we’re not willing to challenge each other; we risk deluding ourselves, and undermining our service to readers.  Even if we are not among our own personal friends, as I was while watching Avatar, surely we can cultivate a space of mutual respect and understanding for the necessarily difficult discussions of children’s literature. I think there's a strong tradition of this already in our field.I've found it helpful to be \"mindful\" in these discussions, to focus on noticing and to expect discovery, knowing that whether or not that discovery is pleasant, it has value. Last November, I was reading the New York Times Op-Ed over coffee, and came across Lori Tharp’s piece The Case for Black with a Capital B.  How could the NYTimes, I thought, in all conscience, hide behind style guides to justify what is ultimately a racist act, refusing to capitalize “Black” by argument that it is not a race?  Then the more personally devastating thought arrived: In all my years reading this paper, how could I never have noticed?   It took me a very, very long time to feel adequately prepared for work that morning.  I was finally able to walk out into the world by telling myself: Well, Nina, now you know.  And clearly, there’s more you’ve missed, so get out of your corner and let’s go. This won’t be easy, but why did we ever suppose it should be? Let’s talk about children’s books."},
{"title": "Why a White Blog?", "date": "Tuesday, September 15, 2015", "text": "Five years ago, I took a subway trip I'll never forget.  I'd finished my book and still had a good twenty minutes left to go on the train.  Bored, I started reading the subway car's ads.  One contained a sexist statement.  It was small and not the “point” of the ad; nevertheless, I read it three times, feeling my temperature rise.I realized something as I sat there fuming: At that moment, I fit the bill for the \"Angry Feminist\" stereotype.  If I had been presented with the ad's creators, I could have screamed at them from Brooklyn to the Bronx, or I could have tried to explain my thoughts calmly; either way, I suspect they would have thought, \"what's wrong with this crazy lady, that something so tiny can set her off?\"  I suspect they would have snuck glances at each other, dismissing me as an “hysterical woman”.I'd encountered this catch-22 before, when someone would say, for example, \"Feminists can't take a joke,\" or similar.  By objecting to something so small, I opened the door to accusations of my being petty, hypersensitive, or looking for a fight.  If I elected to swallow my rage, I would internalize yet another tiny act of sexism (I did not yet know the term \"microaggression\"), and who knew how long my blood pressure could take it?  In that moment, I saw very clearly not only how the ad was sexist, but also how the stereotype of the Angry Feminist disempowered me from effecting change. It was a profoundly painful realization. I found myself thinking: This shouldn't be my burden to bear. I shouldn't be the one agonizing over sexism, or the best strategy to educate people in power about disempowering stereotypes.  Men should do this work, because it would be so much easier for them!   A man who brought up issues of sexism would likely not be laughed at or dismissed as I would (there is no stereotype of the Angry Feminist Man).  What if a man in the advertising department had said, \"Hey, let's take that one out, it's sexist and that's not cool\"?In that moment, I desperately wished some man, somewhere, would start a \"men for Feminism\" or \"men against sexism\" group.  I realized the names sounded oxymoronic, but--what amazing work such a group could do!  Where women's groups have to strategize and campaign for decades just to be taken seriously before they can start to advocate for things like equal pay or access to health care, men could skip that \"take me seriously\" step.  They could sit in a circle and say to each other, \"What things do we do that are sexist? Let's stop doing those things.\" How fast would change come if all-men Feminist groups started organizing and advocating for change?I hung on to these thoughts, convinced that because I was oppressed in this situation, I understood all oppression; and that because I am a woman and therefore oppressed, I could do nothing about it.What a rude awakening it was when, two years later, I discovered that I am White.________________________I had begun to do some work around racism (primarily as it related to a curriculum I was co-teaching), but in my discussions of race I focused on the experiences of people of color.  I still thought of myself primarily as a woman, a target of sexism, and therefore oppressed.  In my very limited race-related self-reflections, I tended to think of myself as race-less rather than White.Then one day, I had lunch with a colleague who told me about a racial microaggression she’d experienced earlier that week.  I nodded sympathetically, and then replied, “I get you.  I know what that’s like.”“You do?” she said.“Sure,” I said.  “I’m a Feminist.  I experience sexism all the time.  I totally know what you’re going through.”She looked at me hard, then said “No, you don’t, and what you just said was a microaggression.”  And she stalked away.I was numb, then upset, then angry, for about an hour.  Didn’t she know that I was a “good” White person?  And anyways, I thought, sexism is just as bad as racism!  I knew too much about being on the receiving end of microaggressions--I could never be the aggressor!  How could she be so callous to my experiences?  Didn’t she want to hear about the microaggressions that I’d experienced too?That was the moment something in my brain finally clicked:  She is a woman too.  She already understands sexism.  She is dealing with racism on top of that.  And I am exempt from that.Over the next few weeks--months--years, I gradually became aware of a world of exemptions, of -isms I’ve never had to deal with.  I am a woman, yes.  I am also White, heterosexual, cisgender, and not disabled.  I am a documented citizen, I am housed, I am educated.  None of these things change the fact that as a woman, I experience sexism (as it manifests against white women).  But similarly, my woman-ness doesn’t alter the truth that I belong to the dominant group along these and many other identifiers.I dove whole-heartedly into a self-education that focused on the ways in which I dominate others, rather than the ways in which I'm dominated.  I attended professional trainings.  I read.  I followed more and more anti-racist people on social media.  I learned of the existence of all-White anti-racist groups.  Wait, all-White anti-racist groups?First thought: This sounds like an oxymoron.Second thought:  Actually, so did the “men against sexism” groups I’d dreamed of, years ago, on the subway.Third thought: I have to check this out._________________________________There’s more to this story (see Nina, Megan, and KT's upcoming posts), but it leads to a phone call between me and Nina Lindsay in which we hatched the idea for this blog.The field of children’s literature has a long and fascinating history of anti-racist advocates and allies, and a thriving anti-racist community today.  If you browse through our blogroll, you’ll see the excellent, Herculean, work of marginalized people in the children's literature community, primarily people of color.  These people understand racism and its effects much, much better than I, as a White person, ever will.But if we White people talk about racism as if we are not part of the equation, we are the problem.  We have a responsibility not just to boost marginalized voices as much as we can, but also to examine ourselves and our Whiteness.  And we must create all-White spaces in which we can do this work without burdening non-White communities.  People of color and First/Native Nations have enough work to do in analyzing how racism has impacted their lives.  To ask them to also educate us on our Whiteness is White privilege in the extreme.What advantages do White adults in the field of children’s literature experience?  From what are we exempt?What is White culture and how does it perpetuate the status quo?By what mechanisms does Whiteness dominate in children’s literature, and why are these mechanisms so often invisible to us White people?How does all this affect children--White and non-White?Reading While White is intentionally by, about, and for White people who are interested in anti-racist work in the field of children’s literature.  There is no quick fix to racism, which exists on personal, institutional, and societal levels; but by organizing ourselves and working together, I hope that we can start to answer some of these questions.In Sam Bloom, KT Horning, Nina Lindsay, Angie Manfredi, and Megan Schliesman, I have a dream team of thoughtful, smart, questioning, self-examining librarians.  It’s an honor to list my name alongside theirs.Years ago, I daydreamed on the subway about an empowered group that would devote itself to examining, and changing the balance of, its power.Let’s get to work."},
