{"title": "Green Tomato Harvest Ideas: Chutney", "date": "Thursday, November 2, 2023", "text": "Now that I am learning about native plants and reading people like Doug Tallamy, I let my plants stand and die in their spots.         They provide homes for insects and food for other critters over winter. In the spring, they are reduced sufficiently to break down into soil or something - it must be easy because I don't have a memory of any hard work associated with them in the spring.         So I had green tomatoes right up until frost. My husband brought in my huge bread bowl full. They are very versatile!         You can make salsa verde, to eat fresh or can. You can make green tomato curry or dhal (google for recipes), or you can chop them up and freeze them as is, no blanching required, to make that recipe in the future. You can pickle them as fridge pickles or to can if you don't have fridge space. And yesterday, I used a bunch to make chutney.         I got the idea from my old Mennonite cookbook, Mennonite Community, that has green tomato pie which closely mimics apple pie. I have an apple chutney recipe I love, so I researched a bit and decided I could use green tomatoes instead of apples in my recipe. It worked GREAT.                 I did taste it at the end of cooking, tweaking the taste with a bit of salt and a few more sprinkles of cumin and chili powder. We'll eat this chutney next to Indian dishes this winter, with naan or with rice and curry.         My freezers are full to the brim, so I was glad for a canning method for the green tomatoes. I think I'll can some pickles next.                 Green Tomato Chutney, adapted from Simply in SeasonCombine in large pot, preferably wide:12 cups finely chopped green tomatoes (I use my food processor)1 1/2 cups chopped onion4 cloves garlic, chopped1 cup raisins2-3\" piece ginger root, minced2 1/2-3 cups dark brown sugar1/4 cup apple cider vinegar2 tsp. ground coriander1 tsp. ground cloves1 1/2 tsp. yellow mustard seed1 tsp. salt1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper1/4 tsp. black pepper1 1/2 tsp. chili powder1 1/2 tsp. ground cumin1 1/2 tsp. cumin seeds1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon1/4 tsp. ground cardamomBring to a boil, covered. Then reduce heat and simmer until softened, thickened, and will mound slightly on a spoon. Keep covered if the mixture is not very liquid-y, or remove lid to evaporate some liquid (depends on the green tomatoes - mine were on the dry side). Stir occasionally for up to 1 hour. To can, process in pints or half-pints in boiling water bath, 15 minutes for half-pints, 20 minutes for pints."},
{"title": "On Replacing a Faucet", "date": "Wednesday, October 4, 2023", "text": "When I saw that our laundry faucet was leaking copiously, I surmised that the fix was a new faucet. The old one was as old as Genevieve, who is turning 18 any day now (my stars! that's a different post). Then, I further thought in my new pragmatic way: I bet replacing a faucet is just a bunch of screws and matching up connections. I prefer to save my money for skills and professional services I cannot hope to duplicate with a YouTube video. So I checked with my dad who is the ultimate handyman if he would be present while I crawled under the sink and matched things up. I wanted to free up my husband for other house repairs - he also is a handyman, but he works fulltime, unlike my dad who is retired and enjoying himself hugely. Guess what? It went great. I bought a faucet for about forty bucks, my husband bought new hoses for a few dollars more, and I changed that faucet with my dad's excellent guidance. The only glitch was that the hot and cold water got switched, which meant another tedious session under the sink switching them.          As a professionally trained and experienced teacher, I was impressed with my dad's patient, positive approach. He gave some low-key guidance, never critical, and he did not show impatience as I struggled with the bolts and figuring out which tool to use, sometimes getting my righty-tighty and lefty-loosy mixed up. It's not easy to be the expert being patient as the novice hacks and bungles through the job. He just fetched a work light from his truck. He really had me do the work and sat back in full confidence that I could do the job. It was a delightful, empowering experience for me. I have more respect for my dad's life work and knowledge.         I gave him concord grape pie - sort of a thank you gift but truly, I love to share my homemade fruit pies with my parents anytime. They are so appreciative.In this phase of my life, I am looking for ways to cut through the patriarchal, traditional approaches to distill the problem and see what solution I can offer. I don't always have this confident, pragmatic energy, but when I do, I lean into it hard. It feels great."},
{"title": "My Very Strong Body", "date": "Saturday, April 29, 2023", "text": "This morning, I ran, almost literally ran, a 5k. I walked a little on the hills and I also wanted to stay with Genevieve. Phoebe started out with us but switched to walking with a friend (tiny brag: last year Phoebe ran the entire thing at age 6 with a patient kindergarten teacher as her buddy, even placing 6th in her age group!).         This is the farthest I have ever run; I usually run a little over a mile in about 10 minutes, usually about twice a week. I am extremely proud of my strong body and mind for accomplishing this personal best! I kept checking in with myself as I ran, and I felt good and strong the whole way - not even that ragged breath, painful lung feeling that I loathe and try to avoid with running. My husband pointed out that in cycling, you can add up your weekly miles, double that, and be confident that you can ride that for a longer ride. So I see now how my dogged jogs for the last five years, really not increasing in speed or distance, have created this strength in me. Another thing: when I had my first baby, I went down into post-partum depression. I was blindsided and confused. By the time I figured out what was going on and started to climb out of the hole, I felt terribly betrayed by my body. One of my big healing steps was saying this out loud to a therapist, who gently led me to talk to my body, speaking truth and love. I have continued to grow in my love for my body beyond what she looks like - is she well-rested, well-fed, and strong? Today was a milestone in that radical self-love. I am definitely in perimenopause now with a whole cluster of symptoms a few months back: hot flashes, mood swings, dry mouth, achy joints, flesh blanket descending on my middle, and my period a skittish, random guest. So I am even more astonished and grateful for my body's endurance today.  I will continue to jog in astonishment and self-love!A thrifty note: the tee shirt I am wearing is from 2019. I always decline a new one with the registration. Too many branded, logo, advertising tee shirts in the thrift stores for me to contribute to that waste. So I keep wearing my race tee on repeat, even mending the holes that the bunny nibbled in it when someone who shall not be named borrowed my shirt."},
{"title": "A Long-Suffering Beret and a Wild Hat", "date": "Monday, April 3, 2023", "text": "I had this silvery-green wool yarn from a local shop, so not cheap. I knitted a beret. The band was much too loose, so I carefully handsewed a little knit headband inside. I wore it last winter, as in, the winter of 21-22. Great color, not a great fit. I wanted it to be a classic shape, the band not too tight or too loose, and a simple decrease.  I decided to undo the whole beret and knit it again with a different pattern. I did. It was a eensy-weensy beret. I almost gave up and gave it to Phoebe, but no, I took the dumb thing apart again. Now the yarn was so crinkled that I soaked it in cool water as a skein and laid it out to dry. I used the original pattern with different needles. Still NOT RIGHT. Now I read patterns very carefully, furiously, and doubtfully and finally finally finally, after knitting and re-knitting this beret over the course of the winter, I made a lovely beret that I like! The wool yarn was resilient and wonderful through this laborious process - thank you sheep, shearer, and spinner. Photos of me by *Phoebe*!                        In a much shorter process, Phoebe and I realized one cold morning just before her bus arrived that she did not have a beanie. I was delighted to solve this problem with my stash. I had seen and noted a local artisan who knitted hats from different weights and kinds of yarn. Like yarn patchwork! Using the little bits! Phoebe was game for a wild hat, and it was SO much fun. Some of the yarn in my stash comes from balls I let my children choose at the creative reuse store as a treat for coming along. That explains this weird pink chenille yarn that becomes excellent next to the other colors and wool. There's also one little strand of eyelash yarn in there, too, making a great texture. I am definitely making more wild hats."},
{"title": "When the Dog Bites. . .", "date": "Thursday, March 16, 2023", "text": "I was at my friend's house recently when she needed help in a hard time and I came across a potholder in her kitchen drawer that I had made long long ago. It was a funny blast from the past, but it also made me laugh out loud because her dog had clearly tasted a corner of the hotpad.                 I asked her if I could replace the bitten hotpad with a pair that matched her new kitchen better. She said yes! This is now the third time I have replaced my worn-out handmade hotpads for friends - I like knowing the hotpads are worn because that is what I meant them for. Satisfying all around."},
{"title": "Two Patchwork Pillows", "date": "Monday, March 6, 2023", "text": "I have been sitting in my bed more this winter - drinking tea, reading, journaling, you know, cozy things. In the past my whole house was a quiet sanctuary when the children were in bed, but these big beautiful children have independent social lives now and sometimes it takes place right in our house.    Which is good! Hilarious! But not quiet.  So I made myself a patchwork pillow to sit against the headboard and in the magic surprise of patchwork, I adore it. Restful yet not at all bland.         I limited myself to using my small scraps, which makes me extra-proud of my results. I used an extra throw pillow we had around, so I didn't have to buy anything at all for this project. This butterfly quilt was made by Grandma Weaver and I adore it.         I also saw the end of the patchwork living room sofa pillow. It stood up bravely to pillow fights (big kids!) and mending, but it was too worn for more mending.         I took the zipper out and used it again. For the last year or so, I have been pretty determined to sew down my stash, but I had a vision for deep purple in some way for this pillow and no fabric to assist me.         The striped fabric I found for pennies at the local creative reuse store is delightful in my living room. I pieced it with red and lavender and then I felt led to put baby rick rack on some stripes too.         Patchwork magic again! I am thrilled. I am less fond of the other side, but have moved on to other things."},
{"title": "Low-waste Tee Shirt Rug", "date": "Saturday, December 24, 2022", "text": "It is Christmas Eve, and the wind chill is -2°. I haven't written a post for months, as I become more middle-aged with all the internal processing and existential thoughts that entails. Possibly I will try to explain some of that sometime, but for right now, I will keep it simple and tell you about my rug triumph. (And throw in some pictures from Christmas tree acquisition, ok, because they're more fun than the rug pics).                 I needed a bath mat, and thought I could perhaps turn some of the ratty t-shirts around here into a rug instead of cutting them up for rags as I usually do. I am oversupplied with rags right now, but not bath mats! I'm calling this low-waste because I can't compost it when it wears out: one or two of the tees had some polyester content.                         I looked at a few YouTube videos of people crocheting rugs and got a big plastic crochet hook. I simply cut the t-shirts into approximately 1\" wide strips, as long as I could make the strips, and then sewed them end-to-end on my sewing machine as needed.         I found the crochet process addictive and delightful. Since I was making an oval, there were no ends of rows that invited me to stop, so I often kept on just going around and around. I started with about a six-inch ball of t-shirt yarn, and when that ran out I made another and kept going. I think there may be four or five t-shirts in this rug. It is actually somewhat heavy for its size and a little wonky in places due to the casual way I cut the strips.                 I also went back in with a needle and white thread and tacked down some of the more flyaway ends, which did not bother me at all. I'm sure a more experienced crochet-er could make a tidier rug, but overall, I am quite pleased. Phoebe has already requested a colorful crocheted rug for her room! We'll see."},
{"title": "The Vegetable Dress", "date": "Thursday, September 15, 2022", "text": "This dress turned out so differently from my vision. I'm still not sure I like it or will keep it. . . my vision was for a summer dress that was easy to wear, an everyday dress.         Yes, why did I pick fabric with a white background that needed a full lining? And. . . white? Why, Margo? The vegetables spoke to me, I guess? And the dress I made feels like a sweet, cute 1950s housewife dress - it doesn't feel like me!         I thought by way of decoration that the skirt lining could peek out with a bit of eyelet lace, but I've gotten well-meaning shocked comments that my slip was sticking out.  Overall, I think the dress is just a bit too sweet for me.         Funnily enough, I was at the optometrist one week, wearing the dress. The receptionist was so tickled to see there were vegetables on my dress. Then, when I brought Phoebe for her appointment next week, she remembered me (I was surprised - it's a big practice) for wearing the vegetable dress previously!         Fortunately the side pockets I added are successful. And the blue and white is such a refreshing cool vision on the eyes in the deep sticky stink of a city in summer.        I found the bodice very tedious to fit. I needed to take in the top and let out the bottom, but since the dratted thing is lined and a multi-piece princess style, I had to rip out and the reconfigure twice the number of seams.         All the photos on this post are by Phoebe! She did a fabulous job.This dress caused me to think more carefully about my wishes for summer dresses. I did some research on pattern styles, and thought of the clothes I have that I like the most for comfort and personal style. Then, I purged my sewing patterns and carefully bought some different ones. Stay tuned - I fit in some successful sewing in my busy summer!"},
{"title": "Raspberry Nightie", "date": "Monday, June 20, 2022", "text": "I cranked out a swishy yellow nightie for the growing girl.  The flowers are just so pretty on this vintage fabric from my stash. I used a size 5 pattern and just eyeballed some width and length. When I had her slip it over her head before I put the finishing sems in, we tore the armscye a bit. I'm afraid the vintage fabric might be a bit fragile. I topstitched a patch over the tear.         I did actually make the nightie too wide, so I put a pleat in the front neckline. Sewing over it with rick rack is a bit homemade-y looking, but I knew the fancier the trims, the more Phoebe would love it.         Well, it is pretty and she loves it! And raspberries. Keeping up with the bramble is a twice-a-day job right now, and the black raspberries are coming in, too. One of the fun parts of summer!"},
{"title": "Walking the Estate on a June Evening", "date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2022", "text": "Come view my plants with me! I'll tell you some tidbits about my plants and what's going on. I put some houseplants out for a bit of fresh summer air. Some of you advised me to put my spiderwort outside to get rid of its brown faded leaves. We'll see.         Another houseplant, the big spider from the dining room. I like to think it gives the hummingbirds a little cover at the feeder. The pink geranium is Phoebe's from 3 years ago! The red geranium is mine from last year. They cover up the sugar drips from the feeder quite prettily.         The rhubarb on the left is still going strong. The little swamp white oak grows steadily in the middle and the red raspberries on the right are exploding. I am hoping to make red raspberry jam this year. There's apple mint (meadow tea, the locals say) mixed in there, too.         This is my rain garden full of native plants, and I adore it. I am reading about native plants and having a real epiphany about their importance to the birds and bees and, you know, people. Because we are all connected and nature needs us to do our part to fix the damage.         My tomato plants were nibbled early on, but not recently. I suspect a rabbit family took up residence under the red raspberries and we have tried to make them feel unwelcome with bobcat pee and stern lectures. The plants are heavily mulched with grass clippings from my dad.         Black raspberries coming on!        The main raised bed has Phoebe's zinnias that she planted from seed, pepper plants, okra seedlings that I started from seed, and cucumbers and green beans just coming up. The okra seedlings were also being nibbled, but I suspected slugs or snails. I ringed each seedling with crushed egg shells and diatomaceous earth. The damage slowed down, so I guess it helped?In the back is my new composter gotten free from a neighbor via freecycle. My old composter sat on the ground and the mice made themselves free with it. I mean, I still got plenty of great compost but it annoyed me to feed mice so close to our house when they take any opportunity to come inside in cold weather. Behind the composter are some junk trees growing in the fences there. Their roots are not on our property but their branches sure are. One tree I have been cutting back for years. I don't want to use chemicals on them, but they look so ridiculous and they're not situated for anything useful.         Here is Phoebe's pepper plant and my new herb bed my husband made me. I am having a hard time thinning the basil seedlings. I love the transformation of seed to seedling to food so much that I can barely stand to take any of the seedlings away. I know, I know, they need the space. . . I actually transplanted some in my front porch pot to help my mental state!                My front porch flowers make me so happy. Just happy. Life is zipping by, my children are at a hectic age, but we walked the estate here and I'm grateful."},
{"title": "An Easy Calico Dress", "date": "Friday, May 13, 2022", "text": "I made Genevieve a first-day-of-preschool green calico dress and then lengthened it as she grew taller and then saved it for the little sister who wore it to literal shreds.         Mending fabric that is shredding due to age or heavy wear is like bailing a leaky boat. I've become a savvy mender by inspecting items carefully to make sure I can truly extend their life with mending. Here the fabric was giving out at the bottom of each tuck and I had already mended a three-corner rip that had torn open again. So, the middle of the green dress went in the piece bag, the top was discarded, the buttons put back in the button tin, and Phoebe said sadly, now I don't have a calico dress.          That is an easy fix!         I had a length of navy calico just barely enough for a Phoebe dress - I almost wrote \"little girl\" but Phoebe is just not very little anymore (and when you look at little Genevieve wearing the green dress - oh my heart! my little girls!).         I planned to use the same dress pattern as the green calico, but apparently I had gotten rid of it at some point. I used a Style pattern a neighbor gave me when she cleaned out her sewing stuff. I added some rick rack and juicy red buttons and that is a very smart summer dress.                 Phoebe has been helping me set up garden beds and plantings all week long as she quarantines for COVID reasons. She has a pepper plant named Rosalind now. She gets to read books with her pasta and pesto and watercress lunch.  A good week to be at home wearing an easy breezy calico dress!"},
{"title": "Rhubarb Morning", "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2022", "text": "I have my longjohns on again under my pants because the windchill is 29F, but the rhubarb is basically a bush again so I cut it for the first time this spring!         Those branches in the foreground are from little white swamp oak growing slowly but surely next to the rhubarb. There are lilies of valley on the other side. Other years, I have been planting zinnias in that bare patch but they really grow too tall for that space. I want to figure out another bright happy flower to sow there that is shorter.         I'm planning to make a rhubarb custard pie to share with friends this evening! And I still have some jars of chopped frozen rhubarb from last spring, oh dear. I got a tip from another friend to use rhubarb in winter soups and sauces where he would normally use lemon for tartness. It worked great for me."},
{"title": "Elbow Grease and the Cleaners I Use", "date": "Friday, April 22, 2022", "text": "I was inspired to write this post by Auntie Dorcas and now that I'm finishing it, it's Earth Day! (Let's keep Earth Day every day, ok? Like Mother's Day - honor the mothers and all the parents every day).         I refill my dish soap bottles at a local store with Better Life unscented dish soap. I jazz up my life by adding some drops of essential oil. The current mix, \"Happiness,\" has citrus and peppermint in it.        I also refill my laundry jugs at the same store with Ecos unscented laundry detergent. The clothes are scented by fresh air from the laundry line!        I refill these bottles because I have read that reuse is better than recycling. For our wood floors, we use Bona spray and a cloth as we see spots and over the whole floor rather, uh, infrequently.        To wash the tile floors and walls in the bathroom, I keep Dr. Bronner's castile soap on hand just because it smells so nice and I like the ethos of the company. I do have Murphy's Oil Soap for when we wash down the unpainted main wooden steps, but that is rare. I have some kind of wood polish or lotion or something for Grandma's rocking chair, the vintage buffet, and the vintage piano - a good job for a child who wants to earn some cash, so that task happens on whim.         I also have Windex glass cleaner around, but most of the time, a damp microfiber cloth is quickest and best on mirrors. I would dearly love to have sparkling clean windows all the time, but I have to really work up to the effort that takes with double-hung aluminum storm windows and cranky old wooden windows.         For the rest of the surfaces, I mix up cleaners from vinegar and Sal Suds. For general cleaning, I put 2 Tbsp. white vinegar, 2 Tbsp. Sal Suds in a spray bottle and fill up with water. For toilet bowl cleaning, I use equal parts vinegar and Sal Suds and just squirt 1-2 Tbsp. in the toilet bowl before scrubbing and letting it stand.         Before I detailed all of this, I thought I was just cleaning with Sal Suds and vinegar. Huh. I still am pleased with my current system and think it's reasonably earth-friendly. We use rags and elbow grease to clean (explaining elbow grease to kids is super-fun!). I have some paper towels way at the back of a closet, but in general, we avoid disposables and I have rags in almost every load of laundry which is just fine with me (also, am I the only one who will suddenly swipe off dust with an item of clothing headed for the dirty laundry hamper anyway?).I'm interested in your cleaners and methods and thoughts."},
{"title": "Chickweed Pastries", "date": "Wednesday, April 13, 2022", "text": "Spring is springing lusciously everywhere and it's been a cold one in our area, so all the green and flowers (flowers!!) are so wonderful.         A few years ago, I learned that chickweed is edible and available in my back yard. We never spray any pesticides or herbicides in our back yard because we have food growing there as well as children running amuck. I did plant some spinach seeds, but in the meantime, I made these spinach pastries by subbing in chickweed from the backyard.         These pastries come from Extending the Table, which is a companion book to the cookbook I use the most, More with Less. Extending the Table has recipes from cuisines and people all over the world, many of them with stories and insights about food justice and simplicity. The spinach pastry recipe comes from the West Bank, from the Bishara and Selwa Awad family, and they are delicious. Simple ingredients and technique, yet the resulting pastries are definitely from another place and tradition. I love that.      This time, I had two balls of dough left and no filling, so I quickly grabbed some leftover curry from the fridge and made two half-moon pies with it to distinguish from the chickweed filling. Grated cheese would work well also, and I think I have done peanut butter and jelly under duress, too. I served them with home-canned tomato soup. The pastries make nice picnic food, and aren't we all eager to get out into the warm air?        Spinach (Chickweed) PastriesCombine in bowl:3/4 cup warm water1 tsp. active dry yeast1 tsp. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1/4 cup olive oil2 cups whole wheat flourabout 1 cup all-purpose flourKnead a few minutes until nice and elastic. This is a lovely dough, not sticky, purely pleasurable to knead. Cover and allow to rise for 1 hour, give or take. Meanwhile, make the filling.Mix together: 4 cups packed, chopped spinach or chickweed, fine to include minced stems3/4 cup finely chopped onion1/4 tsp. pepper3/4 tsp. salt3/4 tsp. ground cumin2 Tbsp. olive oilThe dough doesn't necessarily need to rise, so when an hour is up, divide it into 18-20 balls. Roll a ball very thin (I find that flour is not necessary here). Put a heaping 1/4 cup filling in middle. Bring 2 edges together to form a cone shape, then the third side to form a triangle. Pinch seams tightly. Place on greased on silpat-lined baking sheet. Bake 350 for 15-17 minutes, until golden brown. Serve hot or warm. The recipe says you can freeze some unbaked pastries to bake later, but I have never done that."},
{"title": "Rain Barrel Management", "date": "Friday, April 1, 2022", "text": "We've had a rain barrel under one of our downspouts for years. In our city, it's important to manage rainwater which routinely floods our ancient combined sewer system and pollutes the river which pollutes the bay downstream. I use the rainwater to water our outside plants. In hot weather, the water gets a little smelly - haven't tried very hard to solve this problem in an eco-friendly way, so I want to know if you have solutions (and any other rain barrel management tips - you can see we are a no-frills operation).        I think most people in our area disconnect their rain barrels from their downspouts in freezing temps, but we have not. I do actually use rainwater through the winter on houseplants and with compost activities. It is important to keep the rain barrel from freezing as the ice can damage the barrel itself as well as the spigots and overflow spouts through expansion and thawing. On warmish days, I would try to remember to drain water as needed to keep the rain barrel at half full or less.         But I have hit on a more successful (for me) method: the stock tank heater. I don't love shopping as entertainment but it is true that sometimes shopping without a plan yields exciting problem solvers. I didn't even know there was such a thing as a heater for an animal's drinking water! \"K&H De-Icer\"        I just plug it in when the temperature is cold enough long enough to freeze the barrel. I do have to use an extension cord, which is not recommended, but our outlet is a new GFCI outlet so I am comfortable with the safety. The cord has a plastic sleeve to protect it from the top barrel edge as the heater floats along in the rain barrel.         After I bought this heater and had it going, my dad told me it's possible to buy stock tank heaters that are \"temperature limited,\" meaning they run on a thermostat and only heat the water to a pre-set temperature. That seems like a prudent energy saver that I would look for next time. I have now put away the stock tank heater three times this spring, mis-judging the depth of cold still in store for us. I am almost scared to put away the cold weather things again! Sadly, our neighbor's gorgeous magnolia buds were ruined in the last surprise cold spell, and I will miss the creamy pink blooms this spring."},
{"title": "Mittens Yet", "date": "Friday, March 25, 2022", "text": "Last fall, I made Phoebe nice black felted wool mittens from an old sweater. I even placed the cuffs on the ribbing so that they hugged her wrists. She ignored the mittens all winter until I finally realized they were just too plain (and sophisticated and New Yorky) for her style. I offered to add hearts to them and then would she wear them? Oh yes, little pink hearts stitched on with blue perle cotton were just the ticket.         I am still using the Purl Soho mitten pattern. It is so fast and uses just scraps of warm fabric! I can't justify knitting mittens again when these fleece ones are warm, fast, and economical. Plus, mittens are easy to lose, for anybody, not just kids, so I'm very pleased to have found easy, thrifty replacements.         I even made myself a pair of leopard print fleece. I added a lining of grey knit cotton because I like very warm hands.         We are having some spring-like days here and there - once I even put away the sleds and snowpants and stock tank heater from the rain barrel. That drew the attention of the snow gods and we got a not-little snowstorm, indeed we did. Spring, you really bring the drama! I have both my mittens and my barefoot sandals in rotation right now. I love it."},
{"title": "Family Salmon Pie", "date": "Tuesday, March 22, 2022", "text": "This is like shepherd's pie, only with canned salmon and white sauce instead of beef and gravy. I riffed on two recipes. One came from The Little Irish Baking Book, which is a delightful read that tucks me into the Irish countryside.         The other recipe was from Laura Ingalls Wilder's Country Cookbook, which is delightful for the interior photos of Rocky Ridge.                 I added some parsley and spinach with the peas, and kicked up the white sauce with some onion, celery seed, and dry mustard. When I drained the liquid off the canned salmon, I used that as part of the liquid for the white sauce. Even so, I thought the whole thing was a little on the bland side, but my family was enthusiastic. My husband called it comfort food. Good thing they all had seconds because the pie filled up my casserole dish more than I expected from my guesstimates and I was hoping I didn't have a big dud on my hands.            My mom filled this same casserole dish with macaroni and cheese when I was a kid. . . comfort food. . . one of the nostalgic necessities of home life.         And also, I realized I was making this Irish recipe wearing the Irish fisherman's sweater my parents got in Ireland in the 1970s when my mom was pregnant with me. I love these objects freighted with memories which are also in happy use in my current life!"},
{"title": "Seeking Advice on This Houseplant", "date": "Tuesday, March 15, 2022", "text": "My Grandma Weaver's house was full of houseplants, many of them given to her from owners who gave up trying to keep the plants happy. The entire wall in her daylight basement housed babies and big ones of all kinds, nurtured in plastic margarine tubs, yogurt cups, or old plastic nursery pots. When she passed on to glory 20 years ago, I was thrilled to get two of her houseplants.         My sister and I shared the jade plant and have propagated many baby jade plants successfully over the years (Locals! You can always hit me up for a baby jade plant).         However, I am baffled by the spiderwort plant I have. It has nice looking pink and green tips, but all these papery dead leaves on the rest of the stems. I have tried re-potting, different light, re-propagating and starting over.. . . but it always reverts to this disheveled look with pretty tips.         It still looks strange even with the dead leaves removed.  I'm loathe to ditch the spiderwort because it's a direct connection to a grandma I cherish. . . but I'm not pleased with its looks. Any advice for getting rid of those dead-looking stems/leaves? For getting it to look less scraggly?        I think partly what is going on is that perfectly-shaped houseplants in trendy pots are terribly popular right now. This is testing my loyalty to my houseplants that are less cute. Also, spring is springing and I feel the urge to clean up, freshen up, and refurbish all the things."},

I trim the strings off, zig zag the edge in matching thread, and then fold it over just a quarter-inch to stitch it down. Makes a new edge and the towel keeps going. Currently most of our bath towels are wedding presents from 22 years ago. . . and counting!         Then there was this washcloth that turned up with a frayed corner. It looks like a dog chewed on it, but that's puzzling since we don't have a dog. So I cut off the top strip entirely and stitched down the flat part to make a new edge. Let's see if that one can go 22 years, too."},

In fact, all the materials for this tunic were on hand.        I have used this pattern before for Genevieve.         As I sorted through notions for the tunic, I discovered the most astonishing matching flannel, a scrap I have had in my stash for years and enjoyed looking at.         Look! It matches like the calico and flannel came from the same fabric line in 1970! Different fabrics bought as scraps from different stores, marinating in my stash for years, joined in such happiness. I just love it. Phoebe does too!"},
{"title": "Why and How I Hang Laundry Outside in Frigid Winter", "date": "Wednesday, January 12, 2022", "text": "Choose the whites to hang in sunny frozen winter. They will bleach!         I am willing to get numb fingers for anything that can really benefit from a free bleach. Otherwise, I put the unmentionables and rags, etc. inside on the radiators. Here, I hung these bits outside when the ambient temperature was 12F with a real-feel of 3F. The clothes were frozen stiff within the 5 minutes it took me to do this.         Their line-dried deep-winter fresh scent was just exactly what I crave.        Also, please notice my nice big clothes dryer! It is this one from Lehman's, made in the USA. My old one was a similar umbrella style and had been repaired and babied along and rusted for a number of years now until it dramatically flopped to the ground this past summer (yes, with laundry on it - sighhh).         I am very pleased with my sturdy new one. It is leaning to one side because I simply used my old ground screw (like a pipe you literally screw into the ground which provides a hole for the clothesline to stand in and is flat to the ground otherwise for mowing or running over). which is slightly large. The clothes dryer comes with its own ground screw which I'm sure, some day, I will get around to installing. When the weather is bad or we want the whole yard for our activities, I remove my clothes dryer from the yard. It can hold 4-5 loads of laundry, although keep in mind that my washing machine is on the smaller side. I am really happy with this clothes dryer and drying our things without electric or gas. My friend, also in town, uses the Amish method of pulleys with the clothesline high above her yard. Another city friend has a drying rack that she puts outside in good weather. Many ways to get the wet clothes out in the fresh air!"},

A little kitchen luxury for the cook. My old hotpads had been used and washed so hard that the fabric was splitting.                 I moved them to the outdoor kitchen where they will get some more grease and black spots in their useful life before going in the compost.         For the new ones, I used fabric scraps that were lingering in my stash because they weren't 100% quilting-weight cotton. I tried to mostly stick with darker fabric or with busy prints, and I do love kitchen brights.         As filler, I used felted wool sweater scraps that were so thick the hotpads barely fit under my machine's walking foot. The hotpads are wonderfully insulated, if a little thick and stiff, but they are great with the cast iron which gets quite hot.                 Please, if you have insights or reflections for \"out with the old, in with the new,\" leave a comment with your wisdom. Or if you just want to chat about hotpads, I am all ears for that, too. Happy New Year, dear friends!"},

That ridiculously overdone thing that needs to stop hogging winter. We're doing Christmas at my house, yes, and my children are all in a tizzy about it, but I'm focused on winter. . . and soup.         Here's one of my favorites, from Fountain Avenue Kitchen. My photos are mediocre, snapped in the rush of supper and daily life, but I promise you this recipe is a keeper.

{"title": "A Big Quilt for My Sister", "date": "Wednesday, December 8, 2021", "text": "For a few years, my sister talked about the quilt she wanted, and I began to take notes. Teal. Grey. Orange. Modern, not traditional old quilt patterns. Noted. I love making quilts for my family!         My sister had a big birthday (number, not party) early in the COVID shut-down. I told her my present to her would be her quilt and that it would not be done until it was done. She told me that she wanted it to be a surprise. So I have been keeping the quilt off social media, where we both hang out, and the one time I went down to North Carolina with her and her husband, I sat in the back and quilted and she chose to keep her gaze forward. I think that was a hard time for her, but I could not bear to sit empty-handed on such a long drive with such a big quilt to finish. The quilt also traveled with me by car to upstate New York, to the beach a few times, and camping where it picked up some dirt and smokiness (I washed it when it was done!).         This is a large queen-sized quilt. I pieced it in rows, slipping four-patches in every other row, and a little piecing on the back. I machine quilted long lines parallel to the row seams. Then I hand-quilted with black perle cotton down the middle of each row, stopping to outline the little four-patches. I adore striped binding, and I do really like my decision to have that as the only pattern on this quilt.                 I finished the quilt a few days before Thanksgiving, and my big kids helped me get photos of it.         Not only were we all happy on Thanksgiving being inside and so very normal together, but then I got out the quilt to give to my sister. So much joy!         I started her quilt in April 2020 and finished it in November 2021. I already know what my next quilt will be: entirely sourced from my overflowing piece bag."},
{"title": "Two Blue Dresses ", "date": "Wednesday, October 27, 2021", "text": "In January, deep in covid-cautiousness, my sister got married. It was a delight to dress up again and celebrate!         Phoebe was the flower girl, although as soon as she said \"flower fairy,\" the title stuck. My sister said we should choose whatever dress we wanted (I have the best sister and she was never, not even for one second, a bridezilla). I had a delicious deep dive on winter flower girl dresses, developing a vision that suited all parties: dressy but not out of regular church-wear, wintry but not black or white, flexible with whatever other colors appeared at the wedding. . .         I used a simple Prussian blue cotton from my stash. I found a gorgeous net sequin fabric for the overskirt at JoAnn's as well as pink satin to line the bolero. For cold weather, she wears the bolero. For warm weather, it's a sundress! I wanted to give Phoebe as many chances as possible to enjoy wearing her dress, but wanted it to look appropriate in any season. At that time, I could not predict when we would be going out in nice clothes again and I did not want any more nice clothes hanging sadly in our closets, especially the handmade ones.          I thought I could just gather two rectangles of the net fabric into a black ribbon and tie the overskirt on at the sides, but it ended up being too heavy so I basted it onto the waistline for the wedding.         Phoebe and I are both so pleased with this dress! She has indeed worn it in all its iterations since January.                        The second blue dress is a school uniform dress. I added some light blue topstitching to liven things up.         It has a deep hem, so I'm planning to let it out as Phoebe gets taller. I love Peter Pan collars and here with the puffed sleeves, it's such a charming retro look.         I had all the supplies in my stash! When my older kids were starting school, I laid in a supply of fabric that would work for uniforms. Our district currently does uniforms until 6th grade and I think that is just right: let the little kids scramble into a prescribed uniform, let the big kids define their own style as they fledge into adulthood.                Phoebe is really the only child I sew for any more. I feel like I live with three other adults and a child! In fact, Genevieve turned 16 this week, oh my word. Such is the speed of life...."},
{"title": "Fun With Okra", "date": "Thursday, September 23, 2021", "text": "Without exception, my family loves okra. Okra loves hot weather, which is why it is such a Southern thing, but it is possible to grow it around here and I have found it from some local farmers occasionally. But to really ensure an adequate supply, we have started growing it in our backyard! green beans on left, tomatoes in back, okra on front right        Our first crop was last summer - we started the plants from seed, mainly my husband driving this with his outsize love for okra, and were astonished at everything about them. The okra plants get about 8' tall and their stalks are woody like trees, so it's not easy to get them out of the garden in the fall.         The pods grow from gorgeous hibiscus-like flowers. And the pods grow fast. We try to harvest them at 3-5\" long, but even when we miss some and they are longer than that, they have stayed tender and not woody, thank goodness.         This picture has a funny story. I picked the garden in the morning, and then I wanted a picture of a person with the okra plants to give you some idea of their height. I brought my husband outside to help, and I am struggling to hold all the okra pods he found after I thought I had picked all of them! He called me \"okra-blind,\" oh my word. I retorted that the pods grew big enough in the few hours between pickings! Also, we are getting about a quart of okra pods daily right now from 10 plants. Amazing.        Okra pods keep pretty well in the fridge. My go-to recipe is to slice the pods in coins, toss with some flour and cornmeal and a seasoned salt or equivalent, then fry in a hot oiled pan until they get some crispy, browned edges. We never have leftovers!Extremely proud to have okra, green beans, and tomato pesto (on pasta) all from our backyard garden!        Another easy method is to oil the pods lightly, salt and pepper, then grill until they are browned in places and even splitting open a little. So so so good. When time permits, I make gumbo. And I was astonished to see at this linked blog post that we also grew okra in 2010. I have no memory of that whatsoever!         This year, I also pickled some okra because there was so much on hand. I used the Ball Blue Book recipe, which is essentially the same as the dilly beans I like to can. If you have okra recipes to recommend, please do!        Public service announcement: I absolutely re-use my canning lids if they are free of nicks, dents, rust, and the like.  I have been doing this for years. There was (is?) a canning lid shortage due to the pandemic, but I recommend this practice for economical reasons even when there is not a shortage. I have found no difference between lids that went through a waterbath or through the pressure canner. The main thing is to reuse lids in good condition. Iffy lids are used on jars that are used for food storage in the freezer or elsewhere, or recycled in my metal bin that I take to a salvage yard.        A word about how I did those okra pickles: I looked at the recipe one night, pulled the jars from the basement the next morning while waiting for the coffee, washed them later in the morning while on a phone call, stuffed the okra pods and garlic cloves in the jars in the afternoon before picking up Phoebe, mixed the brine and filled the canner after picking up Phoebe, and finally assembled the jars and canned their butts right before we went out the door again to Ben's game. It goes to show that little chunks of time can add up to a finished project. Dogged determination gets everything done, right? We choose what we spend our precious time on, and food preservation is important to me, but dang, family life is busy."},
{"title": "A Pilgrimage", "date": "Monday, September 13, 2021", "text": "A friend told me that the Baltimore Museum of Art was hosting an exhibit of Gee's Bend quilts, and I knew I needed to see these quilts in person. This is my third fall with the big kids' sports laid over top of the garden and preserving, laid on top of regular family life which keeps me hopping to begin with. I'm in survival mode right now, but I was determined to see these quilts. I did!        I love these quilts for their beauty and seeing the artistic decisions the quilters made in the urgent utility of using what they had and keeping their families warm.         They remind me of the wholly practical approach my Grandma Weaver had. No time for fussy stitches, matching corners, purchasing coordinating fabric or enough fabric so the whole quilt was the same. That pragmatism is beautiful to me on its own. \"Use it up, wear it out, make it do, or do without.\"         The exhibit notes also explained how the Gee's Bend quilters received Martin Luther King Junior in their isolated community three weeks before \"Bloody Sunday\" in Selma, Alabama, and how they leveraged their quilting fame for racial justice and voting rights after that. And now I connect to the quilts through that lens, too. After George Floyd's murder in May 2020, I began a personal journey of education and activism regarding systemic racism.         I have mixed feelings about the Gee's Bend quilts (and Amish quilts) being displayed in art museums and called art. Certainly I agree that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and these quilts are stunning. However, I think of art as made to BE ART. The people who make art think of themselves as artists. They should get paid for that and recognized as artists, and note \"artist\" as profession when they fill in that line. The rest of us who make beautiful things, accidentally or on purpose, I want respect for us, too. I'm quibbling with art museums being the highest standard of respect for beautiful things.         It's similar to the mindset that truly beautiful rooms and homes are the ones showcased in magazines. I reject that - those places are often showcases that simply photograph well, not homes where people are happy, industrious, and engaged in life.         How can we respect the quilters of Gee's Bend, the Amish quilters, the everyday quilters like me? We are often the homemakers whose unpaid work in running our homes and raising children and the like is not counted as economically significant or valuable. And the quilters of Gee's Bend have the added layers of poverty and Black skin as well. It's a lot easier to take the quilts from Gee's Bend and exhibit them in an art museum, to say they are \"eye-poppingly gorgeous\" (New York Times, Michael Kimmelman, 2002) than it is change attitudes towards poor Black female homemakers.          There were only five quilts in the exhibit. I stood in front of them and cried behind my mask (useful for that, isn't it?). And then I drove home and got out my own needle and thread again."},
{"title": "The Madras Skirt I Wanted to Wear On Vacation", "date": "Sunday, August 15, 2021", "text": "In June, I was packing for a family trip to Niagara Falls and the Finger Lakes in New York when I realized I did not have a fun skirt I wanted to wear. (Related blog posts I have toyed with writing: Why Do We Get Tired of Our Clothes? And what can we do about it? Also, Why Do I Loathe Packing So Very Much? Really, why? Maybe I should find out why some people enjoy packing to shed some light on my loathing?)        It was late at night and I was not nearly done packing, but the ding-dong pandemic has ridded me of some pragmatism, so I went immediately to my fabric shelves to see what was \"fun.\" Madras! And also unbelievably soft with the wonderful intersections of colors creating new colors. I googled \"madras skirts\" and spent some daydreamy moments in our trip designing the madras skirt I wanted.         I found an image of a Ralph Lauren skirt that fired my imagination, so I modified a simple wrap skirt pattern I had to add the ruffle and make a tie closure instead of a button. I inserted some pretty little scraps in the ruffle and tie for the patchwork fizz I like, but then when I saw the ruffle in the mirror, I unpicked the biggest pieces and took them out. Just didn't like them - patchwork can be so surprising. I left the smaller pieces intact.         I had enough madras left to squeak out a tank top (another Sorbetto tank). I love wearing the skirt and tank together for a dress look, or mixed with other shirts and skirts to hopefully avoid clothing boredom.                 The madras is a dream to touch. Truly the best thing float off sticky sweat in hot weather. However, it is really lightweight, almost delicate, and I did not add a pocket to the skirt because I was unsure it could handle the stress on the seams. I also could not quite figure out where to slap a pocket on a wrap skirt. Bummer. I really rely on pockets.        Back to packing: I have noticed that it does bring my clothing collection into focus when I pack for a trip. Suddenly I see that I have tons of navy, or that my tank tops are stretched out and sad, or that my favorite sandals need to be replaced soon. Or that I want a fun skirt! So that is a good thing I can focus on for future packing. . ."},

Very few of the recipes require time ahead of time for marinating or something. Most of her technique is unfussy or flexible where it's unusual, and she's not bossy or snobby. Most of the food I've made has been delicious and creative and very more-ish.

{"title": "Old Sheets, New Jammies, New Curtains", "date": "Saturday, July 24, 2021", "text": "I save sheets that have a stain somewhere, a rip, or whose partners were worn to shreds. I use sheets in sets, pretty much, so the orphan sheets go into my fabric stash.         I made pajamas for myself with a sheet from a Tommy Hilfiger set I bought for Genevieve when she graduated to a big bed. So, that would be about 12 years old now, and that speaks to the quality of the namebrand in this instance. I had a pair of pajamas from Old Navy clearance a few years back that were so floaty and cool, I laid them down on the sheet and used them as a pattern. I also used a length of cotton eyelet to fancy them up a bit.                 Then, the new bedroom needed some curtains.  I had a lot of fun treating myself to fabric from Spoonflower.         But here's a little word of caution: this was my first time ordering fabric from Spoonflower. I bought 8 yards of their petal cotton, giving myself 2\" to spare with all the seam allowances included. I prefer this kind of no-waste sewing because, even though I adore patchwork, my piece bag overfloweth and there are only so many little piecey projects one house needs.         But when the fabric came, there was a wide white selvage on the sides and both ends. I expected selvage on the sides, but not on the ends! Uneasy, I measured the whole dang yardage and discovered it was 6\" shy of 8 yards. When I contacted Spoonflower help in a froth, she said that 1-4% shrinkage is within the range they stated on their website and also that the fabric is cut and measured before the dyeing/printing process and it shrinks after that in its mordant process. She indicated if the fabric was unusable that they would give some kind of refund/discount, but I did not feel right about doing that because I did indeed use the fabric and the shrinkage was what they stated. I did suggest to her that they clarify when the shrinkage happens - as part of the manufacturing process, even before the washing the buyer is going to do at home.  Never have I done measuring and math for shrinkage of commercial fabric I have purchased and washed, but any shrinkage always seemed negligible. Please note that I am not mad at Spoonflower, just newly aware of the differences in purchasing from smaller companies.                          On the plus side, I do not have one single shred of this fabric left over.         I made the narrowest possible hems on the tops and bottoms, and cut the height as skinchy as possible. I think they turned out well! I used old white sheets as the lining fabric. I do find old sheets really useful.         What do you do with old sheets?"},

Sometimes I increase the sauce amounts to use a full pound of pasta because my people eat a lot of food these days. I'm also cooking outside on a single-burner induction cooktop to keep the steamy heat out of the house.

More than I would ever need to make Phoebe little girl clothes (and have you seen her recently? She's basically a grown up).         I printed out the Sorbetto tank top pattern, and was pleased with the resulting tank top (made that laborious pattern printing, taping, cutting process worth it).                 This summer when I pulled it out to wear it, I really wished for a dark denim skirt to go with it. I had another small but pretty piece in my stash, wouldn't you know. So I made a little denim skirt, shorter than I would normally wear, but it was a small piece after all. This is the same pattern I used for my yellow skirt, different view.                  I used a navy calico inside the waistband and at the hem for a private pretty for me, but also to stretch the denim as far as possible. I always put pockets in the clothing I make, but I literally had a few scraps left from the denim piece. I held them up to the skirt a couple different ways and just made up a pocket! I top stitched the heck out of everything with red thread, and I am really happy with this comfortable skirt. Bonus: it matches the Sorbetto tank!                 Genevieve floated the idea that maybe I could make her a denim skirt and I was all, well, you look in the fabric cupboard and see what you find, but I am sewing down my stash, so good luck."},
{"title": "Our Really Big House", "date": "Monday, June 14, 2021", "text": "Living in close quarters through a pandemic changes how we think about our houses, doesn't it? I always liked the open floor plan of our first floor - made it easy to supervise little kids, seemed light and open.  But in the pandemic, we realized we didn't have doors to close on spaces when a number of us needed to be on separate screens, on separate Zooms (oh, Zoom, how we hate and need thee).         My husband and I crunched the numbers and decided to take over the rest of the second floor apartment. When we bought our three-storey house, each floor was an apartment. When Genevieve was a newborn, we renovated the house to add interior stairs and create a first floor apartment for us that included part of the second floor. Over the years, we have gradually nibbled away at the second floor apartment until 2 weeks ago when we swallowed it entirely.                 Glory be, we added another bedroom, a family room, and a bathroom! Now our girls have separate rooms, which is a wonderful development in their relationship. Now I have an actual desk in our family room instead of just a drawer next to the dining room table.                 It feels incredibly luxe to not have to wait for someone else in the bathroom, to have masses of storage in the new bathroom, to have a second fridge in the apartment kitchen (and sink and stove, but the fridge is what I immediately put into use). We even have a second staircase to access our new space.         It's disorienting, honestly. The first night in the new bedroom, I kept worrying about my babies, spread out all over this huge house. I'm still a little puzzled about how much desk stuff to take up to my desk and how much to leave in the dining room, which I have realized is the nerve center of the house.                        We had to acquire some more furniture and organizing things. I did my best to buy second-hand items from local sources. The way I see it, not only is this cost-effective, but better for the planet than manufacturing new (cheaply made) stuff that is shipped from everywhere. But oh my, I am also now experiencing the big-house effect, where I have doubled the bathroom equipment, added more bedroom furniture for Genevieve, and considering how many duplicate desk supplies I need upstairs that are already in use at other desks. We have another air conditioner in a window, too, now, which I recognize as really helpful in our swampy summers, but hate the enlargement of our carbon footprint. Living in small spaces makes us efficient, for sure."},
{"title": "Little Red Elephant Shirt", "date": "Thursday, June 3, 2021", "text": "We got an interesting bag of hand-me-downs for dress-up from another family when Genevieve and Ben were small. I pulled out a little appliqued skirt for real clothes because it was so charming.         I am avoiding buying new fabric, even new-to-me, until I really use up some of what I have. So I poked around what I had and came up with this red-striped fabric. It also starred in the Swedish summer pillow. I used the same shirt pattern from Phoebe's anchor shirt (look how little she is!), and just as I was finishing up the facings, I recalled that I had some vintage elephant buttons that my mother-in-law gave me a while back. Oh, how I love matching up disparate things to make something I love! My brain shuts down at the thought of selecting all the notions and fabric and patterns from the universes available on the internet. Truly. Much easier for me and more fascinating creatively if I poke through my own collections to design a garment.         So I came up with these two little red elephant buttons and sewed them on the front, and I just love them. It's a whole elephant ensemble, with the appliqued elephants on the skirt.        I forgot to take  a picture of the pretty zipper pull on the vintage zipper. It's a nifty little ring.         The big sister has requested a dress. I am thrilled - she is not into mom-made clothes much anymore. Stay tuned!"},
{"title": "Green and Growing", "date": "Thursday, May 27, 2021", "text": "Last weekend, I was talking to a blogger friend who has also drifted into silence on his blog, and we agreed that we missed writing and then we further vowed that we would blog again. So here I am! Let's start with all the green things. The plants are hard to distinguish in the photos. If you're local, come for a tour: we can safely do that again, praise the Lord! My loosestrife did not come back in the cute little olive pot, so I pulled a spider baby off a houseplant and a piece of creeping Jenny from the tree well and poked them in there. It's only been a couple days, but they don't look dead so I'm hopeful.        The big pot has lemongrass, purple basil, apple mint, petunias, marigolds, and creeping jenny. I love mixing edibles and flowers. The nasturtium seeds are germinating unevenly for the second summer in a row. I think I need to buy more and sow more heavily to get a decent amount. That parsley overwintered and surprised me.                 We are making a pea gravel patio in our backyard after talking about it for years. It's coming along and we are using it in its half-completed state, eating supper outside most days on our new dining set before the mosquitoes get going. We also made a rain garden to absorb the runoff from our roof after my husband piped the spouting under the patio. Our city has a runoff problem that is polluting nearby waterways, so this is one way we are working at it. We followed directions to blend the soil with compost and sand and dig the bed out to encourage absorption. The native plants can handle soggy roots if needed. We planted a redtwig dogwood, black-eyed susans, Joe Pye weed, turtle heads, and another shrub whose name I don't recall. I loved this project!                 I planted kale last fall and was pleased by the harvest and thought it was done, but it appeared this spring. Bonus! Or maybe that's what kale does? I still have a lot to learn about growing food. My sugar peas are just starting and we've been harvesting spinach for a few weeks now. I transplanted 4 tomato seedlings to nurture; we get volunteers every year from the heirlooms planted years ago. It's thrilling, but maybe not advisable for crop rotation and soil diseases.         We grew okra for the first time last year and it was a huge success: easy to grow, nutritious, popular with the fam. The seeds my husband saved did not germinate, however, so I just bought seed (not really easy to find in the north) and we're trying again. The red and black raspberries are going nuts. I lost my hold on a container of organic berry fertilizer this January and whoops, they got overfed.         The rhubarb is also turning into a bush! That is a little swamp white oak tree next to it, which is finally taller than me. It is a slow growing tree, but I was just reading this spring how oaks are the backbone of the regional tree ecosystem, so I'm pleased to be part of that. My family gives rhubarb the side eye, but I love it, so I'm still figuring out how much I can realistically use or preserve and whether I should give it away. I did already freeze some to use as a tart element in winter cooking instead of lemon: got that tip from a friend who also likes to cook with local food.         How are your plants doing? And how are you? I missed you and plan to keep writing here!"},

I am homeschooling Phoebe and she is a dear little student. Our school district is currently totally virtual, and it just did not make sense for Phoebe to enter kindergarten on a screen with me trying not to chew my arm off beside her.        I am grateful that I have a flexible schedule and some years of parenting under my belt. The skills that I need are not really the skills I gained as a high school English teacher, but rather the skills I learned through parenting: patience, cheerful matter-of-fact firmness, calmness, and capacity to enjoy my child and enter into her world.         For curriculum, I queried the homeschool parents I know who have taught their children kindergarten. I read some websites in the manner of surveying the landscape. Our state uses the Common Core standards and since we intend for Phoebe to return to in-person schooling in the future, I read those standards and chose curriculum aligned with them. We are using:Explode the Code Book 1DK Geography, Kindergarten levelsome partially used kindergarten math books from a friend in the district because the Argoprep Introducing Math! Kindergarten book I bought is too advanced.                          Daily, Phoebe draws in a journal and writes the date. We go over the days of the week, the months and seasons, and do some counting as we ascertain the date.  I read out loud to her; currently we are devouring the Little House books. We spend about an hour on homeschool every morning.         Then she plays her heart out and talks our ears off the rest of the day. She keenly misses peers as her older siblings are so much older - another reason we want to send her back to in-person school. As for Genevieve and Ben, they are doing their virtual school thing with their district-issued iPads. Each class has two Zooms a week and the rest of the work is asynchronous. Fortunately, they can still play their sports because these are outside and can be mostly socially distant. I'm grateful they have that fresh air, exercise, excitement, and teamwork."},
{"title": "Orange Linen Pants", "date": "Tuesday, July 28, 2020", "text": "I've been wanting wide-leg pants for a while, but I loathe pants shopping. I knew I would sew some wide-leg pants eventually, but I was held back by the complicated fitting and finding the right fabric weight.                 But then my sister showed up to our (socially distanced!) backyard firepit fun wearing flowy black linen pants and that is exactly the right outfit on a muggy evening when the mosquitos are out. I actually started down the online pants shopping path until it occurred to me that these are not fitted pants: they are essentially pajama pants and I have made lots of pajama pants!         I found this heavy, soft orange linen in my stash; it was enough for a dress, but orange is not a color I wear next to my face.         I used my standard pajama pants pattern, modifying the crotch to be higher and cutting the legs to fall straight and wide instead of taper.  I added patch pockets and a paper bag waist, using a casing of bias tape inside. The drawstring has 20\" of elastic for comfort. I also finished the hems with orange bias tape because they were just the right length and proper length pants are so important.                 These photos were taken by my husband on a (socially distanced!) beach family getaway.         The beach in the evening means fewer people, no sunscreen, fabulous light, and (ugh) biting flies. The pants kept my legs protected - my husband, wearing shorts, spent a lot of time whacking flies off his legs with my flip flops.         I'm  really happy with these pants! I plan to wear them with tops of all colors.Are you wearing wide-leg (public pajama) pants? Do tell!"},

We are coping.  My silence on the blog is just due to underlying pandemic stress sapping my energy (amen?).Due to some people in this house whacking each other with the living room throw pillows, I needed to replace a pillow cover.  I have a pillow cover for hot weather and one for cold weather.  That is about as seasonal as my decorating gets! They ruined the hot weather cover.I made a pillow cover of reds and greens, with the colors lightening up into the middle of the pillow.  Normally I love the surprise of patchwork, but this time, the results lacked the gravitas I wanted in the living room.  It looked like a little girl's bedroom to me, and I could not unsee it.I kept turning this problem over in my mind at odd moments, poking through my fabric stash at other odd moments, and then I came up this red striped fabric and doily. No patchwork this time!Ah, now this fits my vision of a summer I want to have: a little cottage by a lake, with tall trees and wildflowers and blue pitchers of milk, whitewashed walls in the sunshine, and a rocker creaking on the porch. Probably I would be alone. I love my people dearly and am very grateful for the community support we give and get. . . .but oh, my, I am a little fried from my people home all the time."},

No evening commitments tonight, so it didn't matter.  Flavor was worth it, though!Also, if you chop the kale stems very thinly and put them in the hot pan for 5-10 minutes by themselves with the lid on, they will be tender enough to eat with the sauteed leaves.  It's a small thing I do to cut down on food waste.Thawing for supper.Thursday: chicken tikka masala in the slow cooker from Stock the Crock with swiss chard as well; turmeric brown rice; nigella seed naan; pear chutney; pickled lemonsNotes: If I'm making a saucy stew with a flavorful sauce, I usually bulk it up with vegetables to capture the sauce.Also, I mixed the nigella seed directly into the naan dough this time because it kept falling off when I sprinkled it on top in previous batches.  Success!I'm working on using my little jars of canned goodness.  Hence the spiced grape butter on Monday, pepper jam on Tuesday, and chutney here.Friday: pepperoni/onion pizza, fancy mushroom pizza with white sauce and truffle oil, radish top and green olive pizza; chips!!! frozen peachesNotes: The fancy mushrooms are from a local farm who normally sells to restaurants. My husband gave me truffle oil and truffle salt for Christmas - I am totally hooked. I tried to recreate a mushroom pizza from a local restaurant I love and I'm very pleased with my version - except that I forgot to put salt in the dough when I mixed it up which shows the state of my brain these days.Saturday: take-out Chinese!Notes: We rarely buy take-out or go to restaurants as a family, but we wanted to support our favorite local Chinese place. It was a total treat - a break from the heavy-duty cooking I do and so delicious.Lemony Mashed PotatoesI got the recipe from Jennifer, who got it from Melissa Clark.  I don't really consider it a salad, and this is how I make it.Boil until very tender:2 1/2 -3 lbs. chopped potatoes with skin onWhile they are cooking, mix together in bowl:zest & juice of 1 lemon1/3 c. olive oil2 Tbsp. mayo1 Tbsp. grainy mustard1 tsp. dried rosemary1 tsp. salt1 tsp. freshly ground pepper1/2 c. sliced scallionsDrain potatoes.

I want to start a quilt for my sister who has a big birthday in a few weeks, but instead, I sewed her masks.      My mom loaned me The Chilbury Ladies Choir by Jennifer Grey, which is set in World War II England. I really liked it! It helps me to calm down to think of people living through wars where they wanted to carry on with normal life, wanted to \"do their bit\" to help the situation, and could not make plans for the future. That's how I feel right now, even though I acknowledge how fortunate I am that I am not deprived of any comforts of a first-world existence.  Really.  Sometimes the store does not have the exact groceries that I have on my list, but come on, I have lived in other countries where the store selection was spotty.  I do not think we will starve.      For a while now, I have kept a well-stocked, deep pantry.  I have flour and yeast!  Now I am not sure if we should eat to the bottom of my stores, or if I should replace my replacements.  I am confused.  I recognize this as a sign of the underlying grief and stress that COVID-19 brings and I just chug along, limiting grocery shopping to one market trip a week and the grocery store to 2-3 weeks.       I am extremely proud of my menus, my resourcefulness with the food we do have on hand.  I know how to make do with odds and ends! I think my family is less impressed and wishes to know where I've hidden the chips. I am messing around with my sourdough as I have been since before Christmas, learning new ways and studying various methods.  When the library abruptly shut down lending, I won the jackpot with a full library basket that includes no less than four cookbooks, two on bread! Not that I have actually been reading them.  My big kids have been reading Harry Potter for the first time and coaxed me into reading along after I read the first book out loud to them. This is Phoebe's desk, her Christmas present; she loves it.I have gradually come to expect nothing from the future, except that I can't wait to hug dear ones outside my family again and sing in groups again. Oh, I miss singing so badly! I am really not making any future plans so that COVID-19 can't steal my plans again. When I remember to look at my calendar, I usually see something that I need to delete. Sometimes I rage, sometimes I cry.      I like to walk the estate (we live in the city; we have a yard) and revel in all my growing plants: the three types of raspberries growing back, our little tiny oak tree, my big rhubarb, the persistent meadow tea, the peas and spinach coming up strong in the new raised bed.  Inside, I found a grow-light lightbulb and a lamp and trained it on my sweet little herb seedlings in the windowsill. All this green, growing hope.  I crave it. How are you doing these strange, strange days?"},

I had a scrap of shower curtain, some outdoor fabric pieces, and an old life-preserver my father-in-law gave me filled with kapok. Kapok, I learned, is fluffy stuff from a tree that grows in the rainforest.I first sewed a bag out of the shower curtain and filled it minimally with kapok.  I wanted some softness, but not a fat pillow.  Then I encased the whole thing in the striped outdoor fabric.  I meant to put a loop on one end for easier grabbing and carrying, but oh well: such is the state of my brain these days.My rhubarb is coming out strong.  I just planted it last summer, so this is the first spring I will be able to harvest it.  I am thrilled!I babied an expensive little clematis last year, and it appeared to die in August.  Oh, I was mad.  Now, something green and viney is coming in that space and I think it's the clematis! In this strange spring, I want all the green, growing hope I can find.Here is Genevieve's new bunny, just a few months old, a mischievous little sweetie.  Genevieve named her Daisy Augusta Saoirse Diamond, and is entirely responsible for her.  There is so much joy in this relationship!  Daisy's poop is going be great in the garden.I've planted spinach and snow peas in the raised bed, as well as spinach in some containers out front. I also snagged some basil and parsley seeds at the grocery store.   This is really all the room I have to start seeds in a sunny location; the rightful occupants of this windowsill are visiting other windows in the house. ￼      I'm relieved that my summer seeds arrived yesterday - I had gotten an email saying they would be delayed indefinitely - so I am trying to be on track with the garden and trying to continue learning.

I had some difficulty getting the waistband just the right size - first it was too tight, then I pieced in some ease and it was too big.  But this print serenely disguises lots of things and keeps up the blue sky.I got to wear my circle skirt for a beach walk and dinner on the deck, although I was shivering by the end because Florida in January is not really balmy and there was a sharp breeze off the Tampa Bay.  But I'm a Northerner and I wanted to wear my Florida skirt in Florida.  Spring is gently rising around us, and I am eager wear this skirt soon again."},

I start something, walk off, and do something else, and stare into space, and burst into tears.We are playing board games, doing chores, watching movies, eating our normal good food with extra desserts (morale booster!), and deliberately, consciously, running around in the fresh air every day. I am an introvert and a homebody, so overall, if I don't look too hard at what is causing this situation, I'm content to cuddle down and nest with my dear ones. So, the beans. I actually don't have a photo of these beans because they only look like black beans, a little bit soupy. Enjoy these photos of Phoebe playing her daddy Uno instead!As I put the beans in my slow cooker this morning, I realized they are just absolutely what I want to be cooking in this strange time.  They are forgiving of my distraction, they do well with little check-ins throughout the day but they're fine without, they might get done early if the beans are fresh and then they can sit and wait for dinner.  They use pantry staples, and they are cheap and nutritious. They don't make a big mess, which is lovely because even though I have time - lots of time! -  to clean up the kitchen, I'd rather be sewing.  These beans are the kind of  simple, fundamental food we didn't realize we were craving.  They are creamy and salty and while they have flavor, they can be a side dish or the main dish of a meal.  Tonight we ate them spooned over cornbread with a crunchy purple cabbage salad with cilantro and lime and frying cheese. Also great next to garlicky greens and mac and cheese, or over rice with salsa.Home-All-Day BeansPut 1-3 cups dry beans, whatever color you like, in slow cooker in morning (I typically do 2 cups black beans in my 4-quart cooker).  Add water to cover by an inch or so.  Add a tablespoon or so of olive oil, a few shakes of cumin, a sliced garlic clove or two - I just slice it in my fingers with a paring knife, very quick and casual.  Turn on High. In an hour or so, stir the beans, add a little more garlic or cumin, and keep it all cooking.  I check on the beans intermittently, tasting and adding more garlic and cumin if I feel moved, and when they are almost soft, I add salt (the experts vary on when to salt cooking beans - eye roll - I get contrary sometimes and add it whenever I want to).  Sometimes I turn the cooker down to Low.  Sometimes I take the lid off mid-afternoon if the beans have more liquid than I meant them to have.Phoebe lost the Uno game, can you tell?

{"title": "Phoebe Gets Her Quilt", "date": "Friday, February 28, 2020", "text": "It is a big deal for me to finish a quilt! I started Phoebe's quilt in October 2018 and finished 14 months later.  Now, each of my children sleeps under a quilt I made.  Oh, that makes me happy!For Phoebe's quilt, I used crib sheets and scraps of clothing that she and we wore.  I limited the colors to pink, blue, and yellow, but I mixed in little exceptions to liven things up.I am quite serious about sewing down my stash, so I used the white fabric I had on hand for the squares, which means there are actually two slightly different whites.  For a few weeks after I made this choice, I was ashamed; the church of my childhood believed in  matching as part of its religion. For years, I have been slowly growing away from this perfectionism. Quilting and mending are spiritual metaphors for me, I reminded myself, so these whites are my choice to \"gather up the fragments and let nothing be lost\" (paraphrased from Jesus' words in the book of John after he extended the little boy's lunch of  bread and fish to feed thousands of people).Another use-it-up material did not work out so well for this quilt.  I bought pink yarn from the creative reuse store, making ties in the center of each pieced star with the goal of little felted balls.  But when I put the finished quilt through a hot wash and dry, the ties would not felt: the yarn was not 100% wool.  Cussing a little and refusing to drive and seek pink wool, I re-did the ties with pink perle cotton in my stash.I like to work in a bit of machine quilting on my quilts, but it didn't seem to fit in Phoebe's quilt.  So I handquilted the whole thing in white perle cotton, outlining the stars and then highlighting them further with diagonal lines.  I am not fond of quilting that runs all over a quilt, but prefer quilting that works in harmony with the patchwork.Phoebe's quilt pleases my eye.  She loves it, and so do I.  I am already deep into another patchwork project for the patchwork surprise I adore, as well as the pleasurable mental work of planning and dreaming The Next Quilt until I blink and find myself cutting fabric for it.  I'll keep you posted."},

Mr. Thrift is not pleased, as I run intense about stuff like this and he would prefer I calm down. I might.      The oldest has a new pet, a sweet little bunny,  that she worked long and hard to prepare for, but I was still out to the Amish stores yesterday to buy pellets and see about getting hay for her to burrow in. I bought the most beautiful, soft fabric at the creative reuse store the other day - I think, I dare to hope, it may be cashmere; the strongest, most declarative green  - not kelly, not dark green, just a strong, rich green green.  I overheard a standholder at market say she needed to get rubberbands for the egg cartons, and I had a bag of rubber bands down to her the very next market day because I am oversupplied.  We were both tickled.  And this is also the stand that still has local storage veggies, which I am so grateful for because buying and eating local food is my act of defiance and hope in the face of very large world problems.  Phoebe has had a dreadful cough and of course, it is worst at night and people are sleeping poorly around here. We read the news about the coronavirus with disbelief and worry. I do laundry every day.  I keep up!  I keep the family in good food.  I have a sore foot that is healing very very slowly, so I can't jog as much and this is changing my mental and physical health.  I do Pilates.  I try.       Ben has soccer games and soccer practices just about all the time (it seems).  He just absolutely loves it, so I try to work on my attitude about driving him all over creation.  We carpool, and I take my knitting along, and I enjoy my boy enjoying himself. I am studying sourdough bread.  I have borrowed books on the subject, and one or two blogs I read.  I made a few notes.  I make something with sourdough every week, as I have for about 10 years now, but I am tweaking and understanding it differently, and the feel of the silky strong dough is pure delight in my hands. I finished Phoebe's quilt.  That does really need its own blog post.

Phoebe and I poured out the buttons and put our heads together; I love the combination of ladybugs and little vintage flowers!  Then I found this scrap of woven ribbon in my ribbon drawer and scratched my head good and long over where to use it.  I put it on the mandarin collar and divided it evenly down the sides of the placket (it doesn't actually reach the hem), making little black machine-embroidered welts to finish the tops and bottoms.The blouse is from this pattern, and I do actually still have the flowered blouse that I made Genevieve.

{"title": "My Favorite Hair Product is Water", "date": "Tuesday, December 10, 2019", "text": "Ok, that title is kind of click-baitish, I know, but I'm here to update you on my curly-girl methods and it's true: water is my favorite product! I started trying the curly-girl method about 2 years ago. I finally feel like I have a handle on what my hair can do and what I'm willing to do for it.I love the DevaCurl shampoo and conditioner the best - I've tried several different brands by now. My hair is thick but fine, so it can easily get weighed down by the heavy moisture in lots of curl-recommended products. I never skip shampoo, and I do put my hair up after a shower in a regular towel for a few minutes so it's not dripping - I don't rub or pat my hair with the towel, so it doesn't make it frizzy. Then I put on some DevaCurl Wavemaker and gel and clip up the roots to help hold up the weight of the wet hair so it doesn't dry flat. I use about 5-7 clips, mostly on the top of my head; one key clip pinches a cowlick in the back so it doesn't show so much.  I give it as many hours as I can to dry, remove the clips, and scrunch a little to break up the crunchy gel.  When this bottle of gel is done, I'm going to try something else that doesn't give me the 80s rocker look.  Not my look.So at bedtime, here's when I use my favorite hair product: I spray my hair thoroughly with water and go to bed with a wet head. Overnight, my curly waves bounce back into soft, generous curls.  In the morning, I ruffle my hand through the curly waves and that's it! I used to try spraying my hair with water in the morning, but it never did much except dripped on my neck.Bedhead! Still in my jammies so I can show you      I don't know exactly why sleeping with a wet head makes such wonderful hair, but at my fall haircut, the stylist said that's what she does (locals, let me know if you want an amazing DevaCurl stylist who is totally cool with low-maintenance girls like me and a desire to be environmentally friendly).       I only wash my hair every three days, so I get two days off from everything hair-related except for some squirts of water at bedtime.  See? Water is absolutely my favorite hair product."},
{"title": "Magic Elderberry Elixir", "date": "Tuesday, December 3, 2019", "text": "My friend and neighbor Jess told me elderberry was great. Rebecca told me it was great and sent it with her kids to college. I finally thought I would try, too.I used Wellness Mama's very simple recipe; I bought dried elderberries at a local grocery store, $4 for the amount needed for this recipe (locals, email me and I'll hook you up). The other ingredients are raw honey, water, cloves, cinnamon, and gingerroot, making this much less expensive than commercial versions. I figured it would be like taking vitamin C or putting extra garlic in the chicken soup when we had colds - just another tool to possibly shorten the length of the cold.  But no! I am convinced that taking elderberry syrup has literally killed several colds in our family already this fall! No one has taken to bed with a cold. No one has gone through more than a few hankies before we upped the dosage of elderberry and pow, the cold has entirely disappeared. For general maintenance, we take a half teaspoon or a teaspoon a day. We either take it straight or mix it with a little water.  When we feel cold-like sypmtoms, we take that dosage several times a day. We all like the taste of the syrup except Ben, who falls on the floor in dramatic horror every time I force him to take some. Whatever, Ben. You haven't missed out on any fun because of elderberry syrup, so your protests are in vain."},
{"title": "Use-What-You-Have Mittens for Phoebe", "date": "Friday, November 22, 2019", "text": "No surprise, Phoebe's sloth mittens were too small for her this fall when I dumped out the boxes of kid winter stuff and checked.  Sidenote: one of my biggest thrifty tips is thinking ahead to what you will need and then having the time to find it at a time/place/price that is good for you! So as one season is ending or a holiday is getting closer, I am taking a little time to look at my supplies and think.So, I thought Phoebe and I would have fun picking out new fleece for mittens, but on the morning that we could run to the nearest fabric store (JoAnn's - ugh), she was dragging her feet about running errands.  I delved into my little box of fleece scraps just in case and you know what? I found enough scraps that suited Phoebe and her new winter coat! The purple plaid is actually a beautiful, fine merino wool from a scarf my friend gave me after her dog chewed on one end; she was hoping I could use it to make something.  I did, Stephanie!  The teal fleece is just regular polyester fleece left over from something.From last year's experience, I put elastic in the wrists.  I made casings from red fleece bias binding - scraps from the Christmas stockings.Phoebe likes the mittens and wears them and that, I tell you, is Something.  She has strong opinions on her clothes, and I navigate carefully to teach her dressing well and also respect her opinion. I am not the parent who lets the kids wear whatever they want.The pictures of her on the porch in her winter coat show that she paired a red striped shirt and navy striped leggings - I suggested the denim jumper and red socks. Success!This outfit is a combined effort: she put the short-sleeved dress and leggings together, I made sure she had a navy cardi and pink socks and bypassed the flowered sneakers.  I think the splashy roses look good together! Wonder what other combinations we will cook up together. . ."},
{"title": "Salsa Verde Schools Me", "date": "Friday, November 8, 2019", "text": "The kids had off school due to elections, the sun was shining, and a real freeze was bearing down on us.  Clearly time to put the garden to bed.When we were done stripping the tomato jungle that afternoon, I had a heaping dishpan full of little green tomatoes as well as a basket of bell peppers and a handful of berries.   So I recalled a conversation with a market farmer back before life took a turn into crazy with sports; I was listing all the problems I had experienced with canning salsa and declaring that was IT, no more canned salsa, when she said simply that she'd never had a problem with tomatillo salsa, salsa verde.  Then she said she uses Marisa's recipe from Preserving by the Pint, which I already own and love. I use green tomatoes and tomatillos pretty much interchangeably - my research tells me they are cousins, and I know from experience they have a very similar flavor and texture.Now staring down the heap of green tomatoes in my kitchen, I plunged in.  First I recruited Ben to take my Visa (no cash, wanted the points, knew the standholders and guessed they'd be ok with it) and go back to market for me to get cilantro, garlic, onions, and poblanos. Then on the way to pick up Genevieve from a friend's house, I stopped at the Latino market and got 20 limes for $2. I know that canning recipes specify bottled lime juice for the acid predictability, but I couldn't bear to drive further to a grocery store and buy plastic packaging with my lime juice. Marisa's recipe did not have cilantro in it, and I do love cilantro in salsa verde, so I grabbed a recipe online from Montana Homesteader. Photos with  me in them taken by Ben - good job, buddy!I used a red poblano to make a batch of Marisa's salsa verde. Then I made the rest of the tomatoes into Montana's recipe with green poblanos, running the food processor like a crazy woman and getting Phoebe to pull some stems off tomatoes. I sent Ben to the basement for more wide-mouth pints; he came back with a measly one jar.  Certain he just wasn't looking, I sent Genevieve down (all the while pushing buttons and heating up leftover supper and watching the boiling water vat on the stove), and she came up totally empty-handed.  People, I used up all my wide-mouth pints! I thought I was over-supplied with jars! I finished up the canning with half-pints. The first canner-load had a jar bust in it, and I thought darkly of the salsa curse, but the rest of the jars sealed beautifully.And then I snapped back to reality: I had not measured the lime juice, nor had I used bottled lime juice, and I had canned it in a water-bath.  Botulism visions danced in my head! I was so angry at myself for not doing more research, for not measuring the lime juice. I can low-acid foods in my pressure canner to negate botulism!  Why oh why didn't I find a salsa verde recipe that was pressure canned?  I decided I had to freeze my beautiful salsa verde, treat it like fresh, not canned, food. But first, I talked to Rebecca, who listened to my woes and recriminations and seemed not all worried about it (\"Are you sure it's a low-acid salsa? Green tomatoes are tart!\"), but shrugged and said, why don't you pressure can it if you're worried?  The heavens opened and a light of reason shone on my head.  So I carefully broke the seal on all my salsa verde jars and pressure-canned their butts.Here are my take-away thoughts:find a salsa verde recipe before next fall  that uses cilantro and the pressure canner and not lots of lime juice to keep botulism fears away. Roast or grill the poblanos for a hit of smoky flavor."},
{"title": "Our Family Trip to Seattle and ONP", "date": "Friday, November 1, 2019", "text": "Back in June, we went on a family trip that we had been anticipating for a long time.  My husband and I had been saving money for years, funneling money into a savings account whenever we could, sometimes only $50 a month, sometimes nothing for a while. We wanted to take this trip before Genevieve started a job (that could happen very soon, friends! she just turned 14!) and after Phoebe was independent of diapers and naps and strollers and such. This summer was that perfect window.  Let's look at our trip through the thrift lens.We chose Olympic National Park just west of Seattle because it looked like \"Acadia of the west\" according to my husband, and last summer, we had a super-successful family trip to Acadia in Maine. Our family does well with a location that allows slowing down and deep playing and gets us out in nature, so we lean towards national and state parks for vacations right now.The kids adored flying on a big airplane to get to Seattle (my husband and I tried not to dwell on the environmental cost of the flying).  We booked our flights months ahead of time on Spirit Airlines - we only paid for two checked bags.  We did not pick our seats or take carry-ons.  Instead, we each had a personal item - a backpack filled with snacks and entertainment - and I chose all Air BnB houses in Washington that had washing machines so we could take limited clothing and shoes in our two checked bags. We flew out on a Tuesday, and home on a Wednesday, the cheapest days to fly, and the Wednesday happened to be July Fourth, so we got a free, beautiful fireworks show when our plane took off from Seattle at 10pm. It was perhaps not the smartest choice to fly a red-eye flight against the time change from West to East Coast, but we suffered through the first day back with coffee and early bedtimes, and then we were fine.Because my husband travels a lot for work, he had saved up his rental car points.  We were able to rent a car in Seattle for 10 days for a little over a hundred bucks. Before we rented the car, we got around Seattle by bus and by Uber, which thrilled the kids.We chose our activities in Seattle and Olympic National Park carefully, considering what really sounded fun and interesting to us. Some of the activities cost a lot of money, but that's what the savings were for!  We went on the Great Wheel of Seattle and on an under-the-streets walking tour; we explored the Klondike Gold Rush Museum (a national park - free!), and watched boats and migrating salmon at the Ballard Locks (also free!). We stayed with dear friends in Seattle, such a treat. We had to take a ferry to continue our drive to ONP and thoroughly enjoyed the wind, the wake, the novelty of the ferry from top to bottom. We loved the Forks Timber Museum and Makah Museum, but eschewed the (expensive) hot springs at Sol Duc for looking like a regular old swimming pool. We hiked and hiked and hiked - stopping to play in the water, pose in the trees, and just generally luxuriate in the crisp air and gorgeous sky and mountain views.I had done some brainstorming ahead of time for meals that I could easily source from any grocery store that would be nourishing, cheap, and relatively easy to make, especially with the unknown kitchens in the AirBnBs I had booked.This is what I did:Breakfast 1: eggs, toast with butter/honey, fried mushrooms or oranges, coffee, milkBreakfast 2: peanut butter/honey toast, bananas, coffee, milk(We rotated between these two breakfasts)Lunches: all eaten on the go from our backpacks around Seattle or ONP: bread, cheese, sardines (sometimes), pickles, granola bars, apples, seltzerDinner 1: jarred spaghetti sauce, spaghetti, steamed fresh broccoliDinner 2: grilled salmon with lemon, baked potatoes + butter, lettuce + croutons + olive oil & balsamicDinner 3: grilled kielbasa, pierogies sauteed with onion, (frozen) peasDinner 4: pasta + canned white beans + frozen spinach + garlic, roasted fresh cauliflowerDinner 5: grocery store fried chicken, mashed fresh potatoes, sauteed fresh (local!) spinach with lemon + butterWe did eat four meals out when it was otherwise not possible to cook (travel days) or there was a really cool local place we wanted to try, and we also had some ice cream snacks and espresso and such along the way.Fun with pipe-cleaners while we wait for food; the backpacks eased the tedium at other times, not just the flightsWe ate every last scrap except a half-jar of peanut butter before we boarded the plane, and the security people threw our peanut butter away because it was classified as a liquid and thus illegal to take on the plane. Peanut butter as a liquid!My plane buddy after the red-eye flight, 3:30am in our bodies when the plane landed.Overall, this trip was a huge success. We did not actually use all of our vacation savings, and we have immediately started building it up again.  I was worried that Phoebe was still too little to benefit much from the trip, but oh my goodness, if you ask her, she will still tell you about the Great Wheel over the ocean and about nurse logs in the Hoh Rainforest and when she rode in the canoe with Mommy and Daddy while Genevieve and Ben had a kayak.  She was perfectly behaved and occupied on the 6-hour flights (another worry of mine), and occasionally she and I stayed at the AirBnB in the afternoon so she could catch up on her naps and mama could, whew, do her introverted thing. Now that I've actually sorted through my photos, I'm going to make a photo book to go with the travel journal we kept - using a coupon for a free book, of course!"},

{"title": "What I Did Yesterday", "date": "Thursday, October 24, 2019", "text": "Friends! I was swept under the tide of big kids' activities this fall, and I dropped everything I could to keep my nose above the water.  For me, that meant keeping up with the laundry, good food, and bills/paperwork, and everything else had to wait. I'm eager to get back to you!  Last week, Phoebe and I picked out a custom blend of apples to make applesauce: Fuji, Grimes Golden, Gold Rush, and Smokehouse. Twenty bucks for two bushels of apples, a good price.  I really should have read my canning notebook more closely, though, because I would have met my applesauce goal with 1 1/2 bushels.  In the spring sometime, I take inventory of the preserved food in freezer and cupboard, and then I set some targets for the year's preserving.  So I stashed the apples in the basement until I could clear a day to make applesauce.  Phoebe was keen to help, hooray, so I planned for a day when she did not have preschool, but her help couldn't extend much beyond washing jars.  Hot apples in a food mill are too much for a four-year-old.  I made a grand total of 33 quarts of applesauce yesterday.  Oh, I was tired! I did not do laundry, go food shopping, or editing.  I stood in the kitchen and canned.  But the resulting applesauce, from those four kinds of apples, is so delicious: deeply rich apple flavor with no sugar needed, thanks to the sweet Fujis.  And now my canning goals for the year are all crossed off.  Putting some tomato-canning photos in here as well!Here's my list from this year, basically in chronological order: 7 half-pints strawberry freezer jam18 pints frozen blueberries13 pints frozen sour cherries25 pints frozen corn17 pints dilly beans3 quarts frozen green beans8 pints pickled red beets9 pints bread & butter pickles3 half-pints blueberry syrup5 half-pints pickle relish10 pints 7-day sweet pickles5 half-pints duck sauce2 quarts frozen grape pie filling3 quarts grape juice4 half-pints spiced grape butter21 pints pizza sauce14 quarts tomato soup28 quarts whole tomatoes7 half-pints pimentos3 half-pints peach jam33 quarts applesauceAnd I'm back on the laundry today, with a grocery shop planned as well."},

I love it!The bandanna fabric could be cutesy and kitschy; I sort of itched to pair it with rick rack or calico or even some crocheted lace.  But no: cute is not my look.  But still: I wanted just a little pizzazz somewhere.  Look closely at the yoke in the front:  I hand-sewed running stitches in black and white perle cotton around some of the circles and squares!  Subtle and happy. Also, inside the dress, I made the channel for the drawstring out of striped blue cotton and finished the hem in light blue bias tape.  I really need a little fizz somewhere in my clothes, a little patchwork effect if you will.I used this dress pattern seven years ago, the second dress I ever made for myself.  This time around, I did not widen the bodice, and I'm really pleased with the fit.  I wish I had made the red dress a touch longer.  Also, I have to say I no longer own that plaid sundress because the fabric turned out to be part polyester as plaids often can be, and I really cannot abide that wrapped-in-plastic feeling in the summer.Genevieve took these photos of me as I ripped the unholy mess of cucumbers out of my raised beds.  That was extremely satisfying."},
{"title": "The Summer of the Cucumbers", "date": "Friday, August 16, 2019", "text": "I have accidentally not blogged since June! Hello! How is your summer going now that it is ending? Mine was really nice and I have no reason for the lack of blogging except perhaps I was buried under a heap of cucumbers?My family loves kosher dills/fermented cukes/sour pickles so much, and I had a hard time finding good pickling cukes, so I decided to use my raised bed space for cucumbers instead of green beans this year. I have tried cucumbers maybe once or twice before and got basically nothing: the vines wilted or the leaves got powdery or something ate everything.Well. I planted the whole packet of Parisian Pickling Cucumbers, timing them to be ready once we got home from our big Seattle trip (there's a post!) and figuring that I'd only get a handful anyway if I was lucky.  Well no.  Turns out, this is The Summer When All the Cucumbers Grow.  All my friends who planted cucumbers are overflowing and pickling and laughing in disbelief.As a cucumber novice, I am not very good at getting the buggers at the little pickling size I wanted. Overnight, they grew six inches into logs!  Which were bitter and seedy and tossed on the compost pile.I made gallons and gallons of fermented cukes (method below).  I also made two batches of bread and butter pickles from the Mennonite Community Cookbook, as well as 7-Day-Sweets, a childhood favorite that involved pouring boiling water over the cukes several days in a row to make them crisp.  Why does this work?  I don't know, but it does.I made pickle relish, fridge pickles, and salad after salad.  Because I planted so many plants close together and did not water them regularly, but regularly let some of them get too big, I had to deal with bitter cucumbers.  I tried cutting off the stem end and then rubbing it on the cut end until a bitter white foam came out.  I tried salting sliced cukes and then rinsing them.  My best success was slicing cukes and soaking them in salted ice water for about an hour, then draining and rinsing.Last week, the cucumber plants finally showed signs of slowing down, so I yanked them out.  I still have over 1 1/2 gallons of fermented dills in the fridge, plus fridge pickles, and a crisper drawer full of cucumbers.  On my to-do list:  \"decide what to do with cukes.\"  I guess we will eat pickles for every meal this winter?Did you plant cucumbers this year and get a roaring crop? Or is something else bursting from your garden?Fermented Dill PicklesIn a half gallon glass jar, combine:1 Tbsp. fine sea salt (not iodized)1 quart room temperature non-chlorinated water1 Tbsp. dill seeds1 tsp. dill weed1-2 garlic cloves, slicedStir and/or set aside until salt is dissolved.Wash and trim ends from small pickling cucumbers - I usually kept them under 4\" and a thumb-size diameter. Drop them into the brine, shaking and pushing to fill up the jar but making sure they can all be submerged. May need to add a little more water and salt.   Keep the pickles submerged under brine by filling a smaller jar with water and capping it and setting it in the jar on top of the pickles.Set jar in room temperature for 48 hours.  Should see foam and bubbling action.  Scrape off the foam before capping and storing in fridge. Keeps indefinitely in fridge. Sometimes I use a cup or so of the brine in a new jar of fermented dills. If you have fresh dill, use 2 heads or so in place of the dried stuff."},

I have a lot of pretty bias tape, and I've been using it on purpose recently I guess so I can feel free to find more at the thrift store. That's a weird little mind trap!I did a sewing-for-massage trade with a friend (so wonderful!).  The piece she asked me to resize was from Nepal and when the scraps where tumbled on my floor, I suddenly saw a bag to make.  The solid colors are so great and strong together, and that pretty ruffle is just right.  I actually used the scraps entirely to make this bag.  Satisfying.The last bag ushers in a new era: an e-reader.  Oh my.  I do adore books, but I could not picture fitting enough books in my luggage and carry-on to keep me happy for an upcoming trip.  Obviously an e-reader is the way to take 40 books along, most for me but a few for my husband and kids just in case.  I only bought two with a coupon that came with the e-reader.  The rest are free downloads, mostly old books whose copyright has expired and have been digitized for such a time as this. Here is the helpful article that led me to books I wanted to read.The e-reader seems sturdy enough, but I still feel pretty protective towards any screens I have purchased (and let me tell you, it has been a new phone and a new iPad recently, too, and I am sick of it). So I made a little padded bag - sturdy upholstery fabric on the outside, batting scraps in the middle, and lined with a flannel shirt scrap from my husband - with the pocket positioned to hold the charger.  I'm very pleased with it."},

{"title": "The Results", "date": "Friday, May 24, 2019", "text": "We got back our test results for our backyard soil, and it is contaminated with lead. This has been keeping me up at night, stirred into the dire climate/environmental situation, worried about my family's health and the future. In all the years we have gotten extra blood tests for our children, they have never had elevated lead levels.  So I'm thankful for that.  But I'm so sad about our soil!  Now that the black walnut tree is gone, I have sun and so much growth in the mint and the berries.  I am going to do a more focused soil test, to see if the beds are all contaminated, or just the area by the house which is typical of old houses with their former lead paint. I still have my raised beds with their clean soil that we brought in, so I'm growing edibles there; I may need to rip out my berry bushes and mint - I'm assuming that once a plant has been grown in lead-tainted soil, it doesn't help to transplant to clean soil. New this year, I colonized a ledge with two big planters filled with nasturtium seeds.  Little babies are coming up! I will never get over that excitement. I had wanted to plant grapes to climb up our side porch posts, but given our lead situation, I planted a clematis instead.  Perhaps I will become a flower gardener and rely on the excellent farmer's market 2 blocks away for my local produce.  Perhaps that is my silver lining - that I can plant all the flowers, instead of prioritizing for edibles. Poppies! Peonies! A lilac bush!We planted our little oak tree, free from a city grant program.  It's barely taller than the irises, and I'm trying to be all mature about \"planting for future generations\" when I just want it to hurry up and give us some sheltering shade. Our street tree, a zelkova, is growing tremendously.  I planted some red creeping thyme as a groundcover in the tree well, and now I'm going to add some fencing because I think the neighborhood dogs are peeing in a corner and killing my thyme. I feel better for having written this all down.  This helps me have some perspective and cling to the good parts of this story and my life, instead of focusing on the bad and chewing on it to feed despair.  Today is a beautiful, breezy spring day, and I'm going to go out and sow some cilantro seeds in my  raised beds.  Onward!"},

It pleases me that there's no pectin involved other than what's in the lemon seeds (tied up in cheesecloth when the jam boils) and pith - and the viscous nature of cooked rhubarb. A lovely slice of toast on a chilly spring day with a cup of hot chocolate and a fascinating book to edit."},

Let's remember the first few moments of your life, your wondering eyes and calm.  Let's see again the sweetness of your brother and sister meeting you for the first time.We need this joy to counterbalance, to season, the pain of other dear ones who are sick and dying.  And I do believe there is joy for them on the other side of death, but for us who stay here? Oh, that is hard. Phoebe asked me the other day: \"when is Uncle Ron going to come back to life?\"  Getting Jesus and Easter and our loved ones all stirred in together.Joy and pain.  The contrast that makes the patchwork of life. Let's look now at the Phoebe's birthday cupcakes - made and decorated by Genevieve, shared with preschool friends and then later with grandparents.  I don't have a good photo of the layer cake I made for Phoebe - it's from Smitten Kitchen Every Day and I highly recommend it.  Easy to make and one of the best-tasting cakes I've had in a long time.

It's just a little overwhelming. I signed up to get a red oak tree for our backyard, but I don't exactly know where and how I will plant it.We are finally getting our soil tested after eating food from it for years - city soil can be laced with heavy metals, oh dear. But I have a serious vision of a grape arbor, so I'm checking the mail every day for our test results. My raspberries, both black and red, are growing by leaps and bounds; I pruned off old canes (I think) and got some nasty old thorns stuck in my skin.  I have started wearing my gardening gloves more faithfully.Some days, I can only manage to grab at a weed as I take a break from writing and editing projects, or hang up and take down the endless laundry that my people require. We bought a badminton set, which the children love, and which caused my neighbor to look wistfully at their leaping and shrieking and tell me about her spring badminton matches with her four older siblings.All of this eases my heart a little: my dear uncle died on Palm Sunday morning. He was full of juice and fun and nothing about spring or any season, actually, was wasted on him.  He paid attention, and he made everything into an adventure.  I cannot really believe that I will never see that adventurous gleam in his eyes on this earth again.  So my heart is a little broken, but I have vowed to Uncle Ron, wherever he is with God, that I will take inspiration from his approach to life.  See? Spring is so lush and vigorous, and I am looking."},
{"title": "My Children Match!", "date": "Tuesday, April 16, 2019", "text": "I can explain how this happened, but not the why.  Really do not understand the deep desire to dress my three children alike.  What is this? An orphanage with uniforms? A type of branding? What?  I cannot tell you, but my delight in these outfits (and these children) is real and true.I asked Genevieve if she wanted me to make her a spring dress - she is definitely working on figuring out her style, so I deferred to her in pattern and fabric choice when she said yes.  Well, there was so much of the splashy daisies fabric hat I wondered if she'd like me to make Phoebe a dress and be twinsies.  Why yes, she thought that would be fun! Giddy, I then told Ben I should make him a splashy daisy bow tie but he said what about a shirt.  Well. Holy cow!  You see? I was in deep.Genevieve resisted all the cutesy features on her dress pattern and kept it simple.  We had to have a number of fittings because the pattern was too big.  The plan was for her to wear her cute turquoise flats with the dress, but as I was hunched over the sewing machine, she outgrew the darn shoes.  Such is the way with kids at this age!I played around with trims on Phoebe's dress, and I love how it turned out.  The white bias tape on the ruffles really punches them up.  I was thrilled with the lace placement I came up with on the bodice, a kind of Lilly Pulitzer look that I am itching to do again.  It didn't require a ton of lace and is much more effective than just a neck trim. As you can see, I ran out of splashy daisies for Ben's shirt.  He's so big! So I mixed in some navy gingham like it was on purpose. I thought he would wear this shirt with dark jeans, but he chose the shorts and Converse. His style veers towards flamboyant (hello, bow ties), so this shirt suits him well. I'm a little surprised I managed to churn out these clothes this spring! I can easily justify zoning out to Netflix and knitting every night, but I've been redirecting my waning energy to the sewing machine recently. Sometimes I do just go to bed when I'm too tired for anything but staring.  My daytime brain is for my freelance gigs. It was fun to pull off this splashy daisy project!"},
{"title": "New Cookbook Review: The Food in Jars Kitchen", "date": "Thursday, April 4, 2019", "text": "The Food in Jars Kitchen is a cookbook after my own heart: it uses little bits of food in clever, flexible ways and gives the home-canned pantry lots of work to do.  I've been keeping track over the years of what my family eats, so I've cut back on making jam because we don't go through much toast and jam.  Marisa is evangelical about people like me in her Introduction - there's so much more to do with jam than toast! She is giving me an \"empty-jar-to-empty jar education.\"When my copy came in the mail, I put my nose in it and my pencil to paper as I jotted down all the recipes I could make right away.  There are so many! I did make three before I wrote this post, and I will make all of them again.Also, please note: I received this book free as a review copy, but my opinions and my decision to write a review are my own.First, I made Popunders.  Isn't that the most adorable name? I made them one morning at breakfast time and while we did, indeed, spoon a little jam in their little hollows, I could also see a dab of cheese or pesto or a bit of anything that I would put on bread.  Popunders are super-fast to whip up, sugar-free, made with pantry staples and standard muffin pans, and just need 20 minutes in the oven, no-preheating needed. Even though Marisa recommends them hot from the oven, we found they made a perfectly fine snack at room temperature a few hours later.For a family gathering, I made the Concord Grape Butter Pizza with Camembert.  Oh! that was delicious! When I make and can grape juice in the fall, I use the spent skins to make grape butter, so I've got plenty of grape butter on hand.I followed Marisa's pizza crust recipe instead of using my standard favorite, and it was the perfect thickness and texture for its toppings as well as easy to make and handle.  Marisa also explains the ratio of sweet spread to cheese to green topping which is helpful to cooks who want to go off-recipe.  I used Brie instead of Camembert and chopped arugula instead of baby arugula.  So, so, so delicious. I will definitely be making this for future neighborhood potlucks.Yesterday, I made Marisa's Jam-Lacquered Chicken Wings for supper (excellent name!). I buy whole chickens and when I cut them up to cook, I've been collecting the wings separately in the freezer.  I've never made wings before, just threw them into stock, but I was determined to try since Ben has requested wings several times. Marisa's recipe was very clear and produced excellent results.  I didn't know meat can literally cook under the broiler - I typically just use the broiler to brown something.  But the wings cooked under the broiler exactly as Marisa indicated.  To paint the wings, I finished up jars of fig jam and grape butter and added some tomato jam as well as enough runny pepper jam (from 2013! it was waiting for its destiny) to give them a nice kick.Next time, I will salt the wings on both sides and also broil them on both sides to increase the caramelization.  I find it annoying to get my fingers so messy for such a little bit of  (ok, delicious) meat, but my family was loving these wings, so ok, I do love seeing my people enjoy their food. Too bad my fingers were too sticky to operate my camera!There is really a lot more to love in this cookbook.  I'm going to use my onion jam in a Goat Cheese Savory Jam Tart, and I'm going to consider all the options for a jar of apple butter that I don't think we will spread on toast.  I appreciate Marisa's inclusion of some basic canning recipes in the final section because I have a deep yearning for Orange Marmalade Ice Cream and no marmalade in my pantry. I have two small quibbles with the book, both of which are typical of me and typical of most cookbooks being published (and probably not Marisa's decisions, either).  I prefer spiral bound cookbooks for kitchen use because it's tricky to get a stiff hardcover book to stay open while I cook. But good job keeping the recipes mostly on the same spread! It's also very tricky to turn pages between ingredient list and instructions while cooking.   I also prefer a very detailed index that includes major ingredients as entries so that I can look up recipes based on the ingredients they use, not just the recipe name or type.I highly recommend the Food in Jars Kitchen cookbook.  It's beautiful to look at and full of recipes for daily cooking - from quick-the-kids-need-a-snack to the fancy-food potluck happening on the weekend."},
{"title": "A Shirt Dress with Swiss Buttons and a Favorite Color", "date": "Tuesday, April 2, 2019", "text": "Many years ago, in our first year of marriage, my husband and I went on vacation in Switzerland, where everything really does look like the postcards.  At the time, I did not have a sewing machine or knitting needles or anything like that (I also did not have children or a teaching job or a house, just to orient you to how much of a baby I was).Nevertheless, in Neuchǎtel, Switzerland, we went shopping in the market square, and I was drawn into a Bernina store. I bought bright buttons like someone buying candy.  All these years, they have been in their little paper Bernina bag in my button collection, where I take them out occasionally and finger them happily. In the meantime, I became the proud owner of a Bernina sewing machine and started to sew and make things in earnest.As I do, I began to hunt through my fabric this fall in search of a dress. I settled on this plaid from a thrift store as a classic shirt dress.  And then, the Swiss buttons made perfect sense: a whimsical olive color, but not Too Much Drama with the plaid.  Oh, it made me so happy to use them after all these years!  I had just enough buttons for the front placket, so I used two pretty brown tulip buttons on the cuffs.I made two additions to the dress that were not included with the pattern. I added side pockets to the dress - one of the perks of making clothes for myself!Photos of me in this post courtesy of my husbandAlso, I lined the skirt of the dress to make it even easier to pop on instead of hunting for a slip to keep the dress from sticking to my tights. My husband says these tights do not match the dress, but piffle: they go with the dress. Actually, lots of colors go with this dress, and I have the cardigans to prove it.Gradually, it dawned on me that perhaps gold is also a favorite color of mine?  Look at the golden yellow trim on my house - I chose it.  Look at the turmeric benches at my church - I chose their color, too. I have mustard-colored pants, a yellow wallet, yellow sandals, on and on: obviously I have been choosing gold for years while saying blue is my favorite color.  Oh, I crack myself up.Are you having a color crush currently? I might be having a tiny crush on purple, but no acquisitions to prove it."},

Together, the coins add up to thousands of dollars that MCC sends to peace programs and relief projects around the world. That these little coins can add up to make big sums and impact lives is energizing to me and fits with one of my life philosophies:  small things have value and make a difference, too! This year, instead of taking my coins to church in an old ziploc baggie (hello, ugly), I got out my scraps and a chunky zipper and made a coin purse.  The red scrap is from Ruth, the lining is left from this dress, and the itsy-bitsy scraps at the ends of the zipper are from this skirt. Very satisfying. Anytime I pay with cash, I deliberately squirrel away the change in my coin purse and carry it to church on Sunday.  It strikes me now that this is my Lenten discipline and focus this year!  The beauty and purpose of small things. . .excerpts from the song My Coins Count by Les Gustafson-ZookMy coins count, my coins count.Sitting in my pocket when they could be doing good.My coins count, my coins count.We can make a difference in the world.The gifts we are given we are given to be sharedall around the world.Doesn't matter if they're big or small when used with careWe can make a difference in the worldbecauseMy coins count, my coins count. . ."},

Then you have to time the whole shebang to be done at the same time, preferably the time your people are expecting to eat.  Wow! That's a lot of skills!So obviously, this is a big step for kids to produce a meal.  Over the years, however, I've taught them some individual recipes and they've made one-off desserts.  Also, since I stopped making breakfast for everyone, Ben and Genevieve have gotten more experience with what it takes to prepare a meal if they feel like eating something other than cereal. Ben and Genevieve take turns cooking dinner on Saturday evenings.  Early in the week, I discuss the menu with them and help them make a plan.  I shop for any ingredients they need.On Saturday, I leave the kitchen in the late afternoon and park myself somewhere in the house with a project that can be interrupted.  They come and consult with me if they need to (usually do), and I don't have to sit on my hands and bite my tongue watching them cook. They do fine! They do things differently from me! It's mean to expect them to be tidy and efficient when they're beginners!Some of Ben's menus:  vegetarian chili, cornbread, and picklesSingapore street noodles (with Dad's help)dhal, rice, greens in peanut sauceSome of Genevieve's menus: chicken corn noodle soup, pimento cheese + crackers, cranberry applesaucetaco saladwaffles, creamed spinach, pickles, and waffles with ice cream and magic shellBen says he likes seeing us eat the food he made.  Genevieve says she likes being able to choose the menu.  It's really nice for me to get a break from cooking supper, and it's wonderful for them to be acquiring life skills.

{"title": "I Sliced Up My Blue Boho Shirt", "date": "Saturday, March 2, 2019", "text": "I thought I could make myself a popover shirt that would work as part of my winter uniform: jeans, cardi, shirt.  I used this 1970s pattern again, and this time I decided to insert some lace.  I was afraid I had made a cowgirl shirt, but Rebecca called it boho and talked me into wearing it (good job, R!).  I do adore the blue fabric, which I got for pennies somewhere. I had just enough for this shirtBut here is the slicing part:  as I was sewing the shirt, I accidentally made a 1\" cut on the front hem.  I was squeezing this shirt out of very little yardage, so I couldn't re-cut the front.  Instead, I \"mended\" the cut with a little piece of flowered bias tape because I've seen some trendy labels put their tags on shirts that way.  Most of the time, the hem is tucked in my jeans anyway. I used that same pretty bias tape to make the casing for the elastic in the sleeves.  I opted for elastic to make the shirt more user-friendly in the kitchen with my hands in dough or water or whatnot; plus, it's easier to get dressed without buttoning cuffs. But unfortunately, even though I had measured carefully for my long arms, the sleeve elastic had pulled the sleeves back behind my wrists. I hate sleeves that are too short!  Instead of tediously picking out the elastic and casing and adding length there, I sliced the sleeves and inserted a few inches.  Uncoventional, but really not very visible, and now I truly have just a few inches of blue fabric left.  And the shirt is so comfortable and hard-working that I wear it often."},

{"title": "Hearts and Sloths", "date": "Thursday, February 14, 2019", "text": "Of course, Phoebe's preschool is going to do valentines.  Phoebe and I took some time one day to make valentines, and I used what I had on hand: construction paper, lace and rick rack, and a red stamp pad (borrowed from Genevieve - she has a serious craft stash!). I first tried hot-gluing the trims to the hearts, but it was tedious and fraught with glue-strings. So I put an old needle in my sewing machine and sewed those babies up. I used Phoebe's thumb in the red stamp pad to make little hearts on each paper heart. To be frank, that part didn't go well, and I should have stayed with my policy of letting my kids design and execute their own little projects.  But Phoebe does love the resulting valentines, and even put her own \"P\" on each one.  But in general, Phoebe is confused about what exactly is happening with these valentines.  We'll see how it goes at preschool today and what she comes home with!In keeping with tradition, I made a little valentines' carrying bag for Phoebe (Ben's bag, Genevieve's bag). Luckily we had a plain yellow bag in the bag cupboard, and I just picked through my piece bag to make some fun hearts.I also made Phoebe these mittens recently, and they are a scream. Phoebe and I had a serious artistic discussion among the bolts of fleece at Joann's Fabric.  I told Phoebe she could pick a fleece that wasn't too light and would go with her red winter coat.  She studied the bolts, we pulled out a number, rejected the ones that wouldn't work, and ended up with this mint-colored fleece. I love seeing my kids develop their personal taste!  The lady at the cutting counter admired the sloths and Phoebe looked at her reprovingly, \"they're kitties!\"I used the Purl SoHo pattern, although I sort of free-handed a child-size paper pattern.  I made a test mitten and had to adjust the dimensions. However, even when the sloth mittens were made, they needed some tweaking.  Phoebe said her hands were still cold, so I made a second pair of mittens and inserted them inside to make lined mittens.  Also, the mittens were literally falling off Phoebe's hands, so I put some elastic at the wrist to help them stay on. Now, finally, the mittens do what they're supposed to do.  And they make me laugh every time!Happy Valentine's Day to you all, in whatever way you celebrate or not."},

Perfect for winter when we must make our colors while the natural world sleeps in grey, white, and brown.I made a new batch of handtowels and aprons (Simplicity 1221) for a shop that promotes young Mennonite makers (I am still young, see). I am particularly proud of that little zing of yellow rick rack with the calico and gingham. Also, I love yellow and pink together, particularly these strong shades.  I didn't have enough for the belt, so I pieced together the feedsack calico.I love mixing fabric so much that I like to piece even the toppers for handtowels. Also, I have not forgotten that I owe my readers a handtowel tutorial. Also, I made a beautiful cake for Christmas day; well, it's presented as two rectangular cakes.  It's the petit fours cake from Smitten Kitchen Every Day: Triumphant Unfussy Favorites. There was some difficulty and swearing involved as is normal for fancy cakes, but oh my word, this cake was beautiful in every respect.  Those are almond paste holly leaves and berries that I colored and formed with my own stained fingers.  On top of ganache, which covers a triple layer of delicious almond cake sandwiched with raspberry jam. So, so delicious.Hope your winter day has some brightness in it!  Around here, it's terribly cold and I just found out that school is canceled.  This is frustrating to a person like me who makes it a priority to get proper clothing for my family so they can get fresh air in any weather.

You can do this in a slow cooker, too.  Two of the beets went into the sauce.  Then I also took two beets and two wrinkly apples and chopped them up, adding a little mayo and some toasted walnuts:  beet and apple salad from the More With Less.  Perfect next to shepherd's pie and broccoli.The remaining beets will probably be used as vegetables in a green salad, although it's easy to dress cooked beets with a vinaigrette, sprinkle with feta or blue cheese, maybe some walnuts, and serve on a bed of greens.Beet Sauce2 medium beets, cooked and peeled, roughly choppedAdd to blender with:1/2 cup orange juice2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice1 Tbsp. cider vinegar2 tsp. honey1/2 tsp saltseveral grinds black pepperPuree.  Taste.  Add a little something if needed (I can assure you, I am not getting out teaspoons and tablespoons for this!

{"title": "Turmeric Benches in the Prayer Room", "date": "Thursday, January 17, 2019", "text": "I was asked to make the prayer room function better at our church.  I would call it an anteroom, in the style of old Mennonite meetinghouses:  a little room back of the pulpit used for various small purposes. In this case, it's the site of the pre-service meeting, as well as part of the library and some service supplies like candles and baskets and drums. See? Various small purposes. It was cluttered with chairs and an overhead projector, as well as some things on the shelves that no one noticed because, as is the way of many spaces, everyone assumed someone else was the homemaker or caretaker. Unfortunately, I don't have a \"before\" photo.To open up the space and allow for maximum flexible seating, I took out the clutter of chairs and put in three backless benches.  I made some cushions for people that objected to hard benches. I straightened the shelves and re-homed some lost items.All of this cost about $70 in materials when (I think I recall) my budget was $300.  The benches were in a fascinating graveyard of church history up on a third floor. A fellow property commission member resized the one bench for me.  I spread out a dropcloth in a Sunday school room and painted the benches (with trepidation for the carpet) over a week in Benjamin Moore's turmeric. I had to do it Monday to Saturday - luckily we live close to our church and luckily Phoebe could amuse herself by climbing over and under pews.  At first, the yellow looked dreadfully brassy and brazen and I had to force myself to finish.  But when the benches were dry and placed in the prayer room, I was so relieved to see them warm and brighten the space, just like my vision.For the cushion covers, I used pre-cut patches that were given to me a few years ago and backed them with red corduroy left from Phoebe's dress. The colors play together in such interesting ways - a little Amish here, a little somber there, a little clashing over there. A little brightness wherever a cushion roves in the room.I also hung a wooden plaque in the prayer room with a quote by Menno Simons: \"True evangelical faith cannot lile dormant. It clothes the naked, feeds the hungry, comforts the sorrowful, shelters the destitute, serves those that harm it, binds up that which is wounded; it has become all things to all people.\"And we're all very happy with our little prayer room in its freshness."},

I started the first block in November 2016, and finished the quilt top in time to take it with me on our family trip to Maine in June to start the handquilting.I had not planned to do a border, but I couldn't resist the urge to play, so I thought of having the trip-around-the-world break into a blue border in spots.  But I also used some large patches in the border of the prints used in the blocks because I adore scrappiness.  In this case, I think the effect is too chaotic and would have worked better with a blue border punctuated just by a few scrappy trip blocks.I pieced the back of the quilt because scrappiness is my jam.As for the quilting, I thought I would knot the orange streaks with orange wool and felt them into little balls.  But after doing all the handquilting on the rest of the patches, I changed my mind.  The orange did not need any more highlighting, the quilt did not need any more lively texture. I did some machine quilting in the solid border as I love to do by way of framing the quilt.  The handquilting is all in blue-grey perle cotton: I like the stitches to show up more than just create texture.Overall, I am pleased with this quilt.  It's a bit short on the sides for our standard queen bed, so I will remember not to trust the packaged batting's measurements next time but do my own measuring.The back of the quilt is the restful, soothing side with the wonderful stitching pattern, so I expect to show either side of the quilt depending on my mood.I'm on to Phoebe's quilt already! I do love to have a big project humming along in the background."},

The corduroy and the patterns are pass-ons from Mrs. R when she moved to a retirement home, so this is a really thrifty dress."},

{"title": "An Ode to Homegrown Green Beans", "date": "Monday, September 10, 2018", "text": "Ah, green beans, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways.1.  Easy to grow.  I grow Blue Lake beans, bush variety, and after you soak the seeds and plant them according to the spacing directions on the package, that's it!  No staking, no pruning, no other support needed.  They just grow.2.  And they grow fast and furious! The seedlings come up quickly, the plants produce and produce and produce as long as I keep picking.  I thank my plants as I pluck off their beans and tell them they can keep making more (if the neighbors are outside, I do this silently; I'm not totally crazy).3. Their flavor - unlike the flavorless strings at the store or even from some farmers enamored with uniform shape and color - homegrown green beans are buttery, hefty, \"beany beans\" as my mom calls them.  4. Green beans are so versatile!  Steam them and then put a little sheen of brown butter on them for a sidedish that goes with anything.  Put a hot bacon dressing on them for main-dish beans. Pickle them (they don't go mushy, like canned cucumber pickles tend to). Treat them with curry flavors.  Treat them with Italian flavors and Parmesan. Blanch them and freeze them for later. 5.  Because of their versatility and abundance, I got to experience the joy of giving my own garden produce away! That was a rush to this small city gardener.  I actually pickled enough, froze enough, and ate enough to joyfully give away several bags of green beans.I planted a packet of Blue Lake beans and thanks to the increased sun in our yard this summer, plus the abundant heat and rain, they did amazingly well. In fact, our garden is rather jungle-like with tomato vines sprawling on top of the beans and herbs.  Herbs also do pretty well for me, but if I don't have the bandwidth to start them from seed, they are more pricey.  How did your garden grow this summer?"},
{"title": "Now I Jog", "date": "Thursday, September 6, 2018", "text": "I have always hated, loathed, and despised running.  When we had to run a mile in gym class, I thought I was dying.  I would be near the end of the pack, and I walked every chance I got.  My gym teacher yelled her theory that my long legs were made for running, but no, I am a lumbering-gait kind of tall person, that's all.  Some of my friends ran cross-country. Some of my friends run marathons.  Who runs for fun? It's painful to run!  Why invite pain? I confess I kept this mindset until June of this year (sorry, runner-friends! so sorry).I have three reasons why I started jogging in June (I like to call it bouncing, based on this very inspiring article).First of all, I am middle-aged (I'd have to do some math to tell you exactly), which means my metabolism has slowed down.  And it was showing.  Hoo boy, I was getting pudgy.  I basically like my clothes, and I didn't want to get new clothes. Jogging has trimmed off some fluff and my clothes fit better now.Secondly, since having babies, I also have bouts of clinical depression that I manage with self-care (partly chocolate, duh) and antidepressants. I get a little mental-health high from running.  I don't know if it's the same \"runner's high\" that real runners talk about, but it works to reset my brain, wipe out anxious thoughts, and bring me happily back to my reality.  I'm a much nicer person after a run.Thirdly, jogging is so efficient, and I do love efficiency.  I can have my heart pounding and the sweat dripping within minutes - much faster than walking or biking, my other reliable forms of exercise. I don't really know how far I'm jogging, but I usually am gone from home about 30 minutes. Then I stretch a little, shower, and drink some extra water, all pleased with myself.Some jogging bonuses: it's easy to do anywhere with no equipment. I love the wide-open space and big trees in the cemetery where I jog. I get to connect with more friends over jogging.  Sometimes my sister or Genevieve jogs with me, and once I took Phoebe in the jogging stroller.While I jog, I admire the names on the tombstones going by and find my place, humbly, in the whole gamut of humanity.  I sometimes say the name of a pressing problem over and over again to the sky and that seems to take care of that problem. I sometimes throw little one-sentence prayers at God.  I give myself kind and hopeful messages: my clothes fit nicely now! I love how my strong legs look as they pound down the path! I am doing this for my mood! For my children! For my sweetheart!At this point, I aim to jog twice a week and do a Pilates DVD at home twice a week.  All free and relatively quick. I've noticed that I have fewer aches and pains, that I can bend down and stand up more easily (no joke as you enter middle age!). I sleep better on the days that I jog.  I may have more energy, but since I've also taken up a second cup of coffee in the afternoon, it's hard to tell.I've tweaked my diet just a little bit, too.  I really try to be in tune with my hunger because sometimes I get confused by stress, boredom, or thirst. I only eat to being \"not hungry\" instead of \"full.\" I'm often surprised by how small a portion I actually need, so I try not to mindlessly dish out a portion I would have eaten in my freewheeling thirties, in my nursing days, back before my metabolism shifted. I do not eat anything at all after supper, nothing until breakfast. I haven't cut out desserts, but I have reduced  portions and frequency.I tell you all this to inspire you.  That you can be trim, healthy, and happy without a lot of money and time.  This is, after all, a blog about thrift.  I bought one pair of running shorts and I need to buy a new pair of sneakers soon. I haven't paid gym or class fees, or set up a home gym; if that's your thing, I'm glad it works for you.Are you a jogger (or a bouncer, haha)?  Discuss. I'd also take recommendations for Pilates youtube videos that are less than 20 minutes."},

But I now highly recommend that you make some cheese toast and spread some apple butter on top - it's been my breakfast for a few mornings running.This was the Sunday dinner where I had made a pie, a French fruit tart with blueberries and blackberries.

All the plates, plasticware, and water bottles were thrown away as trash, of course (which drives me crazy - our city has an excellent, comprehensive recycling program and has made recycling mandatory!! but enforcement and education lag behind, of course).However, this dad inspired me to think about how I could replace the plastic trash with reusables when I go out. I have napkin rolls that already make potlucks and picnics easy - I'm going to start carrying them more places.  I've seen Zoe (on Instagram) take her own containers along to restaurants for any food leftovers.  And I have stopped using plastic straws (more education at this website). I made this little roll-up of metal straws to keep in my purse.  I bought the set of straws at a local store, and the handy cleaning brush came with them.  I got this set up before a big vacation to Maine (another post for another day!), but I am planning to be straw-free at home, too. The other day, Genevieve wanted to make a little project with plastic straws, and I had none whatsoever in the house.  But when I went for a little jog around our neighborhood, I found no less than 4 straws among the rest of the litter and brought them home to sterilize for her to use.The thought of all those dumb plastic straws out there as litter is maddening. I'm going to try to do my part, and I might even turn into one of those people who decline the straw and then furthermore try to educate the person offering the straw. Might."},

The haircut lasted 15 minutes - Ben was almost disappointed it wasn't longer, but I was so pleased with the results and he was ultimately pleased to have extra screen time.  Bribery is probably not a great parenting tool, but it gets great results.  It's also how I'm getting ponytails on Phoebe these days.Ben felt so fine and sharp after his shower to wash off the hair that he put on his favorite shirt for supper.  Someone in the house dressed for dinner!  How I love that boy."},

She was fascinated by \"the number on my cake.\" She actually tried to eat it in the happy chaos after she blew it out and I was cutting the cake. And now one of her conversation starters is \"the number on my cake\" and \"it's wax, and we don't eat wax.\" I'm glad we waited until she could fully participate and appreciate her birthday.

This is Phoebe's new little sandbox that her daddy made her for her birthday.  She turned three while she was sick, and we had to postpone her birthday party twice, but we gave her the sandbox on her birthday.  And it brought a smile to her sick little face and she dabbled in it.  Tomorrow, finally, is the birthday party!"},

So I'm really enjoying these photos of her working hard in her little anchor shirt."},

Ruth told me that when people had a scrap they didn't know what to do with, they said, \"give it to Laura!\"  Some of it was from Laura's mother, even. Laura's things were sorted through when her son took over the farmhouse, and some of the relatives wanted to throw the scraps away, but Ruth, Laura's daughter, saved the boxes. Laura considered this fabric like money in the bank, a valuable resource for making things. Ruth kept the boxes for years and now gave them to me because she looked at my work and thought I could appreciate the beauty and utility of vintage scraps.  I am so honored."},
{"title": "Breakfast Mushrooms", "date": "Friday, April 13, 2018", "text": "My family and I have parted ways over breakfast, and it's great! I had been still making breakfast for everyone every morning, a default mode left from the days when the big kids were too little to make their own.  They had started to grumble because different morning temperaments have different breakfast requirements, can I get an amen? It was one of these situations that happens often with growing kids where I forgot to step back and reevaluate the routine, and once I did, it seemed so obvious that we needed some tweaks! I still set Phoebe up with breakfast, but first and foremost, I please myself at breakfast time and provision everybody else.Sometimes they want ideas, or I coax them to eat a perishable that needs to be used; sometimes I even make muffins or something and then they eat them . . . or not (I make sure the leftovers can be frozen so that food is not being wasted). The big kids and my husband really appreciate making their own choices, and I appreciate the break.I'm on a savory breakfast kick, so I'm often making mushrooms. Simple, delicious mushrooms that make me feel like a hobbit at home eating breakfast (certainly not out on the lonesome, dangerous trail to destroy the ring - oh no, but at home in Bag End with the sun shining and the kettle humming).  I chop a number of creminis, usually more than I think because they shrink as they fry, then I fry them in a little bacon grease over medium heat.  The trick to frying mushrooms is not to stir them too much at the beginning, but let them release their water and start to brown. I sprinkle them with some dried thyme, fresh pepper, and truffle salt.  I keep a small jar of truffle salt to really amplify mushroom flavor when mushrooms star in a recipe. When the mushrooms look nicely browned and the kitchen smells like a hobbit-hole, I turn the heat down to low and splash in a tablespoon or two of heavy cream as I stir.  The cream will sizzle and then disappear as it clings to the mushrooms. If you want creamed mushrooms, then sprinkle the mushrooms with a bit of flour before you add the cream, and add more cream to make a sauce that will thicken as you stir.  So so so so so good.  How do you do breakfast at your house?"},

Too small and thus sliding up?  It's a mystery to me.  There's stretch in the yarn, stretch in the stitches, and I'm baffled.  So I switched to a different pattern.The Nola Cloche has a dramatic twist that appealed to me.  I struggled with understanding the twist (done like a cable), and got help from Christy and the hat designer herself.  Finally, I got the cloche done and the band was too loose for me while the top was too shallow!  But the hat itself was fine, so I chucked it over to the thrift store and started again.  This time, the hat fits perfectly, but I messed up my decreases at the top so it's a little lumpy.  I swan.  I might have to do it again, but not until next winter.I taught my sister to knit back in December because she wanted to knit her boyfriend a scarf for Christmas.  I gave her some chunky yarn and needles to practice with, and when she knitted her practice square, I admired the yarn so much that I made it into a cowl when she was done with it (she made a great scarf, by the way!). The yarn was passed on to me by a neighbor who moved, so I don't know what its content is or anything.  I do really like the cowl (which I made up) and I especially like that I knit it in one day while I went with my parents to Virginia for a great-aunt's funeral.  Knitting is so slow, at least the way I do it.Hopefully I will now jinx winter by posting this.  It's been an unusually cold spring; in fact, it snowed for several hours yesterday afternoon.  Even the kids were disgusted!

I am usually content to live in tidy filth; inviting people over usually motivates me to clean a bit. Visible dirt can also motivate me to clean, but I'm way more interested in food and sewing projects than cleaning. So boring!I'm also not great at planning social things or deciding what to do with invitations to social things - I'm a homebody until I get housebound and then it's usually too late for my organized self to just, you know, add something to the calendar.

{"title": "Red Hammer Soup", "date": "Wednesday, April 4, 2018", "text": "The inspiration for this soup comes directly from Rebecca, who served me a hot virgin bloody mary this winter.  It was fantastic, sipped directly out of pretty china cups, with chicken-salad sandwiches and chips. I have never liked this name for a drink, even though I do really love the drink (tomato juice anything, really), so I did a little sleuthing.  Back in 1942, a bloody mary was called a red hammer.  So that's what I'm renaming this splendidly versatile soup.Red hammer soup brightens up a winter menu as a soup, yes, or an appetizer cup, or even just a vegetable to go next to pesto and pasta and green salad, as we had it here. Essentially, make any virgin bloody mary and heat it up: now it's a red hammer, ok?  This is how I make mine, although the measurements are guesses.  I add the seasonings, taste, and adjust.Red HammersHeat together:1 quart tomato-soup base* (see recipe here)2 tsp. Worcestershire1/2 tsp. celery seed1/4 tsp. Tabasco (or add individually if you have spice-adverse eaters)Serve hot to sip in mugs, or in bowls garnished with chilled, diced shrimp or chopped celery and onion.Other ideas of add-ins or garnishes: squeeze of fresh lime juice, minced parsley, Old Bay seasoning, oyster crackers*I think you could absolutely start with something other than homemade tomato-soup base.  I'm using what I have.  Try pureeing fresh or canned tomatoes, or use tomato juice or V8."},

I have some big kid appetites to reckon with.Also, the yogurt with salt, pepper, and lemon juice was a real revelation.

{"title": "Meadow-Stripe Mittens", "date": "Thursday, March 1, 2018", "text": "Phoebe had her mitts from last year, but now that she is so big, she is out of the stroller and down on the sidewalk needing to pick things up.  That is hard when you don't have your thumbs! So I made her some mittens. I figured if I could knit socks, I could surely do mittens. The pattern, World's Simplest Mittens, has the ribbed cuff being knitted with size 0 needles, which felt like knitting with flexible toothpicks.  And the resulting cuff is almost too tight to get over Phoebe's hands.  I think the idea is that mittens would fall off without a tight cuff, but since I put them on an I-cord, that's not an issue for Phoebe. So I'll remember that for next time.  I also found the decreases confusing at the top of the mittens, and the mittens don't lay flat the way I think they should. The yarn is called Meadow Stripes by Patons, and I adore the colors and how the mittens are fraternal, not identical, twins. Phoebe also adores her mittens and handily picks up any old thing she finds on the sidewalk; we've now had lessons in What Phoebe Can Pick Up (basically, sticks and pennies)."},
{"title": "Wonderful Lettuce as a Wonderful Side Dish", "date": "Wednesday, February 28, 2018", "text": "I have eaten lettuce as a side dish for lunch for 6 days straight now since I read about this in the newspaper last week.  I regretfully cannot quote the writer or article, because most of the article was about the French vinaigrette she fell in love with and took years to re-create at home.  But she did mention that she puts excellent olive oil, flake salt, and fresh ground pepper on butter lettuce and it's so good it doesn't need vinegar.  This is a game changer!  No tedious salad prep! No emulsifying a vinaigrette! I adore green salads, but I consider them kind of a production.  I wash and dry the lettuce, chop and shred some veggies, sometimes toast some nuts, make a dressing or vinaigrette if there's not one sitting in the fridge, and hope for leftovers so I can have some for lunch the next day.  But!  If you simply pull some lettuce leaves into a bowl, drizzle with your best olive oil, sprinkle with some flake salt and fresh pepper, stir, and oh-my-goodness-EAT IT, it is wonderful and fast and I can have it whenever I want!I am extremely fortunate to have local farmers who grow gorgeous, organic lettuce year-round in their greenhouses or hydroponically; their lettuce is clean enough to skip the washing and drying steps, hallelujah. My favorite serving dish, from Grandma Weaver.When I steam broccoli or something like that, I sprinkle it with salt and pepper and give it a slick of butter or olive oil when it's done.  So that's what's going on with the lettuce here - that's why I call it \"side dish lettuce\" instead of a salad.  You could add vinegar or lemon juice if that's what you do with your steamed broccoli (and then you could go on to add other veggies. . . and you've got salad). I am just thrilled for the simplicity that allows me to assemble side dish lettuce in the 33 seconds it takes to microwave the toddler some lunch. You may also be interested to see this study by the Center for Disease Control that ranks vegetables and fruits according to their nutrient density; leaf lettuce outranks kale, collards, cabbage and others as a nutrient-dense powerhouse vegetable.  Hooray for lettuce!"},
{"title": "A Bright Wool Wrap Skirt with a Kilt Pin", "date": "Friday, February 23, 2018", "text": "I bought this wool from my favorite thrift store: 3 yards of soft, pure wool in a gorgeous plaid for $5.  Amazing!I was a little nervous to cut into it, but you can see that I did in this post.  And I matched the plaid by making sure I laid the bottom of the pattern pieces on the same stripe in the plaid. I decided to line the skirt to make dressing even easier and wearing even more comfortable (I hate when my slip and my skirt/dress don't move in the same way so that I'm conscious of two separate layers - lining eliminates this!). I used a navy lining fabric from JoAnn's and simply made a duplicate skirt.  The waistband facing at the top holds the lining in place, as does my handstitching at both sides.  I left the lining hem free of the skirt hem.The kilt pin is pretty and also functional when you have kids crawling across your lap randomly.  I'm still debating if I should put belt carriers on the waistline like the pattern calls for.Thanks to the deep green in this skirt, I'm having a new color crush.  I don't know what it looks like on your monitor, but it's a deep jewel green.  Like cobalt blue is to navy, this deep green is to the 80s hunter green.  It's lively.I bought this elbow-sleeve sweater at the thrift store for $3 and got it home to realize it was kelly-green. So gauche next to the deep rich colors in the skirt. So I dyed the sweater! The sweater in these photos was overdyed with Rit Dark Green #35. I did it the Saturday night before I wore it to church, while Ben and a friend roared through the dishes (nothing broke, just the silverware drawer spilled over the floor, so I took the opportunity to clean the silverware tray while the sweater simmered on the stove).  And the girls shrieked in and out of the kitchen, and I told my husband I was dyeing a sweater, and he said, \"I'm impressed, but not surprised.\"  Isn't he the best?  I flopped the wet sweater on the radiator overnight, and wore it (I confess) smugly to church the next morning.  And these whimsical green gems that I bought from an opera-singer neighbor years ago finally have an outfit!  I still have some wool plaid left:  maybe I can get one of my girls to wear a matching skirt."},

Our volume is a little high right now because Phoebe wears disposables overnight, but I'm looking at the big picture.  We have an excellent recycling program in the city, and often our recycling bins are fuller than our trash bins. I wondered if I could do anything with this big pillar candles that burn through their wick in the center and leave behind a heavy chunk of wax for the trash.  I did a little research and successfully made some new votives!Supplies I used:wax from old candles a metal coffee can + a saucepan to make a water bath to melt waxsmall paper cupstoothpickscandle wick stringcontainer to hold candle molds while I pouredI put all the old candle chunks, wicks and cinders and whatever included, in the metal coffee can and set it in water in the saucepan over low heat.  Stay in the room while you do this - liquid wax is a fire hazard! Once the wax was totally liquid, the impurities went to the bottom.I had set up my little votive molds by greasing the paper cups, and putting the wicks in the middle by punching a hole in the bottom of the cup, knotting the wick underneath, and then tying the wick to the toothpick at the top.I set the molds in a newspaper-lined tray, and poured the hot wax in each mold. You can see that I did two color batches.  The votives hardened fairly quickly, but also left a sinkhole in the middle of each votive.  Since I made these just for winter evenings for us, I don't care, but I'm sure there are ways to prevent that sinkhole. And the votives burn very nicely! So I've started collecting scraps of wax and candles again in a bag for an easy, thrifty project that reduces our trash volume and keeps the house bright."},

You'll see that I put hearts on Phoebe's jeans just like I did four years ago for her big sister.People are not talking about the mundane at a funeral; they are talking about more unique acts in peoples' lives, and yet we must eat, wear clothing, and be sheltered in hopefully clean houses.

Her big thing these days is dressing and undressing; it's rarely appropriate to the circumstances, which cracks us all up.Russian Borsch - from the More With Less with tweaks by me, and please taste and tweak as you go along; I tried to accurately record what I did, but ultimately, soup-making is an art which varies with mood and pantry realitiesIf you have a beef bone, preferably a meaty, fatty bone, from roast beef, simmer it in 2 quarts water in a soup pot for at least 12 hours with 1 tsp. salt and 1 Tbsp. vinegar. I did mine 18 hours, starting the night before. (More With Less recommends a mutton neck or lamb bones - good for you if you can get those). And if your cupboard is bare and you have no bone, use whatever meat stock or broth you have.Take out and discard the bone. Add to the stock:1 large onion, chopped2 big potatoes, diced1 medium red beet, shredded1 cup pureed tomatoes1 tsp. fresh-ground pepper1 dried red pepper3 bay leaves1 Tbsp. dill seedSimmer covered for 1 hour or so. Taste, and if the broth seems thin, I like to add some powdered beef bouillon instead of just salt.Add:4 cups shredded green cabbage1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped1 tsp. dillweedSimmer another 30 minutes or so.  Taste and add more salt if needed (or a splash of Worcestershire!). Serve with dollops of plain yogurt or several tablespoons of heavy cream in each bowl. When you stir it in, the borsch will turn creamy red-purple, which is exactly what I remember from Russia."},

For the last few years, I've had to fight it considerably to get it straight in the winter.  After reading Jennifer's post, Rebecca texted me:  \"your hair would do that!\"  So I bought some new products, poked around on the Curly Girl website (totally overwhelming!), checked the Curly Girl book out of the library (less overwhelming), and tried some things.Here's what I've been doing for 3 weeks now.To wash my hair, I put a quarter-size amount of sulfate-free shampoo on my fingertips and put it only on my roots.  I scrub my scalp with my fingertips and ignore the rest of my hair.  I rinse it well with cool water by standing under the stream of water and just lifting and scrunching my hair to get all the soapy parts rinsed. I usually count to 60 to make sure I'm really getting it rinsed.  I do not swirl, rub, or otherwise roughly disturb my hair.  My reasons:  shampoo, even sulfate-free, can still be drying to hair and curly hair needs so much more moisture than I ever imagined. Cool water is less drying than hot water. Even while wet, curly hair is trying to keep its curl pattern, so I don't want to mess it up unduly.Then I squirt apple cider vinegar directly on my scalp and give it a quick rinse. My reasons: my scalp likes to get itchy and flaky quickly, and the vinegar helps to disrupt that pattern.  Plus, it removes any product build-up on my hair.To condition, I use a half-dollar size amount of sulfate-free conditioner.  This time, I ignore my scalp and scrunch it through my ends, getting to within an inch or two of my head. Then, I run my hands lightly over the top of my head, to hit the \"hair canopy\" where most of the frizz would be. I let the conditioner soak in for the rest of my shower ablutions. Then I stand under the water, cool again, for just a few quick rinses. My reasons: conditioner is going to moisturize my hair, not my scalp.Just done putting on gel: drowned rat look.As soon as I'm out of the shower, I squeeze the ends of my hair in a towel - no rubbing whatsoever! But no special towel, either, as Curly Girl would have me use.  I just blot the water out of the ends. Immediately, I flip over my head and scrunch DevaCurl Light Defining Gel through the ends and up to about an inch from my scalp. I stand up and ignore my hair as much as possible until it's thoroughly dry, several hours. It will look fairly crunchy and 1980s gelled, which is a scary look, but Curly Girl calls this a \"gel cast\" and says you can break it by shaking your head and shuffling the roots.  I find that just general living with kids breaks my gel cast before I get around to it.The next two days, in the morning, I spray my hair generously with water with a few drops of lavender essential oil in it.  When it's quite wet and the curls are springing back, I flip my head over and scrunch in One and Only Argan Oil Styling Cream. Then let it alone completely until it dries.Some issues, notes, and questions I have:1. Lorraine Massey (Curly Girl method) says frizz is just parched hair reaching out into the atmosphere for moisture; it's a curl-in-waiting.  My hair is hardly frizzy at all anymore!2. I'm not sure if I actually love how my hair looks.  I can see it's healthier and I'm not fighting its natural wave, but do I actually like it?  Thinking this might be a reason to seek out a Deva salon to get a good cut.3. Apparently my wavy hair will adjust and develop more the longer I stay on this routine.  I'm curious to see if I like the looks more, or if it gets more curly?  I know it will be more curly in the summer humidity.4. If sulfates are so drying for hair, should I ditch all the sudsy sulfate shampoos in our house?5. My scalp is less itchy, but more flaky than pre-Curly Girl method.  Not sure I have the stamina to brave the Curly Girl forums and do research.Please chime in with what you know about curly hair, wavy hair, or hair care in general."},
{"title": "A Wool Cape for Genevieve", "date": "Monday, December 18, 2017", "text": "My neighbor went KonMari on her attic, so she gave me a load of patterns and fabric.  There was a gorgeous length of double-sided wool, and since Genevieve had outgrown her Sunday coat, I wondered if she would like a Sunday cape.  Indeed yes! Over the years, we have received some dressy coats as gifts or hand me downs, or I have found them at thrift stores for a few dollars.  I don't usually set out to look for a dressy coat, although there was the time Ben requested one and I do love to support my children's interest in looking good. I doubt I would have bought Genevieve this cape, but since the wool and pattern fell into my lap, I seized the opportunity. I'm glad I had already sewn a cape from this pattern with fleece for Ben.  I lined the cape with satin, but I didn't follow the pattern precisely.  I essentially made a second cape out of grey satin, where the pattern was excluding front panels for the lining, which I couldn't understand. I used the red side of the wool inside the placket and hood so that it would show (I was afraid that a full red cape would always and forever mean \"Little Red Riding Hood\" in a tiresome way). I also made more of a placket for the buttonholes than the pattern directed, but this wool was so plush that keeping it smooth under the presser foot was very tricky.  I think I should have used my walking foot when I was sewing double thickness.  I would like to pick out one of the placket seams and straighten it out a bit, but I'm worried that I'm going to snip the wool in the process because the stitches are so deep in the plush. Oh well. Genevieve adores the cape, and (don't tell!) I'm going to make her a muff to go with it.  She probably needs a lantern in her hand, too, don't you think?  She was hoping I would make it floor-length like Ben's, but I thought it would look so costume-y that she would have to switch her wardrobe to hoop skirts and bonnets. As it is, if she keeps growing straight up the way she has been doing since toddlerhood, this cape should fit her forever, even as it becomes above-the-knee length."},

{"title": "Little Mocha Oreo Cheesecakes", "date": "Friday, December 8, 2017", "text": "I used my husband's birthday to make little individual cheesecakes.  He does like cheesecake, but I'm not sure how he feels about Oreos.  I can tell you the children love Oreos, but I don't necessarily. However, these little cheesecakes turned out quite delicious.My in-laws gave us a package of Oreos some time back, and I stuck it in the back of the pantry because why.  Because I don't buy Oreos, and I don't know how to just hand out Oreos to a hungry kid?  Because Oreos are boring?  But if I use Oreos as an ingredient, nay, as a crust for a little mini cheesecake?  Now that's more enticing.When I was buying my two blocks of cream cheese at market, I mentioned to the friendly girl who tells me about her new puppy that I was planning to make these little cheesecakes.  She immediately remembered her mom making such cheesecakes, but mocha flavor.  I took note.I can't even link to the recipe I used because I combined several traditional recipes after googling \"individual Oreo cheesecakes.\"  And no way was I going to crush up Oreos and bake them with butter first to make a crust - people, please, I have a toddler who was thrilled to drop whole Oreos in the bottom of the muffin papers, taking bites occasionally while saying in her serious, sweet voice, \"We are not eating dem - we are just putting dem in dere.\"I divided the cheesecake batter in half.  To one half, I added a hefty teaspoon of instant decaf espresso powder.  To the other half, I added crushed Oreos.  Then I layered each batter on top of the Oreos in the muffin cups. Bake them, chill them, done.Now I have a whole bag of little candy canes that my children picked off the ground at the park one night in somebody's terribly misbegotten idea of a fun holiday activity for children.  My children know me well enough to know they were never going to eat more than a few, but what in heaven's name do I do with all these boring, plastic-wrapped stupid candy canes?"},

It's a feat to find real work for toddlers (they're not easily fobbed off with fake chores!) that is actually helpful with minimal potential for breakage, bodily harm, and disaster.I borrowed a mandoline from a neighbor and sliced two heads.  Phoebe took up the meat mallet with proud purpose to pound the cabbage to release its juices. Another key to having a toddler helper:  act like it's normal and don't over-praise because then you will mark their helpfulness as somehow abnormal. I want to encourage all the helpers!  We all eat food in this house and by gum, we can all pitch in.I lugged the crock up to the balcony - I'm going to try fermenting outside!  The crock is in a sheltered spot and will get strong morning sun.  So far the weather has been fairly mild, so we'll see how the bacteria like being outside in the fresh air to make sauerkraut."},

And don't forget the myriad runs to various medical establishments (my husband had to go on a 2-day business trip in there, too) and food stores to coax the healthy color back into the sickies' faces again.We realized the necessity of canceling all Thanksgiving plans with extended family on Wednesday afternoon.  Sitting with Genevieve in the hospital lab, I quickly sketched a menu that I thought could work to make Thanksgiving at home traditional and doable. I flew down to market, forgetting its holiday hours, and got there in time to see it shuttered.  I begged the meat stand to quickly sell me something, anything, and got a chicken just before he drove off.  There was just one produce stand with all its boxes packed, but Laura dug through her boxes in full sympathy and good cheer to find what I needed. For years, I have wished to cook an entire Thanksgiving feast with everything exactly to my taste, recipes researched, rejected, and chosen with care, ingredients gathered for weeks ahead, and linens fussed over and prepped.  And here I was, thrown into my own feast in less than 24 hours with lethargic children coughing in the other room. So I am thankful for things I was not expecting to be thankful for this season: for skilled doctors who use their diagnostic tools well, sympathetic nurses, supportive parents and family who jump in with childcare and errands, the relative health and incremental recovery of my children, an abundance of food from kind market sellers, and all the big things that underpin our lives that I can take for granted.What are you thankful for this season?"},

I was able to reduce the puff significantly, while still keeping the ease that I needed for songleading, the first event where I wore this dress.I also tried on the dress multiple times to take in the waistline darts and loosen up the hip area.  So many fitting issues!  The linen was rough and scratchy when I started making the dress, but I handled it so thoroughly that it turned soft and buttery by the time I was ready to wear it. I do like the dress, especially with the chunky bracelet I got at the thrift store for $2 and the merino wrap my mother-in-law got in India.

And then my water went to a drip, to nothing.  I went down to the basement, and the guys were apologetic, and yes, my gas was turned off, too.  \"But I'm canning!\"  I said blankly.  They had forgotten to mention that the gas and water needed to be shut off for the installation.  They bustled around and set up some valves, but still, it was more than 2 hours until I got my utilities back and could resume where I left off.Thank goodness the terrible purple spill down my creamy-white cabinets happened when I still had water earlier that morning! I mixed up a concoction of 1 cup ammonia, 1 gallon hot water, 1/2 cup white vinegar, and 1/4 cup baking soda (the recipe comes right off the ammonia jug) and was able to get the purple stains off my cabinets and wood floor.  This is a wonderful cleaner for painted walls and woodwork.  Once a year or so, I go around and wash the gray and grimy evidence of kids off the walls as best as I can; it's so much easier and cheaper than repainting, at this stage!As for the grape canning, I got 8 quarts of thick, rich juice with the leavings going into spiced grape butter; I also made 2 quarts of pie filling for the freezer.  Furthermore, we went out for dinner that night (with coupons!) because my kitchen game had been totally thrown off by the disappearance of gas and water.The next day, I shared a glass of grape juice with the gas company's supervisor - he was always interested in my kitchen projects and was suitably impressed with my grape juice.  He suggested I make grappa with the skins left from the juice making.  Now our boiler is installed, and the grapes are done."},

More curses!  From here on out, I am pretending that I intended to have ruched stripes on my balcony curtains.  Sigh.I'm mad.  I'm mad for the reasons above, but also in the older usage of the word, this was an insane project.  It was too much fabric, and while the thickness of the canvas is great for blocking the sun, it was terribly difficult to wrangle on my sewing machine.  It took a lot of time to sew these curtains and dulled all my pins.  When the curtains were done, I threw away the pins and got new ones. In retrospect, I should have bought the thin outdoor curtains I saw everywhere online, and just lined them with heavy fabric (not canvas!) to truly block the sun. If my curtains can't be the example to follow, at least they can be a warning.

Once the rain started, I just shriveled and did not take pictures. We pretty much followed the same lists as last year, except that I forgot the percolator cord and the hot dogs.  And long underwear, for crying out loud.Ryan told me how to make Mexican coffee and it turned out so well:  3 mugfuls of water in a cooking pot with 6 heaping tablespoons of ground coffee.  Bring to a boil with the lid on.  Boil a minute and then turn off the heat to let the grounds settle. Pour into mugs, leaving the grounds behind in the pot.Also, Christy mixed her French toast milk and egg liquid together and froze it before packing it for camp.  She said it worked just fine.  I'm going to do that next year for my pancake wet mixture.  And pack long underwear, too.I always take along some snacky foods, even though the kids are filling up with junk from the camp store.  This year, it was apples, peaches, popcorn, and hermits.  The hermits are a hit, kind of like a molasses brownie.Hermit Bars (original recipe from here)Cream together in mixing bowl:1/2 cup sugar (or 2/3 cup if you like sweeter bars) 1/2 cup shortening1/2 cup butter, soft1/2 tsp. cinnamon1/2 tsp. nutmeg1/2 tsp. ginger1/2 tsp. cloves1/2 tsp. saltAdd and beat again:1 tsp. baking soda1/2 cup baking molassesStir in:3 cups all-purpose flour1 cup raisinsPress mixture (it will be very stiff) in greased 9x13 baking pan.  Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes until bars are just barely pulling away from edges.  Do not overbake!  Cut into bars when cool.Notes:  I use 2 cups whole wheat all-purpose flour for 2 of the 3 cups of flour in this recipe and in many baking recipes that are leavened with baking soda and baking powder.  You can use a cup of whole wheat pastry flour (soft wheat) and a cup of whole wheat bread flour (hard wheat) and that should work fine.Baking molasses is mild in flavor.  If you want a deeper flavor, use 1/4 cup blackstrap molasses and 1/4 cup baking molasses."},

This was the kids' supper when my husband and I were leaving them with a babysitter to go out for dinner. I snitched a few bites before we left, and boy, I was so glad there were leftovers.  I had asked Genevieve if she wanted to make mac and cheese, or if I should do something; this fried rice was so easy, I didn't mind when she demurred. Here's how I made it.Summer Fried RiceSauteed an onion in the wok in oil. Salt and pepper.Added a large zucchini, chopped. Salt and pepper (Deb insists that seasoning each addition is crucial for flavor).When that was hot but not soft (a few minutes), I added about 2 cups leftover rice, plus maybe a half-cup of corn.  A large tomato, chopped, and several sprigs of fresh thyme, chopped.  More salt and pepper. When everything was hot, I set it aside and fried eggs for each person to go on top (this recipe serves 4-ish). Then there was about 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan, some mixed into the fried rice, and some sprinkled on top of the egg.Also, I like to set out ingredients for supper in the morning.  It's a visual comfort to see that supper is already in progress, plus it reserves those ingredients from the hungry hordes in my house and frees up fridge space. It may look like a tiny step to set a few things out on the counter, but it represents a much bigger step:  deciding what's for supper.Here we have rice and corn in the leftover container, onion in the jar, and eggs, tomatoes, and zucchini waiting for the fried rice.  Supper decision is made, hallelujah!"},

Once I got the market things put away, the bread baked, and the dishes washed, the actual canning could begin.  Genevieve peeled all the tomatoes, I stuffed the jars, and then I spent the afternoon running them through the canner.  Now I have 17 quarts of whole tomatoes, sealed and cooling.  And then I got a text from a friend on Saturday with a bunch of peppers, so I made pimentos.  And finally, on Sunday, my in-laws dropped off 10 pounds of Roma tomatoes that someone at their church wanted to get rid of.  So yesterday, I made and canned pizza sauce.This is all going on with camping preparation and the kids starting school, with Genevieve's middle school location and schedule throwing a wrench in the works. I love this home-canned food, I love preserving food, but you guys:  my life feels a little impossible right now.  I would ditch the camping if we hadn't already paid for it, and I want to hang with dear friends.My children are happy which is a big consolation and one of these days, mama's going to be happy, too, when she gets a tidy, peaceful house to herself with no looming projects.  One of these years, maybe. . ."},

I know two versions of it in the North.  One is found in More with Less, with no butter (Yankees are no fun), and the other was my childhood church cookbook and had the butter, but less fruit.  I like Aunt Nancy's the best.  The fruit to buttery-moist-crumb-part is about equal, and that's how I like it.If you bake it long enough, the edges darken and crisp from all that butter.  Aunt Nancy loves me enough that she gave me that special edge when we were in NC.  This is Phoebe's photo-face.  She thinks she's smiling.Also, isn't that tablecloth great?  Years ago, I stashed it with my fabric with the idea of making a skirt, but I just absolutely love its grooviness in my summer dining room.

Aunt Nancy said you can use anywhere from 1/4 - 1/2 cup butter.  Obviously a Southerner would go for the full stick.2. I used half whole-wheat all-purpose flour.  You can get this from McGeary Organics and it makes the perfect texture for chemically-leaved baked goods.3. I cut back the sugar a little because I'm not Southern.4. You can use other fruit besides peaches.  I added some sad raspberries and 2 black raspberries from my new backyard bush.5.  Aunt Nancy has baked this at higher temperatures or reduced the time or changed the pan size or otherwise fiddled with the chemistry.  Good news: the cobbler is not fussy!"},

He's learned to yell \"lemonade!\" \"fifty cents a cup!\" \"fresh squeezed lemonade!\"  I also tried to convince him to make a bigger, brighter sign, but he's convinced that his yell is the ticket to success.Recently, I was returning from an errand on foot when I saw a sweet young couple dawdling at the historic church, and he had one of Ben's lemonade cups dangling from his hand.  So I told Ben that I had seen some of his customers, and his face lit up because they were memorable:  \"they gave me five dollars for two cups of lemonade!\"  With some probing, I found out that young Ben said upon receipt of aforesaid five dollars:  \"do you want change?\"  Oh Ben.  Dear Ben.  We sat right down and had a lesson on giving change and how that change is given, as a right, back to the customer, and how any tip is handled as a surprise and a bonus with a huge thank you.  But the little old ladies are not helping this lesson to stick, because as often as not, they simply hand Ben some money as they wander by, declining a cup of lemonade.  Ben is making very good money, actually.  My heart is warmed by all the people who want to encourage a kid.. . the neighbor who insisted that Ben take two dollars because fifty cents is not enough for a cup. . . the big sister who buys lemonade. . . the repeat neighbor customers. . .the contractor who came on business and bought a cup from Ben and told Ben personally that the lemonade was delicious and then later in an email to me that the lemonade was really good. . ..  It really is.  Try it yourself!Ben's Lemonade (will not make you feverish, does not involve simple syrup or waiting, does not need adult help if you can handle a knife)Makes a half gallonThinly slice three scrubbed lemons.  Pick out the seeds as best you can.Put lemons in sturdy half-gallon pitcher.  Add 3/4 cup sugar.Pound and mash with a wooden spoon (Ben says this is his favorite part).Fill up pitcher with cold water and ice cubes.  Stir.

I made the shirt the same way as last year's blue calico that matched Genevieve's. The kitties are so adorably quaint and the colors so whimsical that I couldn't even add lavender rick-rack or black hand-stitching; the kitties carried the day.The fabric has been in my stash for years, waiting for the right little girl in the summer.  The pleasure I feel in this shirt on this girl in this summer reinforces all my saving tendencies.  What if all my saved stuff could blossom in this way after years?"},

The process was easy and the jel was good before the jars went to the freezer.  I also froze some whole berries - an idea from a friend at the berry patch.  She said her kids like to eat them straight from the freezer as snacks.  Then I used two cups of strawberries to make strawberry rhubarb jam - the rhubarb provides the thickness, the jel, and I used vanilla sugar for a little something special.The strawberry rhubarb jam required my canning gear, so the preserving season is officially begun!A few weeks ago, I did an inventory of my freezer and canning shelves so I could make goals for this year's preserving.  Cherries will be up next, I think, followed closely by beets.  And blueberries!  Thank you, dear God, for all this wonderful food."},

In the end, my new cover was a wee bit short and required some diaper pins in the back to keep it in place.  I thought I was cutting generously when I traced the old cover, but oh well.  This is get-er-done-and-functional sewing.  The fabric happens to make me giggle, too.More giggles.

{"title": "Sheet-Pan Chicken is Hot and So is the Weather", "date": "Tuesday, June 13, 2017", "text": "It was 97 degrees F in the shade at our house today, but I still need to tell you about this chicken recipe before I forget (and shout out to Sarah, where I saw the link to the recipe first).  It is fabulous, a total crowd-pleaser and a cook-pleaser because it's so easy.  The vegetables get roasted and, in spots, caramelized; the vegetables under the chicken are bathed in drippings as well. The chicken is juicy, tender, and perfectly savory from the salt.  The crisp chicken skin is highly coveted. The first time I made this chicken, my family exclaimed over and over - my husband even said it was the best chicken he ever had.  Whoa, baby!  The big kids begged me to make it again.However, I will not be making this chicken again until the weather cools down because you crank the oven up to 500 degrees for almost an hour to make it. I think it's kind of an internet sensation right now, sheet-pan chicken, and for all good reasons.  When it's not so stinkin' hot, I will be looking for variations because this will go into heavy rotation in the winter at my house.Simple Sheet-Pan Chicken and VegIngredients:--1 chicken thigh per person, bone-in and skin on--assorted vegetables that take well to roasting - root veg as well as onions, broccoli, green beans--salt, pepper, some dried rosemary (optional)Prepping the Pan:I made 5 thighs on a half-sheet pan (13x18 rimmed baking sheet) with a crowded single layer of vegetables underneath.  It's important to have the veg crowded together so they don't burn to a crisp, but also important to have a single layer so they can be caramelized (yes! yum!) in spots. So, size your pan according to how many veggies you want to use.You can line it with heavy-duty foil if you want even less clean up (regular foil just peels up with the veggies when you try to serve them - you can learn from my experience!).  I didn't line it with foil the second time and the clean-up was still very easy as long as you're willing to break out a Brillo pad.Method:Cut veggies into large bite-sized pieces.  Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper, and some dried rosemary if you wish, and spread in single, thick layer on rimmed baking sheet.Lay the chicken thighs skin side down on the veg.  Sprinkle each one generously with salt.  Flip the thighs over, peel back the skin, and salt the thighs generously UNDER the skin.  Pull the skin back into place.  Pat the skin dry with a paper towel or old kitchen towel. This will make amazingly crispy skin.Bake the chicken and veggies at 500F for 50 minutes.  No need to stir, check, or bother for that whole baking time.  Serve hot.  We like a side of coleslaw or something vinegary on the side.  Shown here was steamed asparagus with lemon juice."},

I returned another day with my camera (feeling shy again, but reminding myself I had permission). My deep love for this yard is based on the pragmatism and sheer abundance - I love the make-do greenhouse/potting shed built out of old windows as far as I can tell, and the old swingset frame used as a trellis and also a shelter for tender plants.  Bottoms from nursery trays turned into fence, all kinds of supports and planters improvised from things most Americans throw away.Look at the milk-crate edging, the lettuce mixed with flowers, the buckets and improvised shelves. I love the make-do, can-do vibe. And the roses.  Oh, the roses! Their scent is a beautiful as they are because I put my nose in as many as I could, and thought of my grandmother who grew roses in tidy little bushes but this yard has a different tidiness, a different aesthetic from the middle-class American gardens I am accustomed to seeing.  It tickles my imagination and makes me bolder in my own gardening efforts.  I am hatching some plans for two different arbors at our balcony and porch and I am not thinking small or middle-class, no I am not."},

I found out I could buy a Samsung Galaxy 3 Express for $40 at my AT&T store (we have our plan through AT&T), and it suits me just fine because I tried to think carefully about what I wanted to use my phone for. I mostly use it for texting, occasionally calling when I'm away from home, and then some Google Driving for navigating on trips.  I snap a few photos here and there, but I mostly use my nice camera.  I rarely use the internet on my phone and I never check or reply to my email on my phone; I do that on my laptop where I feel less claustrophobic with a bigger screen (am I the only one who feels claustrophobic with small screens?).  I use the phone's timers and alarms and calculator.  I do have it synced with my online calendar, but it's not reliable; I don't think that's unique to my phone! The only app I downloaded is a money-tracking app (Dollarbird), and although my kids have asked, I don't know if there are games on my phone because I'm not interested.The nice AT&T guy did convince me to buy a $25 case and $89 headphones for the phone.  I was so relieved to be getting a working phone that I ignored my typical rule of taking time to think through purchases and do a little research on price first.  When I sheepishly showed my purchases to my husband, his face confirmed my sneaking suspicion that I needed to return the headphones and case and comparison shop.  Sure enough, I got a case on ebay for $5 and still haven't purchased headphones because I just don't listen to music or podcasts on my phone (but I could be convinced!).I made a charger envelope for the new charger.  But this time, I included a pocket on the back for the USB car converter, and I keep the envelope in my purse.  It's nice to grab-and-go without worrying about battery life.So I've had my smart phone about three months now, and I do like it.  I feel like I've hit my goal of phone-that-doesn't-exclude-me-from-socializing-and-networking-but-doesn't-cost-a-fortune-for-bells-and-whistles-I-am-not-using.What other thrifty smartphone tips do you have?  Or is this an area where you are willing to pay for convenience, functionality, and security?

{"title": "A Little Tutorial for Patching Holey Jeans", "date": "Thursday, May 25, 2017", "text": "Holes in jeans knees that you want to mend?  Here's one method (more methods at the bottom of the post).Unpick a side seam on the jeans leg with the hole, whichever seam is not flat-felled but just a single seam, using a seam ripper.  You are trying to get it open far enough to fit it successfully under your sewing machine needle.  Probably at least 4\" below and above the hole, but I just eyeball and unpick a little more if I need to.Cut a rectangle of scrap denim or other sturdy cotton fabric and put it inside the jeans leg under the hole.  Pin it on the outside of the leg to mark the boundaries of the patch; you are going to sew on the right side, so you want your pins on the right side marking where the patch is underneath.Now start at one end of the patch and sew back and forth in close zig-zags - I do parallel to the waistband of the jeans, but I suppose you could do parallel to the leg seams - which is attaching the patch.  I sew more densely over the holey/weak area, but I do patch generously beyond the hole, too, as insurance against more holes.  The pins are marking the upper and lower limits of the patch, but you pull the jeans out of the sewing machine and check what's going on back there.  I usually trim the patch a little bit where the sewing didn't get all the way out to the edge.Turn the jeans leg inside out, match up the side seams, and sew it closed.  I sew a straight seam and then zig-zag the edges together to mimic the serged edge.  Done!Sometimes I mend holes in knees by hand.  I use lighter-weight fabric for the patch and a field of hand stitches in perle cotton, contrasting or matching.  Here's Phoebe wearing a pair of jeans with both knees mended in blue perle cotton with blue fabric inside.Genevieve is at this link wearing hearts on her knees.Ben at this link has a monster on his knee.I show a friend how to patch jeans' knees."},

{"title": "Raspberry Buttercream:  A Cautionary Tale", "date": "Monday, May 15, 2017", "text": "Pride goeth before a fall.  Yes.My sister proposed a joint birthday party for herself and Phoebe and I jumped at the chance to make whatever birthday dessert she desired.  She ultimately wanted a layer cake and let me choose, as long as it involved chocolate.  I returned with high hopes to Vintage Cakes by Julie Richardson; I had made a wonderful Italian Cream Cake from her book, and I wanted to make another fancy cake.I chose The Pink Cake, a luscious (read: lots of fat and special ingredients) chocolate cake with a \"raspberry buttercream.\"  To me, a buttercream icing is the kind where you beat butter with powdered sugar and a little milk and vanilla and done. However, there is an alternate universe of Buttercream-That-Will-Make-You-Cry where buttercream involves a pound of butter, six egg whites and in this case, a whole bag of frozen raspberries pushed laboriously through a strainer to make them seedless.  And the technique:  people, the technique is bizarre and tedious and there is a tightrope to walk and if you fall off, the buttercream will die (and you will cry).Actually, after about 10 minutes of my mixer on high, my Buttercream-That-Will-Make-You-Cry did actually look like a dreamy cloud, but then I dumped in the raspberry puree with the vanilla and salt as Julie Richardson airily said to do and the whole thing went to curdled hell. I tried tricks because at that point, I discovered via Google that I had been walking a tightrope and there were tricks for this icing.  I tried adding chocolate, an emulsifier.  I tried a period in the fridge.  I tried calling my best friend and wailing (she recommended hurling it on the compost pile). I tried beating it an additional 20 minutes. Yes, TWENTY. I tried microwaving parts of it and reintroducing it back to the flecked mess in the bowl.Please note that at this point, I had not cried.  I was mad because I had put a lot of time and ingredients into the Buttercream-That-Will-Make-You-Cry and I wanted to taste that chocolate cake against the pink raspberry heaven.  Instead, I whipped up a peanut butter icing and put it between the triple layers, and then swathed the whole thing in cheater Italian meringue (7 minutes to make, start to finish). During the car ride to the party, guess what those dumb old stupid cake layers did while I cradled them like a precious baby in their cake stand?  They slid sneakily and irrevocably apart.  So that's when I cried. The cake was pretty good.  The birthday girls were pleased.  I was mostly mollified.  But I still have a bowl of red and white curds in the fridge that I'm not sure what to do with.Had it uncurdled itself, my icing would have been a much darker pink than Julie Richardson's photo of The Pink Cake in her cookbook.  I followed her instructions for amounts to the letter, although she did not indicate how much raspberry puree was supposed to result from 4 cups of frozen berries.  I think my buttercream suffered from too much acid and water from the raspberry puree, and I wish she had included an exact amount to add so I could have ended up with pink Buttercream-That-Made-Me-Cry-From-Sheer-Deliciousness.  But I've passed on my experience to you and I'm happy to hear your buttercream tales (of woe or delight), too."},

I love it!  Genevieve loves it!  The pink dress became sweet and classic and not Too Much, although perhaps the crinoline underneath makes it Too Much for some people.  Genevieve and I both agreed that the two lines of white lace on the skirt were enough trim for the dress.The crinoline was one that I had picked up at a thrift store for a song years ago, but since I already had a crinoline, this one simply sat in the closet. When I offered to size it down to Genevieve's size, she was ecstatic.  Truly.  I think she loves the crinoline more than the dress and has begged to wear it as a skirt (what if that creamy crinoline is a square-dance crinoline?  Should she become one of those sedate ladies at the farm show who look like regular grandmas except for their gingham dresses and outrageous crinolines flapping up to show their knees as they dance?).I've even offered to make Genevieve a full circle skirt so she can wear that crinoline more often and twirl it out as wide as it goes.  The pink dress has a gathered skirt which limits its twirl factor. I did raise the neckline a little bit and in the process, accidentally rounded it out instead of the sweetheart neckline of the pattern.  But since it turned out evenly, I'm not complaining.  In fact, the dress pattern itself was very simple.The pink dress became a spring dress instead of an Easter dress and made its debut at the piano recital last week. Genevieve adores the dress and I'm pleased that I got it to fit her 11-year-old frame so nicely."},

{"title": "Eating Chickweed", "date": "Thursday, April 27, 2017", "text": "My back yard is pretty scrappy, largely the domain of the children, but I do try to weed the flower beds.  And over the years, I have noticed a particular weed ransack the beds in a damp, stringy way.  Last year, I suspected it was chick weed and actually edible.  This year, I got enough courage to properly identify it and now we are eating it!  I pull it out by the roots (because it's still rather unattractive so I don't really want it in the flower beds), snip off the roots, chop it up, and saute it with some olive oil and garlic.  Add a squeeze of lemon and some salt and pepper.  It really tastes like spinach!  However, it looks so twiggy and stringy that I didn't take a photo of the chickweed-as-food, but I think I will pull the leaves off and discard the stems next time.  I've heard chickweed is very healthy, but I'm also in love with the convenience of greens from the back yard. Any other chickweed eaters with tips to share?"},

{"title": "Chewy Granola or Skillet Oatmeal", "date": "Friday, April 21, 2017", "text": "We eat a lot of oats at our house for breakfast, between baked oatmeal, muffins, and granola.  And now I have another iteration of oats for breakfast!  This recipe is from Fountain Avenue Kitchen, where Ann also calls this \"chewy granola\" and \"not-mushy oatmeal.\"  But since the \"mushiness\" of cooked oatmeal doesn't bother me, I ignored that name to call this \"chew granola\" or \"skillet oatmeal.\"I love how quick this recipe is, and like a granola, it is endlessly customizable.  The texture reminds me of baked oatmeal, but without the need of an oven and eggs. Furthermore, sometimes in the morning, I want a soft chewy thing to eat instead of the serious crunch of granola.  Granola is too crunchy for Phoebe, but she can eat this oatmeal and loves it.I'm sorry I only have one strange photo of the skillet oatmeal; breakfast time is a blur around here.  That's traditional crunchy granola in the big jar and and the leftover skillet oatmeal in the small jar, just to give you an idea of its appearance. People are busy around here, let me tell you!  Their projects overtake them at any time of day.Skillet Oatmeal - serves 4Heat to steaming and set aside (I do this in the microwave):1/2 cup water1/2 cup milkIn large skillet, melt:2 Tbsp. coconut oil or butterAdd and saute together, stirring frequently:2 cups rolled oats1-2 Tbsp. brown sugar1/4 tsp. salt2 Tbsp. coconut, optionalCook and stir until the oats are toasted and the sugar is starting to caramelize, a few minutes.  Pour the hot milk/water over the oats mixture and stand back - it will steam intensely.  Stir.  Cover pan and reduce heat to low for a few minutes until oats have absorbed the liquid.Serve hot or room temperature with a dollop of yogurt, fruit, toasted nuts, etc.  Keeps in the fridge and reheats nicely in the microwave.Notes:  1.I use my 14\" shallow pan for this recipe because as Ann explains, you want the liquid to barely cover the bottom of the pan and moisten the oats.2. Quick oats would turn to mush in this recipe!3. Ann uses just water for the liquid, but I like the creaminess of the milk and the protein match between milk and grain."},

Later today, we will go shopping for gerbils because he did the research and his daddy and I agreed (in fact, in January, when he did the research, we told him he could buy himself a gerbil or he could wait until his birthday and we would buy them for him as his present; he chose delayed gratification and I'm so pleased!).I sewed these green pants for Ben when he loved dressing up; he wore bow ties, appreciated nice caps, and begged for suits.  I can't even remember what year I sewed these, because as far as I was concerned, they didn't exist because he didn't wear them.  He didn't like their fit, even though they are his favorite color.I was pretty sick about the situation because the cotton yarn-dyed plaid is just gorgeous - heavy and smooth and sturdy, and if you have ever installed a fly in pants, you will know that it is complicated and fiddly (and actually, in true boy fashion, he doesn't have the fly zipped entirely in these photos so it looks crooked; it's perfect, I assure you).  I don't invest the time in sewing something unless I'm pretty sure it's going to be used, but there was a lot of my time in those pants and they were hanging, forgotten, in a closet.Until one day, I happened upon Genevieve and Ben laughing their heads off and dancing in full make-up and crazy dress-up regalia.  And Ben was wearing the green pants.I pounced:  \"Buddy, they look great!  If I get you a white shirt, will you wear the pants?\"  He agreed, but on Easter morning, he waffled and looked wary, so I quietly bribed him with a chocolate peanut butter egg before breakfast and he wore the pants. Now the pants exist!  But will he wear them again?I try to save bribery for urgent situations and not probe too deeply into what it's teaching my kids because, dang, bribery is a handy tool in a tight spot.  And I don't want to give it up.  (Do you bribe your kids or, uh, anybody?  What for?)Happy birthday, dear Ben!  I hope you wear the green pants again, but I'll always love you entirely no matter what."},

{"title": "A Little Tip for Better Yogurt", "date": "Wednesday, April 12, 2017", "text": "Truly, such a little tip that really has made a difference to my homemade yogurt: don't stir the yogurt starter into the warm milk. Don't stir!  Just pour the warm milk over the yogurt and let it incubate.I can't recall where I picked this method up or even if it was promised as a tip, but I like it because my yogurt has a sweeter, milder flavor and a lovely jell. Plus, it's one less step! Maybe I should just give you the run-down for how I currently make yogurt?  It's a little different from my 2010 instructional post and subsequent posts (using glass jars, wild starter).1. Plug in yogurt incubator to warm up with glass jars in it.2. Use another glass half-pint to measure the (pasteurized) milk into a saucepan.3. Heat the milk to 180F using a candy thermometer to check.4. Set aside milk in its pan to cool to 100-110F.5. When milk has cooled to that temperature range, dollop a teaspoon-ful of plain yogurt from the last batch of yogurt into the bottom of each glass jar in the yogurt incubator.  I don't measure precisely!6. Pour the milk into the jars.7. Don't stir!!8. Loose cover.9. Incubate for 1-2 hours until jelled. 10. Refrigerate, making sure to put the \"Belgian yogurt - save this starter\" label on one of the new jar lids.More fun to look at Granny and Phoebe than it is to look at cups of white stuff which don't change their looks over the years, unlike these cuties."},

{"title": "Ben Bakes Cookies", "date": "Tuesday, March 21, 2017", "text": "It's a long story, but it's a good illustration of how children learn and how adults can contribute, so I'll tell it.Ben likes to earn money, so he often asks for extra jobs that I am willing to pay for and then squirrels his cash away.  He's been learning how to count and roll coins and how to keep a ledger recording money in and money out.Ben set up and took this photo.  I think it means the minifigure is going to work.When the school hosted a Scholastic book fair, he asked if he could buy a book.  I said sure, because it was his money; I prefer to shop for used books or use the library. He picked out two books and never said a word when the volunteer told him his total was $19.  But when we got home, he was very quiet.  And later, he burst into tears:  he didn't know the prices of the books and regretted spending that much money.  He didn't know where to look on the books for the prices, nor did he ask any questions.  Poor buddy.  He was distraught.So we made a special trip back across town the next day with one of the books and the receipt to return it, although I cautioned him that I wasn't sure if book fairs can do returns.  While we were waiting in line, the principal bopped by and started chatting up Ben.  I could see Mr. S. was impressed with Ben's depth of feeling, so he offered Ben a job to earn some money if Ben couldn't get his money back for the book.Well, Ben did get his money back for one book and kept one book, and he was happy.  And he was overjoyed when Mr. S. said the job offer would still stand, but that Ben needed to send him a proposal and pay schedule for his services. Ben was delighted to be treated like a wage-earning adult, and dictated an email through me to Mr. S. suggesting what he could help with (uh, that was a hard one: what can an 8-year-old help a principal with?).  I suggested \"bake cookies\" since Mr. S. has a legendary sweet tooth and Mr. S. said yes, indeedy, he would like a dozen cookies but to be sure Ben paid for his ingredients. So Ben took a pencil and paper and went with me when I went grocery shopping so he could write down prices.  Then, later, I helped him break down those prices for the amounts in his Snickerdoodle recipe, and then, further, for the dozen cookies he was taking to Mr. S.So Ben baked cookies on one of the snow days last week.  He had never baked cookies before, so we talked through the recipe, and I stayed nearby while he worked. I took these photos to illustrate how epic the baking process was. I'm really not even sure how I had the tolerance and patience for this project.  Maybe it was his pride and grit that impressed me?  He's something special, that Ben.I never took photos of the cookies!  They were good, but very dense:  we think he forgot the baking soda in all that chaos.And then he forgot the cookies on the porch the morning he was supposed to deliver them to Mr. S., and only remembered when we were halfway to school; yes, we turned around.  I love that Ben!"},

So my silver lining in this winter storm is that Ben and Genevieve actually got to wear the things I made for them.  But otherwise, winter, I am done with you.  Go away.This is Genevieve's ear warmer.  I used the last of this pretty yarn from Phoebe's vest and Phoebe's mittens - not sure what size it is or what the fiber content is.  I made up a pattern and it worked!  I just knitted a rectangle and then sewed the ends together.And this is Ben's scarf.  I made him a striped one years ago when I didn't understand yarn and needle size; it was a very amateurish scarf with shrunken patches and stretched out stitches. His favorite color is green.  I used the seeded-rib stitch and I love the cushy ribs.  I was close to being done early in the morning of the first snow day, so Ben stood over me dressed in his puffy coat, snow pants, and boots while I knit furiously and cast off.  He said I could put the fringe on later.  Thanks, bud.  He loves the scarf, but when he gets to seriously hogging around in the snow, it comes off. Phoebe wasn't totally thrilled about being out in the snow.  But I wanted to say that her snowsuit and hat are hand-me-downs from her big sister.  It gives me a strange jolt to see a little Genevieve walking around again:  it's fun to see the cute clothes in action after 10 years, but it's bittersweet to think how quickly time moves on."},
{"title": "Make It Into Pot Pie", "date": "Tuesday, March 14, 2017", "text": "Recently, my parents came back from a restaurant raving about the beef pot pie Dad got.  And there was this post by Becky on chicken pot pie.  I looked up pot pie in my Mennonite Community Cookbook (\"Old-Fashioned Beef Potpie\" by Grandmother Showalter); it's been a long time since I made homemade noodles!So I made pot pie twice in a short period of time, and I will be doing it a lot more; it's pretty easy and flexible, which suits my cooking style now.  Essentially, you make a very simple dough, roll it out, cut it into squares, and drop it into boiling stew.  The noodles soak up some of the liquid and make the stew into the kind of thing you can very easily imagine eating on a farm \"back then\" (as my kids say).the ham versionHowever, Grandmother Showalter is very careful not to shock her eaters with too many flavors, so her recipe only calls for 1 teaspoon of minced onion and 1 teaspoon of minced parsley to 2 pounds of beef.  Very funny to a modern cook!  I kept her proportions the same, but played with flavors.  We all loved the results.Old-Fashioned Potpie for Modern TastesCook 1lb. stewing beef cut in 1/2\" cubes in 6 cups water; use a large pot (Grandmother uses 2 lbs. meat, but I wanted more veggies).  Add chopped onion, sliced mushrooms, salt (I start with a scant teaspoon), pepper.  When beef is nearly tender, add approximately 3 cups diced carrots and potatoes.  A splash of Worcestershire sauce and balsamic vinegar.  Taste.Make noodles. Beat 1 egg and 3 Tbsp. milk together in a bowl.  Add 1 1/2 cups flour to make stiff dough (I use part whole wheat pastry flour - depends on how you feel about whole wheat noodles). Roll out dough on floured surface.  Aim for 1/4\" thickness or less - we like the noodles on the thick, chewy, toothsome side.   Drop the noodles into the boiling stew, stirring occasionally to make sure they don't stick together. I stir in chopped fresh parsley at this point, too. Allow to boil for 15 minutes or so.Ham variation: Use chopped ham instead of beef. Keep the onion, potato, and carrot, but also a cup or two of sauerkraut and add 2 bay leaves and a clove or two.  Lots of black pepper and parsley at the end.Notes:  This is a very forgiving recipe.  You can add more liquid if the noodles suck up too much in cooking or in sitting in the fridge as leftovers.  You can make the stew base earlier in the day and bring it back up to boiling closer to dinner when you make the noodles.  You can make the noodle dough at least an hour ahead of rolling it - in fact, the gluten will relax and make the rolling-out easier - just keep the dough in an airtight container at room temperature.beef versionI'd love your ideas for more variations - what other kinds of stews or flavor combinations should I use with these noodles?We've got an honest-to-John blizzard going on right now outside the window: blowing snow and sleet, everything canceled.  Perfect day for a thick homey stew like this!"},

{"title": "Two Further Thoughts About Barb", "date": "Wednesday, March 8, 2017", "text": "At the washline this morning, I realized that I wrote my post yesterday before my thoughts had really crystallized. Thought one: I don't know if I expected Barb to have some tricky tricks or clever solutions or fancy systems up her sleeve for her beautiful life and pleasant home, but in fact, it seems that Barb's magic is just faithfully keeping house all the time.  \"Just do it\" as a homemaking method is not very enticing and won't sell magazines, but it's extremely effective.  (But I also wonder if Barb's skills and habits are so deeply ingrained that neither she nor I could tease out and articulate what is really going on day in and day out.  I wonder.)Thought two: I have a stereotype of women Barb's age who see the homemaking I'm doing and say, \"oh, I used to do that. . . \"  It's almost as if retirement finally gives them permission to take shortcuts and buy solutions or hire help in every area of homemaking. Was homemaking just a phase, a season of life? Barb isn't doing that.  She's pretty much carrying on the way she always did, which makes sense to me (please know that I take shortcuts sometimes!).  But what I want to know is what makes a homemaker slack off anyway? What kind of homemaker will I be when I'm retired?  I wonder."},
{"title": "How Barb Keeps House", "date": "Tuesday, March 7, 2017", "text": "Barb first got my attention as a homemaker when she volunteered to bring a plate of Christmas cookies to a little gathering of ladies.  It was a real old-fashioned cookie plate, with at least 6 different kinds of cookies, some exquisite and some straightforward, all delicious.  Barb told me she likes to bake half-batches ahead of the Christmas season so she can keep the cookies in the freezer to pull out for occasions where a cookie plate is called for.I was impressed with her efficiency, enjoyment of the season, and baking.  I probed deeper, betting that here was a homemaker that I could learn from.We each had a little Lenten rose from Barb's yard at our place setting.Barb invited me and Phoebe to her lovely home for lunch and let me write things down and snap some photos, all while we handled a busy toddler.  Barb is an experienced daycare and preschool teacher, as well as a mother and grandmother, so she knew how to wrangle Phoebe.Some highlights of our conversation and my notes:1. Barb enjoys homemaking, which is why she's still doing it all instead of taking shortcuts that I think are typical of retired women I know.  Not only did Barb's mom enjoy entertaining and flowers, but she was willing to share her enjoyment and let Barb do some of the cooking for company as early as 13.  2. Barb writes out menus a week at a time before she goes grocery shopping. She hopes to save money and not waste food.  In fact, she writes down every penny she spends in order to keep track of where her money goes; she's been doing it for years, in fact, and compiling the information each month.  Her husband tallies it year by year.  3.  Clutter is Barb's cleaning priority because she feels better when things are in place and she can find things easily.  However, she also wants her family to feel good about coming home and being themselves, so she prioritized happy kids over a perfectly clean and tidy house.  Barb doesn't have a schedule for cleaning, although she said she likes to clean towards the end of the week and laughingly told me not to look behind doors where she had stashed clutter in advance of my visit. Creative kitchen storage.4. Barb relies on her big freezer a lot.  She always cooks full recipes even though she and her husband are the only ones at home, freezing the extra for times of sickness, hosting guests, or for Sunday dinner. When she was working long hours and parents would complain about not knowing what was for supper and not having time to cook, she would tell them how she filled up her slow cooker before she went to bed and then in the morning, put the food in the fridge to be heated up for supper.Clever to add the decorative towel over the regular handtowel.5.  Barb loves trying new recipes, probably 1 or 2 a week, and is grateful for a husband who enjoys her experiments.  She's attracted to quick and easy recipes that don't require her to buy specialty ingredients.  In the winter, she makes soup at least once a week and in the summer, main dish salads.  6.  Barb has four raised beds where she grows vegetables.  She freezes and cans a lot of food, keeping track of the total yields for two years at a time inside her cupboard door.  Homemaking is a deeply layered set of skills, is it not?  Barb keeps her house running efficiently and graciously, and I'm so glad I had the chance to ask her about it, to try to deconstruct the skills that she's built up over the years and takes for granted. I encourage you, dear readers, to seek out the experts among us - not necessarily the professionals with the degrees to prove it - the competent people whose skills you admire and ask them:  how do you do this?  Why do you do this?  You'll probably get farther than I did without a toddler and her exigencies."},

{"title": "Phoebe Goes to Church in a Sober Dress", "date": "Tuesday, February 7, 2017", "text": "My vision for this dress was a little French girl:  a charcoal grey dress with a bright white Peter Pan collar, worn with black tights and black patent shoes.  In reality, Phoebe looks like a sober little pilgrim, still a darn cute look for a toddler. But I could also call this dress the Goldilocks dress because I had to try three times before I got it right.  First, when I followed the pattern, the enormous 80s puff sleeves were wearing Phoebe.  Then, I recut the sleeves with a sleeve from another pattern and they turned out to be too small for the arm scye of the dress, but I tucked them in there anyway because it was the night before Phoebe's dedication at church.She wore the dress to her dedication and it was all bunchy across the shoulders, which no one noticed because Phoebe herself was charming. We came home after the service with our extended families in tow and had brunch instead of Sunday school.  My husband came up with the idea, and I worked on the menu to make as much ahead as possible.:::tartines composed of homemade French bread or flax-seed bread, with bacon, proscuitto or ham and yogurt cheese, brie, or local cheddar, or tuna cream cheese, plus onion jam and smoked tomato chutney:::roasted potatoes, mushrooms, and onion:::olives:::fresh fruit tray:::caramel pecan sticky buns:::coffee:::mimosasEverything was so delicious and leisurely that several people begged to have brunch together every Sunday.I had decided to salvage the adorable striped buttons off the dress and junk it, but really, Phoebe did look so cute in it, that I found the very last scrap of grey fabric and redid those sleeves a third time.  And finally, finally, I got them reasonably right (still a tad long across the shoulders and through the wrist, but at this point, Phoebe had started shrieking \"no!\" when the dress crossed her line of sight because I had tried it on her so many times).I'm really grateful to have pictures to show some snippets of the good times we had.  Thanks to my sister for snapping some phone photos during the service itself; I hear my sister-in-law also got a short video of Phoebe saying \"amen\" to the congregation, too, and laughing and clapping at them when they started laughing and clapping at her. Oh, Phoebe!"},

{"title": "How I Grocery Shop", "date": "Monday, January 30, 2017", "text": "I'll start by saying we drive a gas-hog SUV because that's what we could pay cash for last summer (it's a 2004) and haul our family with some extras.  Fortunately, we seldom drive our car because we live in walking distance of most of what we need and my husband's firm pays his travel expenses.  But when I realized that my local grocery store would give $.10 off per gallon of gas per $50 spent, I started making some changes to how I shop.I aim to get as close to $50 dollar increments as possible.  This usually means I shop twice or three times a month, $50 each time.  I also shop at the farmers' market twice a week on the walk to school and about every other month, do a large bulk-food shop at Amish stores out in the country. For the grocery store, I keep a running list and start planning a shopping trip when I think I can hit $50 and can do it without kids. I never take my kids grocery shopping.  Never. Even though I look at the store circular and my coupons before I go to the store, I still have to concentrate and make decisions on the spot, and kids would distract me. I only take my kids on short errands when I have a short list and know exactly what I need so I don't have to make decisions with kids milling around me.  That is probably my biggest thrifty tip for shopping! (And I realize not everyone can work their schedule that way, but I'm sure they have their tricks for making the shopping work with kids).I also look at my calendar before I go shopping to see what events are coming up so I know if there's anything I should stock now or seek on sale.  I'm grateful to have a large pantry and freezer space so that I can take advantage of good sales.I carry my grocery list and coupons clipped on a little clipboard I made out of cardboard and a binder clip; I used to get so annoyed with trying to use my hand as a hard surface under my list to cross items off my list. Also, since I am trying to get just over $50, I keep a running total on my list as I put items in the cart, so I'm writing on my list frequently. The clipboard is a wonderful help. Sometimes, I have to put some items back when I get close to $50 because there are some necessary items on my list yet and those other things will just have to wait until next time.I also try to go shopping when I have the energy and time to not only go through the store and checkout, but also to deal with all the putting-away at home.  On a good day, I even get the cloth bags back out to the car trunk.I would love to hear how you grocery shop!  I'm sure we can pick up tips from each other."},
{"title": "A Hat for Me", "date": "Thursday, January 26, 2017", "text": "The color I love to wear currently is navy.  I made myself a navy hat, and just to keep it quirky, I added a stripe of some colorful, lumpy yarn in my stash.  I used this pattern, and it was not too hard, although the top got lumpier than I expected.  When I cast on, I was worried that the hat would not be big enough and so get stretched out a lot when I put it on my head and let the cold and wind get in.  It's big enough, yes, but now I wished it hugged my ears more firmly!  I started this hat at a worship leaders' retreat a few hours away.  There were some other knitters sprinkled through the audience; one of them was in front of me at the beginning of the weekend, also a few inches into a hat on her circular needles.  The next evening, I saw that very hat on her friend's head, complete with trees and beaver knitted in different colors on its crown!  I had only managed to add another inch of ribbing to my hat.  I was amazed at her speed and my slowness - I bet she was a continental knitter (I use the English technique - yarn in right hand).  Another knitter, when I marveled at her speedy continental knitting, told me she manage to switch to continental from English in about a week of concentrated effort.  One of my main gripes with knitting is its slowness.  So maybe I should switch.Also, in the outerwear line, I re-did the fabric scraps and stitching on my black mittens; I used blues and red perle cotton in geometric shapes to ditch the ragamuffin look I had done a few years ago. Navy is edging out the black in my wardrobe, and I love that.All photos courtesy of Genevieve!"},

{"title": "Cornflakes are Mennonite Panko", "date": "Friday, January 20, 2017", "text": "Long before panko hit American grocery stores, we were using crushed cornflakes to give our casseroles and breaded things crunch.  I intend to keep panko on hand, but I just never get around to it; I have cornflakes, I have breadcrumbs, I have other stuff like cornmeal and soda crackers.  Are you a panko keeper?I made a new baked chicken recipe recently because I wanted to have something to go with greens and mac-and-cheese.  I needed that Southern menu ever since my sister told me that's what her friend's mom cooked on New Year's Day.  I usually make mac-and-cheese in the slow cooker as a main dish for a vegetarian meal, but this time I used the stovetop version that Genevieve loves to make. It was an intensely satisfying, comforting menu.  I highly recommend it.Buttermilk Baked Chicken, from Mennonite Country-Style, tweaked a bit by meMelt 1/4 cup butter in 9x13 baking dish.Cut up approximately 3-lb. chicken into 4 serving pieces (I save the neck, back, and wings for stock). Sprinkle with 1/2 tsp. salt and some pepper.Dip in 3/4-1 cup buttermilk or kefir or yogurt thinned with milk.Roll the drippy pieces in 1 cup crushed cornflakes. (To crush cornflakes, I do it the way my mom taught me:  put cornflakes in a long-ish bag, pinch the end of the bag between your waist and the countertop edge, and roll the cornflakes to crumbs with a rolling pin.  How do you do it?) Place pieces in melted butter. Sprinkle with herbs of your choice and some paprika if you like. Cover loosely, either with foil or a baking sheet turned skew.  Bake at 350F for 1 hour, remove covering, flip pieces of chicken, and bake uncovered 20 minutes longer or until chicken tests done when poked with a fork or an instant-read thermometer."},
{"title": "A Clean Room and Bed Pouches", "date": "Friday, January 13, 2017", "text": "The major project over Christmas vacation was a deep-clean of the children's bedroom.  It was not fun. I could not bear to take any \"before\" photos.  It started with my husband banning everyone from the room while he boxed up all the junk and washed and vacuumed and dusted. Then, Ben and Genevieve and I sorted through the contents of the boxes, keeping the good stuff, throwing junk away, and sending other things to the thrift store.  It was not fun.  There were sharp words, tears, and worse (tantrums!). It was not fun. It required all my adult skill to focus on the end goal:  a reasonably clean room that we were not embarrassed to have children or visiting aunties see, and a reasonably tidy room that allowed Genevieve and Ben to work on projects, find their supplies, see their books, and sleep happily. I will say it again:  it was not fun. But now!  Now it's a pleasure to walk into their room and it's not hard for me to say, hey, the clutter is building up, take a few minutes to put things back where they belong. When my husband roared into that room in December, I protested feebly that I try to teach the kids how to clean instead of doing it for them; he retorted that you don't teach drowning kids how to swim, you save the kids and then later teach them how to swim.  Yes.  So wise!  So he saved them, and now we're working again on teaching them how to clean.One of the little problems I solved was a place for the in-bed reading books.  Usually, we cuddle on the living room sofas to read a book aloud at bedtime (currently, The King of the Wind by Marguerite Henry, one of my childhood favorites). But then Genevieve and Ben like to read in a bed a little, too.  They had nowhere to put their books or their book lights.  I whipped up two little pouches.  Ben's is made from an old sturdy workshirt of my husband's; it tucks under his mattress.   Genevieve's is made from some fabric left from her baby nursery curtains, a Waverly print whose colors I adore.  I added ribbon ties to the back so it could be tied on the top rail of her bunk; I sewed some extra lines along the top to lend it sturdiness.Any comments or wisdom on children and messy bedrooms?  I'm always eager to hear how other people manage this."},
{"title": "More Authentic Kimchi", "date": "Tuesday, January 10, 2017", "text": "I've made kimchi before and we did really like it, but I kept on buying the commercial kind at the Asian store because it tasted better.  For reasons this fall that I cannot now remember, I got really determined to make more authentic kimchi. Linda Ly's recipe convinced me that I did really need to buy the Korean pepper, gochugaru (but what I actually got was gochujang, the paste, because that's what my Asian store and the herb shop had). I resist buying specialty ingredients that I only use in one recipe, but this one is totally worth it.Oh man, this kimchi is good! Pungent, garlicky, gingery, spicy but not too. . . we eat it straight out of the jar.   I wish I could remember to get it out and serve it as a kind of relish or salad at meals. Do you eat kimchi?  With what?I also wish I could say kimchi kept our household entirely healthy while everyone else fell to the dreaded stomach bug over Christmas, but no, that is not the case.  But I'm not really eating it to stay healthy - it's just intensely more-ish and the kimchi breath is totally worth it.  I think we're on our third batch since November.Kimchi (modified just slightly from Linda Ly's recipe, linked above)Place in large bowl:2 lbs. Napa cabbage, sliced fine1/4 cup non-iodized saltStir and massage well.  Cover with water.  Stir occasionally for 2 hours.  Volume should be reduced by half and cabbage should be limp.Strain salt-water off cabbage. Rinse and strain again.Add to cabbage in bowl:1/2 lb. daikon radish, julienned1/2 lb. carrots, julienned6 green onions, cut in 1\" pieces4 cloves garlic, minced1\" piece ginger, mincedIn a blender, puree:1 Asian pear, cored and chunked1 small yellow onion, chunked1 cup dechlorinated water1/2 cup Korean chile powder (gochugaru)2 Tbsp. fish sauceStir puree into vegetables.  Stir well (can use your hands if you wear gloves).  Pack into jars or a crock to ferment, leaving at least 2\" headspace.  Weight the vegetables down under the liquid, pressing firmly.  Ly recommends pressing down firmly every day and fermenting for 3-7 days.  I don't always press daily, and I usually ferment a little longer.  Store kimchi in fridge when it's done fermenting.Notes: 1. I did use a Bartlett pear once and didn't notice any difference.2. I halve the water since I'm using the chile paste instead of the powder; well, once I forgot, but I just had more delicious liquid so it seemed fine.3. Use organic ingredients when possible for fermentation because they are more likely to have happy bacteria on/in them already, which assists fermentation.4. On my previous kimchi post, I explain the methods of fermentation much more fully (but used cayenne! wouldn't do that now).  But if you're still confused, please ask.  I think fermentation is a strange process until you've done it a few times and know what to expect.5. Kimchi is not like baking chemistry, so you can probably add or subtract ingredients up and down the line.  We love the flavor of this recipe because it's similar to what I used to buy."},

I have even served them to cautious eaters who liked them.  Falafel is tasty!They are nutritious and relatively cheap and, like a burger, you top them with whatever you have on hand or strikes your fancy.  So far, we've been keeping it Middle Eastern with lettuce and pita, and in the summer, tomatoes and cucumbers.  I've made a sauce of yogurt, tahini, garlic, and parsley sometimes, too.

The soaking chickpeas can absolutely sit longer on the counter if you can't get to them.2. The ground-up falafel mixture can be refrigerated for several days before frying.3.

I knit this vest on regular-length knitting needles and constantly had to push push push to get the volume of stitches to stay on the needles.  So I bought a new, extra-long pair of needles, because, yes, I love this red vest so much that I have started another.  This one is a cloudy blue-grey which should make Phoebe's blue eyes even bluer.For both vests, I bought two 90-yard skeins of Loops & Threads Cozy Wool which is 50% acrylic, 50% wool and comes cheap from Michael's with coupons. Again with the blurry photos.  Because she has work to do!  Lots of work taking apart this place and getting into things and getting things out and strewing things around!"},

To wit, ribs.  I have never made ribs before.  I'm not someone who orders ribs at restaurants and I don't really know the difference between short ribs, spare ribs, beef ribs, and pork ribs.  But I had about five pounds of \"beef ribs\" (that's how the Amish butcher labeled them) in my freezer.I used the Kitchn's recipe and method, recommended by Rebecca.The flavor was fantastic, but (there are so many buts) the ribs were really tough even after 3 hours in the oven.  Furthermore, so much fat and bone went into the trash; I didn't think even my cleaning method could get that fat clean enough for soap and even though my family thought barbecued stock from the bones was funny-cool, I didn't save the bones for stock.  Plus, I used a lot of ingredients to get that fantastic flavor and because of all the stuff in the trash and the toughness of the end product, I'm unwilling to try that again.I did not order ribs again from the butcher, and maybe I'll become one of those people who actively seeks out professional rib joints because it's such a rigamarole at home."},
{"title": "About That Cake", "date": "Monday, October 31, 2016", "text": "I told you that Genevieve made her own birthday cake, and I'm reporting back to say it was delicious and beautiful.She made the cake by her very own self.  I just pointed her towards some good recipes and helped her to get the cakes out of the pans.She had her heart set on a layer cake, even though I cautioned her that layer cakes require some extra skills and patience and that I didn't even attempt a layer cake until I was about 25.  I offered to ice the cake to spare her some frustration, but no, she was firm and confident. There's a section in Mennonite Country-Style about icing a layer cake, so I suggested she read that first. If you are not familiar with this cookbook, a Virginia mother wrote it for her daughters when they left home, to pass on all the cooking hints and helps she thought they would want as they started up their own kitchens.  Then Genevieve chose an icing recipe and got up on a stool for the icing syringe my aunt got in South Africa (what a great reason for a trip:  I need more tips for the icing syringe!).  She tinted the icing, and used two different tips to pipe words and a border.  The icing had picked up chocolate crumbs as she iced the cake:  she shrugged and called it \"cookies-and-cream icing.\"  She scattered candy pearls on top and used the last of the rice paper butterflies. I truly was not in the kitchen while this was going on and she cleaned up everything when she was done.  And when we sliced into it that evening, it was perfectly moist and delicious on top of being pretty.  I am so impressed. Amazed.  Excited to watch her continue to grow and bloom."},

So I got my 17 quarts of applesauce in a morning and then, after it cooked down, I had 3 pints of apple butter the next day. And Phoebe wanted to be tucked up on the sofa with a blanket so she could read.

{"title": "Late Night Limas", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2016", "text": "My dad invited me to pick limas with him at ye olde family farm a few weeks ago and since I could drop Phoebe off with my mom, I gladly went.I was less glad that night at 10pm when I finally finished shelling the buggers and had to blanch and freeze them.  The big kids and my husband all sat around shelling with me after supper.  We took turns picking songs to play on Youtube - that was fun! I picked a 5-gallon bucket (my uncle charged me only $10) and ended up with 13 pints in the freezer.  We'll enjoy succotash and lima bean chowder this winter, and maybe I'll look around for some new lima recipes, too.Now, a word about freezing in glass jars from a reader request a few weeks ago: I use glass jars because I'm trying to use less plastic overall.  I prefer to use wide-mouth canning jars for freezing because they seem to break less frequently than regular-mouth jars, possibly because the shoulders of the regular-mouth jars are too constraining to the food expanding as it freezes. I only put glass jars in the freezer if the contents are room temperature or chilled - putting a jar with hot food in it into the freeze stresses the glass and frequently leads to cracks. I always throw away the contents of jars with cracked glass - so frustrating to waste that food, but much less frustrating and scary than injuring my people with a shard of glass. Another reason I like to use wide-mouth jars is because they stack better and stay stacked; when a stack of jars topples in the freezer, they crash into each other and crack.  Sometimes, if a jar has been rapped too many times by a hard object (metal serving spoon, another jar, the granite counter top), the glass is weakened in spots and then it cracks from a change in temperature, whether in the canning pot or the freezer. I try to leave plenty of headspace - about 2\" - although you wouldn't know it from the lima photo on this post, but let's blame that on a late night and an unwillingness to wash more jars.  The next time I went to the freezer, I nervously examined each jar of frozen limas to see if any had cracked.  Thanks to my canning fairy, they were all fine."},

{"title": "\"What DO You Do all Day, Mommy?\" (warning: long)", "date": "Wednesday, October 5, 2016", "text": "Well, Genevieve, it's not easy to explain, so I thought I'd try to record a typical day. I'm the homemaker, the housekeeper, the calendar-keeper, the cook.  If I'm keeping up with my work, you probably don't notice it because a well-run house is a background of comfort and stability with the possibility for hobbies, projects, and hospitality.  This is hidden work; I'm not bitter about it - I understand because I can't really sum up my homemaking in a quick sentence and I understand why people don't know how to start a conversation with a homemaker at a social hour over drinks (we stick to editing - more straightforward).  But nevertheless, let's not forget what it takes to care for a house and a family.  Of course, this is my version and other people have different styles and goals.Wake up 6am to alarm.  Make coffee, bring paper in, clear stuff off dining room table (I usually do this the evening before). Turn washing machine on (there was a load soaking in there; one load is already clean and wet from the night before).  Go to the basement freezer for English muffins for breakfast.  Set out eggs.  Put away clean dishes in the dish drainer to clear the counter.  Pack Ben's lunch - realize I need to refill the peanut jar and go down to the basement freezer to do that and get a brownie for his lunch. Cast my eye over the 30-lb. bag of potatoes I bought last week to see if I can store potatoes successfully in the basement - feel a rotten potato and quickly dig it out for the compost pile. Get dressed, folding the laundry from the drying rack in our  bedroom. Fry eggs, toast English muffins, slice peaches. Get a cup of coffee and read paper for about 4 minutes.At 7am, wake everybody except Phoebe.  Help everyone assemble breakfasts. Read paper some more.  Dump the bag of peanuts I picked up from my parents' freezer into two trays - put them in hte oven to roast. My husband volunteers to walk the kids to school - he's working from home today, hooray! - and I water the houseplants. Put the next load of laundry in (I sorted out 4 loads yesterday). Make the bed. Phoebe wakes up and starts calling for us - I get her up and change her diaper.  Fry her egg and get her breakfast set up. Keep stirring peanuts and setting timer to remind myself to stir.At 8am, I quickly rush down to the basement to haul up the peanut butter maker - I can't run to the basement with Phoebe unless I put her in the baby carrier and we're going to be on our own the rest of the morning.  At 8:13, the school crew leaves and because Ben was the one who was 3 minutes late, he will do an extra job of 3 minutes in the afternoon.  I write the note to remind myself.  Help Phoebe with her breakfast. Put the final load of laundry in the washer.Phoebe is playing on the kitchen floor, so I set up the peanut butter machine, pour in the still-warm peanuts, and make 2 1/2 quarts of peanut butter.  I get out cookie ingredients to warm up, using the empty peanut butter bowl.Somewhere around 9am, I suit Phoebe up in her rain suit and rain boots (it's muddy) and Phoebe and I head out to the yard.  First I pick up all the black walnuts so Phoebe doesn't get them and stain her clothes.  Then I hang up 4 loads of laundry, working until a squirrel in the tree eats a black walnut directly over my clothesline.  Arghhh!  I dash for a sheet to throw over the wet clothes, but a few things are sprinkled with indelible black walnut dots already. I notice that my husband's white dress shirt has not whitened from its soak in Oxiclean, so I put it in a bucket in the sink with bleach (with a note! so no one splashes bleach around until I get back to it). At 9:50, Phoebe and I repair to the kitchen where I make cookies and she fusses and plays.  While the cookies bake, I clean up the peanut butter machine.  My husband comes down for a snack, and I get to take the machine down to the basement again while he hangs out with Phoebe.  I give Phoebe a banana and a cookie for a snack - a big one because then we get in the car for some errands.  I added my list, return receipts, and a few entertainment options for Phoebe to my purse.  Oh - and before we leave, I change Phoebe's diaper and dress her. We drive to a consignment store where I look for a stroller - I can see in 2 minutes that they don't have what I need.  We drive to Target so I can show them that the online price for Ben's Lego set was $5 less than the in-store price that he paid.  This errand has been on my list for several weeks - feels good to get it down.  Phoebe and I go quickly through the store, shopping for rain boots for Genevieve (too expensive, but cute), hiking boots for the husband (too unsure of his taste), bathroom shelves (a nice one in the right size, but at $129, I can wait and hope for a sale), cloth diapers (not toddler size), and then, yes!  a $3 clock for the big kids' room so they can keep track of time better.We get home at noon, for lunch (leftovers).  At 12:30, as Phoebe plays, I quickly check email and respond to my sister's text about an upcoming vacation.  I shop for cloth diapers online - very confusing.  I put the cookies away.  I answer the door for the Fed-Ex guy. Phoebe and I go back to the yard to pick green beans, jalapenos, and bell peppers.  I also take down the two clean, dry tablecloths which I figure are big targets for the walnut-eaters.  Already there are spots on the one tablecloth! Drat.  I daydream about how to cover the spots. Phoebe lays down on the floor and sucks her thumb - I ask her if she wants to take her nap and she says \"da\" (yes).  I fold the tablecloths, and suddenly, Phoebe trips and falls near the laundry room and roars in pain.  A big goose-egg jumps out on her forehead, turning black and blue immediately.  I call the pediatrician for help, and am reassured that the bump means the skull is not injured, but the black-and-blue could migrate down to her eye in a day or so.  Phoebe lets me put an ice-pack on the bump a little bit.  I change her diaper, read her a story, and plunk her in bed.I return to my computer to edit -  I have a deadline in a few days - and I'm tired, so I drink a cup of oolong tea because it's faster than taking a nap. I work until the big kids come home from school, 3:30, and then it's time to juggle.  I supervise homework, snacks, changing clothes, putting school things away.  Ben does his extra job. I take down the rest of the laundry.  I start making supper.  Phoebe wakes up.  I change her diaper and give her a snack.  I wash the dishes. I keep making supper and drag Genevieve from somewhere to set the table.  After supper at 5:30, Ben washes the dishes (but this is not a linear process - oh no, it takes check-ins and reminders and some help).  My husband has to return to his desk to work. I give Genevieve her piano lesson (not much drama tonight, whew). I run errands to Rite-Aid and the library with Phoebe and Genevieve; Ben wants to go, too, but he is still washing dishes so he has to stay home. When we get home at 7:30, it's time to clean up the toys and give Phoebe a bath.  I put on her pajamas, help her brush her teeth, and read her a story.  When she's in bed at 8pm, the big kids are basically ready for their story, too (Chasing Redbird by Sharon Creech - none of us have read it and we're all enjoying it so far).  Then Ben realizes that he forgot to finish his homework and we have a tense round of tears and natural consequences; he finally agrees that he will try to finish it in the morning (he's usually up early - a morning person).They are finally in bed by 8:45.  I return to my computer to knock out a little more editing.  At 9:30, I watch an episode of Lilies while I work on a freelance sewing project that I am itching to get off my plate.  My husband joins me, and we end up in bed at 11pm. That was long and a little boring to write.  But let it stand on the record!Related posts:  job description for a homemaker, the details of one morning 8 months ago"},

But Cinderella can also keep her feet warm when she's not dressed for a ball. I finished these socks for Genevieve on a drive home from the beach, when the air conditioning in the car was making her cold and she was beyond happy to have toasty feet. I'm embarrassed to say that my Kitchener stitch at the toes was faulty on one sock, because it unraveled somehow after only a few wears.  I darned the toe.  I wish I had made the socks taller, but my lack of experience limits me to following the pattern.  Oh well - I think I have enough yarn left to make a wee pair of socks for Phoebe.  The sisters can go on matching!"},

SUMMER.  Furthermore, I adapted the pie recipe that was recommended to me for my slow cooker because it's summer and the heat index was 104 degrees F today.  I use my slow cooker a lot in the summer - I run the extension cord out through the kitchen window and set the cooker on the table outside. With this pie, I served our very own garden green beans (very proud of that!) with brown butter, and sweet basil ice cream with pine nut pralines for dessert.  Yes, truly.  That supper was the essence of summer for me.Summer Tomato PieLine a 6-quart oval slow cooker with a crust for a 9\" pie - bring it up the sides about 2\".  I don't crimp it and the edges are definitely rustic. Prick bottom of crust with a fork.Turn cooker on High for 30 minutes with lid propped open or cocked.Meanwhile, prepare the filling.Thinly slice 3 medium-to-large tomatoes. Sprinkle evenly with 2 tsp. salt and lay in a colander or other porous container in the sink.  You must draw some of the water out of the tomatoes or your pie will be too soupy.  Allow the tomatoes to drain for at least 10 minutes.  Blot moisture gently with a paper towel or old kitchen towel.After the crust has baked for 30 minutes, carefully (the crock will be hot) layer the filling ingredients below in about 3 layers, ending with cheese.sliced, salted, drained tomatoes3 garlic cloves, minced2 Tbsp. chopped fresh basil1 tsp. dried basil1/2 cup grated nutty cheddar like Dubliner, or freshly grated Parmesan3/4 cup grated mozzarellaThen, dollop 1/4 cup mayonnaise in tiny dollops around the top and gingerly spread it over the top layer of cheese.  Aim to get it distributed as evenly as possible, but don't stress.  It's summer!Put the lid on the cooker (not cocked this time) and keep it on High for 1 1/2 hours.  The crust should be crisp where it shows at the sides, the cheese melted, and some tomato juice bubbling.  Remove the slow cooker lid and keep it on High for 15 minutes to evaporate some juice.  Remove crock from cooking unit and allow pie to set for as much time as you have before you want to eat. The longer it sits, the more it firms up (we ate ours hot about 10 minutes after it was done due to hungry kids, so the second helpings were much easier to serve). Serve warm or room temperature."},

I love this pattern, which Rebecca introduced me to:  a gored skirt with wide pleats, putting thefullness where it looks good.  Unfortunately, my skirt turned out a little big so I sewed belt loops on it and wear the mustard-colored belt with it.  Easier than taking ripping out a pocket and a waistband.

{"title": "Did I Break My Stroller For This?", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2016", "text": "I had onions on my list when I went to market, and the farmer said laconically, \"how manyja want?\"  And he handed me a heavy grocery bag full of seconds.  For free.  I had just canned my way through over a bushel of tomatoes and was not looking to preserve something.  I had never dealt with that many onions, some of which were slightly rotting and most had that black stuff which looks like mildew to me.  But I rarely decline FREE.  \"Do not resist chances: take them like vitamins\" (an internet meme I have pinned to my canning board on Pinterest).I had a stroller full of market purchases, so I hooked the heavy bag onto the clip on the handle and creaked home.  The stroller collapsed on the porch as I struggled it inside - Phoebe was fine.In the chaos of getting the perishables into the fridge, Phoebe found the sack of onions on the floor and took several mouthfuls out of an onion before we noticed.  She eats the bits of onion out of her food and says \"yum\", so I should not have been surprised.  I set aside the nibbled onion with the worst-looking onions.I googled around until I found an easy onion jam to can.  I used this one.  When I tasted the finished jam, I didn't care for the lemon peel in there.  We'll see - sometimes citrus needs some time in the canning jars to taste right to me (for example, marmalade).The jam wasn't done cooking down until around 9pm.  All my equipment was on hand due to the bushel of tomatoes, so I turned on the outside light and canned that jam in my canner on the grill burner (I do really wonder what my neighbor the judge thinks of all my machinations as she sits on her side porch in the evenings). And while I was waiting for the jam to process, I filled up the recently-emptied slow cooker with sliced onions and olive oil to caramelize overnight.  My husband came into the kitchen at 10pm and very nicely got out the other big knife and helped me.  We went to bed with stinging eyes from all those onions, I'm afraid. The next morning I had to cook and stir the caramelized onions with the lid off a few more hours to get them browner and evaporate some liquid. I packaged them up for the freezer.  The only ideas I have for them right now are  a caramelized onion pasta sauce from Moosewood, steak toppings, and French onion soup. And then, my husband looked at the broken stroller and said, oh, that's easy.  He got out his drill and fixed it somehow (Phoebe helped).  I think his drill died a natural death in the process because he told me he found a replacement on ebay. I still have a number of onions to use up - good thing I signed up for chopped onions for all our Labor Day festivities!"},

The half-bushels of seconds tomatoes cost $6 apiece this year.2. The salsa came from a bunch of really ripe tomatoes and peppers that my friend Naomi gave me one Sunday, not from the bushel-and-a-half. 3.

I set goals for canning after taking an inventory of my basement canning shelves this spring.  So these jars are being added to some food left from last year.  The only canned food I try to use up every year is pickles because they seem to get mushy with time.5.  And a dirty little canning secret:  I have been re-using my canning flats.  All the authorities tell you not to do this, but everybody in my mother's generation re-used their flats with no ill effects.  I did it this winter with a few small batches to see how they would hold up because I was awash in used flats.  No poor sealing that I can see or taste.  But of course, you must decide who to listen to and how to keep your family safe: I just wanted you to know what's going on over here."},

{"title": "Lavender Soap This Time", "date": "Thursday, August 11, 2016", "text": "Four years ago, I made soap.  It was good soap and not as difficult as I thought it would be.  So I accumulated more fat in the freezer and finally, just before back-to-back vacations and in the middle of summer canning, I became obsessed with making soap.  I briefly argued with myself about the timing, but the heart wants what the heart wants.  Because I had waited four years, I had to study up on soapmaking all over again. The most helpful instructions came from an article by Amber Moss Ek in the Song issue of Taproot.  The recipe I used came from a library book whose name I have purged from my memory because it recommended adding water to the lye which is dangerously, explosively wrong (I corrected the book in pen in the margin, but still).  Here's a useful mnemonic for this part of soapmaking:  snow falls softly on the pond (slowly add lye to water, never never never the other way around).  I had to wait a while for the lye solution to cool down, so I snapped some other photos, too.The big kids were strictly warned away from the soap-making area and the baby was napping.  I myself made sure to wear glasses, gloves, and old clothes.  All went well, especially the part where I explained to the big kids what a chemical burn would do to their skin if they got too close to the lye.The fat that I had collected was mostly tallow, but also some random globs from other meat.  I found instructions from Esther Shank in Mennonite Country-Style on how to clean fat that has cooking contaminents in it that may prevent the soap from setting properly.  I added the fat to an equivalent amount of water in a large pot and boiled them together for about 10 minutes.  Then I cooled the mixture, refrigerated it, and scooped the cleaned, hardened fat off the top of the \"dirty\" liquid on the bottom.  It must have worked, because my soap set up beautifully.I tried using a plastic tub as a soap mold; unfortunately, I broke it in the process of getting the cake of soap out.  I will do more research about soap molds before I make more soap.  Nineteenth-Century Soap22 oz. tallow15 oz. olive oil14 oz. lard7 oz. lye22.5 oz. water1/4 cup dried lavender flowersI added the lavendar per Amber Moss Ek's instructions.  I ground up the lavender in my spice grinder, an old coffee grinder set aside for non-coffee jobs. After the soap had thickened (\"achieved trace\"), I stirred in the powdered lavender.  I had more lavender flowers than I needed, so I made some sachets on the spot.  And now the soap will cure for 6 weeks in the top shelf of Phoebe's closet.  I'm excited to try it out!"},

The plaid is some that was left from Grandpa's shirt, also in Ben's quilt.  I wanted the eight to look handmade and a little wonky.  I can't explain why; we want what we want! All of this happened in early July and now these tees are faded and probably a bit stained (I don't look too closely).  We are deep into summer."},

This spring, I knew that it needed to go to my cousin April, Aunt Nancy's youngest daughter.  So I told April I had a late birthday present for her, finished the quilt as I said her name to God over the stitches, and then we visited her in Philadelphia.  She was surprised and delighted and in literal need of a blanket.  Furthermore, she loves folky unique style like this for which I am grateful, because I have a fierce love for things that are not traditionally pretty or trendy.

I did not want to spend Phoebe's birthday making food and cleaning house, so I started working ahead more than a week in advance of her birthday.  I planned the light supper menu as soon as I sent out invitations, and that way, I could start planning.  I bought the ice cream probably 2 weeks before her birthday (and hid it in the deep freeze).  I made the cake layers almost a week before, and froze them, triple-wrapped.  The light supper was French lentil salad, homemade French bread, and cream of tomato soup.  The salad was made the day before.  All I needed to do on Phoebe's birthday proper was make bread and soup, assemble the cake, and set the table.  Success!  I still had energy and good humor left for the birthday party!Phoebe loves books, although she generally prefers to look at them herself rather than being read to.  She loves to drop her baby while I'm changing her diaper, making little chuckle-whimpers which is the baby crying, and then I imitate a baby crying which makes her grin all over her face, and when I return the baby to her, she spanks it soundly with her hand to comfort it.  When a phone rings or a timer goes off, she says \"oh! oh! oh!\" in the manner of an alert until we respond - we're not sure if she's trying to say \"phone\" or just going on high alert the way the rest of seem to do when there's beeping.  You see we are so highly entertained by her, and she is just a dear."},

We do not have a kids' play room at our house - we have little stashes of baby toys in most rooms and that's it.  The big kids have some toys in their bedroom and some in the playhouse outside.  That's it.  The rest are in storage and I have renewed determination to rotate toys to keep the fun fresh.  Because I do not want to drown in toys because they're usually ugly, plastic, and a sign of over-consumption. And besides toys, we also have lots of books and the raw materials like tape, paper, cardboard, stuff in the recycling bin, and let us not forget the entertainment of cooking up an edible mess in the kitchen or the almost-helpful mess of cleaning the front porch with the mop and hose or going to the park or playing with the bunny.  You see what I mean?  I have little tolerance for plastic objects made just for children's entertainment.  I want to keep that stuff to a minimum.  Your thoughts?"},

I had put potatoes in the oven on timed bake, then I cooked and buttered some garden green beans from the freezer, and served it all with some pepper cabbage (a vinegar-based coleslaw). Well.  That was an eminently satisfying Sunday dinner, starting from when we opened the front door after church and smelled that beef. Later in the week, I heated up the leftover roast and juice with a sauteed onion.  Then we spooned it over homemade French bread with a slice of cheese and called it French dip.  And I raved all over again.  My family is going to be seeing a lot of this beef because it is easy, tasty, and did I mention it's so easy?Of course, you could fiddle with it and drop some rosemary in the juice, or add barbecue sauce, or maybe use part soy sauce - early in this blog I had great success with a roast in soy sauce."},

And since she was playing with the baby, she gave me carte blanche to pick the fabrics, too.  Fun! I suddenly had an inspiration and asked her if it would be helpful if the bag was on a big elastic that held it in place on her binder. Oh yes!  Fortunately I had some frilly yellow elastic on hand - I thought I might see if I could make some sagging knee socks stay up.  But in the meantime, Genevieve has a sweet little pencil bag that is convenient and much nicer to look at than a filmy, pockmarked plastic bag.   I realized that I haven't been blogging about my kitchen work.  I believe it's mostly because Phoebe is urgently hungry at meals, so I feel pleased to just get food on the table and into her mouth and I don't have much time to photograph anything (I like to put pictures with my posts).  I'm going to try to be more deliberate about that."},

{"title": "On a Snowy Tuesday Morning", "date": "Tuesday, February 9, 2016", "text": "I woke up at 6am and immediately looked out the window and went out to this computer to see if the children had a delay.  There seems to be rain and ice outside, but no delay.  I needed that delay - I wasn't prepared for this school morning. In the kitchen, I whisk together a blueberry coffee cake and as it bakes, I take a shower. I run through morning scenarios as I shower because there are, as you will see, lots of variables. As I dress, I hear the baby starting to fuss and it sounds like she still is sick; she had a fever and a runny nose yesterday evening. It's now 7am and time for the big kids to get up, so as I change Phoebe's diaper (she is crying and definitely feverish so I won't take her on the school walk), I'm exhorting them from the next room over to get up and get going because daddy is sick and sleeping and I need them to be helpful. While I nurse Phoebe on the sofa, the coffee cake timer goes off and she wails as I set her down on the kitchen floor to check the cake.  Back in the oven it goes and back to the sofa for Phoebe and me.  By this time, Ben and Genevieve are struggling downstairs and mostly awake.  Phoebe fusses with her toys in the kitchen as I make coffee, put away the clean dishes in the dish drainer, and plate coffee cake for the big kids and me, pouring milk (a dash of coffee for Genevieve, please).  I stand at the counter eating bites of cake as I start to pack lunches.  I leave the children in the kitchen to fetch some foccacia and brownies from the freezer in the basement; the sidewalk is turning slick and the rain has turned to heavy snow.  In the kitchen, I peel two clementines for the big kids' lunches and urge them to hurry, to clear their breakfast spots. I rouse my husband long enough to ask him if he wants to walk the big kids to school or stay home with the sick baby; he was up until 3am meeting a work deadline and he is fighting a cold himself.  He opts to stay home. It's now 7:30 and Phoebe is very fussy.  I set her up in her high chair and give her a few cheerios.  I mix some yogurt with a squirt of broccoli/pear/peas from a baby food pouch (man, I love that convenience).  I slice more coffee cake, grab my coffee, and sit down at the dining room table with her.  I am surprised by her appetite because she is clearly sick.  I share my coffee cake with her, picking it apart for the cake and blueberries, keeping the nuts on my side.  She is especially fond of the blueberries and picking cheerios off my fork.  I yell up to the big kids to keep dressing because I hear a toy car going across the floor. Phoebe notices the snow outside the dining room window; she is mesmerized.  I clean her up and we stand at the window while I tell her about snow.  I plunk her on the bed next to her daddy, surrounding her with pillows and toys. The big kids are now milling around downstairs - I remind Ben to put socks on and he dashes upstairs again.  We cram into the bathroom for teeth brushing, hair brushing, face washing and of course a fight breaks out; I finish my teeth at the kitchen sink and ignore them.  They put on their snow pants, boots, coats, and put their lunches in their back packs.  Genevieve heads out to feed her rabbit, Ben goes to the front porch to wait, and I race around covering the coffee cake, unplugging the coffee, picking up cheerios off the floor, wiping the high chair again and putting it away, checking one more time if there's a snow delay, etc. etc. We leave for school at 8:20 (this is late), walking a half mile across town.  It's fun, that walk; we chat and I hold Genevieve's bare hand in my mittened one and Ben throws a few snowballs, careful of cars and pedestrians (good boy!). At school, we kiss and hug and I hurry home.  My husband has brought Phoebe out on the sofa to snuggle as she is getting fussy for her morning nap.  He returns to bed and I change her diaper and check her temperature; it's a low-grade fever at this point. She bounces in her johnny-jumper while I blow dry my hair.  As I return my things to the bedroom, Phoebe on my hip, I manage to smash my finger in the catch of the pocket door as I whirl it closed.  I am whimpering, Phoebe is crying.  I sit her down so I can bandage my bloody finger, lamenting my clumsiness. I cuddle Phoebe on the sofa and nurse her again, an extra nursing because she is sick.  She struggles with her stuffy nose.  When she is peaceful, I put her in her crib for her nap. Downstairs, it is 9am and I hurriedly pack my market cart, thankful I made my list yesterday. I put my snow clothes on again and walk down to market.  I fill my cart and walk home.  It is 10am. The market haul; I'm not taking the time to style it for a photo.  I'm not that kind of blogger.The house is quiet.  I hang up my dripping coat, bag up the produce, lay out chick peas and beets to roast later, refrigerate the leftover coffee, and sit down to write this post.I want these details of a fairly ordinary morning at this time in my life.  Let it stand on the record that family life is a lot of work, that I am happy and efficient and busy.  I find times to catch my breath (like this post) and other times I am just exhausted and barely kind to my family.  I also want to remind myself that ordinary family life is consuming right now, even though the general vibe I get in society is that I'm a lightweight, that parenting and housekeeping shouldn't occupy all my time and energy; I don't believe that, but it's tiring to defend myself. The children grow so fast, so I will be with them now and later have outside commitments and paying jobs.  The baby is about to wake up.  I am ravenous."},

{"title": "Thoughts on Feeding the Baby", "date": "Monday, January 18, 2016", "text": "I feed the baby a lot these days.  Eight times a day, whether it's nursing or solids.  My goal is to help Phoebe love to eat to nourish her body, a balance between pleasure and practical fueling.  There are so many ways to be confused and crazy about food choices these days, so my goal clarifies my food decisions for myself and my family.To that end, here are my thoughts and observations on feeding Phoebe.1. We introduce her to every flavor we are eating, with the exception of honey and really hot-spicy food.  My casual research indicates that her digestive system can probably handle any possible botulism spores in honey by now, but I'm going to wait until the recommended 1 year old.  We do not skimp on strongly flavored foods for Phoebe, but we introduce truly picante dishes very slowly, in the way of babies the world over.  Phoebe has eaten vegetable sushi, hot and sour soup, injera, dhal, you name it - whatever we are eating and most of it is food my mom would not touch.working on eating a vegetable sushi roll2.  If she spits out a food, we preserve a neutral face without comment and keep offering it again at that meal or next time it comes to the table.  Back in my really evangelical days, I heard a preacher say that people usually need to hear the gospel seven times before they accept it.  I use that as a joke for food, too.  Granted, my big kids have some real food likes and dislikes, but around here, we try to treat dislikes as \"preferences,\" instead of absolutes.  So when squash comes to the table, Ben is still required to eat some, but he will never choose it for his birthday meal or from a restaurant menu. the rejected pickled beetsIn Phoebe's case, she spit out pickled red beets with vigor the first lunchtime I gave them to her. I don't think she chewed a single one. A week or so later, I served pickled red beets with chicken and dumplings.  I simply put a bit in her mouth without comment (she opens her mouth like a bird for anything from my fork) and she ate it.  And ate more throughout the meal!  I was pleased, but I did not praise her because. . .3. I try very hard not to make my kids' eating about pleasing me.  I focus on nourishing bodies and respecting the people who made or grew the food and honoring the preciousness of enough food when there are people in our world who are hungry.  I never allow them to throw food away unless it's manufactured junk.  If they are truly full and there is food on their plate, possibly another family member will eat it or they can put it in the compost bucket; however, they absolutely cannot have more food at that sitting because I don't want them to be \"too full\" for a vegetable in favor of dessert.  We don't use dessert as a reward - it is part of the meal, although unlike the savory part of the meal, they are not required to have some because dessert is by definition sugary and I see no reason to encourage sugar consumption.Well, I got off track there talking about the baby's meals, because she's not old enough to grasp the concept of wasting food.  It's relevant, though, because this is the long-term goal, so I don't praise her for eating, but just agree with her that the food is delicious or observe that she's done eating.4. I trust her appetite, while guiding her into the pattern of family eating.  A healthy child will eat the food she needs - it's important for people to recognize real hunger and I've seen that children can do that but adults can confuse hunger with boredom, sadness, or habit.  However, it's still easiest to manage family meals if we all eat about the same time, so I gently nudge Phoebe towards our family mealtimes, making sure we eat supper on the early side to accommodate her needs.  Of course she has more snacks throughout the day than the rest of us because her stomach is smaller, but I steer my big kids away from snacks as much as possible and direct their hunger to mealtimes. 5. And we enjoy food!  We sometimes ditch the normal approach and just (wheeee!) eat fries from a drive-through, or get bakery cupcakes after school, or have a bedtime snack, or eat junk food on vacation.  Because for me, personally, it's good to bend the rules I make for myself and be a little mischievous. I don't want to take myself too seriously.I discussed children's eating in this post as well: Thoughts on French Kids Eat EverythingI'd be grateful for your thoughts and comments.  This post is in response to a Sunday school discussion a bunch of parents are having right now.  The young parents invited the more experienced parents to come and share with us - it's life-giving, encouraging, and wonderful."},

So yes, these had to be thrown away and then I figured out my mistake. I also made an entire pair of boots using leopard-print polar fleece (see second photo above).  They do work, although the lesson I learned from making those was to take precise measurements instead of sizing up to account for growth as I usually do for children's clothing.And now Phoebe is snug, with nothing hampering her mobility. Both projects were quite fast (not accounting for my mistakes with the boots) and used very little fabric.  If the winter were colder, I'd probably make some more."},

So a few weeks ago, I  was able to whip up a green patchwork square with a red corner (the color opposite of the red side).  It was so fun!  I limited myself to my small scraps, hence the piecing within the strips where I sometimes stirred in another harmonious fabric.

Even Advent is getting on my nerves this year and I like the concept of waiting and reflection in theory, but in practice, I just want a cozy winter without all the Christmas decorations! and sugar! and glitter! and shopping! and events!  I know some people think winter is boring without Christmas, but I find the revved-up pace of commercial Christmas hard to sustain or enjoy.So, a few days ago, I got out our collection of Christmas music.  We made one batch of Christmas cookies and I let the kids paint them with a simple cookie paint glaze.  We got a Christmas tree (so much different from last year!  I got to choose the tree entirely - it is slim and elegant; Mr. Thrift had to jury-rig the tree stand since last year's behemoth crushed it, so the tree can only stand straight since it's wired to the wall).  I let the kids decorate the tree entirely - they broke two ornaments and fought most of the time.  I have already announced (yelled) that we are not getting a tree next year because it was so unpleasant.  Humph.The big kids had already set up the manger scene by themselves, I had hung the stockings earlier and they are filled.  We ate homemade St. Lucia buns on December 13, and I have Grandma's Christmas bread tucked away in the freezer for Christmas morning. Well, I guess we are getting rather Christmassy around here!"},
{"title": "In Which I Steek", "date": "Friday, December 18, 2015", "text": "I knitted a pair a mittens for Phoebe and there were several problems with them (my fault, not the pattern).  First of all, the weather has been so warm that no one has been wearing winter coats, let alone mittens. But the mittens were just too narrow for Phoebe's hands.  I was keeping the yarn tight as I knit to make the mittens more windproof, but alas, the mittens had little stretch for her hands and she fussed a lot when I tried to jam her fingers beyond the cuffs. If this was a sewing project, I could fix it any number of ways, but I was truly stumped and sad because I thought all my time had been in vain and the mittens would have to go (where?  who could appreciate my hours of labor and also knew a narrow-handed baby? ) and my baby would still have bare hands. Fortunately, global warming kept the weather on my side as I walked the kids back and forth to school little or no wraps and suddenly, in walking, I hit upon a solution!I steeked the mittens. It was staggering to just cut them apart, but I did it because what did I have to lose? I cut off the narrow stockinette tops and then I used my sewing machine to zig-zag the scarily loose edges of the ribbed cuffs.  I attached new mittens made from a fuschia felted wool sweater.  It worked!  I was elated. Phoebe wore her mittens on the chilly walk to school this morning,  Success!  Also, I really enjoyed knitting the i-cord that keeps the pair together."},
{"title": "Patchwork Christmas Stockings", "date": "Monday, December 7, 2015", "text": "We have a new person in the family, and so we needed another Christmas stocking (not that Phoebe is going to get gifts this Christmas - she will only be 8 months old).  To goad myself, I threw the old stockings away last January, with the intention of making new stockings well before this Christmas. I cleverly remembered this goad a few weeks ago. I briefly abandoned stockings entirely, but oh my word that didn't last long because the children consider this A Tradition and furthermore, Ben considers a soft fuzzy stocking A Tradition and he shed tears over his missing stocking.   It is always a mystery what details of family life the children will latch onto as Traditions!I didn't have any fleece left from the previous stockings, nor was it a smart choice because of its stretch.  So I returned to my favorite medium of thrift and creativity: patchwork. After a lot of rumination, I decided to identify the stockings by each person's favorite color.  So the patchwork is mostly red, a little green, and then a few splashes of the person's color.  I chose yellow for Phoebe (\"but Mom, what if she has a different favorite color?!\").  Ben has green, Genevieve has pink, I have turquoise, and my husband has black and as plain as possible.I made the pieces of patchwork, cut them down to the stocking pattern (which I drew, smaller than the previous ones because big stockings are hard to fill in a meaningful, non-junky way).  Then I laid the patchwork stocking on a piece of unbleached canvas and stitched each seam, \"quilting\" it to the canvas.  I slipped in a few pieces of rick-rack on the kids' stockings and a piece of lace on mine, but nothing, no nothing on Mr. Thrift's stocking.  Then I used more plain canvas for the backs.Ben was still severely, vocally, disappointed in his non-soft stocking.  I had to pick up some red double-fold bias tape to finish off the tops and wouldn't you know, when I flew into the tiny crazy sewing shop downtown to buy some, all they had in red double-fold was fleece binding.  Fleece!  I didn't know fleece binding existed!  Ben was placated with the soft top of his stocking, I was relieved, and the stockings are hung with care.  And some of them have delightful lumps in them already."},
{"title": "DIY Baby Toys", "date": "Saturday, December 5, 2015", "text": "There seems to be two extremes of baby toys:  the cheap plastic crap with screaming colors and patterns all over every inch (we have some of these) or the gorgeous handmade toys of natural materials that cost more than my wool coat (we have three of these - all gifts). So I thought I'd try to find my solution with an internet search and some at-home materials.  I actually made these toys a few months ago, but they went immediately into heavy usage and I forgot to blog about them.  That's my project theme these days:  immediate usage and I don't document them.  I'm going to try to remedy that in the next few posts.This is a bottle with half baby oil and half water, plus food coloring.  It's fun to shake it and watch the bubbles foam up and disperse.  The big kids adore this thing.This is a shaker made from a plastic jar cadged from the recycling bin and the random beads and bobs I find on the kids' bedroom floor.  I put a jingle bell in there, too.  I glued the lid shut on both these containers for extra security, but my glue job was a little shoddy so I'm not sure that it's good to let Phoebe put these in her mouth.  She puts everything in her mouth.  So I guess I'm not picky about what the third child is putting in her mouth.This is a cloud softie - I was so surprised to find myself making a stuffed toy!  I never had any desire to make dolls or animals, but this cloud idea with its sleep face and smiley face was pretty fun.  Again, my workmanship was a little shoddy (my approximation of ladder stitch to close up the hole after I stuffed the cloud is, uh, lumpy, and some of the seams on the dangles are coming out).  I put two jingle bells in the middle of the batting scrap stuffing.Phoebe loves these toys.  She also loves bowls, wooden spoons, combs, rags, and paper. It's kind of a game these days to find things around the house that Phoebe can explore with her fingers and mouth."},

So I recently had collard greens and I decided to see if I could use their woody stems to make pesto.  I did whiz the stems first by themselves in the food processor, but then I added walnuts, Parmesan, garlic, salt, a handful of whatever herbs I found in my garden, and olive oil.  Delicious!  Not woody at all. November has been very mild, hence the presence of herbs yet in my garden.  I'm going to experiment with the pesto again and see if the lack of fresh herbs still makes an agreeable pesto."},
{"title": "A Wee Shawl for Phoebe", "date": "Wednesday, November 18, 2015", "text": "I was intrigued by the Larkrise to Candleford shawl I had seen on Soulemama and Ravelry. It looks like a warm hug!  I'm actually watching the Larkrise to Candleford miniseries right now, but I haven't seen anyone wearing the shawl yet. There were some similar patterns on Ravelry, but they were all beyond my abilities or patience to increase said abilities. I boldly struck out on my own and I think it worked (and I wrote the details below in case you want to try, too)!  But Phoebe keeps growing, so I'm not sure how long it will work.How I made the shawl - also called a \"sontag\" in the 1800s(not a \"pattern\" - please, I am not at that level yet!)  I used size 7 needles and medium-weight  (is that called worsted? confusing) wool yarn that I got for a song at the creative reuse shop.I started a dishcloth, which means I cast on 4 stitches.  Knit all 4.  Then slip one, knit one, yarn over, knit the rest of the row.  Then repeat this (which adds a stitch every row while creating a picot edge) until you have 75 stitches.Knit 25.  Keep them on their needle and bind off the next 25.  Leave the last 25 on their needle.  With a third needle, work on one of the wings of 25 stitches.  To continue the picot edge without adding any stitches, slip one, knit one, yarn over, knit two together, knit rest of row. Only do this when you are starting a row with the picot trim, otherwise just knit the whole row across.  When the wing measures four inches, start decreasing: at the picot side, slip one, knit two together, yarn over, knit two together, knit rest of row.  On the plain side, knit two together, knit rest of row. When you get down to 4 stitches, bind off. Repeat process for other wing.  Weave in ends (there will be ends at the beginning of one wing, too, but I can't quite explain the details of how I got the yarn where I wanted it - trust me, it could not have been hard because as it must be obvious by now, I can't handle hard knitting).Sew buttons on the wing tips.  Wrap around baby with the wings going under her arms, to button on the point of the vee at the back.  Adorable and warm."},

{"title": "A Little Tiny Knitted Vest", "date": "Tuesday, November 10, 2015", "text": "So now I am looking for ways to keep the baby warm with materials I have on hand.  And I have been slightly obsessed with knitting!  This may be due to a bout of  tendonitis in my thumb joint (less hand sewing), the relative speed of tiny baby knits, and the convenience of a friendly teacher to call on.I used some yarn I had on hand that I hope has some wool in it to make this little vest.  The idea is to keep Phoebe's core warm without wrestling and shoving her arms into two sets of long sleeves. I used this tutorial, but I cast on 36 stitches and used 20 for the neckline and 8 for each shoulder.  I also did not use the fisherman's rib because I didn't recognize all the methods and I was too impatient to go to my teacher or You-tube; I did a knit-2, purl-2 rib.I was pretty proud of myself for figuring how to segregate the groups of stitches to make the neckline! However, when it was time to sew up the side seams, I realized that the vest was rather narrow for Phoebe's chub.  So I knitted two little panels (I think 12 stitches wide - maybe?  it took me a while to get photos of the vest in action, and I've knitted other things in the meantime) and then added one panel under each arm.  This is only obvious is you take your eyes off the sweet baby face above the vest. More vests coming soon!"},
{"title": "Old-School Cocoa Puff Bars", "date": "Thursday, October 29, 2015", "text": "Once upon a time, I was a student at a very large Mennonite high school.  Later I was a teacher at this same school.  I ate in the cafeteria and those cooks did a pretty good job, better than other school cafeterias I've eaten in (but not as good as Mennonites at home). They served a dessert called cocoa puff bars and I loved them. I can't actually now recall which lunch the bars went with, although I have never forgotten the green beans with the mac and cheese, the flabby pizza, and hot sauce with the Vietnam fried rice. I remembered those bars a month or so ago and suddenly realized: I could make them!  And eat them again!  But alas, a Google search showed me that there are several versions of cocoa puff bars around (one, oddly, with a ganache topping; these are cocoa puffs, people, and they are not gourmet).So I emailed the head cook of this Mennonite school, and she sent me the bulk recipe in pounds.  She said she had to hunt for it in an old file, which makes it sound like cocoa puff bars are no longer on the menu and I feel sorry for the current students. They are super-simple to make and the cocoa puffs give a delicious crunch in the rich peanut-buttery goo.  If you can ignore the questionable nature of the puffs (what, exactly, are they?), these bars are wonderful.I've made these bars twice now, and both times I finished the box by dumping the cocoa puffs into a finished batch of chocolate buckwheat granola with a fierce ironic glee.

I like a single layer of potatoes and onions.  Pop the pan of veggies into a hot oven to roast - maybe in tandem with another oven project? and mix up a half-batch of pizza dough.When the potatoes and onions are tender and brown in spots, let it cool on the counter.  Cover it.  Now you are ready for the morning. I do not refrigerate the potatoes and onions because I'm not worried about anything happening to them and I don't want to make another dish dirty (or make space in the fridge for the big pan). In the morning, turn the oven to preheat to 500.  Slide the potatoes and onions off the baking sheet, sprinkle it with cornmeal, and stretch/pat the dough onto the sheet.  Shingle the potatoes and onions on the dough, slice some cheese (I used Swiss here, but I would also use an aged cheddar or fresh mozzarella) and put it on sparingly.  Bake the pizza at 500 for 12-15 minutes.Perfect served with a side of applesauce and a deep cup of black coffee."},
{"title": "Two Thrifty Cookbooks Inspiring Me Right Now", "date": "Tuesday, October 20, 2015", "text": "I have been inspired by two new cookbooks from the library recently. It so happens that they are both thrifty, although in different ways.The CSA Cookbook: No-Waste Recipes for Cooking Your Way Through a Community Supported Abriculture Box, Farmers' Market, or Backyard Bounty by Linda Ly is a new book (so I can't renew it and I just keep paying the fine because it's a rental fee, a donation to the library - right?).  Ly's parents were first-generation immigrants from Vietnam and they used every scrap of the food they bought. I knew that rhubarb leaves were poisonous, so I guess I extrapolated that to mean that other leaves are not good eating either.  But: Tomato Leaf Pesto and Ginger-Spiced Chicken Soup with Wilted Pepper Leaves (and others!). I have already made her recipes for Chard Stalk Hummus and Kale Stem Pesto.  I didn't care for her specific recipes (she put lemon in the pesto and I like my hummus recipe better), but the concept is brilliant. I definitely will not be composting kale stems again!Ly brings in a number of ethnic cuisine recipes, which makes sense because other cuisines are adept at using parts that we Americans ignore or discard. Chimichurri the Way an Argentine Makes It, for example, and Watermelon Rind Kimchi which has convinced me to seek out a Korean pepper paste at my Asian store.My only pet peeve with this book (and it's not Ly's fault) is that it is a hardcover book which is difficult to wrangle in the kitchen where, ostensibly, a cook would want to have the book in order to use it.  Hey, cookbook publishers, make the cookbooks kitchen-user-friendly, like with a spiral binding or a three-ring binder.  I know the industry tips towards coffee-table book food porn, but I want a practical book.The other cookbook I'm renting is paperback - a bit easier to manage as I cook.  It's Good and Cheap: Eat Well on $4 a Day by Leanne Brown. It grew out of her master's project to make good recipes for people living on SNAP (formerly known as food stamps). I am absolutely fascinated by this book because I deeply desire to get people, especially people with few resources, into the kitchen to cook and eat well.  Brown is attempting to reach a population that could really benefit from kitchen knowledge and cooking. I bump into people like this frequently at my kids' school, although I usually start up conversations with less-dangerous topics than cooking and eating. Her tone is friendly and matter-of-fact and she has an impressive range of recipes and ideas for all kinds of cooks - I picked up several tricks along the way (corn cob broth, frozen melon cubes for a quick sorbet, savory breakfast oatmeal).  Her recipes focus on vegetables with just a bit of meat here and there; I am particularly charmed by the Half-Veggie Burgers, and the Chorizo and White Bean Ragu. I love her suggestions for hot dog toppings.  She divides her recipes into truly useful chapters:  Breakfast, Soup and Salad, Snacks, Sides, &Small Bites, Dinner, Big Batch, Pantry, Drinks & Desserts.  The final chapter of desserts is a tiny chapter and although Brown doesn't preach anywhere that sugar is bad, that tiny chapter is an unmissable statement.Most of the time, Brown explains any fancy ingredients and techniques.  Sometimes, however, she forgets these cooks and accidentally shows her NYC roots.  Her dal recipe specifies black mustard seeds and cumin seeds in addition to other spices; these are not common spices, nor do they have wide application in a number of dishes. There are dhal recipes with more common spices (mine, for example), or she could list a variation with ground spices. A recipe calls for a \"handful of Thai basil\" - this is a rarity unless you have a garden or a fancy (probably urban) grocery store. She doesn't advise what to do with a partial can of coconut milk (I would freeze it in cubes for other recipes) and she generally specifies fresh hot peppers, which have unpredictable heat so you could accidentally make a dish too spicy to consume or burn your fingers and lungs in the process. For a stroganoff, she airily advises cooks to \"ask your butcher\" if you want to use a cut other than chuck. Most cooks don't have a butcher to ask, let alone a novice cook who is overwhelmed simply by the grocery-store display of meat.Both these cookbooks have inspired new dishes in my kitchen, which is nice.  I cook for my family daily which occasionally bogs me down into a rut where I feel like I've cooked everything already. And now that I have told you about these books, I will return them to the library on the walk to school tomorrow.  Possible purchases in my future. . ."},

I sprinkled baking soda in the smelly pail liberally, but it couldn't seem to quell the stench.  Back a generation, moms would keep the dirty diapers in a water/bleach soak.  But I wasn't willing to use bleach that often or risk little white bleach spots on clothes and floors and linens.I found an idea online somewhere for using essential oils to help with the smell.  The only oil I have on hand is tea tree oil.  I knitted a little tag with a long string - it looks like a necklace.  I hang it down inside the diaper pail and sprinkle a few drops of essential oil on it.  It works so well!  All we smell now is tea tree oil, so I'm thinking I want to get a nicer smelling oil.When it's time to wash the diapers, I take the tag off the pail and give the pail a hasty wash.  I usually let it dry outside overnight before I set it back up in the nursery again.  I sprinkle more oil on the knitted tag, and that's that.Other easy methods for deodorizing a diaper pail?"},
{"title": "My Four Lists", "date": "Monday, October 12, 2015", "text": "There are so many details to keep track of in our modern lives, especially for the person who is running a household.  Add multiple people in the household and the details increase exponentially.   I am helped by writing lists (my mother jokes that her mind is written down on post-it notes around the house).  Currently, my system has evolved into four lists on the side of my fridge (made on quarter-sheets of scrap paper).Top left:  grocery list. (verbatim from the list: soy sauce, wax paper, red lentils. . . )  There's a general list of items that I could get at any grocery store; I shop at any local store that fits in with another errand.  On the side, I write items with their specific store, if there's a sale or something (for example, I buy my laundry detergent by refilling containers at a specific store). If there are coupons that go with any item, I clip those to this list.  My market list is a separate sheet of paper because I write a new one before each market trip and carry it with me (and sometimes lose it).  Top right: this is my running list of non-grocery things that I'm keeping an eye out for, whether online or in physical stores. (verbatim from the list: blinds for green bedroom, black trash bags, construction paper. . . )  So, if my husband is running to the hardware store, I glance at that list to see if there's something he can pick up for me; or if I need to hit a minimum at a website to get free shipping, I try to combine purchases. This list is useful for me to decide if I really need something because it slows down my decision-making process and helps me decide how committed I am to that thing:  shopping for it, dragging it home, storing it, cleaning it, maintaining it. . . all that mental weight that I want to remember before I buy something. Bottom right: this is my very sketchy menu plan for the week. (verbatim from the list: honey mustard chicken, brown rice, kale)  See this post for lots and lots of detail about how I plan menus.  And the final list, on the bottom left, if my to-do list for the week. (verbatim from the list: make samosas, start piano lessons, plan washing windows, schedule H&H)  It only includes the extra jobs that I am trying to accomplish in addition to the dailies. These could be cleaning tasks, social obligations, financial tasks, kid reminders, etc.  Sometimes a job reappears on the list for several weeks before I give up and drop it, or just make the time to do it. I am highly motivated to do my jobs because I get to put a checkmark next to an item if I worked on it and I get to cross it out if I completed it.  Seems silly, but that's motivating for me!I'd love to hear what lists you keep to maintain your house and life, or maybe a different way that you run things."},

And when I was done cutting out the pajamas, I had mere scraps left of each flannel.  I was so pleased with that thrift.I gave him three choices for the buttons and he chose his favorite color, green.  I was expecting these pajamas to be big for him, to last another winter at least.

They are not brownies - no chocolate.  No, due to the butterscotch chips and the peanut butter, they are tannies, I say.  My children made the short leap to \"Mary Anne's panties,\" I'm sorry to say (and sorrier to report that I laughed, too; sorry, Mary Anne).I also need to explain something: these are not health food and I'm totally fine with that.  I make random exceptions to my food preferences for local whole foods, and I think it's important for a literal thinker like myself to loosen up sometimes. I could not, you will see below, resist using whole wheat flour so I could justify eating more (they've got fiber!!).Also, this is the first recipe where butterscotch chips totally make sense to me with the buttery, toasty, vanilla flavors.  In the future, I might try chocolate chips or toasted pecans.  I also bought commercial peanut butter because I thought its silky texture was needed here.  I might try homemade peanut butter in the future.  This recipe is a keeper, so I'll be playing around with it for a while.My kids and I had a wonderful time throwing together these tannies one night after supper; the oven heat was cozy, the baby was happy. Genevieve heard Simon & Garfunkel sing \"Silent Night/The 7 O'Clock News\" for the first time and understood the irony and pathos of the mash-up.

Someone's gotta fill Ben's shoes in the kitchen when he's away at school.Actually, what happened was that the farmer offered me a bushel of tomatoes instead of the half-bushel I had ordered.  When I waffled, he laconically mentioned that he'd just throw them away otherwise because they were truly seconds tomatoes and wouldn't last much longer.  That, my friends, is my favorite reason for preserving food:  so it is not wasted in the horribly common way that we Westerners take our food for granted.  So yes, I took the entire bushel.  I had to buy more jars, push other things off my to-do list, and stick some tomatoes in the freezer.There's the tip:  freeze whole tomatoes and then when you defrost them, you can pull the peels off with your fingers in the same manner as if you had blanched them. I set aside 5 pounds to make smoked tomato chutney once I had dealt with the really-almost-rotten tomatoes. And then I looked over at the stove and realized I had another tip to share.  I occasionally buy bunches of mint at market to make iced mint tea.  I keep the mint tied in a bunch, upside down in the hot water.  When it's done steeping, I pull out the bunch, squeezing the liquid out."},

The big kids could care for Phoebe if I needed to pull jars out of the canner or some other time-sensitive thing.  Thanks to the methods in Bringing Up Bébé, Phoebe can be patient with some delays if I had miscalculated my time or her needs.  She is also a pretty predictable napper by now, so I coordinated my projects with those naptimes. Some of the totals below actually represent several days of split-up work, especially the corn, which I froze by just processing a few extra ears every time we had corn for a meal.   I didn't manage to take photos or blog it along the way, but here's the roundup.June:16 pints strawberry freezer jam3 pints strawberry rhubarb jam8 pints sour cherries, frozen7 half-pints maraschino cherriesJuly:7 pints dilly beans7 quarts kosher dills8 pints pizza sauce10 pints blueberries, frozen4 quarts green beans, frozen17 pints pickled red beets6 quarts red beet brineAugust:10 quarts canned peaches6 pints sweet pickle relish6 pints peaches, frozen5 pints peach salsa7 half-pints salted brown butter peach jam (from Preserving by the Pint)4 quarts pears21 pints corn, frozenSeptember:20 quarts whole tomatoes9 pints salsa6 half-pints tomato jam (from Food in Jars)8 quarts pizza sauce2 half-pints chocolate pear jam (from Preserving by the Pint)I ordered some more seconds tomatoes for tomorrow to make tomato soup.  I also will watch for cheap red bell peppers for pimentos, and also seconds apples for sauce.  And then I'll be done!When I look at this list, I realize how experienced I've become as a canner.  Sometimes I wonder why I do this to myself (I mean, yes, there are all the right reasons - local food, thrift, straight-up skills, etc.) but it's just so much work. I know some of my mom friends have time for other things because they are not canning.  I'm not locking myself into canning (see the first sentence of this post), but right now in my life, my satisfaction with the results is worth the time and work.

{"title": "Bringing Up Bébé:  Book Review", "date": "Tuesday, September 1, 2015", "text": "So my husband purchased a Harper’s magazine for his beach reading a few weeks ago.  And there was the author of Bringing Up Bébé, Pamela Druckerman,reflecting on her book.  I had forgottenabout her book – I had never read it, although I read the other Frenchy books: French Kids Eat Everything and French Women Don’t Get Fat.  I found value in both those books, althoughit’s extremely tempting to lump the trio together for scorn and jokes andpro-American sentiment.Then, two of the beach girls mentioned how much they wishedthey had read Bringing Up Bebe whenthey had their own small babies.  Ilooked at my small baby and read the book.  The immediate effect on me was liberation.  I loved the idea of a patient, happy baby anda sane life not dictated by boring baby needs (note: this is not exactly whatDruckerman claims, but rather the conclusion that I drew).  A fellow blogger pointed out a few weeks agothat days with an infant can be long and boring; I instantly felt relief andrecognition when she described that feeling I was trying not to feel.  I am a homebody homemaker and I love being amother, but yes, heaven help me, I need some stimulation besides baby life allday!But, back to BringingUp Bébé: I reviewed my nighttimes with Phoebe – we weren’t doing too badlyand I had assumed in the American way that I had gotten a “good sleeper.”  She had slept from 9pm to 6am a few timessince she was 3 months old, thus proving to me that she could go without milkat night.  So since then, if she fussedin the middle of the night, I would comfort her without offering to nurse her.  Younger babies usually do need milk aroundthe clock, but by 3 months, Druckerman says, babies can sustain their sleep atnight without milk, even if they feel a little hungry, just like kids andadults. In fact, parents should first watch the baby (La Pause, Druckermanjokes) when she starts fussing to see if she’s trying to go back to sleep orwhat; apparently, kids and adults wake up between sleep cycles and putthemselves right back to sleep without even remembering it; that’s the goal forthe babies, to learn that automatic self-soothing right back to sleep.I found this perspective incredibly helpful.  It also rings true with my previousbabies.  And further chapters had moresensible advice on manners, sensory exploration, eating, vacationing, and adultlife.Towards the end ofthe book, I began to try to read between the lines to see what the downfalls ofFrench parenting might be.  Breastfeedingis actively discouraged (mothers can return to “normal” faster). Children seemto spend almost as much time away from their parents as with theirparents.  From a young age, sometimesless than a year old, they go to nursery schools and childcare; the care isexcellent and personal, but the pattern continues of French childrenessentially outsourced to other caregivers, taking week-long field trips inkindergarten and so on.  I’m guessingthis makes for rather distant, formal relationships between parents and children.  The French government also pays for much ofthe schooling, medical care, maternal care, and extras; there are very fewstay-at-home parents in France because the childcare is so easily available.I’m still ruminating on this book, so we’ll see what stayswith me long-term.  For now, here are mytake-aways:1. Give Phoebe some time when she starts fussing so she andI can figure out what’s needed.  Developspatience in her.  La Pause.2. Encourage her to amuse herself with very little, to lether explore her world on her own terms. This is the opposite of Baby Einstein and constant stimulation to speedup development.3. Tell Phoebe what is going on and my reasons for what I’mdoing with her (the French really believe that babies can understand such talkon an intuitive level – it sure makes me feel better about driving the last 10minutes when she’s screaming if I’ve first explained to her that I will nurseher when we get home). 4. Give serious attention to my marriage as the primaryrelationship in our family.  Feel andfeed my status as a beloved wife and lover. My parents were an excellent example of this and their love made for asecure family life.  I’ve been guilty ofattending to the urgent, noisy needs of the kids and feeling grateful if my husbanddoesn’t appear to need me so I can creep away for silence.  Can I be a good mother, partner, and introvert?  We’ll see!"},

I traced a bib Phoebe has. I used a scrap of the clothesline fabric from Genevieve's nightie, backed it with red gingham, and put a scrap of bamboo batting in the middle.  I had purchased bamboo batting to make nursing pads because it is supposed to be super absorbent. I put the fabric layers right sides together with the batting on bottom, sewed them around the edges leaving a hole to turn the whole thing right side out.  Then I topstitched to close the hole and give a neat look (note to self:  put the hole on a straight edge, not a curved edge, for easier closing).  Then, the handwork!I outlined the clouds in blue floss in backstitch, the one embroidery stitch I have memorized.  I love the effect, although the backstitch is not as pretty on the back, so the bib is not really reversible like it would be if I had just used a big-stitch quilting effect in perle cotton.

Check Lebovitz' recipe for helpful cooking instructions - I do use my fingers to flip them as he suggests!

I used a pattern in my stash and modified it to Phoebe's hilarious measurements. Because I didn't think she'd be using these bloomers a lot and because I need any shortcut I can get right now, I did not finish the seam edges and I sewed the elastic directly on the fabric instead of making casings.I don't have any actual photos from the wedding (way too overwhelmed with just keeping my wits about me for all the needs of a nursing mother and baby).  Here are gratuitous photos of Phoebe with my dad.  Our little sweetheart."},

So I sewed together two upholstery samples from the creative reuse store to keep the dry wipes in and  then I keep a water bottle in the diaper bag.  The water bottle is also to refresh the thirsty mama, a handy dual function.  The stiffness of the upholstery envelope is great for finding in the diaper bag, as I'm usually one-handedly feeling for stuff.And yes, some photos of Phoebe herself.  Genevieve took the two of me with Phoebe - I was quite impressed."},

Once the peace was restored and I went out to the sofa where I belonged, she quite handily turned out these delicious bars.The recipe note says that they taste like \"the O'Henry bars\" which I have never eaten or even seen for sale, so I'm assuming that's a rather vintage candy bar and I like the recipe all the more for it. The bars themselves are buttery and crunchy on the bottom with that delicious peanut-butter chocolate layer on top.  They are pretty difficult to cut nicely, especially if you are  sleep-deprived and desperately in need of calories (hangry) from feeding a chubby baby.  Great food to have around the house!Candy Bars - tweaked a bit from Mennonite Country-StyleStir together until thoroughly mixed:2/3 cup melted, salted butter1/4 tsp. salt1 Tbsp. vanilla1/2 cup brown sugar1/2 cup light corn syrup4 cups quick oatsPress mixture in bottom of 9x13 baking pan to form even layer.  Bake at 360 F for 12 minutes.  Set aside to cool.When cool, melt over low heat on stove or in microwave:1 cup semisweet chocolate chipsAdd 1/2 cup coarse or chunky peanut butter.  Stir well.  Pour and spread gently and evenly over bottom oat layer in pan.  Allow to harden in refrigerator.  Cut into small bars - they're rich!  Makes 2-3 dozen small bars.Notes: 1. Genevieve used homemade peanut butter, which is coarsely ground.  I suggested that she could add some chopped peanuts if she wanted to approximate chunky peanut butter.2. I think some or all of the corn syrup could be replaced with honey, although the flavor will change and I'm not sure honey would keep the flexible-yet-firm texture that corn syrup seems to give.  Corn syrup is the standard ingredient of all old candy recipes.  I welcome your thoughts and suggestions here (although I'm not opposed to a bit of corn syrup in homemade recipes because we're not eating much commercially processed food in this house, the problematic source of corn syrup in the American diet).3.  The obligatory baby Phoebe photo.  One week old here, and getting ready for her first bath (she was insulted).  Phoebe is very alert and communicative, so much fun.  Photo by Genevieve."},

I must add that Genevieve was also bit with the cooking bug that same day; she made a lemonade \"sirup\" from my vintage Joy of Cooking.  (Recipe here - Genevieve used a lemon, a lime, and some bottled lemon juice).

{"title": "Cheshire Cat Pajamas to Match", "date": "Tuesday, May 5, 2015", "text": "Rebecca gave me this hilarious vintage fabric she picked up somewhere.  I couldn't imagine what I would use it for - and it was at least 5 yards.  Then Ben asked me to make him summer pajamas (he usually wears something much more abbreviated than pajamas in the summer and nothing I have ever sewed for him), and I proffered the funny cat with their smug smiles and polka dots.  He loved it, and so did Genevieve when she got wind of it, and thus the plan for matching jammies was born.However, I unwittingly chose two tricky patterns for the pajamas.  Ben's pajamas have a unique neckline - just two overlapping facings and no buttons or snaps or anything.  He says it is super comfortable, so I'm glad I persevered with that particular mind puzzle. And the sleeves gave me fits - they looked like puff sleeves when I first put them in and the shirt was much too broad for Ben.  I did some ripping and hacking and the end result is quite fine for pajamas. Genevieve's yoke was terribly confusing to me, also.  Part of it still is:  it has those two funny vintage rhinestone buttons on the lavender part, but then there is an open keyhole that extends down into the bodice below.  Why, I cannot tell, because I don't think it's necessary for getting the top over her head. I didn't have quite enough cat fabric for Genevieve's pajamas, so I took a leisurely wander through a fabric store looking for something that would complement and girl-ify the cat fabric.  I'm very pleased with that lavender (the cats have purple spots - and Genevieve says they are leopards, not cats). I added white rick-rack to the puff sleeves and peter pan collar.  Genevieve will decide if she wants it to rim the yoke and the hems as well.  With such silly fabric, how can there be too much rick-rack?Genevieve's pajamas are pretty enormous on her, but I figure that makes for sleeping comfort and several years of wear.I've never sewed matching anything for my kids and it was so much fun!  And if you think they are willing models on an early school morning just after breakfast, you are wrong: I bribed them with chocolate."},

{"title": "Tweaking Two of My Standard Recipes", "date": "Monday, April 27, 2015", "text": "I do like to mess around with recipes, even my standard recipes I've made for years.  It's one of the perks of my job as a cookbook editor to get ideas from other peoples' recipes and then there's Pinterest, where I collect recipes that I'm curious about (and I do have a board, Recipe Verdicts, where I make notes on my results).In this case, I was thinking of other ways to flavor sticky buns, which I usually make caramel pecan. I decided to see if I could bring in the flavors of cardamom balls, sort of a baklava-type profile.I used my standard sweet roll dough and method (recipe in this post).  When the dough was rolled into a rectangle, I spread it with 3 Tbsp. softened butter.  I sprinkled on 1/4 cup shredded unsweetened coconut, 1 cup finely chopped walnuts, and 1 1/4 tsp. ground cardamom mixed with 1/3 cup brown sugar.  I rolled up the dough and sliced it into rounds.  I placed the rounds in a pan that was buttered with 2 Tbsp. butter with 1/3 cup honey drizzled evenly over it.  I followed the baking method for the recipe I linked to above. Genevieve was very impressed that I was making up a recipe - she thinks this recipe could make me famous, bless her heart.  She was worried that I wasn't writing it down as I went along, so she got a paper and pencil and recorded the measurements and ingredients as I went along (I wasn't really measuring - I was guessing for the sake of her efforts).Her book at breakfast, however, was much more fascinating than the buns.Delicious!  I might try adding a sesame presence next time - either toasted sesame seeds in the dough, or perhaps some tahini spread inside the buns with the other goodies.Then I took Jennifer's raves about Ruth Reichl's cherry pie to heart.  I made my standard sour cherry pie, but I used Ruth Reichl's fabulous crumb topping instead of the traditional pie crumbs I use.  Amazing!  I think I will be trying Ruth Reichl's crumbs on some other fruit pies as well."},

{"title": "Up to Some Mending Tricks", "date": "Wednesday, April 22, 2015", "text": "I was visiting my friend Mary Anne and we got into discussing mending, particularly a tricky zipper job that she wanted to do.  Then she showed me how she can slip a pant leg or sleeve on her sewing machine because of its space under the bobbin case.  I went home (fully loaded with a boppy, clothes, moby wrap, and baby extras she offered me - ah, the generosity of other mothers!) and went straight to my machine to see if I, too, had that handy space.  I do! How has this escaped my notice for 7 years?  What is this called?  Does your machine have it? Of course, sliding a leg or sleeve onto this space means that I can't turn the fabric in all directions to patch a hole, so I use parallel stitching lines to mend.  For a really big hole, I think I would still rip out a side seam so I could really maneuver the problem area under the needle.I slide off the plastic tray to reveal the smaller spaces where I can slide on a pant leg or sleeve.  I hope the photos make up for my lack of vocabulary for these machine parts!But so often, I just want to quickly stitch up a hole and get the clothing back in service - I try to match my mending speed to the children's growth, which means I need to be fast.When I started mending and darning, I was so proud that I took photos of every project.  Now, I mend so often that I rarely stop for a photo. Recently, I mended these black pants for Ben - both knees had small holes.  They are knit pants, what we call \"soft pants\" around here and reserve for wearing at home or to bed, which is my attempt to preserve some dignity in public life. Then I patched a strange hole near the hem of Genevieve's jeans.I also patched a hole in my pajama sleeve that I got one morning as I was tearing (literally) out the back door with a full load of wet laundry to hang before we walked to school.And then there was the loose flap of velcro on my husband's biking shoes, the unraveled seam on one of Ben's slippers, and the loosened stitching on a coat seam.  And I'm not even sure I could guess at how many socks I darned this winter - a lot, I know!  I love mending because it's so much faster than starting a whole garment from scratch."},
{"title": "The Layette: Nursing Cover and More About the Wipes", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2015", "text": "The baby is not here yet, but I am spending all my time in serious preparation (a.k.a., nesting) which is why I have been silent in this space; I haven't even stopped often to take photos for blogging purposes.  I ask myself if I would rather do X with an infant in my arms or in utero, and yes, I would far rather buy socks for Ben, pay bills, clean blinds, bake bread, and such like while the baby is still safely inside. Any time I have a few items on my grocery list, I go shopping; this is efficient only in the sense that the baby could come any minute (my kids' italics).  I'm enjoying myself, really.  I know for a fact that nothing was ready when Genevieve made her surprise appearance (3 1/2 weeks early) and I have an absolute blank about preparations before Ben (I had a toddler running around - I think that accounts for it).I've noticed the young things using nursing covers, and I love this idea for times when I want to stay with the people or the activity, but the baby needs to nurse.  I doubt I will use the cover at home or around familiar people; I doubt I will even use the cover as the baby gets older and we become brisk nursing partners (positive thinking here).  So I didn't fuss much with making this cover.  I used this tutorial.  It said nothing about fabric weight, but I think the gingham I chose is too lightweight because the piece of boning doesn't hold the cover out far enough from my body.  I'm thinking of stitching on some fabric or ric-rac in horizontal rows to give it some more heft.I also did not have the specified D-rings, so I modified the straps to use what I had on hand:  three cute little white buttons, no need to match.Now, after reading AmyK's comment on my previous post about wipes, I decided to alter my system to her practical method.  I bought a cute metal mug at Old Navy - big enough for my fist to fit in, sturdy enough that the children can't break it when I ask them to refill it.  Normally I would sleuth around for a nice vintage or used mug that cost less than $8, but see the first paragraph above re: dramatic surprise any day now.  The vintage tray, a lucky find at a cute shop downtown, is so that water drips don't land on the wooden desk that we're repurposing as a baby changing table.  And here is a photo of my kitchen this morning, as I dared the baby to come while I got several projects going (Rosie said the best way to get a baby to come is to start a multi-step project that the baby can derail).  Left to right: cream cheese pound cake, pancake syrup in the pot just vacated by Scarlet and Grey ice cream base (Jeni's, of course), sourdough crackers, black beans.  Still on the list: pizza cups, bagels, sesame cookies."},

So I was attracted to do-it-yourself Velveeta not because I desperately needed a whole-foods substitute in my kitchen, but because the cookbook I was editing needed it.  And I was game for  testing the recipe because it was odd.  I am drawn to odd recipes, I know this.Turns out, I was just mixing shredded cheddar with milk and gelatin.  Cheese Jello! The recipe was remarkably easy and accurate, but after I went ahead and tested a cookbook mac-and-cheese recipe with the DIY Velveeta, I had a fair amount left over (and the test recipe was a dud - my family and I like my slow cooker mac-and-cheese much better). The flavor of the DIY Velveeta was not plastic-y at all, just a little less sharp than the original cheese.  I can't even remember what all I used it in, trying to use it up. The very last thing was melting it with some salsa, and then adding some cilantro and green onions to make a kind of queso that we poured over baked potatoes.  It was tasty, but I don't think the gelatin aspect helped me in any way in my kitchen. Helped the cookbook, sure, and now my big deadline is past and I have more time to catch up with freezer-filling and sewing before the baby comes.  I think.  It was just at this very time in my first pregnancy that Genevieve was born, catching us entirely off guard."},

I love how all the baby stuff is passed around to the new mamas who pass it on again - seems like the last vestige of the generous support and sharing small communities used to enjoy.  We can be so disconnected and independent of our neighbors and families now, but the way these baby things make the rounds speaks of such practicality and hope to me.I'm cutting up whatever knit fabric I can get my hands on to make wipes.  My original blog post discussing wipes is here, from when Ben was two.  Good grief."},

Blown. What will he say next?!But instead, I'll just say that this Nutmeg Crunch is a keeper and to garnish Ben's comment, it's not even really meant as dessert!I saw Marisa's blog this morning about Nutmeg Crunch.  I hopped over to Team Yogurt and pinned it.  Usually my pins languish a while on Pinterest while I think or forget about them.  No, on the walk home from school, I suddenly had the perfect dessert idea and it was entirely doable in the short interval before supper, on top of pregnancy weariness and homework supervision, because this recipe is so short and quick.For dessert tonight, I put half a home-canned peach in a little dessert dish, dolloped on a little plain yogurt, and topped it all with Nutmeg Crunch.  So perfect - a balance of soft, tart, crunchy, rich, and sweet.  On its own, the Crunch is pretty rich - I wouldn't eat this as granola, but I'm planning to use it as a plain yogurt topping.  And I'm sure we'll repeat the peach/yogurt combo as long as the home-canned peaches hold out.  Oh, I bet the Crunch would be good on applesauce, too!Nutmeg Crunch, adapted just slightly from Team YogurtIn food processor, combine:1 cup rolled oats1 cup unsalted almonds1 1/2 Tbsp. salted butter, room temperature or melted1/4 cup honey1/4 tsp. salt1 tsp. nutmeg, preferably freshly gratedPulse the processor until ingredients are well-mixed in tiny chunks and crumbs.  Scatter the crumbly stuff over a parchment or Silpat-lined baking sheet, making sure the layer is thin and even.  Bake at 325 for 8 minutes.  Stir and toss.  Return to oven and bake again for 7-8 minutes, until starting to brown evenly.  Cool completely before storing in a tightly lidded jar.  Keep at room temperature.Notes:  There's supposed to be an additional ingredient, 1 Tbsp. dark brown sugar, which I overlooked in my supper rush.  I think the Crunch is perfect without it. Also, to be entirely frank, I eyeballed my honey and nutmeg amounts because I hate measuring those things, so it's possible I didn't get the exact measurements listed here.  But still:  so delicious!"},

{"title": "The 3-Gallon Sauerkraut Crock", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2015", "text": "I can't believe it has taken me this long to tell you about my favorite Christmas present:  my dad got me a 3-gallon crock to make sauerkraut and about 8 huge heads of cabbage from my uncle's farm.  Dad definitely gets the dad-of-the-year award for this one!On December 26, Dad dropped off the cabbages and the Amish-made slicer he had borrowed from my uncle for me.  My husband and I shredded and shredded until we had enough cabbage to mostly fill the crock.  He even got out the food processor to see if it was faster than the hand shredder (which looked something like this).  Nope, the shredder was faster; I need to cast around for a shredder to borrow or buy next fall.  I can't recall how many heads of cabbage we used to fill the crock, but I know we gave several heads away to church friends.Then, in four weeks, we tasted the sauerkraut.  It was absolutely delicious, better than any storebought stuff or even my previous batches of homemade.  I think it was better because I used my meat mallet to really pound the cabbage into the crock. In earlier batches, I was using a glass jar for the fermentation, so I was much gentler in the pounding and pushing because the mouth of the jar restricted my movement and also I didn't want to break the jar.  With the crock, I didn't need to add any extra liquid because I so successfully pounded the cabbage that it was covered with its own liquid by the time I put the plate and the heavy water-filled jar on top.So I've been fetching the sauerkraut up to the fridge, a half-gallon jar at a time.  We often eat it just straight, it's so delicious, but I've also done the typical pork-and-sauerkraut, a slaw, and lots of vegetarian Reubens.Next winter, I'm definitely starting the process in the fall so we have all winter to eat our way through the crock; the cool basement preserves it well.  We've got about a half-gallon left yet, but spring is starting to nose its way in, and sauerkraut is winter food in my opinion, so we've got some eating to do."},

I've asked Marisa several canning questions over the years, and she has always been very prompt and helpful.  I love that.I was curious about the flavor of the pickled mushrooms, so we opened a jar after a week. We ate them next to a farmer supper Rebecca told me about:  roasted (or fried) potatoes with baked beans, hard-boiled eggs, and vinegar on top.  So delicious and simple.  I added a green salad, too.And after months of shopping for oil and vinegar cruets in thrift stores, Etsy, eBay and the like, I remembered our local restaurant supply store and found a classic set with a handy holder for $7. I was planning to cover the pouring holes with a plastic bag and rubber band because I was worried that the constant exposure to air would degrade the oil and vinegar.  Pretty ugly, I know, but I couldn't figure out how else to do it. Then my husband watched me knitting (and boy, do I need to write a knitting post!) and suddenly asked why we couldn't pop those little silicone point-protectors on top of the cruets? Genius!  So I took a coupon and went to AC Moore and look at the funny little lids on my cruets!  Four dollars with a coupon, the largest size they had.  I'm very pleased with my functional, nice-looking cruets and my pickled mushrooms.More canning projects to come - I'm still hibernating inside due to the weather and the baby is still inside due to her age.  Let the work fly!"},

They did accept my offer of stopping at AC Moore and each picking out a sheet of stickers (of course we used a coupon). They each have about 25 kids in their class, and I fretted that they would lose steam after making a few cards and not have anything to take to school the morning of the card exchange.  Well, as you can see, they made very charming valentines for each kid in their class, and I insisted on taking photos because I wanted to remember their diligence and sweetness.Ben stuck one of those heart candy stickers on my wool sweater and I went around for several days before I noticed enough to take it off.  Yes, I wear the same sweaters for days in a row, even when I'm not pregnant.Happy: We observed International Ice Cream for Breakfast Day.  The children were happy for obvious reasons.  I think Ben actually put syrup on top of this pile-up after I took the photo.  We didn't have sweets the rest of the day.Funny: We've had lots of snow and cold for weeks now.  The children routinely wear their snow boots and snowball each other on the way to school.  They routinely sled on the ice and snow in our back yard and the park (it's the city kid version of ice skating when the sun melts the top layer of snow but the serious cold keeps it icy).  Once, the snow was even wet enough to pack together a snowman; generally, it's been so cold that the snow is just powder (the high temperature today is supposed to be 12 F).  And the highlight of their day was when I gave them each a carrot for the noses and let them eat it.  Boy, I am stingy about snacks.Real:  This is 29 weeks of pregnancy, dear reader.  Suddenly, my baby belly is big and can only be housed in maternity clothes.  I was wearing the same blue shirt in the blog announcement photos - how far can it stretch?  I'm still feeling pretty good and after a bit of drastic anemia, I'm taking Floradix in addition to everything else and recovering some energy that I thought had evaporated due to the third trimester.photo credit to my husband one morning as I mixed up daily bread after a showerphoto credit to A, in her lovely farmhouse one afternoonI hope you have some late winter happiness, too!  I'm afraid most people are really tired of this deep freeze and the cycle between cold, wind, and snow that we've had.  I'm still enjoying the hibernating, though."},

I served the tomato chutney with a breakfast egg casserole, and it was amazingly perfect.  I am currently hoarding the rest of it (maybe because it's so delicious and I doubt I will have time and energy to can this summer, the Summer of the Baby? or maybe I just hoard home-canned things).We've been eating tomato jam on egg sandwiches and cheese sandwiches with sprouts, but also, memorably, spread on savory scones (this is my scone recipe - subtract the rosemary, raisins, and sugar for savory purposes). In the photo is a basil and manchego scone; that's actual fresh basil leaves that one of the market farmers gave me as he was bundling up a crate of basil.  I was initially stumped about what to do with the fresh basil because my taste buds and ingredients are in winter mode.Here's also a breakfast favorite:  avocado on toast with either red pepper marmalade or tomato jam.  So simple and so delicious!The homemade ketchup is only so-so.  My theory is that it's not sweet enough or that it needs a name change so that when we're not expecting Heinz.  I don't know: red sauce, or savory sauce, or retro something?  I really wish I had made more tomato jam than ketchup.  Now I know!"},

I made bias tape from cute flowered calico and used a zig-zag stitch to catch both sides as I sewed it on.  Now I have five cute baby washcloths for essentially free because all these materials came from my stash. And yes, all those flowers mean that we are having a little girl.  Certain children in this family have needed some time to get used to the idea that this baby is a sister, not a brother.

I still have to remind her not to just dunk dishes, but to actually use the cloth to rub all over.  She also tends to hold dishes at her chest-level instead of down in the water, meaning the dish water runs back her arms and gets on sleeves and countertops (eek - the vast heedless quantities of water!).  At this point, my goal is for her to wash the supper dishes once a week.  And I think I'll start teaching Ben how to dry. . ."},

Everything is so clean!  I've even seen those ladies dusting the shelves.  Their prices are low or reasonable - they have a sharp eye for the valuable stuff and they set it aside in a section, priced accordingly. ironed and tied with a ribbon - all 4 for $.50!!Look, here's the list of things I bought recently at an MCC Gift and Thrift store.  Everything was in perfect condition.  I am very pleased!$2.50 - red linen tablecloth for my dining room table$.50 - set of 4 linen napkins$.35 and $.50 - 2 sweet hankies$1.75 - navy Limited Too cardigan for G for school$.75 - 2 hand-dipped gold tapers$.25 - small glass votive cup$.50 - 2 juice glasses$.75 - 3 wooden hangers$8.19 total (with tax)I stopped by this store because I was driving to someone's house to purchase a stroller system from Craigslist (this one, for the unbelievably low price of $30!!!), so I took the opportunity to stop in a nearby thrift store with my lists in hand. I hate shopping as entertainment, but if I have items on my lists, I combine errands like this all the time.  I keep a groceries/toiletries list, as well as an other things list (currently on it: fabric for class set of birthday napkins, oil & vinegar cruets, regular mouth canning lids).Because I'm the homemaker and I have my finger on the pulse of the household, there are some standard things I look for as well as some ideas I might check into.  All the things shown here were on my mental list.  All of these things are immediately useful and have a place in my house (I usually figure out where I'm keeping something before I bring it home - I no longer buy things for the sole reason that I love them because the love turns to loathing when the things clutter up the house waiting to be used or placed).I think I'm going on and on about this stuff because I've sorted a mountain of baby things from storage as well as helped the children sort their rooms as we switched bedrooms around.  Anyone else share my sentiments?"},
{"title": "Belly Bands are Thrifty", "date": "Thursday, January 22, 2015", "text": "When I was pregnant with my first two babies, I thought you had to wear maternity clothes throughout pregnancy. Makes sense, right?  In the years since, I have seen tidbits here and there about women who make do with non-maternity clothes for a large part of their pregnancy.  I couldn't quite figure out how they did that because wouldn't normal shirts and dresses ride up in the front and did you have to wear stretchy everything?Well, I'm wearing lots of my own non-maternity clothes this pregnancy because I found tutorials online for making belly bands. These belly bands look like a cowl or an infinity scarf made of knit fabric (because it has that elastic stretch that woven fabric does not).  It would be possible to make them by sewing a strip of knit fabric into a circle with one seam, but I chose to follow this tutorial and make them double-thickness. I bought small cuts of knit at my fabric outlet using a coupon very early in my pregnancy with this exact project in mind.  I think I paid less than $5 for all three; by way of comparison, a single band is currently $17 at Motherhood Maternity.I flipped the grey one inside out so you could see the seams - and yes, they are wrinkled from their shove-in-the-drawer-state.I have a dark gray one, shown on me in the photos, plus light gray ribbed, and white.  I was thinking of how a camisole would look peeking out from under my shirt when I chose these colors.  The colors and the bands themselves are working great for me. I'm not wearing any maternity clothes in these photos, taken when I was 21 weeks pregnant (I'm showing much more now at 25 weeks).  The magenta shirt rides up slightly, so the belly band keeps the bottom of my belly covered and also hides the occasional rubber band at my jeans button.  I'm still wearing my regular jeans and most of the time buttoning them without a rubber band - does that mean I wear baggy jeans normally, or that I'm carrying this baby really high, or that I'm just stretching my jeans beyond the point of no return?  Don't know, but I'm comfortable and covered, so I'm happy."},
{"title": "Homemade Marmalade (A Poem)", "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2015", "text": "Part 1:  Obsession. I never really had good marmalade, homemade or otherwise, but only the random store-brand jar I bought back in early married life.  I liked that fluorescent goo, so I was really excited to taste homemade marmalade.Part 2:  Research.  Jam-making is tricky for me.  I decided on Marisa's Three-Citrus Marmalade, despite some worrisome comments on the recipe that using the pith, peels, and seeds for the pectin made the marmalade too bitter or runny or both.  I've had wonderful flavors from Marisa's recipes (but dubious set sometimes - but that is the unreliable nature of jam-making).Part 3:  Hard labor.  Seriously, all that peeling, chopping, supreming, ugh.  Fortunately, I pulled up a stool to the counter to rest my pregnant self while I toiled away.  Boiling and boiling and boiling the marmalade, worrying that it couldn't seem to get itself up to the magical 220 degrees.  I did take a small taste and horrors!  it was so bitter!  I even threw in some more sugar - I could not bear to waste all my time and the organic citrus. I canned it (6 half-pints) and the set was beautifully firm, the way I like it.Part 4:  The Very Happy Poem.  I fretted to everyone about my pretty marmalade that was horribly bitter, but then I decided to just try it on a muffin one snowy morning, that maybe this marmalade wasn't meant to be eaten straight.  And it was wonderful!  How did that happen?  Did I mis-taste the first time?  Did it cure or do something magical in the 36 hours it sat canned in its jars?  I was slathering the marmalade on oatmeal muffins that were not overly sweet (more on those muffins in a later post) and here it is on an angel biscuit which has zero sweetening, but the marmalade is gloriously zingingly tart and sweet together.  I love it (so does my husband, but the children do not).  And when you say \"homemade marmalade,\" you have a rhyming poem, right there.  And then you can have a bite of poetry if you make this marmalade."},
{"title": "Dressing Up a Young Lady", "date": "Monday, January 12, 2015", "text": "Genevieve is 9, and this is an awkward stage to dress because girl clothes don't come in size 9.  Size 8 goes straight to size 10, and often it is not just size 10, but size 10-12.  Clearly someone made a mistake, yes?  Because I have a beautiful tall string-bean and commercial clothes either fit her shoulders while her wrists and knees stick out (size 8), or come down decently over her wrists and knees, but bag and sag off her shoulders and slender torso (size 10).  And this is just for school uniforms and play clothes - try finding something that can be called dressy! Plus, I think it's a tricky balance to strike a sweet, yet not babyish or too adult, look for a girl this age (I cannot bring myself to call her a tween - sorry). I think we might be entering the era of be-resigned-to-a-time-investment-and-take-G-shopping-so-she-can-try-on-clothes. My current method is to run errands alone during the school day, doing my research and thinking ahead of time so I can be in and out of a familiar clothing store in 10 minutes if there are no lines.  I rarely browse in a store because I don't always make good decisions on the fly (thus frustrating the marketing and design of all retail stores - oh darn).So here are my latest solutions for Genevieve's dressy clothes.This is a gored skirt I made for her using a vintage pattern borrowed from Rebecca.Although I measured the girl and read the pattern carefully, the skirt ended up being inches too large at the waist (another rant: trying to fit skirts that stay up on girls whose waist and hips are the same - yes, there is elastic, but I was trying for a slightly dressier, more grown-up look here).I did not remove the waistband and reduce the waistband and seams; I simply sewed the side seam smaller, including the waistband as well, and then I cut off the excess inside. This is considered sloppy sewing, but I thought the repair would be hidden enough.  I added belt loops. Now Genevieve can adjust the waist to fit and hide the seamed waistband behind the belt as well.  Braided belts are fabulous for children because they are full of holes, so you can buckle the belt however tight or loose it needs to be.  I found this belt at a thrift store for $2. Showing a tiny flash of the yellow bias tape I used to finish the hem.Genevieve is also wearing her brown boots, bought from Kohl's in the fall with a coupon, and a red shirt that was passed down to her by a friend.  I used fabric from my stash for this skirt, but I chose carefully so that the skirt goes with several sweaters and shirts that she already has.  And given the length and waistband of this skirt, I hope it lasts for several years.Then Rebecca's Clara passed down a vintage linen shift to Genevieve.  We are using it like a jumper in the winter, and hoping it will be a sleeveless shift in the spring and fall (it's lined with polyester, so I'm not sure she will want to wear it in summer). I had so much fun going through my scarves and things to see how we could style this dress; I didn't buy anything new to go with it.This peasant blouse.  I added a tiny vintage velvet collar  - it's just buttoned around the neck and is much too small for me, but so exquisite I had it tucked in with my scarves. She could wear brown boots and tights with this.  Or black flats and black tights.Long-sleeved cream tee with another of those exquisite collars, this one beaded with seed pearls.  Crazy tights, plus black flats or brown boots.  But of course, she could wear cream tights with black flats.The long-sleeved tee again, this time with this infinity scarf at the neck.Genevieve herself, wearing the shift with a white button-down, crazy tights, and black flats.She is nine years old, so beautiful and funny, and definitely a strawberry blonde in the sunlight."},

I used vintage 1960s Simplicity 4006 again.  I can still, surprisingly, wear these pajamas over my baby belly."},

I buy the mustard seeds in bulk (and I wish I had kept track of the math at the time, but the organic seeds I bought in bulk were cheaper than non-organic at the store).  The mustard seeds keep indefinitely at room temperature in glass jars - very handy in the spice cupboard, I must say. The end result is like a stone-ground, grainy mustard with my cheap stick blender; I got a more powerful stick blender for Christmas, so I'm curious to see if the texture is more uniform on the next batch of mustard. But rustic mustard as pictured here is great, too! I also still buy cheap yellow mustard because I think it does have its place in some recipes.Homemade MustardSoak overnight (I do this in the glass jar I'm planning to keep the mustard in):1 cup mustard seeds, yellow and/or brown3 cups waterIn the morning, drain off water.Add:pinch pepper5 tsp. salt1 cup vinegar (I use white wine vinegar usually)Blend with immersion blender or stand blender.  Presto:  mustard!!  Keeps indefinitely in fridge as long nobody double dips with a dirty spoon."},

He stood in the space of the legendary tree (which left a legendary green carpet of needles behind it that I did not help clean up - hooray for big kids!) and proclaimed that it was too bare and he would be the Christmas tree.  No thanks, I am done with clutter and you'd better hide your toys from my pitching frenzy."},

However, this was a good year, as you will see (this was also the year of my mother's raspberry quilt - still slightly astonishing to me).We made Jennifer's hot chocolate mix for Sunday school teachers and school teachers.  The children helped to measure and mix, then I packaged the mix in bags with a little slip of instructions.  I wrapped the bags in scrap fabric with construction paper holly leaves and curly gold ribbon.  The  children wrote the notes and delivered the bags.  I am grateful for the time teachers invest in their students. . . would be nice to give gifts to all the lovely people who offer their talents and time, come to think of it. Then I made a bag from a failed little girl dress cut from a woman's dress; into the pocket, I slipped a postcard of Christmas greetings (the horse is a joke for the family) and into the bag I slipped a loaf of Grandma's Christmas bread.   I got a lovely, unexpected package in the mail, an absolute treat from one of my blog readers!  It was a pretty pile of fabric and notions, plus four wee stones covered in crochet.  They look so charming sitting in the plant nursery that passes as our living room windowsills.  I've started three baby jade plants from the mother plant, and started three spider plants in water.Finally, my children outdid themselves with homemade gifts.  Ben took a pair of soda tabs that he found to my husband and begged to make a pair of earrings for me.  With Daddy's help, he checked with his aunts for a pair of old earrings to scavenge for parts. Then they spray-painted the tabs metallic blue.  When the earrings were assembled, he put them in a tiny box and we were all so proud and pleased on Christmas morning.  Genevieve gave me a beautiful beaded ring in green and blue, so I dressed in my children's jewelry on Christmas - you can see the earrings and ring in this photo."},
{"title": "A Raspberry Patchwork Quilt for My Mother", "date": "Sunday, December 28, 2014", "text": "This is a long story with lots of photos - it covers the month of December and an entire quilt, and I couldn't bear to leave out the details.  Settle in, if you're still with me. . .My mother sent out some Christmas gift ideas in early December (we usually do, on that side of the family, to be helpful), and then she sent out a separate email begging for a throw quilt to snuggle under.  Dad had gotten her a polyester fleece blanket at Costco that she described as \"slimy.\"  I immediately replied to her that I wanted to make her a quilt - I could see her desire and need so clearly - but that I wasn't a fast quiltmaker, so it might take a while. Meanwhile, my sister was getting ready to purchase a quilt online for Mom, when I emailed my siblings and told them to back off: I was going to make a quilt.  This was December 6.  The next day, I was digging in my cedar chest for some flannel sheets and lo, there was a patchwork quilt top that Mom had given me when she and Dad cleaned out their big house last year to move to a little house.  I had completely forgotten the quilt top, and I have no idea why I didn't store it with the other quilts in an upstairs closet.  Suddenly, I had the daring idea of using this quilt top and finishing a throw quilt for Mom in time for Christmas morning.  Understand, I had never made a quilt quickly and never made a quilt to meet a deadline; I ruminate on quilt designs and colors for a while before I begin, and then the quilt is a background project that I work on leisurely when I feel like it. With supersonic speed, I worked up a color scheme to lend a bit of harmony to the randomness of the patchwork. I decided to employ all three methods of quilting (knotting, hand quilting, and machine quilting) for efficiency. I got myself to the fabric store right quick and bought puffy batting, flannel for a snuggly back, and calico for the binding.  I asked Rebecca for a bit of red wool yarn; her mother delivered hand-spun, hand-dyed wool from their very own sheep.  I actually felt nervous handling such special yarn.First, I used the raspberry wool yarn to knot all the middles of the solid patches and along the border.  Then I used raspberry perle cotton to handquilt in long straight lines through the middles of the 9-patch squares.  Finally, I machine quilted around each block and made my typical \"framing\" lines in the border.  For the machine quilting, I used ecru thread on the top and pink thread in the bobbin to make the machine quilting as subtle as possible, just texture and strength.  I read a helpful article that gave advice on how much quilting a quilt needs; in a heavy quilt that is going to be washed, the quilting strengthens the quilt when it is leaden with water.  I was deliberately making this a heavy, snuggly quilt, and I knew it was going to be washed - I would do the first washing to help the wool ties felt down into little balls (like this). My children are now total champs at keeping secrets.  They kept our baby a secret for weeks without dropping any hints or bursting, and they did the same thing with the quilt secret every time they were around Granny.  photo credits to my husband for all the quilt opening and huggingWell, somehow, I snatched enough time this December to complete the quilt on December 23.  I had to wait for the rain to stop on Christmas morning to take pictures, but then I wrapped it in wrapping paper that Genevieve made and well, it was wonderful.  I rarely have such a special gift to give to a beloved person, especially one they are not expecting.  My mother was totally surprised and happy. You can see it, right?She tells me that the quilt top is from Grandma Weaver's things, but we are both guessing that Grandma did not make the quilt top.  For one thing, the fabric is very old (although still quite sturdy - probably because it was not made into a quilt and used), but also, the piecing work is beautiful and with an eye to regularity that Grandma did not have.So, I'm back to the regular quilting in the background.  Actually, my latest quilt is nearly done after 18 months of on-and-off quilting. I'll be sure to share it here!"},
{"title": "Midwinter Breakfast Buns to Cheer You", "date": "Monday, December 22, 2014", "text": "Rebecca passed on a recipe to me for rugelach fingers, although she said the pastry was difficult to work with and really rich with the extraordinary filling.  So I wondered if could make sweet rolls, using the extraordinary filling.  The flavors here are, to quote Rebecca, \"medieval.\"  Chocolate, spice, citrus, nuts, and dried fruit: no flavor family left behind!The resulting flavor is delicious: deep, dark, exotic, although the ingredients are pretty much pantry staples. I have to confess that my family was not as keen on these buns as I was, but I love them - even better the next day (I'm eating one with a glass of milk as I type). They are wonderful with applesauce or some slices of orange on the side, and deep black coffee.I named these Midwinter Buns, thinking of the poem by Christina Rossetti, usually set to music:        In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,  earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;  snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,  in the bleak midwinter, long ago. Our God, heaven cannot hold him, nor earth sustain;  heaven and earth shall flee away when he comes to reign.  In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed  the Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.  Angels and archangels may have gathered there,  cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;  but his mother only, in her maiden bliss,  worshiped the beloved with a kiss.  What can I give him, poor as I am?  If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;  if I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;  yet what I can I give him:  give my heart.Midwinter Breakfast Buns (cobbled together by me from disparate recipes)In a bread bowl, whisk together well:1 Tbsp. instant yeast1 cup warm milk3 Tbsp. sugar1 tsp. salt2 Tbsp. melted butter or oil1 egg (preferably room temperature)1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour1 Tbsp. gluten (optional - helps keep whole grain dough light)Allow this slurry to set for 15 minutes if you have time or start on the filling.  Otherwise, proceed.By hand, gradually stir in 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, starting up the kneading, ideally using the lesser amount of flour for the most tender buns.  The dough will be sticky.  Knead it into a ball.  Grease the ball and the bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and allow to rise until doubled (this can take a while in the cold midwinter kitchen - you can speed it up with some steamy heat). Make the exotic filling.  Combine and set aside:1 cup finely chopped semisweet chocolate (I threw chocolate chips in the food processor)1 cup walnuts, toasted and cooled, chopped finely3/4 cup raisins or currantsscant 1/2 cup sugar1 Tbsp. ground cinnamonzest of half an orange3 Tbsp. light corn syrup3 Tbsp. salted butter, melted and cooledpinch saltOnce dough is risen, roll it out to roughly 12x9\" rectangle (if the dough is oiled enough, I usually skip flouring the counter here - your call).  Dollop and spread the filling evenly over the dough. Roll up, starting with a long side - I use a wide bench scraper to help.  Use a serrated knife to cut into 1\" slices.  Lay slices cut side down in a greased 9x13 pan.  Cover.  Refrigerate 2-24 hours (very handy to serve for breakfast!).  To bake, remove buns from fridge and uncover at room temperature for 10-15 minutes.  Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes.  Serve warm.Note: to skip the refrigerator rise, allow sliced buns to rise again at room temperature.  Then bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes."},

For the first time, my husband looked at me in apology and embarrassment, and offered to chuck this tree and get a new one. I couldn't bear more money and more mud, so I suggested we just make the best of it.  He fetched the tippy-top of the tree back from the trash, plunked it a cup of water, and wired it back on top of the tree.It looks much better decorated (nothing breakable - just in case) and next year, I am choosing the tree.My husband tells me that next time, he wants to put such a magnificently tall tree in our living room which has actual 11-foot ceilings.  I pointed out that we'll have to get rid of some furniture in that room first.  Makes the Christmas tree seem not worth the bother. . ."},

Yes, the slow cooker is forgiving about cooking times, unlike the oven or the stove which is timed to the minute; however, continuing to cook dishes after they are done (dry beans and stock excepted here) erases any flavors they used to have.  I love it when flavor and ease meet, as they do in this recipe.Slow Cooker Kale and Sausage Stew - originally from a Real Simple magCombine in 6-quart slow cooker:4 cups canned tomatoes - maybe chopped or broken up1 large onion, choppedseveral garlic cloves, chopped roughly1 lb. sausage - bulk or links, whatever flavor you like (Italian? country?)some grinds of pepperNestle 2-3 large potatoes (about 1 1b. total) in mixture. Pile chopped kale on top to fill slow cooker to brim - maybe 7-8 cups chopped, but really, I just use the amount of kale that I have. Put the lid on and cook on low for 6-7 hours (until the potatoes are tender and the sausage is cooked through - might even be just 5 hours, depending on  your slow cooker). Fish out the whole potatoes and put them in a serving dish.  Add 1/3-1/2 cup olive oil and 1/3-1/2 cup warm milk, a bit of salt, and mash well with a potato masher; they should be quite soft, although I don't peel my potatoes, so there are delicious shreds of potato skin throughout.

She chose the striped flannel and, due to that voluminous 80s skirt and ruffle, I had to supplement the stripes with the flowered flannel.  I was thrilled to dig through my pretty stash of woven ribbon for a little piece for the bodice, and it only took a few minutes to hunt out the eyelet lace.  I have already explained my philosophy of (not) matching buttons, and I told Genevieve the button in the middle is a kiss from me. Originally, I thought the nightie was long enough without the ruffle and I was worried about tripping hazards, but Genevieve begged and got her floor-length nightie.  We are both very pleased with the Scandinavian nightie; she barely lets it out of her hands to be washed.  Success!"},

{"title": "My Very Favorite (Easy!) Pizza Crust", "date": "Tuesday, November 18, 2014", "text": "I will make almost any kind of food at home because I'm stubborn like that, but secretly, I do think some food is best made by the professionals.  They've got special equipment or ingredients or knowledge that I would prefer to leave with them.  I'm thinking of sushi, macarons, artisan sourdough bread, croissants, and yes, pizza. I have blogged about homemade pizza a lot over the life of this blog, but it was always second-best to the pizza shop a few blocks away.  This revelation might hurt my thrifty cred, I know, but it's the truth.But I have a new truth!In the past, I saw two routes for homemade pizza dough:  a yeast dough that is like bread, or an artisan dough that requires pizza peels and baking stones. I adore homemade bread, but I don't like that flavor and texture under pizza sauce and cheese.  And I'm not willing to store big single-use items (the peel and stones) for the occasional pizza.My new truth, my third route, is this crust from Smitten Kitchen that I've been making for at least 2 months.  I like that it's not fussy and  I can slap it together in minutes with pantry staples.  When it's time to make pizza, I just have to stretch the dough out into the pans; this stretching does take some getting used to, but it is totally worth it to me when I consider the alternatives.  And the flavor and texture of this crust is amazing!naked doughIf you recall the phenomenon of the no-knead bread from Jim Lahey, this pizza dough borrows his technique of a pinch of yeast and a long setting time (it doesn't rise in the true yeast-bread manner).  Then it is baked in a super-hot oven to give a chewy, non-yeasty crust that definitely reminds me of a pizza shop. . . made homemade with love and whole-wheat flour.  Yesssss!Lazy Pizza Dough, slightly tweaked from Smitten KitchenMix in large lidded bowl:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour1/8 tsp. yeast for a 22 hour rise-time (use 1/4 tsp. for 12 hours and 1/2 tsp. for 6 hours)1 1/2 tsp. salt1 1/4 cups waterMix until craggy dough forms.  May add another Tbsp. water.  Cover tightly and allow to sit at room temperature for the time you chose with the amount of yeast you chose.  Grease two 11x14 rimmed baking sheets (or equivalent) and sprinkle with cornmeal.  Divide dough in half.  Flour it lightly so it doesn't cling so much to your fingers.  Pat/stretch/dangle dough to fill each pan.  I find it helps to \"play piano\" with my fingertips to push it out.  Put on toppings.  Bake in lower racks of oven at 500F for 13-16 minutes.Note:  May refrigerate dough once it has risen.  It can hold this way for 3 days, but set it out at room temperature for 2-3 hours before using.  I have also successfully frozen the dough.Breakfast one morning: spinach and brie and pizza crust.  Amazing."},

I would say I like a medium-strong apple butter with subtle spice and deep flavor.  I've had some apple butter that was more like applesauce because it wasn't cooked down very long - thin and light brown in color - and I've had some apple butter that was so syrupy and black it looked like tar.  I like something in the middle.The blackstrap molasses and balsamic vinegar at the end do not really reveal their presence, but rather amplify and deepen the flavors.  Some apples might have enough complexity on their own and won't need the touch of blackstrap or balsamic at the end. My very favorite way to eat apple butter is dolloped on top of cottage cheese.  Another favorite is on top of sweet potato biscuits.  And then we just use it as a toast spread for any old breakfast because we all love it.Blackstrap Balsamic Apple Butter2 quarts unsweetened applesauce1 1/2 cups sugar2 tsp. ground cinnamon1/4 tsp. ground cloves1/4 tsp. salt1 Tbsp. blackstrap molasses, optional1 Tbsp. best-quality balsamic vinegar, optionalCombine applesauce, sugar, cinnamon, cloves, and salt in a 4-quart slow cooker.  Put the lid on and turn on high for 1 hour.  Remove lid or cock lid so apple butter can cook down.  Stir occasionally, taking care to stir in any darkened edges.  When apple butter is deep chocolately brown and significantly reduced (this is a matter of available time and opinion), use an immersion blender to further puree the mixture.  Taste.  Add optional blackstrap and balsamic, starting with a tablespoon of each and going from there.  May need more sugar, too, depending on your taste and the apples you used.  Store in the fridge for 4 weeks or so, or can pints in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes.  Makes about 3-4 pints, depending how long you cook it down."},
{"title": "Homemade Canned Tomato Soup", "date": "Wednesday, October 29, 2014", "text": "October is my favorite time of year to can. The house can be chilly, so the canning heat is welcome.  The children are at school and while I would probably get them to help me otherwise, it's also so luxurious to focus solely on my project in a quiet house by myself.Plus, the farmers have lots of produce yet and no one else seems to want it, so they practically give it to me.  See this sinkful of organic, local, seconds tomatoes?  I had to convince the farmer to take $2 for them.  He wanted to give them to me.  In August, I would pay $10 or more for tomatoes like these!I decided I didn't have enough tomato soup or ketchup to get through until next fall, so I made a batch of each.  Ketchup recipe is here.  Tomato soup method is below. Thrift at Home Canned Tomato SoupUse 3 parts tomatoes to 1 part onions and 1 part celery.  I usually add a few garlic cloves too.  I usually do at least a dishpan of tomatoes and end up with 9-12 quarts, but this \"recipe\" is made to work with what you have, so the individual jars are seasoned after the veggies are cooked.Once the vegetables are assembled, core tomatoes (no need to peel - big time saver!) and peel onions.  Roughly chop veggies.  Puree in food processor in batches, making sure to mix onions and celery and tomatoes to get a juicy puree.  Pour into stockpot.  Add 2-3 bay leaves. Bring to boil with lid on.  Remove bay leaves.  Puree again with immersion blender.  Ladle into quart jars, leaving at least an inch of headspace because tomatoes really siphon out during canning.  Add 1 tsp. salt and a scant tablespoon sugar to each jar.  Seal by pressure canning at 10 lbs. pressure for 35 minutes. To Make Homemade Tomato Soup:Pour a quart jar of home-canned tomato soup in a saucepan and heat; I do this uncovered to concentrate the soup a bit. Sometimes I add a pinch of dried basil. Meanwhile, make a white sauce.  I do this in my microwave in a big glass measure.  Place 3 Tbsp. butter in glass measure and heat for 1 minute. Whisk.  Add 3 Tbsp. flour.  Whisk.  Heat again for 1 minute.  Whisk.  Add 2 cups milk.  Whisk.  Heat again for 1 minute.  Repeat the heating and whisking until the white sauce is thick. Once you have a hot, thick white sauce and hot tomato soup base, slowly pour the tomato base into the white sauce, whisking.  Do not reverse the order and pour the white sauce into the tomatoes!! Return the soup to the saucepan and heat gently if needed, but do not boil.  Taste to adjust salt or add pepper/basil/sugar according to your taste.  Serve hot with grilled cheese or crackers.Notes: It's not recommended to waterbath tomato soup because it is a low-acid food due to the added celery and onions.You can make the white sauce on the stovetop in the classic way, which involves lots of stirring.  More on the microwave method in this post.   It's a great job for a child.Microwaves vary.  Mine is old and slow, so adjust times accordingly.Sometimes I add a minced mushroom or two and some minced onion to the butter when I'm starting to make the white sauce.  Not usually.  I like my tomato soup pretty classically plain.  That's also why I only add a pinch of basil, no more.I discuss the phenomenon of curdled tomato soup and why you must pour the acid (tomato) into the base (white sauce) in this post."},

But I couldn't decide.  So I stopped, based on the mantra that a dear sister at church explained:  when she's deciding something, she moves from clarity to clarity.  If she doesn't have clarity, she doesn't move.I'm sure most people would apply this idea to much larger decisions, but I have found it incredibly helpful in the dozens of decisions in my path every day. I saw a cast-iron skillet this weekend and I thought of buying it, but I didn't have clarity, so I didn't.  I wanted to try spiritual direction, but after two sessions, I have only murkiness, not clarity, about continuing, so I'm not going to.

Cheap, easy, customizable, delicious.We had the beans in soup plates with more olive oil and salt.  Then there was good sourdough bread (from the market), thin slices of Parmesan, and sliced tomato.  It was so perfectly, elementally balanced.On other Saturdays, I could swap out the fresh tomato for a home-canned tomato in the soup plate, or a wedge of fresh crunchy cabbage or even a dish of dried figs.  Something pickled would be delicious here, or even a bit of prosciutto or salami.The fancy lady even put down her Bible and joined us. More Details on How I Cooked the Beans:I do not buy commercially canned beans.  I put 2 cups dry beans in my slow cooker, add 5-6 cups water, and turn it on low for 4 hours or high for 2 hours (this varies depending on the time I have and the age of the beans - I don't know how old the dry beans are, but I've read that older ones take longer).  Then I let the whole cooker cool until I have time to portion the beans/liquid into jars and freeze them. This is a habitual task in my kitchen, but I see that I have barely blogged about it!  I will try to remedy that.  (Here are simple black beans, starting with dry beans also).These supper beans were a variation on the basic method I just described.  I started with the 2 cups dry pinto beans and water, but also added 3 whole garlic cloves, 1/2 tsp. dried sage, and 2-3 Tbsp. olive oil.  A few hours later, I stirred the beans and added some salt.  At the table, we added more salt, pepper, and more olive oil.  The simplicity of the beans meant that they were a great base for whatever accompaniments I had on hand.  It's lovely to mop up the salty bean juices and olive oil with bread."},

She adores making little films of her life, filled with kid jokes, inappropriate noises, and strange blurry angles. Any time they use the phones inappropriately (usually when specifically told to put the phone away, bringing it to the table, or playing on it instead of doing chores), my husband and I confiscate the phones.  One child had a phone removed for three weeks.  That child is a much better listener after that loss of privilege!No need to buy DS systems or other electronics for kids like their friends and cousins have!  The children love controlling their own little cell phones.  It's a very thrifty way to let kids interact with screens!What access do your children have to screens and their own personal electronics?  I'm sure this only gets complicated as they get older.

I puree mine pretty well, but there will be an occasional seed floating through the ketchup.  I'll trade that for the efficiency of the food processor any day.Note:  All slow cookers vary, which is why I say \"low or high\" with \"lid removed or cocked.\"  If you've never tried to reduce liquids in your slow cooker before, you're going to have to pay attention the first time.   The ketchup will not scorch - that's the beauty of a slow cooker over the stovetop  method.Note: Clear Jel is usually approved for canning.  Cornstarch and flour are not approved for use in canning (although there are some people who feel comfortable canning with them).  Do not decrease the processing time.  Alternately, you could simply refrigerate the ketchup."},

My family doesn't have a prayer corner.  We sometimes read a Bible story book and sing together after supper. We usually pray before meals. Every night, I lay my hands on my children and bless them at bedtime.  And that's it.  We could benefit from some more spiritual practices, for sure.The Little Oratory is quite encouraging for Catholics.  There is Leila's friendly, commonsense tone speaking directly to the reader (it's written in second person, \"you\").  I love the details of beeswax polish on page 33 and the actual order of the objects in the prayer corner on page 27.  I think I need to start a prayer intention journal, such as the one described on page 44.I'm impressed with the clear (to this Mennonite) explanations of theology and the underpinnings for the little oratory.  Leila and her co-author, David Clayton, do not take the easy way of assuming that all their readers understand the need and genesis for a little oratory.  They go back to the essentials of a relationship with God and start from there. An editorial quibble: I am not fond of the generic examples using \"he\" and \"mankind\" as I think this kind of language forms our ideas about who we are.  If a singular pronoun must be used, I would prefer to switch back and forth between genders and use \"people\" instead of \"mankind.\"I am a major fan of Leila's blog, Like Mother, Like Daughter.  I love the natural warmth and frank talk over there.  It's so hopeful to be cheered on by someone who admits she doesn't know what to do with a weedy yard or a dark kitchen or a house to clean.  There's the same cheering-on in The Little Oratory.  I'm sure Catholic readers will find it quite a blessing."},

I'll try to report on the progress.Ben has just started piano with me, and I have started a very successful new policy for screen time.  However many minutes of piano they practice, that's how many minutes they get to spend on the computer on a parent-approved site or activity.  This is a great motivational tool because they have no other regular screen time - it happens by chance or parental tolerance.I have some freelance work, so I've been telling the kids to babysit themselves in the afternoon for one totwo hours while I edit.  They may only interrupt me in an emergency.  It's rather rocky yet, but we're persevering.  I also bought a laptop so I can sit under a tree at the pool and work while they swim.  Setting up this laptop makes me feel confused and old (Windows 8, sigh).  I persevere.Sweet siblings occasionally.Typical wrestling.Recently I've started having the kids do the Friday cleaning (dusting/vacuuming) and then the bathroom cleaning on Saturday by themselves.  I work on other cleaning projects and occasionally check on their progress.  It's been wonderful!  They don't clean very thoroughly because they are still learning, but I'm more interested in developing their work ethic right now than the actual results.  Occasionally I re-teach a specific job or make them go back and do a shoddy job over again, but mostly I just accept a kid-cleaned house because I didn't have to do it all by myself.  Wow, I love this stage!I didn't do a day-by-day schedule, but I did put a wipe-off sheet on the fridge with the weekly events and extras.  I'm just feeling my way into this summer, and so far, we are really enjoying the break from the school schedule."},
{"title": "A Sailor Dress for Vacation Bible School", "date": "Tuesday, June 17, 2014", "text": "I adore all things nautical, but it can so easily veer into kitsch and irony because I've got no legitimate claim on seagoing gear.  My husband and I have been discussing what it means to wear clothes ironically because one of our friends told him he saw me around town in my 50s housewife dress.  Due to the way guys miss clothing details, I'm not even sure what dress he was referring to (related, as I went to market this morning, a random man muttered \"nice dress\" as he walked by - Genevieve wrinkled her nose \"you're not wearing a dress!\"  I was wearing a skirt and tank top.  Honestly. Men.). After a bunch of fascinating discussions with my husband, I think I figured out that I don't wear my clothes ironically (the opposite meaning of their original intent).  I'm not a hipster wearing vintage.  If I wear old styles, it's because I think the style is lovely as it was originally intended.  However, I don't dress in a period costume - meaning, I wear my modern sandals with my vintage dress and I'm not going to wear a hat or carry a little matching purse.So when I started planning this dress for Genevieve, I wanted to simply reference the nautical colors.  Everything came from my stash and as far as I recall, it was all passed on to me free.  I borrowed the pattern from Rebecca.I love how the sailor dress turned out, although I confess that collar gave me fits and lots of seam ripping.  I used a poly-cotton blend for the collar which does make it lay nicely.  The dress body is a vintage seersucker plaid.  It has no closures, only a detachable dickey.Underneath are white bloomers with red hem stitching, made from a knit polo shirt of Daddy's (the one that came out of the closet with a moth hole).  By carefully lining up the pattern, I used the shirt hem as the bloomers hem.Genevieve wasn't totally thrilled with the dress - I think we'll be collaborating more from now on - but she was pleased with all the compliments she got and she also suggested the red ric-rac to tie back her hair. She's not objecting to wearing the dress to vacation Bible school with sandals.  She's carrying my great-aunt's Bible in its flowered case stuffed with pens, highlighters, and paper - all her own idea and so quaintly old-ladyish."},
{"title": "I Love Wood Smoke", "date": "Sunday, June 15, 2014", "text": "We went camping for the sake of the children.  They loved it.  The adults were charmed by their love, but rather overwhelmed by the amount of stuff camping requires as well as the relentless rain.  Lest you pity us, we were in a rough little cabin in a campground, not a tent in the wilderness.  There was running water nearby - lots of it in the stream, from the sky, and yes, importantly, in the bath house.I am writing this blog post while sniffing my camping sweatshirt - I am loathe to wash the scent of wood smoke out of it.My notes from last time were really useful.More notes and menus for next time:1. Tea lights in pint jars are lovely for atmosphere, especially on rainy days, but don't give out much light.2. An extra bowl and an extra serving spoon are helpful.3. Mug for every person, not just adults, because hot drinks are nice in chilly weather.  Must have hot drinks like hot chocolate and hot tea in addition to coffee.4. Whatever vessel is used over the fire will be covered in black soot - good to borrow from camping friends or else get a dedicated pot from a thrift store.  Used my own cast iron frying pan, of course, and took along an old grate from a grill.5.  Cold cereal and granola are a great camping breakfast because it's easy to be crabby in the morning when you're hungry in an unfamiliar space and trying to start a fire and then cook over the fire.  Much better to move those delicious cooked breakfasts to another meal (see frittata below) and just get everyone fed.6. An extra bag is helpful - this time it was used for the abundant dirty, wet clothes.7.  Chop and slice the onions at home so there's no need to take the big chef knife.  I only took a paring knife and a cutting board, which also doubled as a trivet.Menus:kielbasa on sticks over firebuns/ketchup/mustardpopcorn (made at home)mushroom/Swiss/onion fritatta (ended up scrambling that because the fire was too hot and the eggs were getting too dark on the bottom)baked beans (home canned)grilled asparagus over the fires'moresfried fish (filets dipped in cornmeal and Old Bay) - squeeze of lemonfoil packets in the coals with potatoes, onions, olive oil, s&p (note:  triple-wrap the foil!!)grilled asparagus over the fires'moreshummusdaily breadcarrotspopcorns'moresboth breakfasts:junky cereal that the kids chose rapturously in the discount grocery storegranolayogurt/milkstrawberriescoffee in the percolator (this was the only appliance we brought along; well, we brought our in-laws' camp stove, too, out of fear of the rain, but managed to cook almost entirely over the fire)extra snacks:  spicy peanuts, chocolate chip oatmeal peanut butter cookies (made at home), applesAlso interesting to observe:  we gave the children each $3 at the beginning of the vacation and told them not to ask us for treats, that they could control that money and buy their own treats at the camp store.  My, how they obsessed over the money!  Sometimes they appeared to make plans, and other times it was sheer impulse.  They spent it down to the last penny (Tootsie Rolls cost $.01) with lots of drama and junk along the way.  Ben finally got his wish to stick a dollar bill in a soda machine.  I truly hope that is not the highlight of his camping experience."},
{"title": "Rice & Beans Bowl", "date": "Tuesday, June 10, 2014", "text": "The \"bowl\" concept is an ingenious way to reframe dinner.  Start with a rather plain, starchy base (rice and beans or noodles), and each person adds toppings to customize, whatever you have on hand.  Kind of like a taco salad concept. Or sometimes, I pour hot stock over the top and we go in an Asian direction, like that always-delicious pho.Our latest version of rice and beans is very popular.  Our current favorite toppings are garden spinach, guacamole with lemon and scallions, spicy homemade salsa, cilantro, and grated smoked cheese. I thought I'd tell you how I make the tasty beans.Thrift at Home Black BeansCook some dry black beans in twice as much water in slow cooker on low or high until soft.  Depending on the age of the beans, this could take 2-5 hours.  You can soak them ahead of time if you remember.  The average amount of dry beans I use is 2 cups.  Once they're soft, they can sit in their liquid for hours until you need them.  May divide into containers with the liquid and freeze.In a heavy pan (I use my cast iron Dutch oven), saute an onion in at least a tablespoon or more bacon grease or another fat. Add these seasonings as it's sauteeing (I guessed on the measurements, but at least it gives you some idea of ratio):  1 1/2  tsp. dried oregano, 1 tsp. chili powder, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1 tsp. salt, 2 tsp. sugar, some ground black pepper.  Turn down the heat and pour in the beans WITH their liquid.  Use a potato masher to mash roughly - I guess I aim to crush about half the beans. Now let the whole business simmer uncovered until the liquid is reduced.  Taste occasionally and add more oregano, cumin, or chili powder, but do not add more salt until the very end because the beans are getting concentrated and it's easy to oversalt at this point. We like to add hot sauce to our individual taste at the table. Cook the beans down as soupy or dry as you like them or as much time as you have.  Can be made ahead and set aside at room temperature for hours.  Serve hot or room temperature over hot rice. Leftovers freeze beautifully."},
{"title": "Bags from Upholstery Samples", "date": "Monday, June 9, 2014", "text": "My husband brought home a pile of beautiful upholstery samples from the interior decorator at his firm.  She gets new ones each year, so the old ones go the trash (sigh), to a maker like me, or (thankfully) to the local creative reuse store. On a tip from A, I made one square into a sleeve for my coupons (fold in half, sew up one short and one long side) and made another sleeve for a pair of sunglasses.  Because these are upholstery samples, they are sturdy and somewhat stiff and the edges are finished.  So fast and easy to work with!Then I needed an evening bag for a treat at our local opera house.  My friend took me to a show her fiance didn't care to see. I used 4 shiny upholstery squares to mimic the popular zippered clutch - it's nothing but a rectangle with a zipper on a long side, folded in half to carry.  I lined it with some odd geometric knit scraps that I found in my stash (from a bag of odds and ends my aunt gave me, I think).I made the tassel from the scraps of leftover upholstery.  I hope you can see the colors - three shades of coppery brown and one of lavender.  I topstitched the joining seams of the squares and the zipper so they would lay nicely.  I used all regular settings on my machine and no pins - simply held things firmly in place as I sewed (you could use binder clips or clothespins).  I'm very pleased with this clutch!All evening clutch photos by Genevieve! We slipped down to the beach for a day already this summer, and I planned this next bag as I tried, yet again, to carry and conceal my legal tender in my bathing suit and pocket-less yoga skirt.  Silly!  But sometimes it takes a while to hatch just the right solution, right?So, I made this bag the right size to carry my cash, credit card, and phone when I run up to the boardwalk to fetch fries, milkshakes, pizza, and whatnot.  The loop is elastic so it stays on my wrist by itself as I haul all these things back to our umbrella while fending off seagulls.  I'll put the bag to the test next time we go the beach, but I'm pretty sure it will fit the bill. So far, these upholstery samples are proving to be very helpful!  Our local creative reuse store has samples like this for very cheap, and most interior decorators will be throwing out scads of these every year."},
{"title": "Up on the Ladder", "date": "Friday, June 6, 2014", "text": "One of the areas my husband and I choose to be thrifty is painting.  We do all our own painting, inside and out.  If you have a fixer-upper house, you have to decide how to maximize your dollars and your time.  I know painting is time-consuming, but we need to save our money for plumbers and electricians and other skilled people with specialized tools and licenses. The way we save time is by ignoring some of the shabby paint!Of course, we did have to acquire some painting equipment over the years, but this has easily paid for itself as we have used our own time instead of hiring painters. We also buy quality paint (Benjamin Moore) from a local store with wonderfully helpful, knowledgeable staff (locals, email me for my recommendation if you want).  It's not worth it to me to have cheaper paint, especially coupled with the hit-or-miss customer service you get at a big box store. For example, I've been painting exterior surfaces recently, and I was asking the local paint store guys for advice on how to paint my Victorian porch railing with its terrible-to-access curls.  We talked about custom spray paint, paint mitts, sponges, and a dab-dab (I bought a dab-dab for $1.89 and it works somewhat better than a paintbrush and isn't splaying out bristles). Over the years, I have picked up lots of professional tips and practices from them.So when I get down off the ladder (soon! the porch floor is the last hurdle!), I will have some sewing projects to show you and some thoughts on food preservation."},

Then I tinted some Italian meringue green and experimented with piping it.  The blank spot is for the 6 candle (re-used, of course).It worked pretty well, although the lines softened after several hours. What did not work was my vintage cake cover.  It was too small!  Which led to a strange contraption on my counter involving my dishpan and several dishtowels.  Fortunately, Ben loved his cake, and it tasted good, so everyone was happy.I was even happier when I bought a cake stand and dome.  The dome is actually acrylic because I like its shape and I was nervous about a large, fragile glass cover. I'm planning to use the cake stand for more than just cakes, and I want the children to be able to use it, too. (The cake stand debuted on Mother's Day with the poppyseed violet cake, when I realized I wanted to tell you about piping Italian meringue.)There were presents, too, and quite special that his sister thought of him and bought him gifts with her own money. It's a joy to have a big boy in the house!"},

I wasn't expecting them to take that long, but I had allowed enough time for a long rest before carving, so they simply had a shorter rest. I made a quick pan gravy thickened with milk and flour, with an extra sprinkle of poultry herbs and pepper. The leftover carcasses and shreds are simmering into stock in my Crockpot down cellar, to be canned tomorrow.The cake was delicious, but it cost me some swear words.  I made it the day before, and I didn't slice the layers horizontally because they were so fragile, but then the custard blobbed out the edges and the whipped cream frosting was quite soft, so the whole thing looked pudgy at the bottom.  I shut it up in the fridge and resolved to make it into a trifle with frozen raspberries early Sunday morning if I needed to.  Well, it held up, so we decorated it with violets and my husband took photos.The violets are fading and the dandelions have gone to seed.  I'm so pleased with the ways we enjoyed violets this year."},

(Stuffed these in my scrap boxes, where my daughter pounced on them and started using them as bags until I pointed out that things were falling out the holes.  She pinned the holes closed.  Hello, Grandma Weaver!)Exhibit C:  SlippersFirst I used this pattern and made a horrible, strange slipper with pretty fabric and a red leather bottom (no photo - couldn't bear to look at it).  Then I used this tutorial, scavenging the red leather soles from the first failure.  These slippers do not match and need some tweaks (thicker cushioning on the sole, 2 layers of fabric on the upper), but I see possibilities here.  Genevieve has claimed them for her own.  I offered to cut them down and remake them for her, but she insists on pinning them to her size with pink plastic clothespins. In the meantime, I found a pair of Goody Bon Bon slippers on ebay that I love - so whimsical, cushy, and pretty. My husband was commenting on how I wear these slippers with irony and I had to ponder that (out loud, of course) for a while, until I understood that, yes, I am wearing them ironically.  I think they're fun, but they're definitely a joke for me, and I am definitely channeling an ageing Southern belle with a whispery sweet voice and a cool shadowy house with tall ferns at the shuttered windows.In all of this, I kept asking myself why I was pursuing these projects instead of buying ready-made things. It's because I like solving the problem, figuring things out on my own, and experimenting.  Sewing is really a hobby for me.  There are times when I sew for thrifty reasons, but the thrift is largely a side benefit, and the real reason is my deep satisfaction and pleasure when I sew something just right.  Stay tuned for a happy lot of \"just rights\" coming up!"},

A little graphic jab.I put the monogram upside down so it would show up in the opening, but also because I thought it looked like a cool flower shape.  Now I'm not so sure.  I did mention my thinking on the hang tag, so hopefully the customers won't think I'm illiterate.And these hotpads are in my etsy shop.  I really love looking at all these colors.  Might have to do some more patchwork with solids.  It's so classic and modern at the same time, undated the way printed fabric seems to be. I did most of the hand sewing on these on the bus ride for Ben's field trip.  How soothing to have a bit of handwork in a day of wildly excited kindergartners."},

I also finished the hem with hem lace for no other reason than that I have vintage notions and the desire to sit out in the spring sunshine next to the tulips and whipstitch the hem.Her hair is tied back with the same pale pink satin ribbon that I used on the back ties.

{"title": "How I Coupon", "date": "Thursday, April 10, 2014", "text": "I go by my father-in-law's guiding coupon principle:  it's only a good coupon bargain if you were going to buy that item anyway.Ergo, I clip coupons for things I am likely to buy.  I am not brand-loyal to mass-produced things because there's rarely a locally-produced alternative, so I just try to get the best bargain.  We try to eat local food, and there aren't usually coupons for that.The only sorting I do is keeping food and non-food coupons separate.  I keep my time on coupons to a minimum.  Most of the coupons I clip actually expire before I use them, but sometimes I hit a big deal with coupons, so I don't mind clipping and keeping them just in case.Every day on the school walk, we pass a national chain drugstore on the way.  It's very convenient, although I do use a small local pharmacy (also 2 blocks away) when we have prescriptions.   So I watch the store circular and match up coupons to its store sales for toiletries.For example, recently there was a sale on Tom's items at 2 for $8 and then you got a $2 store gift certificate. I had a $2 coupon for Tom's. I bought a deodorant and two bars of soap for $6, minus the store gift certificate, which brings it to a $2 deodorant and two $1 bars of soap.I also bought Tresemme 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner and hairspray, a brand I have never used.  I bought it because there was a sale, a coupon, and a store gift certificate, bringing my total cost to $1. To put it simply, I paid $4.54 for a Tom's deodorant, 2 bars of Tom's soap, Tresemme shampoo/conditioner, and Tresemme hairspray. I think that's a great deal!The store gift certificates, totaling $5 from both purchases, will be used to buy things that don't go on sale very often.Most stores have their weekly sale flyer/circular online.  However, I also get the \"guts\" (as my dad says) of the Sunday newspaper from my parents.  They aren't interested in the coupons and circulars, and I'm not interested in the so-called \"news.\"  We've had this arrangement for several years now.Talk to me about how you coupon, please."},

I found a handsome J. Crew silk tie at a consignment shop for $5 - it's not easy to find nice children's ties.  I had already cut apart one of his daddy's ties to sew down for him, but I keep bypassing it for other projects.All these ties were taking up valuable sock-and-underwear-drawer space.  I actually started shopping for one of those little tie hangers, but suddenly got cold feet about spending the money. I confess that my thrift goes by spells, and that is okay with me.  We live pretty frugally, but it's not rigidly enclosed by a budget. In this case, I decided to see if I could mimic the features of a tie hanger:  soft surface to grip the ties and let them dangle without wrinkles.I used a cheap-o wire hanger and made a little rectangle from old flannel and scraps of batting.  I enclosed the hanger in it, sewed down the seam and then covered the raw edge with a scrap of bias tape.  Done!  It does exactly what I want it to, and I used what I had on hand. And here is Genevieve on Sunday afternoon.  A rare treat:  she told me I could do whatever I wanted to with her hair that morning.  So I made rainbow braids and enjoyed looking at her all day long.This follows on the heels of a mysterious flu that she had for almost two weeks, one of the reasons my blogging slowed down.

{"title": "A Pretty Party", "date": "Sunday, April 6, 2014", "text": "I planned my own birthday party modeled on one I had attended a few years ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed myself.I invited a diverse group of girlfriends for a late afternoon party and told them to bring a $15-20 gift along, something that they liked to do to relax or treat themselves.  Not a present for me, but a present to trade.And I had prepared early spring treats to eat - thinking of light, pretty food that also had zest and (because it's me) a touch of the unexpected. I also did not want to be stressed out by the food or have high-maintenance recipes.  In the end, my menu met my goals!I made the biscuits, ham, dill cream, curried chickpeas, and cake several days ahead of time.  I used this recipe for the ambrosia, and toasted the coconut and pecans a few days prior to the party. I also cut out the little bread rounds for the cucumber sandwiches and put them in the freezer. Not much left to do on the party day!For the gifts, we put our place cards in a bag, pulled out a name, and received her gift. I loved how there were gifts at the birthday party without undue attention put on the birthday girl.  Of course we all had to explain our gifts, and that was so interesting to hear what each of us was currently relaxing with.A word about the cake:  I made the Italian Cream Cake from Vintage Cakes.  It was fabulous and enormous and I did not reduce the sugar (good choice) nor did I sub in some whole grain flour (probably also a good choice).  It was a lot of work.  I will most definitely check this book out of the library again, which means I am flirting with marrying (buying) this book.A word about the pretty factor:  I was terribly excited to pull out all my pretty linens, dishes, and baubles to decorate with.  I even turned to Pinterest for some inspiration. Well, that was a mistake. My best inspiration came from Anna at Pleasant View Schoolhouse.  She sticks to a theme of some sort and uses pretty objects from around her house with some fresh flowers.  That's what I did.My theme was \"spring pretty\", although I basically just made it up on the day of the party. I borrowed the snack sets from Rebecca's mother, a fancy-dancy punch bowl from Rebecca, and the cake stand and cover from my friend Sue.The daffodils I bought did not open and, in fact, withered before they opened.  There were gallons of punch left over, should have hosted a baby shower or something.  My birthday was perfectly wonderful and this party was one of the reasons."},

You can go now, Winter.I made myself a pair of flannel pajamas.  I love the birdie flannel, but JoAnn's didn't have enough for both shirt and pants, so I used aqua houndstooth flannel for the pants.  With a little orange-flowered ribbon tag.  I used black grosgrain ribbon, free from the fabric outlet with my last purchase, to finish the hems, trim the pockets, and make a drawstring. I loved how these little black buttons complemented the flannel, but I needed one more button.  I decided to simply add another pretty button - why on earth do all 5 buttons need to match?  They all look good together, and suddenly, I see a middle ground between seeking matched buttons and mismatching buttons for the hobo/boho look. Since I'm practically middle-aged, I've noticed I really go for the middle ground on every issue.I also made my husband a pair of boring grey pajama pants and fleece leopard print lounge pants for myself.  Too boring to photograph and too private to model.And here is Christy getting me back on track with my wool socks.  She's an excellent, patient teacher and I've never seen anyone knit as fast as she can.When I get past the heel, I'm going straight back to Christy's house to drink tea again and let her coach me through the next steps.  The best way to knit!"},
{"title": "How I Refuse Plastic Bags", "date": "Monday, March 24, 2014", "text": "When the idea for this post first occurred to me, I thought it was silly and trivial.  But it has taken me years to perfect the skill of getting out of a store without a plastic bag!So many cashiers want to be generous and helpful when they insist I take a plastic bag, so I want to be nice in return.  And very, very firm.  Consequently, I decided to write this post to share the actual lines I use when I refuse plastic bags. Look, I'm not morally opposed to plastic.  There are useful plastic items in my home.  But I am opposed to the thoughtless use of plastic when there are easy ways to avoid it.  Plastic is petroleum-based.  It doesn't biodegrade.  It gives off harmful chemicals. My normal approach when I'm shopping is to say hi to the cashier and as soon as he/she touches the item I'm buying, I say clearly, \"I don't need a bag.\" Clear diction is important because I'm introducing a new idea into the standard shopper/cashier interaction. Most of the time, this line works, especially if I am obviously holding a cloth bag.However. . .1.  To the market standholder looking at my cloth bag of lettuce dripping water:\"It's just water - it'll dry. I really don't want a plastic bag, thank you.\"2.  To the cashier who is bagging my groceries in my cloth bags and wants to put my dish soap in a separate plastic bag:\"I really don't want a plastic bag.  It won't leak.  If it does, I'll take the blame.  Thank you for taking such care with my groceries.\"3.  To the cashier without a bagger:\"I brought my own bags - I'm happy to do the bagging.\"4.  To the cashier who starts to explain all the ways he/she reuses the plastic bags at home so that I will understand the golden opportunity I am refusing:\"I have way more plastic bags at home than I can use.  I'm overflowing with plastic bags.\"If the cashier keeps going, I will extend myself and say,\"I'm trying to cut down on the amount of plastic I use.\"5. To the thrift store cashier who looks nervously at the pile of purchases I want to carry in my arms:\"I've got a bag in the car.\"6. To the cashier who absentmindedly put my items in a plastic bag already,\"I really don't want a bag.  Will you be able to use this one again? [as I remove my items from the bag and push the bag back towards the cashier]  If the cashier seems to be scooting the (barely used!) bag towards a trash can, I will scoop it up and say,\"I'm sorry - I didn't realize you were going to throw it away; I'll take it home and use it.\"I'll leave you with this anecdote:  my husband bought a pair of shoes at the mall recently.  I was standing nearby as he paid for them.  I was keeping the puppies (children) under control.  My husband clearly told the cashier he didn't need a bag - it was one shoe box and we knew we were walking the puppies directly out to the car and going home. At the very end of the transaction, just as he was about to hand the shoe box to my husband, the cashier suddenly threw the box in a store bag, muttering \"just in case.\"  We were dumbfounded.  We collected the bag in silence and walked away. Then we began to giggle and invent the scenarios to go with \"just in case\" the whole way out to the car.  Probably there was a bug in the box - the bag could keep it in.  Probably the roof would fall in.  Maybe the cashier earned commission on the bags he issued.  Or maybe he was just using the bag instead of a \"paid\" sticker and was worried that we would lose our receipt between the cash register and the door. There are rare occasions when it's just easier to take the bag - I'm really not a preacher or a perfectionist.Do you have more stock answers (or pet peeves) to add to the bag issue?"},

{"title": "Homemade Tomato Soup That Doesn't Curdle", "date": "Monday, March 17, 2014", "text": "I have made a lot of cream of tomato soup to get to this recipe:4 cups hot tomato soup basepoured into1 cup hot white sauceThese are some versions that I tried:- hot, thickened tomatoes poured into cold milk (curdled)- hot thickened tomatoes poured into hot milk (curdled)- cold milk added to hot, thickened tomatoes (no note written down, but I bet it curdled)Then, my friend Jan told me that the acid (tomato) and base (milk) must be similar amounts, and the acid must be added to the base.However, I was not fond of the pale pink tomato soup that resulted from so much milk added.  Rebecca started messing around in her lab (kitchen) and reporting results.  I started independent testing to verify her results in my lab (kitchen), with the results verified by a consumer panel (family). Look, if tomato soup curdles, it's still tasty.  It's just that the milk turns into sticky little curds and the soup looks freckled, not creamy.  I've never actually thrown out a test batches, just grumbled my way through it.Last summer, following Rebecca's method, I made and canned tomato soup base.  It's tomatoes cooked with onions, celery, and salt, and then pureed. (Right, Rebecca?  I can't find anything I wrote down anywhere, so I'm going on my paltry memory)To make tomato soup, I simply heat a quart jar of this tomato soup base while I'm making a white sauce in a saucepan. 1-2 Tbsp. butter, melted (maybe a little mushroom or onion in here if you like), with 1-2 Tbsp. flour whisked in and then cooked together until bubbly.  1 cup warm milk whisked in and whisk whisk whisk over medium-low heat until it steams and thickens.I usually prefer straightforward cream of tomato soup, but you can add some basil or other herbs, a little cooked rice, or, as mentioned above, something like mushrooms, onions, garlic, or celery in the white sauce.Serve with crackers, grilled cheese sandwiches, or cheese quesadillas.Just to muddy the research, how do you make homemade cream of tomato soup?"},
{"title": "Patching Little Boys' Pants", "date": "Friday, March 14, 2014", "text": "My friend Christy asked me to show her how to patch little boys' pants. How often do we get to share our skills and methods with our friends, beyond sharing recipes?  This was so enjoyable.  While our kids ran around together, Christy and I sat down at my machine and I showed her what I do.  There are other ways to patch pants, mostly considered more \"correct\" than my method, but my foundation for this casual tutorial is that I have been patching pants into longevity for several years now.This is what I showed Christy:I unpick the side seam of the holey pant leg so I can fit the holey area under my sewing machine needle.  I put a rectangle cut from flannel or other soft fabric under the hole, wrong side of pants.  I stitch it down, being sure to stitch through the hole a few times.  Then, on top of the hole, I put a patch that will be visible when the pants are on the child.  Sometimes I use a pinking shears or a tight zig-zag stitch on the raw edges.  I stitch the patch down in some manner, again being sure to go over top of the hole at least once, connecting the weak places to the strong new fabric. Then, I sew up the side seam that I unpicked.  Done!The way Christy attached the underneath patch gave me an idea for a holey knee in Ben's jeans.  I used navy thread and just sewed back and forth in somewhat horizontal lines, attaching a denim patch that was under the hole.  I love this look!  I will definitely use this for adult pants.Sunday on top, playtime on bottom (lunch on shirt)I also tried another idea on these jeans.  They had two flat-fell seams on each leg (most pants have at least one regular seam). It's not worth my time to tediously unpick a flat-fell seam!  So, instead, to reduce the bagginess and get to the holey knees, I just cut out the interior leg seams in a big U!  After I patched the knees, I sewed up the seams like normal, not flat-felling them.Next up:  a visit to Christy's house so she can tutor and coax me through the socks I started knitting 2 years ago.  Hooray for friends with skills!"},

They love this little task. When there are small pieces of wet laundry or wet gloves, I lay them on the top of the radiator so the wetness evaporates right next to the plants.  In fact, I air-dry most of our laundry on drying racks to try to keep a comfortable humidity in the house.So far, my plants are looking really good!  Genevieve planted some dill seeds in December, which I thought were probably too old to sprout, but dang if those little seeds don't keep stubbornly growing!  I had told her they were her responsibility, but she has totally forgotten about them and I, for sheer joy of green, growing babies, have been watering them and turning their pot so they grow up straighter. I recall how my houseplants suffered through previous winters, and I'm pleased to see mine looking so healthy right now.

So I treated it by pulling out all the fabric in my stash that had flowers and/or white in it, all the fabric that said \"spring!\" to me, and I made clothespin bags.  Because even though I have been known to hang laundry outside on a winter's day, surely spring is best for drying laundry outside.  It may be in the 20s yet today, but the air smells like spring and I am so excited.I had 11 wooden hangers, so I made 11 bags.  I have no plans to make more at this point - should I add \"Ltd.\" to each title the way car manufacturers do?I loved this project more than any sewing I have ever done.  I used pretty odds and ends that I saved with no idea what on earth I would do with them - pieces of lace, scraps of bias tape, frayed doilies, stained dresser scarves, and bits of pretty fabric.Long-time readers will recognize fabric in the bags from my shirtdress, Genevieve's green dress, Genevieve's nightie, and this apron. Before I make something to sell, I always make one for myself and use it well.  I like household goods that are pretty as well as hard-working.  This is my clothespin bag, made several weeks ago.  I might pick off the yellow appliques - I'm still undecided if I like them.  Also, I experimented with covering a wire hanger with ribbon to use instead of wooden hangers because wire hangers are so plentiful.  Well, it cannot hold its shape under the weight of my 2.5 pounds of clothespins! So I bought 11 wooden hangers, and I need to dig out a stronger hanger for my own bag - it's just that I've been so busy treating my spring fever by sewing these bags and working on a large freelance project in addition to normal life that all kinds of details have dropped off my radar.One night, just before bed, Genevieve laid out all the bags on the floor and sorted them in order of her most favorite to least favorite.  Number 3 is her favorite (number 11 is her least favorite, despite the pink gingham).  I really do adore them all, but if I was forced to choose, I think I would be in a French farmhouse in spring (number 4).Just for fun:  which bag is your favorite?"},

But the pickles look lovely.  I experimented with putting some green tea in the pickle brine to see if the tannin keeps the pickles crisp.  I used grape leaves for their tannin this past summer and the pickles are remarkably crisp. Love this bumper sticker from Marilou, although the canning in this post wasn't with local stuff!And next time I went to market, I took a carefully-wrapped jar of pickles to that farmer to say thank you for all the free veggies.  We were both pleased."},

Break dough into pieces and spread evenly on parchment or Silpat on a large baking sheet.  Roll out to a 1/4\" thickness or less, using a sheet of waxed paper between the rolling pin and dough.  Use a knife or pizza cutter to cut into cracker shapes (I cut small squares).  Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  Remove any crackers that are hard when you press on them.  Hard crackers should break away from their partners easily.  Turn oven down to 300. Return soft crackers to the oven for 10 minutes.  Repeat pressing test, again removing hard crackers and returning soft crackers to oven.  Repeat in 10 minute intervals until all crackers are hard.  Cool all crackers and store in airtight container at room temperature.Play with flavoring the crackers:  sprinkle with an herb, more salt, or freshly ground pepper. Press it lightly into the rolled crackers.  Once, I used part rye flour and added caraway seeds to the dough.  I bet cheese or sesame seeds could be added."},

On subsequent scarves, I used Anna Maria's tutorial for handstitching the last seam.a vintage hand-me-down from a friend - a lovely, swingy, navy coatGenevieve loves the scarves.  I love the scarves.  I made two for myself!The first one used up some cashmere scraps left from this skirt that I accidentally shrank. I mixed in a little bright plaid and some deep green.8-year-old L.L. Bean wool coatThen I used a precious length of Hawaiian fabric that Rebecca gave me - not only do I love the colors, but it was a gift to Rebecca's mom for babysitting a little girl whose parents traveled to Hawaii.  I don't really look good in yellow, so I mixed the Hawaiian fabric with colors that do look good on me.my 10-year-old Land's End wool coatIt's nice to have new accessories from the scrap box for my \"old\" coats (I didn't realize just how old they are until I tallied up the years for this post). And it's nice to make Genevieve look polished as she grows out her coats every year.  I'll probably make some more scarves - maybe even some Christmas gifts!"},

So I took a little orphan gold star button (left from this dress) and used it as the top button.It's been my shopping experience that children's pajamas are not cheap or cute (see Genevieve wearing her exception above).  I'm pleased with these jammies because they are inexpensive and nice.  Ben is pleased because I made them and they're covered in trucks and traffic cones.The first morning after he wore his new pajamas to bed, I asked him if he had any dreams, which is a mild morning conversation starter around here.  Ben said yes, he had dreams about trucks.  \"And those dreams were noisy, Mom!\" But he was grinning."},

I made 4 more batches of pesto.  I freeze it in ice cube trays and then we can put hot pasta on a cube of frozen pesto and presto (ha), there's a meal!  I also use pesto on pizza instead of tomato sauce. And speaking of pizza, here's one of several more batches of pizza sauce I made in September.  I couldn't bear the idea of using my home-canned jars of pizza sauce when there were still tomatoes on market, so I simply made more sauce when I made baked ziti, spaghetti, and pizza.  I also made several trays of roasted tomatoes, following Jennifer's directions.  I didn't take any photos -this may have been over the time that I was struggling with a virus.  In my defense, it was an elusive virus and I would feel hale and hearty for hours at a time and then, boom, weak and achey and wishing I had not hung up 4 loads of laundry and started a vat of pizza sauce.I chopped and froze a lot of bell peppers.  I could get them 3 or 4 for a dollar at market.   Several times this summer I made fermented dill pickles, following directions in Sandor Katz's book.  They were tricky to get right.  The first batch was crisp and sour and my husband could not stop eating them.  The final batch, shown here at the beginning of its fermentation, was only fine in my opinion, but my husband still stood in front of the fridge with the jar and a fork.  I got a half bushel of Concord grapes and made grape juice - only because I borrowed Rebecca's fantastic steamer that made it easy.  This will be great with popcorn on Sunday nights.   And finally, here is chicken stock seen from my kitchen window as it cools.  I included it here in the preserving round up because I needed to get that chicken out of the freezer to make way for the local beef that we're getting soon.   I think I preserved more this summer than I ever have before.  Wow!

Related, the elastic was shot on a pair of my pajama pants.  Sometimes I just sew new elastic on top (like this mend), but this time, I had a better idea:  I cut off the elastic and attached a new waistband entirely, using fabric from a yellowed, vintage pillowcase.  The drawstring has a section of elastic in the back - so much more comfortable than a total drawstring and so much better looking than a total elastic waistband.To play with fabric like this was so fun and easy - I encourage you to go patch up your pajamas!  Apparently, my sleepy look is shabby chic.  Who knew?"},
{"title": "Messengers To Us From the Hallows", "date": "Sunday, October 6, 2013", "text": "hydrangeas from friends\"Somehow we have gotten swept into a millrace, and it's nonstop flailing and thrashing just to keep ourselves from drowning.  The sheer necessities of modern life sweep us farther and farther from any sense that it is all hallowed, really. What are we to do?There are various things we could do no doubt.  We could resign ourselves to the millrace and abandon any thought of anything but the flailing.  Or we could take some drastic step like moving to a farm in Vermont or an island in the Aegean, hoping thereby to find some peace and quiet where we would be able to recollect ourselves and do things right.  A third possibility would be to accept the fact that life comes tumbling at us nowadays but that it is nonetheless possible for us to see our ordinary daily routines as proceeding among the hallows, so to speak; and by stirring up in our minds the things that we vaguely acknowledge anyway, to begin to hallow those routines by doing once more what men have always done with things to hallow them; namely, offering them up in oblation to God, as literally as Abel offered up sacrifices from his ordinary routine of work.I would like to suggest that at least one place (among others) which may be hallowed anew as the place where the celebration of all the mysteries may occur, and where all of life may be offered up in oblation to the Most High, is the family household.  Within these four walls, under this roof, the lamps are lighted.  The offering is here, the vigil is here, the feast is here, the faithful are here.  All the eating and drinking, and the working and playing, and the discipline and serving and loving that go on here - they are all holy.  For these common routines of ordinary life are not only necessities and functions:  they are also messengers to us from the hallows.  Nay, more than messengers, they are those hallows, set hourly before us in visible, touchable, light-of-day forms.\"from Hallowed Be This House by Thomas Howard, quoted in Disciplines for the Inner Life by Bob Benson Sr. and Michael W.

So I gave her the choice of eating her gado gado for supper or Wednesday school lunch.  She chose today. I'm not saying this is the ideal way to handle this, but we talk about how we don't waste food.  Also, carrot cake muffin for her.For Ben, hummus sandwich, grape tomatoes from the back yard, carrot cake muffin.Thursday:Kids:  red beet egg, hummus sandwich, applesauceAdults: red beet egg, sourdough bread, Swiss cheese, apple (and someone bought ice cream during her work day)Friday:Children want to get school lunch pizza on Fridays.  That's cool.  For one day a week, I don't mind a break and the school-lunch crap.Husband: leftover taco beans from taco salad supper; rest of rice from gado gado.

{"title": "The Navy Dress", "date": "Tuesday, October 1, 2013", "text": "At a bargain fabric store, I spied this polka-dotted navy cotton.  It has a gorgeous weight and feel.  It was $2.50 a yard.  I bought everything they had - a little over 2 yards, I think - and much less than most of my dress patterns required.  I could not find any more of the fabric online and I had no interest in a skirt, a blouse, or another navy dress for Genevieve.  No, I must have a sleeveless dress, and I must have it now, even though I'm getting my cold-weather clothes out.I love his sandals and socks - like a little vintage boy.So I cut a dress on the fabric width, instead of length, and sewed on a few inches to make the dress long enough.  The vision I had in mind was a simple, almost elegant dress, that could be dressed up or down.  However, the panel did not lay right with the dress (I knew it was going to be a challenge), so I squeezed out a few more inches of the scraps and turned the bottom panel into a ruffle.  Sure, it's cute, but it's not my original vision and I'm still disappointed.My favorite detail of the dress is the button.  I could only easily get a 22\" zipper instead of the 24\" zipper that the pattern specified, so I kept the extra 2\" and turned it into a keyhole and put in a tiny elastic loop and a sweet vintage button.The dress can be worn unbelted because it doesn't have belt loops, but I much prefer the waist definition from a belt.  Rebecca gave me the idea to use nice ribbon, but then I couldn't decide between two in my stash, so I sewed them together!  A reversible belt on D-rings.  My husband also helped me drill holes in some other belt options (fuschia! mustard! red!), because most of the time, my belted waistlines are not at my true waist, so my belts were too big.But I think this dress will be a real workhorse in my wardrobe.  I wore it Sunday like a summer dress, and put tights and a cardi with it Monday to the office.Thanks to my husband for most of the photos on this post."},

We needed something to - poof - appear on the table at 6pm, ready to eat.So what I do is cook double the amount of food I normally cook on the days I'm home.  Some of it hangs out in the fridge for the 6pm days, to be reheated in the microwave, and the rest is packaged into the freezer to be defrosted for other 6pm days.I've read where some people do an enormous batch cook on one day a month and make their meals for the rest of the month.  That alternately overwhelms me and bores me.Here, I am making a double batch of BBQ (as it's called around here - the rest of the world calls it sloppy joe).  I subbed in cooked lentils for the fourth pound of ground beef.  I also experimented with putting all the ingredients in the slow cooker, not pre-cooking or frying anything first, and cooking it on high for about 5 hours.  The texture was very soft and soupy.  Not terrible, but I now know I prefer the stovetop method.Mennonite Community CookbookI split it into four portions, and we had one for supper. The other three went in the freezer.All the schedule pieces that flew up into the air in August are slowly settling into place.  We are happy.  We generally have homemade, hot suppers that almost appear on the table at 6pm.  There is generally clean laundry. The house generally gets vacuumed. I get time at home alone while the rest of the family is out in the world learning and working (bonus:  with everyone away more, the house is less dirty!).But I'll take any 6pm supper tips you want to offer. . ."},

Oh.  When it was time to move the Schiller, it had to be turned on end to get it through the front door of our new house.  Then, my husband's best friend, a professional musician, warned us that we were ruining our children's pitch, and the piano tuner said it couldn't be tuned again.  So, when my uncle called in August and said he was getting rid of his piano, we gritted our teeth and said yes.The Schiller being turned on end to leave.We had to off-load our beautiful, but not very musical, old Schiller piano.  We tried in various ways (and my husband discovered that our piano, restored, was valued around $9000).  Finally, the night before the new piano was coming, he disassembled the Schiller into its parts for wood, metal, and beautiful bric-a-brac.  I helpfully stayed out of the dining room.The new piano is now here - less majestic, less mellifluous, but eminently paintable when we have the time.  And yes, it can be tuned.  Notice how I skipped the trying details of the move?  I fed everybody pancakes, bacon, and coffee.  That was helpful.  Piano lessons got scrambled in the process (this was the beginning of August - I'm trying to catch up with my life), but Genevieve and I got started again once we got the homework-beast tamed.Now, the problem is that Genevieve is struggling with this phase of piano lessons and I can't work out a new way to explain things, so she's very reluctant to practice her songs.  She is still at the pinao, though, because she has just figured out all by herself how to sound out some simple melodies she loves.  So I'm taking that as a sign of progress, and hoping we creep along with our thin patience until she can actually read music. I proposed to my husband that we paint the piano dark, deep, bottle-green.  But I'm not looking for projects right now, so I think the piano looks just fine."},

Here is my real confession:  I made adorable little yogurt panna cotta cups for packed lunches.  I had made them once before and thought them a little flavorless, but this time, they really were, despite the extra honey and nutmeg I added and the pretty blackberries on top.  Furthermore, the panna cotta separated into odd layers after a few days and the children refused to eat them.  Not to be outdone by them and the compost pile, I blendered the panna cotta into breakfast smoothies one morning."},
{"title": "Sunday Dinner: Crunchy Ham Balls and a Delicious Salad", "date": "Sunday, September 8, 2013", "text": "I was pleased with the textures and flavors of this Sunday dinner.  The ham balls are amazingly good, but I'm not always sure what to serve them with.    Here, their richness is complemented by a unique salad that our friend Danene concocted and served us recently.  She took about 2 cups each sliced cucumber and cantaloupe (in the pictures here, I used canary melon, but the cantaloupe is prettier), added a little chopped fresh mint, and dressed it with the juice of half a lime, a splash of rice vinegar, and salt.  I've made it several times since then and we love how light and refreshing it is.  I might experiment with it by adding a little feta cheese or some proscuitto.  I could see this salad served as part of the main course, or served more like a fruit salad at a brunch or with dessert.   Then, for just a little more bulk in my Sunday menu, I added the small patty pan squashes, which take about 10 minutes on a hot grill.  However, you could use any summer squash and simply roast it or saute it in butter if you're not the grilling type.Saturday: mix up ham ballsSunday morning:roll the ham balls, place in oven on timed bakemake melon saladset the patty pans outSunday noon:set tablegrill patty pansCrunchy Ham Balls (from Rebecca from somewhere)2 c. very stiff mashed potatoes (use leftover if you can plan ahead!)1 c. shredded Swiss cheese or other cheese that you love2 c. finely diced/shredded ham1/3 c. finely chopped onion1 egg, beaten1 Tbsp. prepared mustard1/4-1/3 c. mayonnaise1/4 tsp. pepper2-3 c. crushed cornflakesI use the food processor for the ham and onion. You could probably grate the cheese there, too. In a bowl, combine ingredients except for cornflakes.  Start with the lesser amount of mayo.  You're aiming for stiff, moldable texture.  You can refrigerate the mixture at this point - to stiffen up, to fit your schedule.  Roll the mixture into balls - tennis ball size is usually what mine end up.  Roll each ball in the crushed cornflakes and place on a greased baking sheet.  I usually get 9-12 balls (I think). Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes.  Serve hot or hide them in the back of the fridge as the most desirable leftover and sneak them cold when no one's looking - cook's privilege."},

Lightbulb!  I got up from the sofa and promptly sewed three of them, and yes, they solved annoying cord tangles.  The cord taco is simply a disc of firm fabric with a closure, so that it can fold around the cord like a taco shell and fasten closed. I used a button and loop, but I'm sure a snap, velcro, or even two ties would work, too.My hand mixer came with a plastic cord-tie, which broke (of course) after a few months.  I used a rubber band to keep the cord corralled, but it wasn't easy to get on and off.  I love this cord taco!  I also made one (not shown) for the extension cord I keep in the kitchen for popping the slow cooker out the kitchen window to cook outside.  This is the children's night light, a vintage conch shell from my childhood which used to have its cord sprawled around it.  It has a little flower cut-out appliqued on it, but I was in a rush when I took the picture.And then, in the zone, I solved another pesky problem and made an envelope for my cell phone charger.  To keep the envelope from being clutter or getting lost when the charger was in use, I carefully sewed the charger cord into a channel in the bottom of the envelope.  I'm very pleased with it, although I could have made the envelope a little larger.I used the letter look from the needle case.  And yes, the lining of the envelope is a scrap left over from my shirt dress.    I do so love these little solutions, these little comforts of a well-tended home."},

Fabulous.  Slow Cooker Mac & CheeseServes 2-3 if you're my family; I've been doubling this recipe this summer (see note on doubling below)Generously butter a 3 or 4-quart slow cooker.  Put in it:1 2/3 cups uncooked macaroni or other similar small pasta2 3/4 cups milk (I use 2%)3 cups shredded sharp cheese, mixture of kinds preferred1/2 tsp. salt1/4 tsp. pepper1/4 tsp. ground mustardMix.  Cover.  Cook on low for 2-3 hours, taking the lid off for 20-30 minutes at the end if it looks soupier than you want.  To double this recipe, use a 5 or 6 quart slow cooker, cook on HIGH, and do not double the milk - make it more like 4 1/4 cups instead of 5 1/2 cups.Now, there are some variables here, depending on how hot your cooker cooks and how soft or soupy you like your mac and cheese.  You will have to experiment. I like my mac and cheese on the firm, dry side with plenty of pepper and sharp cheese.  The cheese is important and I recommend that you mix several kinds of cheddar or Monterey Jack or the like, including a very sharp cheese.  I sometimes use a bit of smoked cheddar, too.  Some Parmesan would be excellent, I'm sure.Serve with a plate of sliced tomatoes or cucumbers, purple basil optional, or whatever summer fruit needs to be eaten next.  Complete meal.  Complete comfort food.  Try it on your next busy day and let me know how you like it!"},

I don't know - August is a blur), Rebecca gave me a sack of zucchini.  I made sweet zucchini relish, an indispensible condiment for tuna salad, 1000 island dressing, tartar sauce, and the like.  I also canned a peck of peaches, whose beauty is shown in this photo as they ripened.  Alas, I allowed them to ripen too long for easy canning, and I must remember next year to can them while they're still a bit firm.  But they smelled so delectable!I have three-quarters of a bushel of tomatoes down in my kitchen.  I made a batch of pizza/spaghetti sauce today and trotted my new pressure canner out for her first go.  She worked beautifully.  The rest of the bushel is for salsa and whole canned tomatoes.  And then I'm going to get an additional half-bushel of tomatoes and I'll tell you all about that when I do two new canning projects."},

I really did not stay at Genevieve's elbow as I have mostly done in the cooking lessons so far.  The recipe was in front of her the way Barb sent it to me, so it wasn't written for a kitchen newbie.  Genevieve did accidentally add a 3/4 cup of sesame seeds instead of a 1/4 cup; granola is pretty forgiving for that (although I haven't actually tasted the end result).5.  I thought that granola was a good way to accustom Genevieve to the oven, to handling hot things, but she simply freaked out.  I'm afraid I was not gracious about it, but I did the stirring and moving of the hot pan while I prepped the kitchen for canning the pickles.We have granola, we have cookies, we have excellent bread-and-butter pickles.  I did require a nap and coffee, lest you wonder.  I did not have the opportunity to snap many pictures and I have lots more to say about preserving these days - inbetween sewing school uniforms."},

Now I have corn from 10 dozen ears in the freezer.3.  They all enjoyed themselves.  My husband did not take any pictures, so here are mine, which I snapped as I thought I would tell you about my mini-batches of frozen corn.  Just when you think you know everything about your spouse, he busts out a kitchen project groove. I love that.

She decided to slice the mozzarella instead of grate it (smart girl).  I explained the toaster oven to her.I contributed popcorn, baby carrots, and ginger beer to the meal.  It was simple and satisfying, the lesson and the meal.  It's nice to have another worker in the kitchen."},

And me."},
{"title": "A Bathroom Mirror Cleaning Trick", "date": "Sunday, July 28, 2013", "text": "This tip I discovered by myself by accident one day when I was annoyed with more smudgy fingerprints on the mirrors - life with children, right?  I grabbed a damp bath towel from someone's shower and rubbed the mirror and presto!  fingerprints gone and mirror polished!  Over the next few months, I experimented, disbelieving that it was possible to clean a mirror without chemicals and a paper towel.I am here to tell you it's true: rub the smudges with a damp towel and use a dry corner for a final swipe/polish.  The towel trick is less successful if you've got globs of toothpaste or soap bubbles on your mirror - you might have to get out the chemicals or ignore it until the next cleaning day. We clean the bathroom mirrors once a week with Windex and newspaper.  We have two big mirrors because it's a tiny bathroom and (here's another trick!) small rooms look more spacious with mirrors in them. It's possible that this a common tip and I just never heard it before, although I do confess to being a tip junkie who adores Hints from Heloise and the tips sections in the back of cookbooks and such.  What do you think?  Do you have smudgy mirrors that need this cleaning tip?"},

(Pause for meditation)So, Gingerbread French Toast.  It comes from Mollie Katzen's cookbook for children, Honest Pretzels.  Mollie Katzen makes great-tasting food and this was no exception.  It was simple French toast (dip bread in egg and milk mixture and fry) with gingerbread spices added to the liquid.   Genevieve did a good job handling herself by the stove and the breakfast was delicious.This French toast lesson actually comes from two weeks ago. We were at the beach last week.  We are at home now and maybe we should go to the pool less and cook and sew more.  Must meditate on that."},
{"title": "Lettuce-Tomato with Beef and a Lovely Vintage Dessert", "date": "Monday, July 15, 2013", "text": "One of my very favorite meals is Lettuce-Tomato with Beef.  It has a short window of time in late June when the summer tomatoes overlap briefly with the lettuce which is starting to bolt in the heat.  I make it every year.  The only reason I can think of that I have not blogged about it before is that I so fully enjoy this meal that I cannot be bothered to get out my camera.  For your sakes, dear readers, I tore myself away.Lettuce-Tomato with Beef - from More with Less with some serious tweaks by me; it's a dinner salad meal from VietnamStir together and marinate in the fridge, preferably for several hours:1/4-1/2 lb. chuck or round steak, sliced paper thin2/3 cup grated or pureed onion (I use my food processor)2 garlic cloves, grated or pureed (food processor again)1/2 tsp. fish sauce* (or 1/2 tsp. salt, if you must)1/2 tsp. sugarfreshly ground pepper, several grindsIn a small jar, combine:1/3 cup finely minced onion3 Tbsp. rice vinegar3 Tbsp. vegetable oil1/2 tsp. saltseveral grinds of pepper1 1/2 Tbsp. sugarShake together as dressing and set aside.  Plan when to start your rice; I use jasmine rice or regular long-grain brown rice.  The secret to fluffy rice is to keep the water scant (so don't use the full 2 cups water for 1 cup rice) and let it sit with the lid on for about 10 minutes when the water is gone, to steam.A short time before the meal, when the rice is planned or cooking, arrange on a beautiful platter with a small, empty bowl in the middle:1 head lettuce or mixed lettuces, torn2 tomatoes, sliced2 cucumbers, diced, peeling optionalhandful snipped herbs such as Thai basil, cilantro, or mint (Asian-leaning, you see)Heat in heavy skillet until very hot:1 Tbsp. oilAdd marinated beef and onions and stir fry quickly, just until beef loses red color, 1-2 minutes.  Frying it too long will make it tough, trust me (and I like my steaks medium-well, okay?).  Place beef in the bowl in the middle of the salad platter.  Add a Tbsp. water to the hot skillet, swish, and add the collected drippings/water to the salad dressing.To eat this gorgeous meal, place a mound of hot, fresh rice on your plate.  Add some lettuce/tomato/cuke/herbs mixture, a smidgen of beef (the Vietnamese wisely use the meat sparingly, for flavoring), and drizzly lightly with the dressing. Keeping the dressing and beef separate from the vegetables means that leftovers will still be nice the next day.*I love fish sauce.  It is an anchovy-based sauce that has the same umami POW that Worcestershire sauce has (which is also traditionally anchovy-based, did you know?).  Add fish sauce to Asian dishes that need a little boot, or add it to vinaigrette, soups, or meatloaf mix.  I'm trying to talk you into getting a bottle by illustrating that it's not a one-trick pony.  I buy mine at an Asian store, but I'm guessing most major grocery stores have it.Okay, so the lovely vintage dessert was Orange Charlotte.  I adore pudding-y desserts and this one was fabulous and not very hard to make.  I want to make Charlotte Russe next and I have the ladyfingers to prove it.  I was so pleased with its cool, creamy texture and citrus punch after the Vietnamese salad meal.Orange Charlotte - taken from a book at work which I cannot credit because I photocopied it months and months ago without noting the title (oops - bad editor)In a mixing bowl, dissolve 1 envelope unflavored gelatin in 1/3 cup cold water.Add 1/3 cup boiling water.Add:scant 3/4 cup sugar1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (about 1 1/2 oranges)zest of one orange1 Tbsp. lemon juicepinch saltPlace in refrigerator.  When the mixture startes to gel in 20-40 minutes, fold in:2 egg whites, beaten with a pinch of cream of tartar until stiff1/2 cup whipping cream, beaten until just beginning to form soft peaksPour mixture into lightly greased bowl or pretty vintage jello mold.  Cover.  Refrigerate for several hours until firm.  Unmold if you've used something pretty.  Otherwise, just dish it out.Whew.  I don't usually publish two recipes in one post.  But you can see why, right?  Deliciousness."},

We are taking a bit more formal approach to cooking this summer.  Every Wednesday, we will have a cooking lesson and then I will share it with you!I have come to realize that what I am teaching Genevieve is how to read and follow a recipe.  It sounds so obvious, but the first thing I taught her was a technique with no recipe (eggs and toast).   I realized I need to teach her to read the recipe through once, assemble her ingredients, and keep re-reading as she steps through the recipe.  What I do is stay in the kitchen and put away ingredients as she uses them.   Ben adores kitchen work, too, so he stays in the kitchen and his sister kindly allows him to stir or something.  Then he gets to be my helper at the next mealtime.  This lesson, we made Baked Oatmeal.  I have blogged a lot about Baked Oatmeal because it is healthy, cheap, fast, and delicious.  And people with summery-hot houses, take note: we put this Baked Oatmeal in a 4-quart slow cooker on high for 1.5 hours. Slow cookers don't give off a lot of heat to begin with, but you can also plug it in outside to cook and keep more heat out of your house.  Great, huh?  (We didn't take the slow cooker outside today because I thought it would be simpler for the newbie cook to stay in the kitchen.)We actually had this cooking lesson in the afternoon due to our busy day, so we ate the Oatmeal for breakfast the next morning with some blackberries.  I love to have meals figured out so far in advance!  It frees my mind up to think of other things and to get to the sewing machine.  However, later that evening as I sewed happily away, I listened to a sermon we missed while on vacation; it came highly recommended from several church members.  scraping technique: hard to explain, hard to execute, but she licks the spatula at the endI was convicted.  The sermon was about how Jesus responded to interruptions and didn't get glued into his plans and miss God speaking.Oh, how I love my plans!  Oh, how I love order!  But I want to love my children, my family, Jesus, more than my plans.  So I'm trying make plans that I'm willing to release - hard lesson for me.  And so far, the cooking lessons have been bright spots, so I'm grateful for that."},

(1 pkg.) dry instantyeast2.  Add:                1 Tbsp. sugar                1 ½ tsp. salt                2 Tbsp. oil, any kind, plus havea little more for later                1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour3.  Use a sturdy whiskto beat everything together until there are no lumps.  This is helpful to get the yeast started andmake a smooth dough.  Shake the batteroff the whisk – you’re done with it. 4.  Pour on top of thebatter:                1 ½ cups whole wheat flour                 (keep a ½ cup whole wheat flournearby – you will probably need it)5.  With clean handsor a wooden spoon, stir the whole wheat flour into the liquidy batter.  It will be messy.  Persist.6. Begin to knead the dough.  Fold it firmly on itself, turn the bowl or the doughslightly, and fold firmly again.  Use the heel of your hand to push down as you fold.  Do this overand over and the dough will get smoother. If it is still pretty wet, sprinkle some of the reserved ½ cup of wholewheat flour over it.  Knead the flourin.  You can do this again, but do notexceed the extra ½ cup or you may need to add more water. The goal is for thedough to be a uniform ball that isn’t too sticky or dry/crumbly.  It could be described as satiny, shiny,smooth, and elastic. 7.  When you havekneaded the dough for 3-5 minutes, lift it up out of the bowl.  Pour a little oil in the bowl (the bowl isstill a little messy and crusty – this is fine).  Put the smooth side of the dough ball down inthe oil and rub the oil around the bowl and over the dough ball; the goal is togrease the bowl and the dough.  Flip overthe dough ball so the smooth side is up and any pinchy ends are underneath. 8.  Make a dishtowelwet and wring it out.  Cover thebowl/dough while you assemble toppings. The dough can rest like this for 10-20 minutes.9.  Roll dough outwith a rolling pin so that it is a ¼ or ½” thick – you can use a sprinkle offlour if you’re worried about sticking. Fit it into baking pans (I usually lightly grease the pan).  Add a thin layer of sauce, a little gratedmozzarella, some toppings, more mozzarella, and the final toppings that wouldlike a little caramelization in the oven.  10. Bake at 450 F for 13-20 minutes, until crust is nicelybrown, cheese is melted and browning, and any toppings in view lookcooked.  A smaller pizza pan will takeless time than a larger one; start checking at 13 minutes and check every 2minutes after that.  If you cut into thepizza and it is still doughy in the center, it can be put back in the oven andbaked for a decent outcome.  Anyleftovers reheat best in an oven."},

Honestly, the children don't like it and that really irritates me, but my husband and I think it's wonderful.  Jeni says it pairs well with \"champagne, a sprinkling of cinnamon, cardamom, or black pepper.\"  Instead, yesterday, I paired mine with black coffee and a fudgy brownie that my sister made on vacation.  Glorious."},
{"title": "Shorts Out of Thin Air", "date": "Sunday, June 23, 2013", "text": "Well, hello.  We have been away, and I will tell you more about that later this week.In the meantime, let's talk about kids' shorts.  Ben has plenty of hand-me-downs.  Genevieve has plenty of sundresses, but she now, suddenly, prefers shorts and pants.I scrabbled around and put together some shorts for her.  When we were away in the woods, I realized just how uniquely makeshift the shorts are. 1.  Knit shorts for school field day.  These are the most successful pair, maybe because I used an actual sewing pattern.  It was a generic shorts pattern written for woven fabric, not knit, but I just used the mock serger stitch on my machine and hoped for the best.  You do need to know which way the knit stretches before you cut and sew!  This fabric was in my stash from who-knows-where and it suits Genevieve's eye-screeching combinations perfectly.  2.  Cut-offs with bias tape.  I had a slew of hand-me-down jeans for Ben in Genevieve's size.  I found the pair with the most ripped-out knees and made them into these shorts.  They are too baggy.  They look funny.  The bias tape is not evenly sewed down.  She wears them and likes them.  Oh well.3.  The balloon shorts. I searched around on Pinterest for an idea here.  Then I stumbled across a beloved old pair of my pajama pants in my stash and poof, made the elastic waist smaller and gathered the legs into a band.  I think they look fabulously Frenchy, but Genevieve is less fond of them because she says they inhibit her movement. I told her to consider them her least-favorite shorts and wear them when the other 2 pairs are in the wash.  Which they always are.She is clothed most of the time, I tell you.  Maybe I should scrounge another pair of shorts for her?  Like, at a store?  But so far I have not spent a dime on summer shorts and I was planning to keep it that way."},

We are taking a bit more formal approach to cooking this summer.  Every Wednesday, we will have a cooking lesson and then I will share it with you!Our second lesson involved reading a recipe and using measuring cups, spoons, and a liquid measure.  I talked about reading the recipe first before beginning and then often throughout.  We spread out the measuring spoons, cups, and glass measure to talk about them; Genevieve whirled around to get a paper and pen and show me what she knew about fractions from school - I was so pleased and impressed that she instantly made that connection!  She learned to look at the milk in the glass measuring cup by bending down on the same plane as the red lines on the side.  She learned that vanilla extract rushes fast out of the bottle and that tapioca is cassava root from South America (although I thought it was from Africa too, and called manioc there).She got more comfortable with the stove and what a medium flame looks like; her arm got tired of stirring the pudding, so we talked about different stirring patterns and switching hands and we made silly jokes while she stirred.  My husband asked her at lunch what she learned and she explained boiling to him.  We talked about stove safety and how to scrape out every little bit of the pudding using a silicone spatula; I told her Granny is the queen of scraping bowls clean.\"tired-of-stirring\" faceThis was a very successful lesson, even if I forgot to instruct Geneveive in the art of slicing and macerating strawberries to eat on top of the pudding.  She was quite proud to serve us dessert!  The recipe for the pudding that we used is here."},

My husband wants to teach the children some drawing principles.  4.  We've always gone to the library randomly, usually when the adults needed something.  But now, we are experimenting with a regular library day because Genevieve has turned into a voracious reader.  It's exciting!  And way more economical to keep her in books by checking them out from the library. Other than cooking lessons, I didn't make a list of specific tasks I want to teach the children this summer.  It might come to that, but for now, they are both handling the tasks we give them pretty well.  They are also both very grateful for quiet time after the obligatory kick-and-fuss-for-a-few-minutes.This schedule will probably wiggle around some to accomodate lots of swimming at the pool this summer, but for now, we are really enjoying our relaxed, yet purposeful, days."},
{"title": "Finally, a Solution for Playing Out of Hymnals", "date": "Sunday, June 9, 2013", "text": "Back when we toured a local historic farmstead, a musician was playing out of tight little hardcover music books from the 1800s.  He kept them open with large wooden clothespin-looking things.  I couldn't concentrate on his talk because I was staring at the wooden pins. I love to play hymns out of my hymnals where I jot notes to myself on the margins, but it was a perennial problem to keep the hymnal open.  I was always propping it under books or grabbing at it as it flapped shut midway through the song.  I don't like to use the spiral-bound hymnal for accompanists at church (no notes!) and I don't want to make photocopies (an avalanche of paper!).Clearly, I needed those wooden pins or their equivalent. There are giant binder clips, but the ones I found were about $10 apiece.  Then, one day in the local art store, I came across large silver clips for $1.25 apiece.  They work!  They are large enough to handle the biggest hymnal I have, and I am so pleased.   I haven't seen this solution among the musicians I know, but perhaps this is a common trick for professionals and I just missed it all these years."},
{"title": "Banana Milk", "date": "Friday, June 7, 2013", "text": "Once upon a time, I had overripe bananas on the counter.  I was planning to give milk to the children at breakfast anyway, so I just blendered the bananas in the milk.  I put it in cups with straws which makes my children deliriously happy.  I was pleased to have an easy, nutritious breakfast drink.  Sometimes I use kefir or yogurt instead of milk.  It's a nice way to tempt lagging appetites in a heat wave as the cool drink slurps down so easily. Also, you can toss overripe bananas directly into the freezer and they could be used in this drink or in baked goods.  I used to think smoothies needed 10 ingredients, 1 of them kale, and at least 5 others bought at the health food store.  I'm not fond of a smoothie as a meal (I like chewing), so I serve banana milk as the fruit and dairy in the menu.  To wit:banana milkpeanut butter toastbanana milkFrench toast (pictured above is pb&j French toast)banana milkmuffin (lemon poppyseed, oatmeal blueberry, rhubarb, etc.)"},
{"title": "Why and How To Clean Your Chest Freezer", "date": "Wednesday, June 5, 2013", "text": "The Why:Cleaning the a free-standing freezer means taking everything out and defrosting the freezer, a perfect time to take inventory of what you have; do this casually or write it down on paper.  I defrost my freezer when I see a build-up of hard frost on the walls and, in this case today, creeping up under the seal. ﻿Mr. Thrift takes the frozen meat across town in the old bike trailer.  His idea.The How:1.  Bring a stockpot of water to boil on the stove.  (I took pictures only of the bike trailer; I was making sushi for lunch, hosting a child helper in the kitchen, fielding phone calls, and washing dishes throughout these steps.  Yes, I like a bit of high-speed kitchen chaos now and then to remind me of my waitressing days.)2.  Prepare a clean space on the floor next to the freezer.  I put down an old vinyl tablecloth on the basement floor.3.  Turn off the freezer if there is a control.  For extra measure, unplug it. 4. Remove all the food from the freezer.  Mine is in several milk crates and a freezer basket, so it's not too hard to lug it out.  Schlep the meat to another freezer (thank you, dear husband) or an ice chest if you're worried, but don't worry, your food will be back in the clean freezer in 1-2 hours, max.  Insulate the frozen food on the floor with a blanket or two if you wish - it will be more energy-efficient if it's frozen going back into the freezer.  Do not worry about a little thawing - the food will be fine.I call this his pick-up truck.5.  Set a trivet on the floor of the freezer.  Place the pot of boiling water, uncovered, on the trivet and close the freezer lid.  Depending on how thick the hard pieces of frost are, you will hear chunks of it falling onto the freezer floor with 30 minutes.  Check on the frost and tug on it if you are impatient.  Really impatient people should probably plug in a hair dryer and help it along (I don't bother).6.  Pile the chunks of frost in a dishpan and give them to the children, the garden, or whatever.7.  Get a towel and soak up the extra liquid on the floor of the freezer or, if it's handy, pull the drain plug.8.  Get a bucket of water with a squirt of dish soap and a rag; extra-sanitary people wearing old clothes can add a glug of bleach (I don't).  Wipe out the freezer and if yours is like mine, there is weird unmentionable glop on the bottom.9.  Turn the freezer back on and plug it in if you unplugged it (I don't).10. Place your food back in the clean freezer - this is a good time to take inventory as you do.  I was surprised by shrimp shell stock and sauerkraut.Since I counted the preserved items, I know that I only have one box of strawberry jam left.  By looking over the records in my preserving notebook, I know how many berries to order to make jam. I went ahead and did an inventory of the remaining canned jars I have, so now I can start making a list of what I want to preserve this summer and fall.I wrote this post mostly for myself because I seem to draw a blank every time I want to clean the freezer (NOT often, believe me).  Next time, I will borrow an ice chest for the meat and Mr. Thrift will not bike it around town."},

We cranked out 2 quarts from 5 pounds of peanuts.  At $3.05 per pound including shipping, my quarts of peanut butter cost $7.62 apiece!  Hooray for do-it-yourself!We sent Dad home with a pint of still-warm peanut butter and many thanks.Now the machine lives in our basement and if you're local and interested, email me privately - I am happy to let you have a session with Dad's machine."},

{"title": "Easiest Risotto Ever", "date": "Sunday, May 26, 2013", "text": "This is the cheater's version of risotto, so if you are a purist, turn away now.  But I'll just say it is fabulously delicious and takes very little work.I actually made this recipe a few times this winter, but it doesn't really photograph well.I've made it recently because it's turned chilly out and the oven heat is welcome.  Because, yes, the oven is on for almost an hour and does most of the work.  It's an awesome trick.Asparagus risottoThe recipe is based on one from the Barefoot Contessa.  I tweaked it several times over.Easy Oven Risotto1 1/2 cups arborio rice, barley, or short-grain brown rice5-6 cups chicken stock, divided1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning or just dried sage, optional1/2 cup chopped mushrooms1 garlic clove, minced, optional2/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese1/2 cup dry white wine, red wine, or just more stock2-3 Tbsp. butter1 tsp. salt, or to taste1/4 tsp. freshly ground pepper1 cup frozen peas, chopped asparagus, or chopped spinachHeat 4 cups of stock in cast-iron Dutch oven or other oven-safe pan.  (Use an extra cup if you are using barley or brown rice, so heat 5 cups).  Pour in your grain of choice plus the mushrooms and optional garlic and sage.  Clap on a lid.  Bake at 350 for 45 minutes for arborio rice, but 60 minutes for the barley and brown rice.Heat up the remaining cup of chicken stock (I use the microwave).  Have the cheese, wine, butter, salt, pepper, and green veg all ready to go.Remove the Dutch oven from oven.  Immediately pour in the hot chicken stock.  Stir vigorously.  Add the cheese, wine, butter, salt and pepper.  Stir vigorously for 2-3 minutes.  Add the green veg.  Stir again and put the lid on or turn the stove burner on low until the risotto is hot through and the vegetable is just barely cooked.Notes:  Do not try to use long-grain rice with this recipe.  Arborio is a short-grain rice.  Short-grain rices, it is my understanding, have more starch and so will cook up into a more gluey end product than long-grain rices which will be fluffier.  The gluey starch is what translates into \"creamy\" in risotto.for dinner, with a green saladRisotto is great for dinner with a green salad, or for breakfast with some fruit on the side.  Leftovers reheat beautifully, or can sneaked out of the fridge, cold. I wonder what I was expounding on here when my husband snapped this photo?  This was Saturday night.  And then we had gingerbread with a few dregs of lemon curd whipped with heavy cream."},

{"title": "I Kissed Antacids Good-bye", "date": "Sunday, May 19, 2013", "text": "I realized I had acid reflux 1 1/2 years ago.  I went to my doctor who always gives me samples and who sings in the same choir with my brother and thinks my brother is a hoot.  He told me to avoid acidic and fatty food, mint, chocolate, and caffeine.  He told me other things and I tried to follow them except for propping up the head of my bed.  I took Nexium.  Then Prilosec.  I felt better for a few months. I wondered how taking drugs that dialed back my digestive juices could be helpful.  I chewed gum several times a day and that helped stimulate digestive juices until my jaw showed signs of TMJ, a serious, expensive problem.  I took more Prilosec.  And Zantac.  And started drinking gallons of aloe vera per Dr. Oz.  I tried not to stress as my mother advised me.I love to eat and I love to cook and my eating mantra is NO DIETS and all things in moderation and I was/am so angry at God that this ailment is the thorn in my side.  On good days, I see possible spiritual lessons in the distance and I do not allow acid reflux to control my life.  On bad days, I am depressed at my first-world acid reflux problem and, well, you know all the bad things that happen when we are down in our pits.  It's ugly.But.I am done with the antacids. DONE. I have made an about-face - I am stimulating my stomach acid!  This is what happened:  I made sauerkraut last year because I'm always curious in the kitchen.  It was so easy that I started reading and studying Sandor Ellix Katz's book.  Rebecca pointed out a section on H. Pylori, and when I googled H. Pylori and acid reflux, I read this article.  And it made sense.  I am following my gut (ha!) and eating fermented food at every meal, plus taking a stomach acid pill occasionally at some meals (that would be HCl + pepsin), and downing some apple cider vinegar for heart-burn-ish symptoms.I feel pretty good after two weeks. I feel pretty good, oh thank you God.  What I believe is that my American diet, even as healthy as I thought it was, slowly killed off my beneficial digestive bacteria.  I am colonizing new ones by eating live food like fermented foods, raw milk, unwashed organic vegetables, and filtered water.  I will avoid any CAFO (concentrated animal feeding operations) meat with its excessive antibiotics.  As a child, I took lots of antibiotics - we all did - for slight colds and other viruses.  I had already shunned antibacterial soap at our house, and I'm afraid I'm going to get dogmatic on the subject of hand sanitizer:  YOU MAY NOT USE THAT CRAP BECAUSE IT KILLED MY DIGESTIVE TRACT.  WE NEED OUR FRIENDLY LITTLE BACTERIA!!!  My husband gets a worried look when I talk like this and I do try to tone it down because I don't want to judge BUT IF THERE'S A SINK AROUND, MY CHILD IS NOT GOING TO USE THAT PUMP BOTTLE OF HAND SANITIZER.  THIS IS NOT THE HOSPITAL ICU!!!  AND NO, THANK YOU, WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE HAND SANITIZER AT THE PETTING ZOO because (I'll stop shouting now) city kids need all the animal and dirt germs they can get. I don't want people to think I'm lulu on this topic.  I was feeling lulu and lonely, but better in my body, so I kept on. And then the New York Times published this article by Michael Pollan.  I could hardly calm down after reading it!  I feel so vindicated, so justified, so gratifed.I had a hard time writing this post.  This is a watershed moment in my life and I wanted to explain it, but it's so new yet that I don't have a lot of perspective.  I wanted there to be pictures, but I didn't know how to illustrate \"watershed moment,\" so I used a bunch from a recent field trip to a farm with Ben.  Lots of germs.  Awesome.So, that's enough for now.  I have more new food habits to share in future blog posts and, as always, I am happy to discuss questions and ideas in the comments."},

I typically plant three pots of flowers on the front porch with thrillers (tall plants), fillers (bushy, medium or small height), and spillers (a creeper that spills over the edge of the pot).  I even know how to secure my pots so they aren't stolen off the porch, a sad but real part of downtown city living.However, inspired by my friend last fall, I wanted to see if I could work more edibles into my gardening overall.I filled my big pot with a geranium, a few begonias, and then (the edibles!) thyme with purple flowers, variegated creeping thyme, creeping rosemary, purple basil,  and lovage.  The smaller twin pots on the porch posts got a few begonias and summer savory.  We'll see if they fill out and look lovely and if I remember what each herb is.  I'll take pictures in a month or so and report back.In other gardening news, I'm still mulling how to do a container of carrots or beets.  Our peas are up and looking happy.  New baby dill plants are growing.  Our lettuce is nice and hearty.  And I have started a packet of basil seeds inside on the window sill instead of buying plants the way I usually do.I planted hen and chicks, a creeping succulent, in Ben's old sneakers. Not edible, just adorable. This spring, I pulled out some irises and lily of the valley to make space for a rhubarb plant from my friend Caryn (thanks again, Caryn!).  I am hopeful it will take root well enough to survive the summer heat, unlike the last one.How are your edibles coming along?"},

{"title": "A Pompom Garland and a Messy Desk", "date": "Tuesday, May 7, 2013", "text": "I loved Leila's pompom garland so much that I acquired an A. C. Moore coupon and bought two bags of pompoms for $4 total. I started merrily stringing and knotting the pompoms on black perle cotton. Unlike Leila, I didn't make a knot on either side of the pompom because I found that the pompoms still slid around; instead, I tied a double knot directly on the pompom itself and the fluff covered it right up.  Mid-project, I set my strings aside to tend to a party, but the strings got so entirely tangled that not even my mom, my sis, and my sister-in-law could untangle them!  I was so mad. I snipped the pompoms free and threw away a lot of perle cotton.  Learn from my example if you want to make a pompom garland!  I very carefully kept the strands straight until they were done, and then I carried them directly to their hooks. I love it.Airy, like sprinkles in the lime green room. Now, underneath those pretty pops of color is A Very Messy Desk.  The children share it.  I can hardly bear to look at it.  We try to clean it once a week, usually on Saturdays, but I swear as soon as the brown desk surface reappears and there is space for a project, the children happily submerge themselves in projects and the mess starts up again.  I want them to do projects and have art materials, but I want them to learn the value of tidying up.  If they want to keep their desk in a different manner when they are adults, that is their business.  I will try not to judge and feel like a failure; I will say they take after their father.  I will let it go, really.In the meantime, thanks to Rebecca who knows more about parenting than I do, I've come to realize that we are teaching the children about clean desks in these three ways:Method 1: Parent cleans desk while children are away and takes the trash directly out to the garbage can.Pros: The desk is clean, an excellent exhibit for the children.  Parents can throw tacky things away without child's knowledge!  Cons:  Parent's time.  Child has not helped with cleaning.Method 2:  Parent stands over child for specified amount of time, maybe 15-30 minutes (so parent doesn't go insane) and guides child through each organizing decision:  yes, the marker goes in the marker box; is that a piece of paper you want to save?  then pin it to the bulletin board; put all your paper clips together in this little can, etc. etc. etc.  etc. etc.Pros: Child learns the actual process of organization.  Process requires parent to eat chocolate before and after (soothing properties).Cons:  Parent must have infinite patience and no ironic or sarcastic tendencies.  Parent may go insane.  Desk may not be very clean because the process is slow.Method 3:  Parent tells child to clean desk by specified time (or else it could take all day).  Parent does not enter the room, but may cajole from a distance.  Child may attempt to put organizational skills (see  Method 2) in practice, but usually ends up throwing a lot of things in drawer or trash.  Whatever.Pros:  Very little parental energy expended.  Children working.Con:  Messy desk.I gave the children the extras, thinking they could use them as play food.  The children promptly cut them up for a project. How do you teach small people to tidy up their own work areas?  I'd love some tips!"},

{"title": "Water Usage Math for Washing Dishes by Hand", "date": "Tuesday, April 16, 2013", "text": "We don't have a dishwasher because we stopped short of putting in our planned kitchen island 7 years ago.  We were tired of renovating and the accompanying drained bank accounts.  Instead, we kept on washing dishes by hand as we had in the years before we were home owners and home renovators.In the meantime, with all that time spent in the dishpan, I have been thinking.  And then I did a little research.I figured out how many gallons of liquid my dishpan holds without messy pouring of water:Length in inches x width x height = X, then X/231 = volume in gallons14\" x 11\" x 6\" = 924\"  and 924/ 231 = 4 gallonsMy dishpan was 3/4 full after washing that full dish-drainer-load, plus a pan on the stovetop (we use the stovetop like an overflow dishdrainer if no one is drying dishes) and the bag-dryer.I figure I routinely use about 3 gallons of water total to wash a small dishwasher load of dishes. I've been around dishwashers enough to know their general capacity.  In my research, I read that the average Energy Star dishwasher uses 4 gallons of water per cycle and the others use about 6 gallons (although Energy Star says it differently).  And here is another article with food for thought.The way I use so little water to handwash that many dishes is thus:1.  squirt dish soap in pan and run in an inch or less of hot water.2.  Wash a dirty something and turn the water on over the dishpan briefly, rinsing the soapy thing.3.  Place the clean wet thing in drying rack.See, I capture the rinse water right in the dishpan and use it to build up my dishwater. One of the things I didn't see addressed in the articles is that if you ideally wait to run the dishwasher until it is full, then you might need to have more dishes than I do.  I can wash a small load, and often do if I'm clearing the decks for a canning or baking project, with the same efficiency as a large load.  I also re-use dishes for several projects rather than getting a clean item every time; for example, tonight during supper prep, I used the same glass measuring cup for milk for biscuits, cream for a pie, boiling water for the same pie, and tomatoes for a soup.  The hidden problem in my dishwashing scenario is that it takes a long time to get the hot water up to our kitchen faucet, so sometimes we run the water for a while to get hot.  In the right mood, I capture this water in my houseplant watering can.Actually, I'm not a militant water-saver.  I started researching dishwashers vs. handwashing out of curiosity and it suits my personality to discover how little water I use in contrast to what the bigwigs think I use.  Humph.  I like the intricacies of kitchen life, that's all."},

I mean, there are some pieces of art where I am so in awe that I make a resolution to try harder at my interests to see if there is some excellence in me, too. Then, more commonly for me, there are some pieces of art that give me new color palettes or clothing ideas.  I am, at heart, a pragmatic person.I think I need a capelet.And those hotpads? - they're in the shop."},

(And stay tuned for the Fashion Plates!) Today is my birthday, and I am wearing a necklace that Genevieve made me with the guidance of Aunt Mel (thank goodness, because the funny necklace G made for herself is eye-popping in its ingenuity).  At the bus stop this morning, I told Genevieve she may wear my necklace sometimes if she likes because she simply adores doo-dads, and she said quite kindly, \"No, Mom, that's okay, I have my own diamond.\"  She does, indeed, have a Chinese diamond as the centerpiece in her necklace.The real part of my day:  making my own birthday tart and concealing it from family and guests until late tonight.  You see, our church is having Agape meals in homes tonight.  We are hosting a meal.  We will have a simple soup supper with our brothers and sisters, while reading Scripture through The Last Supper.  There will be foot-washing and communion.  We will end quite soberly and leave quietly.  And then (don't tell!) I will whisk my family back to the dining room for lemon tart and a little birthday fun!  I'm pretty sure Jesus will like that, too. We are getting ready for Easter! (And this post is a collection of moments that are pretty, happy, funny, and real - linking up with Leila and Rosie)"},
{"title": "Ben's Quilt is Done", "date": "Tuesday, March 26, 2013", "text": "Just in time for the end of winter, here is Ben's quilt!I have been happily adding a bit of handquilting with white perle cotton for the last couple of weeks, almost overdosing on girly movies after the children are in bed and my husband is studying for an exam, but enjoying myself nonetheless.This is the first quilt where I combined handquilting and machine quilting.  It was a lovely balance, as I didn't get tired of either method.  I think the perle cotton quilting really adds a nice spark to the texture created by the machine quilting.  I'm quite proud of the machine quilted border and how the corners are 90 degrees and match up to the bound corners!  The binding is also exquisitely done.Other things that could have been improved on:  the backing did get folded and quilted such in a few places.  My careful pinning and walking foot still did not prevent that.  A few of the quilting lines are not straight, but that isn't obvious unless you turn over the quilt.  I do really regret not matching the gingham where I had to piece the strip at the bottom of the patchwork, but oh well.  I'm not a perfectionist, and my boy is deliriously happy to have this quilt.  When I presented it to him, he was speechless, and then he laid it on the floor and rolled on it in love.  Well, melt my heart.And, oh, lovely, I get to consider the next quilt.  I'm pretty sure I want to work on an unfinished quilt top my Aunt Nancy gave me.  She started it in college from her childhood dress fabrics."},
{"title": "Sunday Dinner: Chicken Casserole + Short-Cut White Sauce", "date": "Sunday, March 24, 2013", "text": "So, I've blogged about this casserole before which takes a can of cream soup.  You realize that cream of mushroom soup can be replaced by a homemade white sauce?  It's just that most people consider it more convenient to open a can than stand over the stove, stirring.  I do.  Making white sauces gets on my nerves.  I just usually avoid recipes that call for cream-of soups because I don't feel like making a white sauce.  Nothing annoys me more than doing a bunch of stovetop cooking with a dish and then baking it as well.  Humph.  But.This method (below) of making a white sauce has me so excited because it's foolproof and fast! My senior editor has been making her white sauces in the microwave for years and it's awesome, especially suited to the casserole application because it lessens the sting (in my mind) of cooking it twice.  The method: 2 Tbsp. butter in glass measure (I have a 2-cup one that works perfectly)Get it hot and melted in the microwave.Add a bit of chopped onion or mushrooms or both.Microwave for 30 seconds.Whisk in 2 Tbsp.  flour.  Microwave for 45 seconds or so.Pour in 1 cup milk and whisk it.  It will be lumpy, but the lumps will dissolve with additional cooking.Now, microwave in 45-60 second increments, whisking after each increment, until sauce is thick and smooth.  It takes about 4 1-minute increments in my old feeble microwave.  Sure beats standing over the stove stirring stirring stirring!The benefits, as I see them:1.  no can of chemical-ly soup2.  local ingredients3.  fast (have I mentioned how fast this is?)4.  the children can do the microwaving and stirring!  They loved being involved like this and there's no open flame to worry about!the finished Make-Ahead Chicken CasseroleI think I would still make a traditional white sauce with a roux for the flavor if the sauce was going to be the star of the show in creamed spinach, say, or cheese sauce.So, anyway, besides the chicken casserole, the rest of Sunday dinner was cranberry applesauce, sauteed chard with balsamic vinegar and garlic, and then, for dessert cardamom cake (a Moosewood recipe, like pound cake, only laced with cardamom, walnuts, and cinnamon).  And we all sipped some decaf cardamom coffee, too (just add a pod or two of cardamom to coffee beans and grind them up together)."},

{"title": "Recent Kitchen Flops", "date": "Sunday, March 17, 2013", "text": "Since I was writing about the \"abundance of a certain material to make an impact\" in my last post, let's talk about my spate of kitchen flops as a blog post.  Here they are in order.1.  I didn't use my sourdough starter for a week or so because I made a batch of oatmeal bread with regular ol' yeast for my mother who was convalescing from a terrible bout of flu.  The bread was like manna from heaven for her, so that warmed my heart.  But. But. But. I mixed up a batch of sourdough bread.  I left the sourdough loaves to rise overnight and in 12 hours, they had hardly risen. I, the old kitchen genius, baked them anyway and handily underbaked them while I was at it.  So they came out like bricks with doughy centers.  I'm pretending nothing is wrong and I just toast it before it gets eaten, but it's embarrassing.  I will not neglect my starter again!2.  Around the time of the pink living room, I made a batch of Jeni's black coffee ice cream that was truly the most divine thing I put in my mouth this year.  Then last week I made a second batch, dreaming of that flavor, and lo, I messed it up.  It acquired too much liquid (milk? water?  did I just totally space out and add water???) and it's so hard and ice-crystally and the intoxicating flavor is totally diluted.  Very sad.  Tonight I pried a few icy scoops out and added them to vanilla seltzer to make floats, but still sad.3.  I was charging through my excellent recipe for hot-and-sour soup when I reached in the back of the fridge to get my staple box of tofu and it was a frozen-solid brick.  Apparently the cold spot had gotten really cold.  Bless my husband for grabbing up a whiny kid and whipping out the car and returning with tofu in hand.  It wasn't exactly my fault, but on the heels of these other flops, I was not cheered.4.  Yesterday I was making a lemon sponge pie when I realized I had poured in 2 1/2 cups of milk instead of 1 1/2 cups.  I was horrified.  All that butter, eggs, sugar, wasted?  I had nothing to lose, so I poured off a cup of the filling and baked it beside the pie like a custard.  I actually put it in the fridge and did not look at it yet - maybe it's a sauce?   The pie itself was oozy and watery around the edges, so I put it in the freezer for an hour before I served it today and guess what?! It was fine!  The flavor was not diluted too much and the custard was just set from the freezer. Want to share any of your recent kitchen woes?  I could use another laugh."},

I want to look around and see what abundant odd materials I have and make a design statement in that manner.  Ahem.  Toilet paper tubes.  Right."},
{"title": "Soft-Boiled Eggs", "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "text": "For years I avoided soft-boiled eggs because I thought they were runny. I don't like runny egg yolk - just a weird quirk of mine.  Then I saw a photo on The Kitchn of congee with an egg that I suddenly realized was soft-boiled and I wanted to eat it.So I made congee in my slow cooker overnight.  It's 1 cup of rice cooked very slowly for hours in lots of liquid until it makes porridge.  I had heard of it before and was curious.  We weren't crazy about it.  I think it falls under the comfort-foods-you-have-to-grow-up-with-to-love category.I served the congee for breakfast with a softboiled egg on top.  Suddenly I knew what people were talking about when they said \"two-minute eggs\" (all those British novels, all these years - now I know!).  Turns out, I really like two-minute eggs; I think softboiled eggs can be even runnier, though, right?  The way I made my soft-boiled eggs was to start as if making hardboiled eggs:  cold eggs in cold water to cover over low-medium heat.  When they came to a gentle boil, I timed the soft-boiled eggs for 2-3 minutes (for hardboiled eggs, I turn off the heat and let the eggs sit undisturbed for 15 minutes).This was also over the time that Ben was just recovering from the yuck, and he was quite pleased to have an egg and a slice of white toast, homemade whole wheat toast being a bit too rough for his stomach yet.  I boiled his solitary egg in a tiny little pot from a cooking set my mother-in-law got for the children (from Ikea, I think).  And I was glad for all my odd little saucers, ramekins, limoncello glasses, and espresso cups to serve him tiny portions in adorable style.He's now back to regular boy eating and stayed at the table a full 30 minutes after the rest of us at lunch today, eating and eating and eating.  He cleaned up a bunch of leftovers for me.  I love it."},

Make dulce de leche (caramelized sweetened condensed milk, beloved of Latin America):Open 14-oz. can of sweetened condensed milk.  Scrape it all into a canning glass pint jar or 2 half-pint jars.  Put on the lid and screw on the ring.  Place in saucepan with water to cover the lid by an inch (or put it in the crockpot with water to cover - my crockpot wasn't deep enough, so I used the stove method).  Bring to a simmer with the lid on and keep at a simmer for 2-3 hours, until milk has turned a deep tan.  Allow to cool before opening - either carefully take the hot jar out of the hot water or else let the whole business cool down. This is now dulce de leche.  It will keep for several weeks in the fridge.2. Make a graham cracker crust:Combine:1 1/3 cup graham cracker crumbs2 Tbsp. sugar1/4 cup melted butter1/4 tsp. freshly grated nutmeg1/4 tsp. saltPress into 9\" pie plate to form crust.  Bake at 375 for 8 minutes.  Cool completely (can be made ahead of time and tightly bagged and frozen or kept at room temperature for several days).3. Assemble pie.Spread about 2/3 (about a half-pint) of the dulce de leche in graham cracker crust (or use the whole thing and fewer bananas).  This is tricky to spread thick glop on a crumby crust.  The crumbs that got mixed into the dulce de leche didn't bother us, but you could warm the dulce de leche slightly to make it more spreadable.  Slice over top:  2-3 ripe bananasWhip in chilled bowl with chilled beaters:  1 cup heavy whipping cream.  As it is taking shape, sprinkle in gradually 2 Tbsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract.  Spread whipped cream over bananas.  Chop up some semisweet or bittersweet chocolate to equal 1/2 cup.  Sprinkle artistically on top of the whipped cream.  Serve immediately or chill for a few hours.  The pie loses its loveliness after that and weepy liquid will appear in the bottom - but don't despair, the flavor is still there!  The sugar stabilizes the cream well enough that it will be fine the next day."},

I was very embarrassed, as I had never hidden things from him before.  Just before Valentine's Day, he put a big box wrapped in comics and a bow on the table for me.  It was a three-pound bag of chips.  Yes, three pounds.

{"title": "We Have Achieved a Pink Living Room", "date": "Sunday, February 17, 2013", "text": "Well, the flu did get me, and then we painted our living room pink.  It's nice to be back on the blog!  Around the time Genevieve was born, we painted the living room a mushroom color, which I chose because it was between brown and gray and might go with anything.  It did look nice with the creamy trim and the stone fireplace.  My  husband and I figured we'd get a vision for the living room sooner or later.Then we got our twin red sofas and I sewed chartreuse drapes.  The mushroom walls did not assist the aura of the room, you know?  We wanted a wall color that played nicely with the drapes and kept the focus on the red sofas.  Pink!  Very pale pink, like the inside a seashell.My husband and I, with help from friends and family, have done all our own painting over the years on our fixer-upper.  We save our home-repair dollars for the projects we don't have the expertise for.But there was a lot of choreographing to get this room painted, let me tell you.  We arranged babysitting part of the time.  I made sure the freezer was stocked with easy food to keep our morale up and dinner for our Sunday guests.  I made a list of every task that needed to be done, what day it needed to be done on, and possibly how long that task might take.  The idea was to have the children around as little wet paint as possible, and to have the room torn apart for 2 days only.We did it.We're exhausted.  The living room looks fabulous.  But I must say, as we applied the first coat of paint (Benjamin Moore's \"Gentle Blush\"), the living room looked scarily pink, like a little girl's nursery.  We were dismayed, but we painted doggedly on and reminded ourselves how rigorously we had chosen our color.  Amazingly enough, once the dropcloths were put away and the furniture and drapes were back in place, the pink settled down into the background where we wanted it. We were only planning to touch up the trim, but our standard trim color (Benjamin Moore's Navajo White) suddenly looked sickly green next to the pink; we wanted creamy white.  So I made an emergency trip to our paint store, got their expert help, and we painted the living room trim Mascarpone.  Much better."},

Bake 10 degrees warmer than the recipe originally called for OR add 5-10 minutes to the original baking time using the original baking temperature.  Method 2. Allow dough to rise, allow shaped buns to rise to the point where you would bake them.  Then, instead, wrap the pan up tight and freeze them.  The day before you want them, put the frozen buns in their pan in the fridge for 12 or so hours.  Then, bake the same way as #1.Isn't that handy?  I made sticky buns using method #2 on Christmas morning because there were so many festivities piled up that I couldn't bear the thought of fiddling with sticky buns on Christmas eve evening.Sticky buns in the pan, just before baking.Now, here is a bread-freezing trick that I tried over Christmas that did not work for me.  I parbaked French bread and froze it, so that I could bake it another day and have hot bread then.  The first time, the parbaking, I baked the loaves just until they were taking on color.  When I baked the bread a second time, it kept its doughy, underdone center no matter how long I baked it and how dark the crust was getting.  Not successful!  So, now you know."},

I saw an idea from Martha Stewart for cranberry cobbler, but I didn't put enough sugar in and it was terribly sour, even with ice cream.  But so pretty!  But sour. Then I made pickled cranberries, partly because they called for juniper berries and I was curious.  I was so disappointed that the juniper berries did not announce their presence in the pickled cranberries that I thought I didn't like the pickled cranberries.  They do really taste like a sweet pickle to me, except that there's cranberry influence.  But the flavor is not exotic.  We were not crazy about adding the marinade to seltzer.  Apparently, a vinegar drink is a shrub, a drinking vinegar.  I like vinegar, but I was suddenly reminded of a time when I was plagued with UTIs (no more details needed!) and one of the remedies was drinking vinegar if cranberry juice was not around.  I do not want to remember those days. I guess I'm biased against shrubs.I do like these pickled cranberries, although they are a bit too tart and puckery to eat on their own; they are marvelous with bread and cheese, next to chicken and turkey, or any bland winter meal that needs a kick. Any other cranberry experiments I should do?  I still have some bags in my freezer."},

One of my burning questions: Grandma, how did you make your Christmas bread? I asked my mom and several aunts to see if they knew where the recipe came from. Luckily for me, Aunt Elena had copied it down and she generously went out of her way to get it to me.  She warned me that the bread never rose very well for her. Grandma made this bread every Christmas.  It has a mixed reception in the family.  I wasn't sure I remembered the exact taste, but I have a very clear memory of Tampa, Florida, in the 1980s at Aunt Elena's house on a quiet street in a development, on a shiny, sunny Christmas morning.  I was standing next to the counter close to the screened-in porch, there was a toaster, and it was scenting up the kitchen toasting Christmas bread. Cousins were running and screaming everywhere and I was wearing shorts in the middle of winter.  Lovely.So I hunted around for the weird fruit-ish things in this bread and started a batch.  Then, I googled the name, \"Russian Kulich,\" which was also written on the recipe.  Turns out, it's Russian Easter bread.  Now I have another burning question for Grandma:  Grandma, how did this Russian Easter recipe get into our Swiss-German family and why do you make it at Christmas, not Easter?In 1994, I was in Russia over Easter time and I do recall eating a tall, eggy white bread.  I do not recall fruit in the bread, but it was a gorgeously elaborate Orthodox Easter, so I'm sure I've forgotten some details. I am so pleased with this bread; it's delicately fruity and not overly sweet.  We had our bread toasted with butter, alongside grapefruit halves and homemade eggnog.  Ben worked very hard with the grapefruit knife for the first time, a pleasant little kitchen chum. It was the perfect winter white morning outside, and then the sun broke over the breakfast table.Russian Kulich - Grandma's Christmas Bread1 cup milk1/2 cup sugar1/4 cup butter2 tsp. salt2 Tbsp. yeast1/4 cup warm water2 eggs2 cups white-whole-wheat flour3 cups unbleached all-purpose flourgrated rind of 1 large lemongrated rind of 1 orange1/2 cup chopped almonds1/4 cup dark raisins1/2 cup citron (fruit cake mix)1/4 cup chopped candied cherriesoil1.  In a saucepan, heat milk until almost boiling.  Turn off heat.  Add sugar, butter, and salt.  Stir.  Set aside to cool to lukewarm.2.  Combine yeast with warm water in large bowl.  Add lukewarm milk mixture and eggs.  3.  Add 1 1/2 cups flour, either kind, and beat well with a sturdy whisk for 2 minutes.4.  Add the zest, nuts, and fruits.  Stir.5.  Add enough flour to make a soft dough.  Knead 5-8 minutes, until satiny.  Form into a tight ball.6.  Lift up the ball of dough and pour a tablespoon of oil in the bowl.  Rub the dough in the oil and oil the dough and the bowl.  Put a damp kitchen towel over the dough in the bowl and allow to rise until nearly doubled - 1-2 hours or a little more.7.  Punch down and allow to rest for 10 minutes.  Form 3 loaves, oil them, and place in greased 8x5 bread pans.  Cover again with damp towel and allow to rise until almost double, maybe 1 hour.8.  Bake at 350 for 30-35 minutes.  Turn out of pans to cool completely.  Slice when cool.  Excellent toasted with butter.  Mom recalls that Grandma used to ice the tops of her loaves with confectioners sugar icing and then decorate them with cherries and green frosting leaves.Notes on the recipe:  a. You can replace the white whole wheat flour with white flour, but I would not use regular whole wheat flour in this recipe; this is a delicate, eggy bread and the white whole wheat flour is unobtrusive.b. Grandma's recipe called for candied orange peel, but I couldn't get my hands on any and didn't feel like making it; plus, I figured the fresh orange zest would give the bread a nice lift.c.  It's because this is a family recipe that I'm willing to use this crazy candied crap fruit.  It's loaded with preservatives, coloring, and other stuff I can't pronounce and am pretending not to see.  La la la la la, not listening!d.  Unlike Aunt Elena's, I think my bread rose just fine and baked up beautifully.  I made sure to give it plenty of time to rise, however. e.  If you're going to lose all your words and be left with just one, isn't it beautiful that the word is \"yes?\"  I love you, Grandma.  I love making your bread and tasting memories."},

Ben had never been in an airplane before and had begged for a ride, and then one of our friends wanted to keep his license in practice, and thus, the gift materialized!

Watson, although I did not bother to test the finished bars with pH strips, nor did I get completely suited with protective gear when I handled the lye but rather acted with caution and purpose as my grandmothers would have.  I wore gloves and an old apron.    It was hard to find a tallow recipe that suited the amount I had, but I found one at Miller's Soap that I halved, check on a lye calculator, and used:Tallow Blend Soap22 oz. tallow10 oz. olive oil10 oz. coconut oil5.8 oz. lye crystals16 oz. distilled waterThe soap is pale green because when I make stock, I add vegetable tops and the resulting stock and fat has a shade of green in it.  I did not add scent because I love subtly scented soap such as shea butter, honey, oatmeal, or goat's milk.Now the soap is sitting on its plant nursery tray in a closet to cure.  It is drying out and hardening up some more.  I can't wait to get out the first bar next year!  There was a little piece stuck in the corner of the plastic bag, so I stuck that on my kitchen bar and it seems to be quite nice.  I'm a little surprised that I made soap and it works!  I'm adding this to my list of homemaking skills and probably when I've saved enough waste-fat, I'll make soap again."},
{"title": "2 Tips for School Mornings", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "After a nice Thanksgiving break, the children are back to school this week.  It really was a pleasant break and I did not spend it wishing for it to be over.Here are two organizational tips for school that have been making our lives easier:When I remember, I jot down what's available for school lunches that might not be readily obvious.  Sandwiches are always an option, so I don't bother to put them on the list.  I learned the trick for creating an easy white-board when I was the teacher in study hall years ago and had to generate many seating charts:  use a vinyl sheet-protector and slide a sheet of paper in it. Use a dry-erase marker on it, just write and wipe like you would on a white board.  (I just looked at the package I bought - these things are called \"document pockets\" and they are side-loading, meant to be put in three-ring binders). The second tip comes from my husband.  He made this visual by putting masking tape labels around the clock in our dining room to help Genevieve see what getting ready for school looks like.  It dovetails with the unit on how to tell time she is doing at school.  The times don't correspond exactly with the reality of a school morning (there is no freakin' way it only takes my children 10 minutes to eat a meal - 10 hours is more like it), but it's been helpful to point to the clock and urge Genevieve on.  One of the lovely things about vacation, actually, was ignoring the clock in the mornings and putzing around in our jammies.  We are trying to teach the children how to get into quick, efficient mode when it's called for (school mornings, apppointments, bedtime, etc.), but allowing them to linger and lollygag other times."},

{"title": "Hearty Oatmeal Pancakes Using Whey", "date": "Monday, November 19, 2012", "text": "Greek yogurt is easy to love, right?  You don't have to pay its pricey price and deal with all the little plastic cups, though!  All you need to do is strain off some of the liquid (which is whey) in regular yogurt.  I line a strainer with cheesecloth and set it over a bowl; other people hang it up in a bag similar to making jelly; still other people use a coffee filter.﻿And then you have thick, Greek-style yogurt. . . and whey.  Don't throw it away!  The whey is super-nutritious.  My favorite way to use it is in pancakes, but I've been looking around for additional uses.  I'd welcome your suggestions in the comments, too.Hearty Oatmeal Pancakes, adapted from Simply in SeasonThe following mixture needs to soak for 8-12 hours; generally, this means mix this up the night before you want pancakes for breakfast.Mix together, cover, and leave at room temperature for 8-12 hours:2 cups rolled oats2 cups whey, plain yogurt, buttermilk, sour milk, or mixture of these*When you're ready to fry the pancakes, add and stir into the oat mixture:2 eggs1/4 cup oilAdd and stir just until mixed:1/2 cup whole wheat flour1 tsp. baking powder1 tsp. baking soda1/4 tsp. saltBatter will be very thick.  Place a glop on a hot, lightly greased griddle and spread evenly and gently so the pancake is not too thick - I make these pancakes on the small side (5\" diameter or less) or they break when I flip them.  When bubbles appear in the middle and the edges look a bit set, flip.  Makes 6-8 pancakes.*Sometimes I only have yogurt on hand, so I use at least a cup of yogurt and then fill up the measure with milk.  Also, note that the whey used here is sometimes called \"sweet whey\" to distinguish it from acid whey which comes from making cheese; I don't have any experience with acid whey. Ever freeze berries and then not know what to do with them?  I do.  Thanks to Amy at Angry Chicken, we have a new favorite use for frozen berries:  warm some frozen berries in maple syrup or pancake syrup in a small pan on the stove.  The berries will color and flavor the syrup as they thaw - give it maybe 10 minutes to turn into a lovely fruity syrup.   You could further mash up the berries a bit, but I don't usually bother because, by then, I am ravenous.  I took lots more photos than these, but they were all blurry from my low-blood-sugar shakes and the low light of early Saturday morning.  Eat your fruity syrup over pancakes with peanut butter or over, you know, Greek yogurt."},

{"title": "Pumpkin Bread Sandwiches - updated with recipe!", "date": "Tuesday, November 13, 2012", "text": "I made up this packed lunch idea out of my own head, not out of Pinterest, which sometimes seems remarkable these days. I simply put cream cheese between 2 slices of pumpkin bread, wrap tidily in waxed paper, tuck in a plastic bag, and freeze.  Don't freeze bread in waxed paper alone as it would get too dried out.When I pack a lunch in the morning, I just pull out a frozen waxed-paper wrapped sandwich and put it in the bag.  By lunchtime, it's nicely thawed.My pumpkin bread recipe has whole wheat flour, raisins and nuts in it, but I usually fill out the lunch with crunchy vegetables, fruits, and protein.  Here are three menus for a child-sized lunch:Menu 1:pumpkin bread/cream cheese sandwichroasted chickpeasappleMenu 2:pumpkin bread/cream cheese sandwichpopcorncarrot coins & celery sticksMenu 3:pumpkin bread/cream cheese sandwichhard-boiled eggpretzels ****updated with recipe (I don't mind at all posting it, but I didn't know if you wanted the recipe because there are a million out there! So please, anytime you want a recipe, just ask.  I don't believe in secret recipes.) Pumpkin Bread - modified from Simply in Season In a mixing bowl, mix together and make a well in the center:1 cup whole wheat pastry flour1 cup all-purpose flour1 cup whole wheat flour1 cup wheat germ or oat bran1 cup white sugar1 cup brown sugar2 tsp. baking soda1 1/2 tsp. salt2 tsp. ground cinnamon3/4 tsp. ground ginger1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg1/4 tsp. ground cloves Separately, lightly beat 4 eggs.  Then add to the well in the flour mixture. Also, to the well, add:2 1/2 cups cooked, pureed winter squash such as butternut, liquid drained off1/2 cup vegetable oil3/4 cup chopped nuts3/4 cup raisins Use a large spoon to gently mix the liquids and flour mixture.  Mix together until just combined; a few streaks of flour is preferable to overmixed, tough bread!  Pour batter into 2 well-greased 9x5 loaf pans.  Bake at 350 for 45-60 minutes.  At 45 minutes, stick a toothpick or cake tester in the very center of a loaf; it must come out clean for the loaves to be done baking.  Keep baking and checking in 5 minute increments until the tester is clean.  Quick breads must be perfectly baked to be good!   Cool in the pan for 10 minutes when done baking.  Loosen the edges of the loaves with a knife, and then turn out onto wire racks to finish cooling.  Slice when cool.   Serve with cheese, cream cheese, or apple butter. A note about the flours in this recipe:  I would keep the all-purpose flour at 1 cup, but you can use white whole wheat flour for the rest; or, if you don't have WW pastry flour, you can use half all-purpose and half regular WW flour.  If you don't have WW pastry flour, I highly recommend trying it; it's a great way to get whole grains in baked goods with the chemical leaveners (baking soda and baking powder) because it keeps a light texture.  Don't use WW pastry flour with yeast, however; white whole wheat flour is great for that."},

But no more!  Now I have a little envelope tucked away in my top drawer, with all my needles in whatever thread I used last, ready for the next little handsewing job.  I think I have a new skylight in my mind!Then there was the issue of my handsewing carried on the bus and elsewhere.  I had been putting my needle and thread and thimble in a little plastic saffron jar in my handwork bag, but it would get so tangled and I'm sure the plastic was blunting the needle tip.So I made a traveling needle case.First I made a little green pocket for the thimble.  Then I had a better idea (during church, I confess).  I took the turtle pocket off.  I made a second little envelope for the thimble, attached to the mother-ship case by a ribbon.  Then I died all over again from the cuteness.  Notes:  1. The wool is felted sweater scraps from the creative re-use store.2. I got the idea for this needle case on Pinterest, but when I followed the link, I needed to pay $9 for the pattern, so I eyeballed my own and changed some things up.3.  The interior scenic fabric is from this nightgown.  I love the fabric so much.4.  The other interior fabric, the blue rosebuds, is from Jean from church who gave me a bag of fabric and patterns.  I do love found fabric!5.  I do not own a pinking shears.  I borrowed a pair from my mother-in-law to make the stamp.  The shears belonged to her grandmother.6.  The blue chambray envelope exteriors are from a scrap of Ben's quilt backing.7.  The green turtles came from a scrap of Rebecca's daughter's blouse; I also used it to make a pencil roll for a friend, only knowing that her favorite color was green, not that turtles were a sign of God's love after her mother's death.So you see, these little needle cases carry the freight of many people's love and memories.  And the cases are cute!

Cut the whole apple in thirds, top to bottom, turn it 90 degrees, and cut it in thirds top to bottom again.  This makes the core in its own little square in the middle.  Keep the pieces together like a puzzle and put a rubber band around the whole apple.  There's a cored, sliced apple that will not brown until it's time to eat!  We like this so much better than using Fruit Fresh or lemon juice on apple slices.Linking up with Eat, Make, Grow blog hop."},

I shop at a regular store when my list is long enough or has several urgent items on it and I can combine it with other errands.  I have an extensive pantry and no plans to reduce it; it would appear that I lived through the Great Depression and turned into a hoarder.  I am exaggerating, but I am a better cook and better shopper when I do it this way.I get the vibe of the week as it progresses, so I add to the menu list as we approach the weekend. I take Sunday dinner pretty seriously, so I like to plan that, and then Friday and Saturday fall into line to use up the rest of the produce. I never write down 7 menus at the beginning of the week (but I was raised by a mother who did). art in the sink after a busy cooking sessionHowever, my biggest resource for menu planning is my supper notebook, where I (most of the time) jot down what we ate for supper and where the recipes came from. I highly recommend a supper notebook to anyone who wants to plan menus!Sometimes I get menu block; I start flipping through the supper notebook, and pretty soon I come up several possibilities.  The notebook shows me our seasonal eating patterns, gives me the source book or website for recipes we liked, reminds me of good menus for company or carried-out meals, and gives me a sense of accomplishment and rich family life.  I started this notebook in 2008 a few months after Ben was born.  It's priceless.  It has been such a help in my kitchen.  Wouldn't it be clever if I could condense this post into a tidy outline?  I can't.  It's a frank overview of how I really, actually, menu-plan, and I wrote it in reponse to a reader request.But here are the main points of my menu planning style:1. loose plans 2. with backup plans 3. extensive pantry 4. the supper notebook  Anything you want me to explain more?  And,  how do you decide what to eat at your house?"},

(A useful side lesson:  sewing with fringe trim is tricky.) I wanted the bunting to look good from both sides, so I sewed together two triangles of the fabric that had a wrong side.   I strung the bunting around the dining room for the party, but had to take it out on the balcony this morning to try to get a better photo.  I'll get it out for Ben's birthday in the spring; he is pleased that it makes the dining room look like a used car lot."},

{"title": "The Weird Art of Washing Plastic Bags", "date": "Sunday, October 14, 2012", "text": "I do wash and reuse plastic bags, except for ones with holes or that held raw meat.  I decline plastic bags everywhere I shop, but plastic bags still enter my house in various ways.  It's OK - I still find them handy for certain jobs.  But I try to think of plastic bags as containers to be washed and used again, not just trashed after one use.The problem is:  how do you wash a bag?  I have been washing bags for years, so I've had lots of time to hone my mad skilz.  Please don't think I'm loony for blogging about this.  The hidden skills of homemaking, you know (hat-tip to The Hidden Art of Homemaking).Here's how I do it:1.  Drop the dirty bags in the sink to wait with the other dirty dishes.2.  Place a dirty bag in the dishwater and fill it at least half-full with dishwater. Look for holes, which will arc water if they are small, and dribble continuously if they are slits (unlike water just running off the outside of the bag which slows to a drip very quickly).  If it has holes, I ditch the bag in the trash (to hopefully decompose after hundreds of years).3. If not, I swish and rub at the bag a bit in the dishwater and rinse it out by holding it open under a running faucet.4.  I plop the bags on my handy-dandy bag dryer, a gift from my sister.  Before that, I used a baby-bottle dryer or the spoons in my container by the stove.  5.  After an hour or few, when I walk through the kitchen again, I turn the flimsiest, biggest bags inside out to finish drying.   I don't bother doing this with stiffer bags like freezer bags or ziplocs. They are usually dry within the hour. I just discovered the bag-flipping trick this year.  Before that, it could take days for the bags to dry because the wet insides would just stick to themselves and no air could get in.I'd love to hear your thoughts on this - and any other bag-washing tips you have!"},

She also finds loose bits tricky to deal with as she wipes up.8. organize an area such as a drawer or desk of art suppliesOh, I tried so hard to make progress on this goal!  But I think I still needed to dial down my instructions and make the tasks smaller.  We made very little progress on this goal.Trying to sort the toys - poor dear.  Where is her mother?Goals for the 4-year-old1.  dust/wipe the stepsHe does this well, but with excruciating slowness.2.  fold  laundryHe can do this job with his sister without weeping.  He is remembering basic folding patterns from session to session, although he struggles to execute them.  Of course!  He's four!3.  sweep a sidewalkHis daddy supervised this goal usually on days when I was at my job.  He can do a pretty good job with some coaching.  His speed and focus have improved. Ben has also become very good at taking all the rugs outside and shaking them so someone can vacuum.  Both children were excellent helpers with canning and preserving. Genevieve has become accustomed to drying dishes, and very soon, I will start her on washing.  She adores the idea of having her hands in all that water. This post was so helpful for me, because when I glanced at the list of goals at the end of the summer, I only noticed the goals that we had not progressed very far on.  Perish the thought -  we made good progress this summer!"},

But really, as I should know, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.Any bread is excellent with Nutella, iced cafe au lait, and peaches.  This Nutella is not homemade.  I have other kitchen projects I want to spend my limited time on, so my family just ate a jar of tasty chemicals.  There wasn't really a savings of money, although I could use local cream when I made Nutella.  I am glad to know how to make nut butter in my food processor with the hazelnuts (although I found out that almonds don't work the same way).  I guess I am trying to tell you that I am not a slave to thrift.  It's usually fun and satisfying for me to make things, but it's not my god.I'm getting unpacked from a fun weekend and scrabbling around with school supplies.  Stay tuned!"},

{"title": "Thoughts on French Kids Eat Everything", "date": "Tuesday, July 24, 2012", "text": "I just finished French Kids Eat Everything, mostly in little spells while I rode the bus to my job.Here are my somewhat random thoughts because I'm still sorting out the effects of the book.  It's basically the food/eating rules the French use, codified by a Canadian mother (Karen Le Billon) when she and her French husband took their children to live in France for a year.1.  \"Taste training\" is a brilliant way to sum up what I'm trying to do with my kids.  In fact, it applies to more than just food.  I want to educate them on good taste which, admittedly, is far more subjective than it used to be.  I don't automatically think it's cute when they wear mismatched clothes or want to put ketchup on everything; I'm not rigid about it, but I do want to teach my children what goes together and why.  My husband, you should know, thinks this is a little too detailed.  I'm sure our parenting balances out!2.  I do agree with the French philosophy of no snacks, in sharp contrast to the multiple small meals many American nutritionists recommend.  I had already cut back on giving the kids snacks because I was lazy, but now I realize it is making them much hungrier at meals, which are more balanced than snacks.  \"Hunger is the best sauce,\" you know.3.  I do wish I lived in France.  I think.  I'm not usually a Francophile, but so many of the ways I appreciate life match up to what people say goes on in France.  I've only been in France for a few days, but I did live in Germany for a bit and spent 3 weeks in Switzerland.  4.  I love how calmly French people assume that children will learn to like all foods if they are exposed often enough.  I had already noticed that my children's favorite vegetable or fruit changes within minutes, so I don't pay much attention. 5.  We were getting terribly casual about table manners and eating together.  This book gives me impetus to get it together again.6.  But holy cow, I can't picture eating every meal at a table with a tablecloth with other people.  I'm American enough to like a quick sandwich sometimes, or to read while I eat alone.  I appreciate food and I am usually very deliberate about pairing dishes and making it look nice, even leftovers, but I have other things I want to do besides eat!7.  I find the picky eaters in this book tiresome.  I like Karen Le Billon for wanting to change her kids' eating habits, but I am annoyed and appalled at her spineless parenting.8.  And the Le Billon family's eating habits just about fall apart when they return to Canada.  This revs up my anxiety about my kids in school with the food issue - how will their home training stand up to the cold, bad world?  I managed to renew the book for another 2 weeks and asked my husband to read it. I'm still pondering things - I'll let you know if I have further thoughts.  And I welcome your thoughts!"},

{"title": "Sunday Dinner:  Tennessee Corn Pone in the Slow Cooker", "date": "Sunday, July 22, 2012", "text": "I have been having a slow cooker revival over here and I really must tell you about it.  I have had a large, 6.5 quart slow cooker for years, and I just got a smaller 3.5 quart so I could make more reasonably-sized recipes.  If you don't match the size of the recipe up to the slow cooker, it will not cook right.I wanted to make a vegetarian Sunday dinner because we were eating dinner out with friends, but when I looked through my supper notebook, I couldn't really find any.  Apparently we eat most of our meat on summer Sundays.The menu I came up with:Tennessee Corn Pone in the slow cookersalsa, hot saucegreen salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, and French dressingfrying cheeseplum tart with homemade vanilla ice creamTennesse Corn Pone (modified from Recipes from the Old Mill by Sarah Myers and Mary Beth Lind)Have ready:2-3 cups juicy, well-seasoned beans or thin chili*If possible, put it in the slow cooker and heat on high for 1 hour. Mix in bowl:1 cup cornmeal1 tsp. baking soda1/2 tsp. saltMix separately:2 cups buttermilk or yogurt thinned with milk1 egg2 Tbsp. melted butterAdd the wets to the dry and stir just until combined.  Put juicy beans in the slow cooker if they're not there already.  Pour the cornmeal batter directly into the juicy beans (heated or not).  Lay a double layer of paper towels across the top of the crock.  Put the lid down on these so that they are just beneath the lid - to catch the condensation.  Cook on low for 3 hours without peeking.  There will be a solid casserole in there, with a solid cornbread top.  Slow cookers do vary, so check it earlier to be on the safe side, although I saw a recipe online that recommended 5 hours on low.Serve with toppings, if desired, such as salsa, chopped cilantro, sour cream, etc.*For the beans, I usually season leftover beans with onions, garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, sugar, salt, pepper, cayenne, and a smidge of liquid smoke.  Variations include chili, salsa beans, and black-eyed peas in cream sauce.I thought the cornbread layer was a bit thick - it's usually fine when I make corn pone in the oven, but I might try halving the cornbread part if I make it again in the slow cooker.   (For the oven:  bake at 425 for 30 minutes, but the slow cooker will keep your house much cooler!)And then we had dinner with friends, way out in the country, and drove home in a cool, serene dusk."},

Are these tucks? In some patterns, these are elongated things that blend into the line - what are they called?  I thought the blouse called for something more fresh and casual - and it turns out my tuck-things can look like a maternity blouse, too.  Not a good look when you're going to your husband's 20th high-school-class reunion.Still and all, I felt chic in my skinny jeans and homemade silk blouse. Thanks to my husband for these photos, snapped just before I left for work one morning."},

{"title": "The Easiest Rhubarb Sauce Ever on Toned-Down Baked Oatmeal", "date": "Wednesday, May 23, 2012", "text": "A Preface:  My family is not terribly keen on rhubarb, but it is local, healthy, and cheap.  It will be making an appearance on our table.  No one is allowed to complain, but no one chooses rhubarb for their birthday meal.I recently discovered that the apples I had been buying all winter were not local since January.  And the potatoes that I thought came from a local farm, had been shipped in from California until the local potatoes are ready in two weeks.  Unfortunately, both products were presented in a way that made me think they were local.  I think it's fine to ship food within reason (I love lemons, for example), but I am very firmly against lack of information and the sense of entitlement to any food in any season.  Hence, it seems reasonable to me to eat rhubarb and strawberries right now.Easiest Rhubarb Sauce1. Chop 1 pound of rhubarb into rough 1-2\" pieces.  Place in casserole.  2. Pour in 1/4 or 1/3 cup sugar.  Cover.  3. Bake at whatever temperature your other stuff is baking, for about 20-30 minutes.  The rhubarb should be completely soft, some of it dissolved into shreds.  It is not attractive.  4. Allow to cool.  Puree in blender or with a stick blender.  Consider adding a drop (a drop!) of red food coloring. (I resisted temptation in these photos.)  5. Serve warm or chilled, just as you would applesauce.  And if you like to jazz up applesauce with ginger or cinnamon or something, you could probably do that here too.  Or serve as a sauce over dessert biscuit or tapioca.I served it for breakfast with a new variation of baked oatmeal that I am in love with.  I cut the sugar back even more, axed the cinnamon, and added a smidge of vanilla.  The idea came from Marilou's Favorite Oatmeal Cookies.  For simplicity's sake, I'll just re-type the oatmeal recipe here.Margo's Toned-Down Baked OatmealIn blender, mix very well on  high:2 eggs1 c. milk1/4 c. oil1/4 c. plain  yogurt1/3 c. brown sugar2 tsp. baking powder1 tsp. salt1/4 tsp. vanillaGrease a 9x9 baking dish.Pour in 3 c. quick oatmeal (I use part rolled oats).

(Wow, the things they discreetly keep from the bride; what else don't I know about my wedding?)Furthermore, I did not realize that a sleeveless dress has a different armscye than a short-sleeved dress.  I recut the armscye and tried to make new facings which were essentially strips of fabric, not the convex shape they need to be. Straining fabric in odd places - uncomfortable and very homemade looking.To top it off, I put an invisible zipper down the back without using an invisible zipper foot.  In all of this I was pretty much gloriously oblivious.  I told my shameful story to my mother-in-law, a sympathetic listener who also happens to be an excellent seamstress and caretaker of history.  I didn't realize that she had saved my sister-in-law's dress!  She offered me the bridesmaid dress she had laid away in storage which she was thinking of cutting up to make a dress for Genevieve.  I gave her the botched dress to cut up instead.  Now I have a historic bridesmaid dress and I am not going to screw this one up.  So it might be a couple years before you see it, until I know a little bit more about dress making.Care to share any of your sewing flops?  Just think of all the Terrible Warnings we could profit from."},

{"title": "Lemon Poppyseed Muffins - Easy and Healthy Enough for Breakfast", "date": "Friday, April 20, 2012", "text": "Remember when I was looking for a recipe for lemon poppyseed muffins?  Oh my word, it was exactly a year ago! (What is going on? Help me analyze this).I didn't find one (then!) that was easy or healthy enough for breakfast.  I guess I'm picky about muffins.  I like to eat them for breakfast or snacks.  I like them healthy (why?  I'm not sure - \"muffin\" just says \"not indulgent\" to me).  I like them to be straightforward; if I want fancy, I'll make scones or a yeast-raised treat.I made the millet muffins in Heidi Swanson's Super Natural Every Day.  They were much too rich, and used butter.  I maintain that oil works best in quick breads and muffins (but quick breads are tricky to bake without the middle being goopy and the edges too dark).  However, I loved the texture of the millet in the muffins.And I got serious and fiddled with recipes until I got one I like.  Straightforward.  Healthy. Easy enough for breakfast (no lemon glaze, which seems to be the popular approach to lemon poppyseed muffins).Thrift at Home Lemon Poppyseed Muffins - makes 12-16Mix together dry ingredients:1 cup whole wheat pastry flour3/4 cup all-purpose flour1/2 cup sugar1/4 cup dry uncooked millet3 tsp. poppy seedsgrated zest from one large lemon1 tsp. baking powder1/2 tsp. baking soda1/2 tsp. saltSeparately, mix together the wet ingredients and whisk well:1 cup plain yogurt (if you're using Greek yogurt or very thick yogurt, dilute with milk to make the consistency of thick buttermilk)1 egg1/4 cup vegetable oiljuice of one lemonGently combine the wet and dry ingredients, stirring just until mostly mixed - lumps and floury bits are fine (tough muffins from overmixing are not fine).Fill paper-lined muffin cups 2/3 full.Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes, until muffin tops spring back when gently touched.  Cool in pan for 5 minutes, then remove to finish cooling.The next recipe revision upped the baking powder a little.  Better puff.In my experience, adding uncooked millet to baked goods is like adding nuts.  It's not part of the flour chemistry.  If you don't have uncooked millet, I think you can safely leave it out of these muffins.  I keep millet on hand for this casserole and this hot cereal, if you need a gentle push towards buying millet. I like my family to eat more grains than just wheat, rice, and oats."},

I dye things in my big enamel canner on the stove.  I heat up 3 gallons of water plus a cup of salt.  2. Pour in the dye - either liquid or powder.  3. Separately, wet the cloth thing that you want to dye.  Have a stainless steel spoon nearby to stir, and then lower the wet cloth into the dyebath.  4. Stir well, being very careful not to splash.  Keep the dyebath hot and stir often for 30-60 minutes.  5. Carefully pour off the hot dye in a stainless steel sink (porcelain or composites could be dyed!).  Use the spoon to get out the hot dyed cloth, or gently dump it in the sink.  Don't splash!!!  6. Put on latex gloves (unless you fancy your hands dyed).  Rinse the dyed cloth under cool water until the water is mostly clear.  7. Transfer to the washing machine and wash in cold water.  Dry on high heat to help set the dye.  I have also just run the dyed cloth through the rinse and spin cycle, and then put it in the dryer.8.  Be careful to wash dyed things with very similar colors the first few times you wash them as some of mine have bled a little bit then.I accidentally overdyed this toweling when I washed it with my blue tablecloth.  Luckily it turned out nicely!"},

Three checkbooks to balance once a month.  There are appointments and phone calls to make.4.  However, in February, I clean out last year's files, so that takes a few hours longer.a.  I remove all of last year's bills from our 2-drawer filing cabinet (but leave any documents in the file that pertain to more than a calendar year).b.  I put it all in envelopes, labeling them with the year and the number of envelopes.  I've found that the times we've needed a paper from an old year, it was not too hard to find the stack from the file.  Therefore, I don't separate and label each individual file.  Most of the time, information we need is on our tax papers.c.  Then I stick the envelopes in filing boxes in a closet.  I keep 7 years, which is the minimum the IRS wants for an audit.  I shred older years.  Today I shredded 2003, and found my summer paystubs that solved the mystery of what year it was that I worked at the Amish museum.d. Two files are permanent:  our major home renovation with plans, receipts, permits; the list and paperwork of our former tenants.e.  Then I say to myself, \"self, what treat would please you, as a reward for all this hard, adult work?\"5.  In March (it happened this week), I organize all our receipts and deductions that were accumulating in the file over the previous year for tax purposes - another hour or so of work.  Then my husband takes it from there.What I did in my inbox this week:A. entered children's dentist appointments in online calendar - recycled cardB. opened mail - recycled envelopes and junk mail, set bills in inboxC. entered automatic payments for phone and electric in checkbook register - deleted notification emailsD. renewed car registration online, filed paperworkE. made half-hearted inquiries into preschools for BenF. wrote a check for a charitable donation - mailed itG. filed statement for retirement accountHow do you handle the flow of paper/mail/filing in your house?"},

I've seen them worn over tee shirts! The one I'm wearing here is actually reversible to the navy gingham. The gingham ties are too fat, but I wore the collar anyway because I was so thirsting for a little twist in my wardrobe.  I want to use some of my pretty orphan buttons to fasten these too.Then I couldn't help myself and I made an unabashedly spring collar.  Most of the time, all I need is a little sewing therapy."},

Look, I enjoy the challenge of limiting myself only to local foods once a week and the meals really are delicious and enjoyable.However, the challenge of photographing the food in the literal dark days, and then saying something about it on the blog. . . . well, this cook needs some fresh ideas.  (And isn't that why spring follows winter?)And here, we have another vegetarian meal because I got off track with the theme.  And this vegetarian theme is something that I do easily and, I like to think, well (as opposed to the other  Dark Days' themes: desserts, one-pot, breakfast).Menu:  portobello pizzas with garlic, bell peppers, and fetagreen salad with shredded carrots, turnips, and radishes - vinaigrettehomemade rosemary noodles with brown butterHomemade noodles are not like dried semolina pasta.  They are really egg noodles, so they don't fit in very well with the Italian theme here.  Polenta would have been more Italian.These portobello pizzas were a hit and really not hard to make, although I did add an extra step to the recipe I used.4 portobello caps, steps removed, brushed clean1-1 1/2 cups thick pizza or spaghetti saucecheese (I used slices of mild goat feta)1/4 - 1/2 cup pizza toppings (I used chopped bell peppers from the freezer and chopped garlic)1. Grease a rimmed baking sheet.  Lay the caps on it.  Bake at 425 F for 15 minutes.  Flip.  Bake another 15 minutes.  Water will run out of the caps and sizzle.  You are drying the caps out a little - skip this step if you don't have time.2.  With the caps stem-side up, place the pizza toppings on as you would pizza.3.  Reduce oven heat to 375.  Return pizzas to oven. Bake 10-15 minutes, until heated through. (My pizza sauce was already hot so this didn't take long).4.  The tomato sauce juiced out onto the already blackened mushroom water.  It looked like a terrible mess, but when I took the pizzas off the sheet, I immediately put water into it.  After supper, it was a breeze to clean (or Mr. Thrift would have grumbled and left the scene).Then we sat at the table looking at Genevieve's love letter to The Sound of Music and ate fastnachts because it was Fat Tuesday.  The children wanted to know if Easter was tomorrow.  Oh no, children, there are still many dark dregs of winter left and a long wait until the glory of Easter.  Waiting.. . with flashes of spring all along the way."},

We loved this soup I made up.  I cooked the meaty lamb bone with water and a splash of vinegar for a few hours, being careful to shake the rich marrow out of the bone into the broth.  Added the soaked beans and a few garlic cloves.  At the end, added some chopped onion, home-canned tomatoes, rosemary, fennel, and salt and pepper.I made tortillas using this recipe - I have tried at least 4 recipes for tortillas and this is the one I kept and love.  It's become our all-purpose flatbread.We also had a gorgeous green salad with watercress, shredded turnips and honey mustard dressing (local honey, local horseradish)."},

I think.  Because I tried to recreate it at home and it was very good, but it wasn't moaning-good, third-helping good like it was at Thanksgiving.  So I have to ask:  did I love it at Thanksgiving because it was such an anomaly?  Was I over-impressed because I didn't know my little cousin could handle food like that?  Have you ever had a tastebud-blowing experience with food, and then the next time with that food was underwhelming?  Food is far more psychological than I give it credit for.But still, try this salad.  It's definitely in my top 10 food experiences. (Recipe notes:  Don't skimp on the cayenne!  I used proscuitto, and did not brown it. I ignored the tarragon and chives.  I tossed the cut apples in some vinegar so they wouldn't brown.)P.S.  See my sidebar for a link to a giveaway - you could win a pencil/pen roll from my etsy shop!"},

(If you're not using lean, grass fed beef, better fry it and drain off the grease.)2.  Put the beef in the slow cooker along with everything else except the yogurt and flour.  Mix.3.  Cook on low, covered, for 2 1/2-3 hours.  Break up any clumps of beef now.4.  Whisk together flour and yogurt.  Stir, stir, stir it into the beef mixture.  Clap the lid back on, turn the cooker to high, and allow it to cook until thickened, 20-30 minutes.I forgot to ask my family specifically what they thought of this meal, but they all ate enthusiastically and wrangled for the leftovers later.  And look, it soothed them to sleep, too.  Ah, Sunday afternoon, how I love you.(Specifically, the Dark Days elements:  local organic beef, stock made from aforesaid beef, local onions and mushrooms, homemade yogurt from local milk, local broccoli, home-canned local beets, locally made noodles (were the ingredients local?

(and easy to care for)", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2011", "text": "I have tried to take illustrative photos for this post several times over the past year - the problem is my black pans against the black stove.  So I'll entertain you with my crisp prose, ok?Why Cast Iron is Great1.  HEAVY  - things cook better, more evenly than in thin pans.2.  VERSATILE - Use cast iron pans anywhere there's heat:  stove top, oven, grill, campfire.3.  HEALTHY - Adds iron to your food every time! Don't we all love fortified food?How to Clean Your Cast Iron Skillet or Dutch Oven4.  Get any saucy stuff out by swishing briefly with water.  If food was cooked on, gently use a wire brush, scrub brush, or steel wool.  The pan should be free of food. 5.  Set the wet pan on the burner and heat until the water evaporates from the inside - stick around and watch it (I have forgotten and come back to scary smoke!).6.  Dip a rag or paper towel in grease (oil, shortening, lard, etc.) and rub it all over the inside of the pan.  It is now seasoned.Tips7. Using soap or soaking your pan in water will remove the layers of grease that are known as seasoning.  Just use plain water, heat, and grease to clean your pan.  Some things, like eggs, are not messy and you can just put your pan away again when it's cool - hooray for less cleaning!8. These pans are basically indestructible and only get better and more nonstick with age.  However, if you are starting with a newly manufactured pan, use metal spoons when you cook and be sure to scrape around a lot.  The newer cast iron is bumpier, and your metal utensils kind of buff out the surface and give it better seasoning.  I know this from experience - I have 4 old pieces, and one new one.9. I keep my cast iron in my oven drawer on a sheet of newspaper.  It leaves black smudges sometimes, so I keep it separate from my other pans in their pretty white drawer.Talk to me about your cast iron - are you a fan?  Do you care for yours differently? Questions?"},

{"title": "Easiest Grilled Corn on the Cob EVER", "date": "Friday, August 12, 2011", "text": "Remember when I told you how I grill corn?   Complicated and lengthy, relative to what I'm about to reveal to you.First I thought I had discovered the easiest way:Husk the corn down to the very last pale green slip, so the kernels are still covered, but only with one layer of husk.  Tug off what silk is sticking out the end, but no need to actually silk the ear or get all precise.Lay the ears on a hot grill - probably medium (my grill is so old that its setting is reduced to on or off).  Turn occasionally for 20-30 minutes, keeping the grill lid closed as much as possible to help the ears steam.  But the fire will also caramelize some of the kernels through the blackened husk.  It will also singe and spark in the silks, but don't worry, nothing will come of it.Pull back the remaining blackened husk at the table - a very messy job, clearly a family meal - and butter and salt.But WAIT:My friend Crystal discovered that you can grill naked corn!  Just husk the ears completely, rub or brush lightly with olive oil, and grill to your caramelization preference.  Unbelievably easy!  This is now how I do it.  Boiled corn, forsooth.It can't get easier than that unless we just eat it raw and actually, my husband made a fantastic corn salad the other week with raw sweet corn.  Ben keeps asking when we're having corn salad again.  So much good summer food, so little photography and posting about it.

(\"What kind?\" Genevieve wanted to know. Good heavens, is she old enough to start driving a bargain?!)I started with a chore chart because the children wanted a rag, wanted to vacuum, wanted to help put sheets on the bed, heck, wanted to help with anything I was doing.  I think children are initially attracted to adult work because of the novelty, but then they need to be taught how to actually do the job and then keep on doing it, even if they don't feel like it.  Genevieve habitually carries her dishes out to the kitchen after a meal without prompting, so I didn't put that on her job chart.  She is working on jobs that challenge her skills a little.  Ben, on the other hand, has a column for \"clear place setting.\"They have each earned a piece of candy so far.  Sometimes they remind me of the chart, and sometimes we don't talk about \"shiny stars\" for a few days.  I like how this is working for our children."},

The first time I made it, I added more macaroni and milk instead of  hardboiled eggs.  I have never used the full amount of chicken, just increased the poultry seasoning.  I used fresh parsley this time instead of celery, making the casserole much prettier.  I think there's room with experimenting with peas or carrots too.Cream Soup Substitute - - from Simply in SeasonMix and store, covered, in fridge:2 c. dry milk powder3/4 c. cornstarch1/4 c. dry bouillion1 tsp. dried basil1/2 tsp. pepper2 tsp. dried minced onionTo use as one 10-ounce can of cream soup, combine 1 and 1/4 c. cold water with 1/3 cup mix in saucepan.  Cook and stir over low heat until thick."},

However, it's been so rainy that I actually read through the soup recipes instead of assuming I have.According to More with Less, this soup comes from Prussian Mennonites; even if my Swiss-German Mennonite heritage includes Prussia, this is not a soup I've seen or heard of before.  Well, with the exception that its pepper and vinegar reminds me of Chinese hot and sour soup, which my family loves.   Sauer Klops (Meatball Soup) - tweaked slightlyCombine and form into 1\" balls:1/2 lb. lean ground beef1/2 c. fine cracker or bread crumbs1/2 c. milk 1/2 tsp. saltdash pepperSet the meatballs aside.Combine in soup pot:2 c. cubed potatoes1 onion, chopped7 kernels allspice 1-2 carrots, chopped3 c. water (maybe a little more)1 tsp. saltdash pepperBring to boiling point, and then add meatballs.  Simmer over low heat 20-30 minutes, until potatoes are soft and meatballs cooked through.  Add a handful of fresh parsley, chopped.Add 2 Tbs. vinegar.Mix together until smooth (I use my Tupperware batter shaker)1/2 c. cream or half & half3 Tbs. flourPour into soup, stirring continuously until soup is thickened.One option listed is to add peas at the end; I'm going to try that next time.  This amount supposedly serves 4, but with biscuits, it barely served my little family of two adults, two kiddos; I will double the recipe next time.  Maybe not everybody makes a meal out of soup and bread?  That's our staple winter meal.  And then we had fasnachts - spring must be coming!"},

{"title": "How I Make Shepherd's Pie", "date": "Tuesday, March 1, 2011", "text": "If you want to be a thrifty cook, you should know how to make shepherd's pie and its relatives.  They are basically cooked vegetables, usually sauced a little bit, with a top sealing layer of mashed potatoes or biscuits or pie crust.  Baked until the top layer is cooked or everything is heated through.  A creative dish that depends on some scrappy leftovers.  I've never actually studied shepherd's pie recipes, so you can tell me what's traditional or not about my version.My procedure for making shepherd's pie from Sunday roast beef and vegetable leftovers:In cast iron Dutch oven, saute an onion  and a lot of mushrooms.  Then chop up and add the leftover vegetables (usually for me it's onions, carrots, mushrooms) except potatoes.  You can add some herbs here too - I like a bit of marjoram.  Add the leftover gravy - I don't like mine too runny, so I aim for maybe 1 cup gravy to several cups vegetables.   I usually add minced garlic here too, and salt and pepper depending on how salty the gravy is; maybe a splash of Worcestershire sauce.  Sometimes I add frozen green beans or other root vegetables.Meanwhile, mash up the potatoes; they need to be warm to mash well.  Usually I reheat them in the microwave with some milk splashed on them, and then I mash them with a potato masher.  You can add cheese or butter.Now, spread the mashed potatoes over vegetables and gravy, sealing the edges and smoothing it out.  Sprinkle with paprika - pretty! Bake uncovered in a moderate oven for 20-45 minutes - it's flexible because you're really just heating everything up - you should see some gravy bubbling at the edges to show that everything is hot through.  You could take advantage of that oven heat to bake a dessert that needs a precise time and temperature.Roughly, the minimum amounts that I aim for in my Dutch oven:  4 cups of vegetables, 1 cup gravy, 2-4 cups mashed potatoes.Serve shepherd's pie with pickles or coleslaw (shown here is German slaw from the freezer).  You'll notice I did not put the leftover meat in the shepherd's pie - I think it's unecessary because of the meaty flavor and nutrition in the gravy.  We are fond of oven barbeque with leftover roast beef.I'm interested in your version of shepherd's pie.  Tell me, please!"},

Recently, Rebecca's mother told me how her grandmother kept a little tin of basting threads.  Basting is like tape for a sewing project:  holds it in place until you can put the real stitches in.  So you rip out the basting threads after the real stitches are in.  It used to be a common practice to save the basting threads and use them over and over.  I pondered this for days, alternately inspired and incredulous.That kind of saving and reusing used to be the standard; now it's odd.  The standard now is disposable everything.  Disposable some-things are handy for traveling, yes - but I hate to see groups using paper plates, or worse, styrofoam, because no one wants to wash dishes.  Or disposable diapers because no one wants to wash the dirties.  How far can we really distance ourselves from the physical nature of eating and pooping?  Is this a contributor to our collective lack of purpose and deep uneasiness? Washing dishes is real work for a real eventI want to learn more about how my grandparents and great grandparents handled their material things and work.  I haven't started saving my basting threads because I don't know enough about sewing to really baste anything. . . but I have stopped feeling silly and apologetic for saving the crumbs from the cutting board.P.S.

And sometimes I use garlic in place of the onion, or skip the bouillion cubes and use half stock and half milk.  I almost always poke through my herbs and spices and add something.  The photos here are of cauliflower soup with Old Bay.  And of Genevieve's careful feeding and mothering of her bear, Joey.  I wonder where she got the idea to read at meals. . .

{"title": "Do We Know How to Roast Beef?", "date": "Saturday, November 13, 2010", "text": "I have deep sensory memories of returning home from church as a child, opening the squeaky back door, and sniffing a houseful of roast beef.  So satisfying and delectable to come home to!  So when I make roast beef, it is usually for Sunday dinner after church.But roasting beef is not easy.It seems that generations past knew how to roast beef, but when I look for techniques and even recipes in my cookbooks, I'm so lost. Gradually, after discussing this often with other cooks, I've picked up a beef roasting lexicon and method of sorts. Please add your tips (or trials) in the comments.How I Roast Beef  [credited where possible]:1. Use a fully thawed beef roast and salt it well the night before you want to roast it [Alice Waters].2. Drizzle a little balsamic vinegar over the roast when you set it in the roasting pan - it's a tenderizer [Esther Shank].  I use grass-fed beef, which is lean and not as soft as the fattier, grocery store beef.3. Sprinkle well with pepper, marjoram.  Lay onion slices over and around the roast  - occasionally, I insert garlic cloves in slits in the roast.4. Pile scrubbed root vegetables around the roast - bigger vegetables are better because smaller ones will bake into mush.  Potatoes, turnips, carrots, mushrooms.  Sprinkle those with salt and pepper too.5.  Add 1-2 cups of liquid to the bottom of the roasting pan - water or wine or combination.6. Cover loosely. I use a black enamelware roasting pan and its lid fits while allowing steam to escape (a tight fitting lid means you are actually steaming the beef - another cooking technique; no lid is what Martha Stewart and Alice Waters recommend and that is actual true roasting, but boy, you have to know what you are doing to roast without steam!)7.  Bake long and slow [my mother].  I do a 3-4 pound roast at 325 for 2.5 to 3 hours.  It has a chance to come to room temperature first before the oven comes on, which is what Alice and Martha both recommend.8.  Allow to rest for up to half hour while you make gravy, etc.  Slice thinly.    Whew.  Maybe we can discuss gravy another time.  That's another kitchen skill that is hard to pin down in a recipe, something you have to learn at a cook's elbow before you timidly venture out on your own."},

You can allow the milk to cool without the cold water bath, but it takes a lot longer.One time, irritated with a batch that wasn't setting, I went to bed and checked it in the morning.  It had set!  Usually, however, my yogurt sets in 2.5-3 hours.How I use yogurt:In recipes where sour cream or buttermilk is called for.  To use yogurt for buttermilk, you may want to add a tablespoon or two of milk per cup to get a more accurate consistency.To make salad dressings.Smoothies - or popsicles.Peach kuchen.Occasionally as a snack with fruit or granola."},

It was such a satisfying breakfast.* * *Now, a breakfast question for you:  I find it hard to eat eggs and toast without drinking a bit of orange juice.  Sometimes I am happy with tomato juice, so I guess what I like is the acid.  Mostly my OJ habit is not really very healthy or local and if it weren't for stocking up on concentrate at the discount grocer, it would be an expensive habit too.  We do actually drink small glasses of the stuff and I water down the children's juice by half.  But still!  I'm interested in new ways - new side dishes maybe? - to eat our mainstay breakfast that do not rely on OJ every time."},

{"title": "The Fabulous Floating Island", "date": "Wednesday, August 4, 2010", "text": "Made with pantry staples and delectably creamy, floating island is a popular dessert for my family.  It's cool and refreshing and pretty healthy (I consider eggs healthy).  Floating island is puffs of lightly sweetened meringue floating on English pouring custard (also called crème anglaise or custard sauce).  You have to make the pouring custard on the stovetop, and then you run the meringue briefly under the broiler, so it's a relatively cool dessert to make in my un-air conditioned house.  The taste is just lovely lightness, totally more than the sum of the simple milk, sugar, eggs, and lemon zest.  And truly, I can make this dessert in about a half hour, not including time to chill.  I long thought it was a British nursery dessert, but I noticed when I was reading my new issue of Saveur that Abigail Adams served it at the opening reception for the newly built White House in 1801.  I love stories with my cuisine.My recipe is from the 1953 Joy of Cooking, but it's a common recipe. However, if you wish, I will post it here.Updated with recipe, with a little help from Alice Waters' The Art of Simple Food Floating Island Scald (heat without boiling) in a medium saucepan:2 cups milkWhile it's heating, beat slightly:3 egg yolks (put the whites aside in a mixing bowl)3 Tbs. sugar1/8 tsp. saltCarefully temper the egg yolk mixture by pouring in a few tablespoons of hot milk, stirring all the while.  Set the pan of hot milk back over a low flame and slowly pour the tempered egg yolk mixture into the milk, stirring continuously.  Continue to stir and cook over low until it begins to thicken (this happens around 170 F and it can happen quickly, steaming as if it's going to boil but do not let it boil).  It will be thicker than milk, but not like pudding - it's a pouring custard, remember.   Remove from heat, pour into a heat proof dish (I use a square glass baking dish).  Add some flavoring:  lemon zest is traditional with floating island, but you can also use 1 tsp. rum or vanilla extract.  Allow to cool on the counter while you make the meringue.Whip until stiff:3 egg whitepinch cream of tartar1/8 tsp. saltAdd slowly, still whipping:2 Tbs. sugar1/2 tsp. vanillaHeap the meringue on the custard in blobs.  Run under the broiler until the meringue is toasty tan - watch very closely because it happens fast!  Serve the floating island then or chill it."},

{"title": "Camping Lists", "date": "Monday, July 26, 2010", "text": "We are back from camping and already I have forgotten the sheer work involved and am thinking mistily of what a good time we had.

I wish I had brought jam, a tongs, ziploc bags, my sink, and bacon. . .I want my bed and my pillow. . . just my bed. I really want my bed. . .But I'm not going to dwell on that, because truly, we had a wonderful time.  The only thing we didn't do from Gyo Fujikawa's poem was swing in a hammock because by the time we got the camp set up and started on the process that was dinner, we didn't feel like hanging up the hammock.We did follow the menu plan, with the exception of Saturday when my mother came to our site (she was lonely for her grandbabies) and yearned so seriously for a hot dog over the fire that we left the hummus in the ice chest and went to the camp store. My mother bought average hot dogs at the camp store for $4.50 a pound. I had bought locally grown & made organic sausage the day before for $5.50 a pound. I don't usually have the opportunity or memory to compare prices so directly, so I was reminded again what a high price convenience and lack of planning really does have. And I resolved that next time we went camping, I would be sure to bring all the traditional camp foods that we hunger for.Notes for Future Camping1. put food in plastic lidded tub, a portable pantry, instead of all over the front seat of the car2. tea kettle for campfire3. longer clothesline4. big mat in front of tent door5. get/borrow ice chest with a drain plug6.  tongs, ziploc bags7.  sleeping bags for kidsThings To Repeat for Future Camping1. matches, newspaper in coffee can to keep dry2. self-inflating sleeping mats3. 2 dishpans and a bucket4.  the menu (plus bacon and hot dogs)5.  tinfoil, clothespins in leftover container6.  book lightCorn on the Cob Over the Fire1. Strip a few top layers of husk off the ears of corn - you don't want to see/feel the kernels through what's left on the ear.  Lay the ears of corn in buckets or dishpans of water and soak for up to an hour.2. Turn your gas grill on low or prepare a bed of coals.3.  Line a grill with foil over a campfire and lay the wet ears of corn on in a single layer (I don't use foil at home on the gas grill).  4.  Occasionally dribble more water over the corn and turn so that all sides are exposed to the heat source.  The corn is steaming inside its husk, so it needs to stay damp.5.  Check in 45-60 minutes.  The husk imparts wonderful flavor, but the coveted part of the corn is where it has turned amber brown. Even better, however, is if you have a layer of burlap over the corn. We set our small children up to the bench of the picnic table on their little chairs.

{"title": "Doing Something About the BP Oil Crisis", "date": "Saturday, June 12, 2010", "text": "(thanks to Emily at Little House on the Southern Prairie for the post that inspired this one; mind you, she cusses a bit)I am depressed about the BP oil spewing into the Gulf and spreading everywhere. I've stopped following the news because it's so devastating to me. I won't go on: you know what I'm talking about.I am in some measure culpable for this disaster. I buy and use plastic. I burn gas in my car going mindlessly and endlessly everywhere. I turn up the heat, fly on planes, buy products and produce shipped on trucks that use diesel.But this post is not to paralyze you with guilt and hopelessness: it is to take some power into our hands. We can stop doing those things that demand oil. I believe firmly that little things matter, they add up. I'll list the things I do below and please, add your ideas and methods in the comments. Also, bear in mind as you read my list that I've been doing some of these things for a while and others only for weeks. . .and sometimes I don't do any of these things because I'm lazy or tired or grouchy. But let's focus on the positive!Ways I try to avoid plastic/oil:1. I try not to buy plastic containers - I use refrigerator dishes or canning jars in the kitchen, and baskets or metal buckets elsewhere (toys, crafts, etc.)2. I usually wash and reuse plastic bags when I can't avoid them. My sis even got me this handy bag dryer, but I used to drape them over my cooking utensils next to the stove. I try to avoid plastic wrap.3. I buy milk in reusable glass jugs and I'm sure it tastes better too. Our eggs come in reused cartons, which I return to the farmer's market or to friends with chickens.4. I shun the plastic bags at the farmer's market when I can, instead putting the produce in my own old bags at home or into glass jars (thanks to my friend Rebecca for inspiring this). I buy bulk grains and flours in paper when I can, which freezes just fine as it is - no loss of flavor or freshness.5. We use cloth hankies, cloth napkins, rags (not paper towels), cloth diapers, cloth wipes. To my embarrassment, I still do use rubber pants for Ben; since he's started potty training, I'm not sure it's worth switching to wool soakers.6. I recycle what I can, even the stuff that doesn't get picked up curbside (paper, cardboard, household hazardous waste, styrofoam, metal).7. I rarely accept a plastic bag from a store: I carry my own cloth bag or I just carry the item to the car trunk or chuck it in the stroller bin.8. We use a reel mower for our small back yard.Making this list and anticipating your additional ideas in the comments has been such a hopeful thing for me! I don't feel so helpless or puny. I couldn't figure out a photo to treat your eyes, but here is a verse from a lovely song in my church hymnal, Sing the Story . . . (written music and the other two verses here)Nothing is lost to the heart of God,nothing is lost for ever;God's heart is love, and that love will remain,holding the world for ever.No impulse of love, no office of care,no moment of life in its fulness;no beginning too late, no ending too soon,but is gathered and known in God's goodness.Music and lyrics by Colin Gibson, copyright 1994"},

I love it so much I snapped it up at the thrift store when he was a baby.Nice playsuits are a rare find, so I made one! I complicated matters by setting my heart on a scrap of cowboy fabric from a friend's stash; I needed to piece it and pair it with the light blue in order to have enough.  A close inspection would reveal lots of mistakes (and that's after I ripped out numerous seams. . . some twice), but overall, it's pretty cute for everyday play.Ben is fairly tall and skinny for his age; the playsuit is sized for a shorter, chubbier child.  I did check his measurements before sewing, but I'd like to make another one to get a better fit.Genevieve chose to wear this hand me down Clara dress that day and then asked for a \"ballerina bun\" in her hair.

However, we do have lots of light in the spring before the big trees leaf out, so I planted a rhubarb plant with high hopes for next spring.  I am farmy enough to want to harvest something, even though I live in a city with a shady backyard.  The friend who gave me the start advised me to pick up the dried manure under hitching posts at stores the Amish frequent.  I looked at her in horror:  she is a nicely manicured, suburban mother.  Well, if she can do it, surely I, unmanicured and with strubbly hair, can do it.  In the meantime, I used compost.Between the iris and the daffodils, I also planted some parsley, Thai basil, regular basil, and a random pepper plant my husband purchased.  I was surprised to see some volunteer dill from last year's failed containers; I'm rooting for it so I can use it when I make dill pickles later on this summer.  Last year I had to use dill seed instead of fresh dill heads.There's also a surprise spearmint plant; in my naivete, I planted it when we bought our house eight years ago.  It was too shady and then seemed to get a disease and die - very strange for take-over-the-garden mint!  But lo, this spring, it came back, so for now I am reading life lessons into its persistence and vivacity."},

I finally distracted her with gum, and then I bought the plain black sunglasses which turned out to be marked down to $1.99, unlike the pink glitter Barbie ones for $8.99.  The new sunglasses look like the late 1980s to me, in a good way!Genevieve is also sporting her new water bottle, another RiteAid markdown that we got for $2.49 because she asked if she could have her own water bottle like mine (I have a Sigg dating from my pregnancy with Ben which may not be recognizable because it is so dented and the paint is coming off).As for Ben, he needs a beach shirt and hat.  It sounded simpler and more satisfying to me to try to make a hat, than dragging my children through various stores until I found a plain hat in my price range.I used some scraps of whale fabric from Mrs. R and lined it with white.  I also used a pattern from Mrs. R rather than buy a pattern; I just ignored the scalloped edge on View A.    I also put in a bit of interfacing along the brim and then machine quilted a few rows to add structure for turning up the brim. I'm still planning to add some straps that will snap together at Ben's cheek."},

This is a short version of what my mother called \"house cleaning,\" done every Saturday morning, all morning long.  I got lots of cleaning ideas from Marla Cilley (The Fly Lady) in her book Sink Reflections.  I shortened my house cleaning to one hour, tops, although living with my children means I spread it out over a whole day.My Friday Sparkle and Shine:1. dust 2. vacuum 3. shake rugs 4. dust steps with damp cloth5. do one of the following:  wipe doorknobs/lightswitches, clean/seal kitchen countertops, or wipe off kitchen cabinetsA few comments:1.  I don't have a lot of knick knacks.  I do include the obvious baseboards, but I'm not moving furniture to get to any.3.  I have 6 throw rugs to shake in the summer, 8 in the winter.  If I'm rushed, I just sloppily run the vacuum over them.4.  We have painted wood steps, and I learned this nifty trick of hand dusting the steps from my pastor Sue.  I use a microfiber cloth.5.  These are all jobs that cannot be left to zone cleaning (deep cleaning), but don't necessarily need to be done every week.  Did you realize that my bathroom is not included in the sparkle and shine cleaning? It just felt too exhausting and overwhelming to me to clean everything in one day, but bookending the weekend with sparkle and shine cleaning on Friday and bathroom on Monday means that the house is relatively clean the rest of the week.  And I don't think about it the rest of the week either, nor do I clean inbetween (except for the vacuum of obvious dirt on Tuesday - and I do mean obvious).  I don't worry if I see dirt on Thursday because I know that sparkle and shine cleaning is tomorrow.  My mind is free to focus on other things and consider other projects."},

To avoid baking in aluminum foil and still get a soft skinned baked potato, do the following: Wash potatoes and dry well. Lay them on a baking sheet with sides and drizzle with oil - using your hands, rub the potatoes to ensure they are coated well with oil.

I keep a supper notebook.  I keep a children's clothing notebook.  I also keep a preserving notebook.A sample entry:25 August 20091 gallon organic beets from Earl - $6yield:  12 pints pickled beets (SinS)plus some leftover (I think Earl gave me more than a gallon)I reference this preserving notebook a lot, especially for prices, suppliers, and quantities.  Prior to this notebook, I had to figure out every summer how many freezer boxes I would get from how many dozen of corn (8 dozen ears yields approximately 40 cups cut off corn).  I would search through the phone book trying to remember which farmers I went to.  I would wonder if $8 for a half bushel of apples was a good price or I should keep looking? (for non-organic, yes, that's a good price around here).Before I launch into preserving for the year, I take inventory of my freezer and canning shelves.  I was very surprised this year by some of the items remaining:23 c. frozen blueberries7 boxes freezer strawberry jam20 quarts whole tomatoes10 quarts applesauceWas I subconsciously hoarding?  I do recall that I did not make tomato soup often because I didn't want to use up my tomatoes, but Margo, using up the food is the WHOLE POINT.  To be fair, I did do several tomato products last year that I used:  salsa, tomato chutney, and pizza sauce.As I counted stuff in my freezer, I noticed with dread that I needed to clean it.  I loathe cleaning out freezers, so I do it as little as possible (only the second time for this chest freezer in the eight years we've owned it).  It's such a pain to figure out what to do with the stuff and wait for the frost to melt.  This year my dear husband schlepped our stuff over to my parents' nearly empty freezer:  Margo:  I'm just calling to see if we can use your freezer today - didn't know if you went to Costco and got a bunch of chicken breasts or something.   Mom (laughing merrily):  no, no, I wouldn't do that. Margo:  drat. The frost dropped onto the freezer floor; I scooped it out, broke it up, and set it in my flowerbeds to melt.

Dear reader, NO MORE.  I have a dressing gown now!I found this linen dress (brand name \"Possibility\"!) for $6.50 at a thrift store in March.  It was too tight for me at the hips, but I thought if I took out the generous plackets and resewed the buttons on, it could work.  In the event that my remake failed, the fabric was my consolation prize.  But the remake worked!  I did end up letting out the side seams a smidge too (those hips!) and removing the collar.  I finished the raw edge where the collar was with bias binding, something I wouldn't do on a public garment, but which seemed nice and dressy-gowny to me.I met all my requirements in this gown:1.  breathable and breezy linen2.  buttons down the front (I can do my hair while wearing this and just slip it off when I'm ready for the Real Outfit)3.  inexpensive!4.

I was sure that I could use some kind of mnemonic to connect the napkin rings to their owners, but I wasn't sure I wanted to explain that to each table-setter before every meal, in the pre-meal flurry.  The monogrammed napkin rings I saw were totally out of my price range, so I cut toilet paper tubes in half and let the children decorate them.  Then I wrote our initials on with a sharpie.  Those napkin rings were free, but they couldn't really be cleaned, weren't terribly attractive, and the children starting peeling off the layers of cardboard.   One night when he was clearing the table, my husband threw them away.

Inside my husband's are duplicate stripes because he likes plain, simple things; I had to point out my thoughtful design to him, however.  I wonder if he wants the sterling silver napkin rings with engraved initials?The children have taken to wearing their napkin rings like wristbands, which led to a dinnertable discussion about the function of wristbands (decoration, in my opinion).

On top, pour over at least two cups BBQ sauce - it should totally cover the stuff underneath because you're going to bake it for an hour at 350 and you don't want it to dry out.This is great served with coleslaw and maybe a bread to complement the beans and mop up sauce.In the afternoon, lazing on the sofa with this new library book, I was tickled to come across the following quote in the section on New England, written by James Francis Davis sometime in the 1930s:\"In many New England homes, to this day, baked beans - usually with brown bread - are a Saturday night ritual. The custom once was, and still is in some Yankee households, to serve them for both Saturday night supper and Sunday morning breakfast, and the reason for it was primarily religious. . . What food was eaten on Sunday must have been wholly prepared on a weekday. . .Sunday dinner was more of yesterday's roast or corned beef, cold, with the remaining vegetables heated up. Supper was cold meat, bread and butter, cake, cookies, and preserves. For these fully adequate and appetizing meals no cooking whatever had to be done on Sunday. The only domestic labor was heating up food, making coffee and tea, and washing dishes.\"Our Sunday supper is invariably popcorn, cheese, fruit, and any random leftovers; yesterday I actually made a simple sponge cake (Carla's Hot Milk Sponge Cake from More with Less) to eat with strawberries and whipped cream. I make exceptions to Sabbath rest for strawberries!"},

Well, instead of cutting it out to one size and losing the other nine, here's a trick my friend Rebecca and I discovered recently:After making these cuts every few inches, you can just fold to the correct size line that you want.  Does that make sense? This pattern, with its clever cuts, came to me by way of a golden serendipitous moment:  one day when Ben was a baby, I was shopping at the fabric store and an older woman who was shopping too ventured to ask me if I like to sew.  Oh yes!  But I'm not very experienced and, as you can see, I don't have much time (indicating the yammering, dancing children).  Well, Mrs. R had an enormous stash of sewing things from her years as a home ec teacher and sewing for grandkids who were getting into school uniforms now, and would I be interested in having some of her stash?I think my jaw dropped.  I gave Mrs. R my phone number, she called me up, and I have been her guest twice now, each time going away with boxes of sewing goodies and feeling warm and blessed from her kindness.  We even discovered that we have a mutual friend - her former coworker, and a current member of my church.This nightie was made entirely from Mrs. R's supplies. Striped fabric here.  I got some beautiful plaid, some of which went into Kim's journey bag, and some here.  I've passed along a few junior patterns for Rebecca's daughter (as illustrated above - Clara needs a new Sunday dress!).Meeting Mrs. R feels like something out of a book to me, a wonderful opportunity that drops into your lap. . . a blessing from God to recount when the days are dreary."},

{"title": "Managing Children's Clothing Through Seasons and Sizes", "date": "Friday, May 14, 2010", "text": "Pre-children, I had never thought about how much time and money it takes to outfit a growing child each season.  Now that I have limited closets, a small budget, and a penchant for shopping at thrift stores and collecting hand-me-downs, it was a recipe for a huge mess. . .no winter coat, but three spring jackets. . .no socks, but five pairs of sneakers. . . .To stop the chaos, I created a notebook.  I labeled the pages with the age, size, and season of each of my children (Ben, summer 2010, size 2T).  I divided each page into six categories:  tops, bottoms, Sunday, outerwear, pajamas, and shoes. I started two years ago and didn't bother with the stuff already in storage.  Then I gradually started cataloguing what I had and as new batches of hand-me-downs came in, I jotted them down and passed on duplicates.  I try to remember to cross off the items that I hand to friends, but don't always remember.  Nor do I always remember to add the things I acquire, so it's not a totally reliable record.  However, I carry my notebook when I go thrifting, so that at least I have a chance of knowing if I should invest in a winter coat two sizes up for Genevieve or if she already has one waiting in storage (my dad generously insisted we use some of his garage for storage - I really don't have much closet space in my house).This whole process is a blessing to me, although I'm sure it sounds ridiculous to some of you.  I am deeply grateful for all the hand-me-downs.  I feel thrifty when I pass by a nice item at the thrift store because I know I've got it covered according to my notebook.  I don't enjoy the changing of the clothing seasons, but at least it's not complicated by major shopping trips and expenditures. In short, I feel like the housekeeper of yore, with her keys jingling at her waist, knowledgeable of all the supplies in the vast house, watching with pride as life flows smoothly because her closets and pantry and larder are ready."},
{"title": "You Don't Need a Pasta Maker!  A Tutorial", "date": "Thursday, May 13, 2010", "text": "Finally, here's the requested tutorial for making pasta - actually, to be technical, they are egg noodles. I like them best in lasagne, but I do use them in soup and sometimes (like in this tutorial) for regular sauces where I would use commercial semolina pasta.Fresh Pasta (from Alice Waters in The Art of Simple Food)First, separate two eggs, keeping the yolks. Mix the 2 yolks with 2 more whole eggs and set aside.Put 2 cups flour in the bowl. I used 1 cup whole wheat, but I have also used 2 cups whole wheat pastry flour (to make it local). Make a well and dump the mixed eggs in there.Using a fork, start to coax the flour into the eggs in a scrambling fashion. Keep \"scrambling\" until there's no liquid left and then get your hands in there and knead gently until it comes together. It reminds me of playdough - a stiff dough. If needed, you can add a smidge of water to get it to a cohesive, smoothish mass.Now, shape it into a disc and wrap in plastic wrap (or a very close-fitting tight container could work) and set on the counter for at least an hour to allow the gluten to relax.Now you can roll it out!I divide my disc into 4-5 hunks to make noodles. Generously sprinkle the counter with flour.Roll the dough thinly into a big sheet (I usually roll until I can barely see my black countertop through the dough). Fold the sheet in half, flouring between and on top and stack all the sheets on a cutting board.Use a sharp knife or pizza cutter to cut into noodles - you can make them short or long, skinny or fat. Then gently pick them up and run them through your fingers, shaking them apart (this is so fun!) and adding a bit of flour if they are sticking to each other. Try to shake excess flour off before putting them in the pot. Cook the noodles in more water than you normally use because they can boil over - I'm sure you can guess how I know this; cook for 3 minutes. Other tips and notes about my pasta here.We ate ours with a simple sauce of homecanned tomatoes and chard with roasted carrots and turnips on the side.Beware, pasta can give energy for craziness!The Condensed Pasta Recipe (you know, so you can fit in your recipe box!)Mix together:2 egg yolks2 eggsPut 2 c. flour in a bowl, make a well in center. Dump eggs in center. Scramble flour into eggs with fork. Then knead gently, adding a bit of water only if necessary, until a stiff dough is formed.Wrap dough in plastic and allow to set for at least an hour. Roll out in sheets, using lots of flour. Fold and stack sheets and cut into thin ribbons. Cook noodles in lots of salted water for 3-5 minutes.One more piece of pasta business: Meghan asked about my marinara when I made lasagne. For the lasagne, I used a batch from the freezer using the Simply in Season recipe. But otherwise, here's what I do to make about 4 cups spaghetti sauce:Fry an onion or two.Add lots of herbs: at least a teaspoon each of basil and oregano, then less of thyme, rosemary, marjoram, and fennel.Dump in 1 quart canned whole tomatoes with their juice.Break up the tomatoes as the sauce simmers on low, uncovered. It will be thick in probably 30-45 minutes. About 5 minutes before you think it's ready, add several garlic cloves, minced fine (not pressed). Taste and add salt and pepper.Sometimes, to taste, I add hot peppers, Worcestershire sauce, some red wine. Some people might add a bit of brown sugar. Sometimes I also saute mushrooms with the onions. If you've got fresh herbs, by all means use those, but add towards the end.If the sauce is too chunky, puree some or all or it. If it's too watery, turn up the heat and let it reduce, keeping a close eye on it."},
{"title": "\"This Pileup of Gorgeousness\"", "date": "Wednesday, May 12, 2010", "text": "The rest of Sunday, I was finishing up Aunt Linda's Potato Salad and a Boston Cream Pie from this cookbook for the party. We had hamburgers and hotdogs on the grill with all the necessary stuff (which included potato salad, potato chips, and potato rolls - seriously).The Boston Cream Pie was a big undertaking for me; I had intended to make it on two other occasions this spring, and both times chickened out.  I even had the heavy cream, measured, in my freezer.  I am still learning how to make traditional fancy cakes.  Other cakes that I call family desserts with fruit, hot water, or whatnot, I can handle with ease.So on Saturday I baked the cakes using the food processor method Nigella recommends -it was easy and I felt confident. On Sunday I made the creme patisserie following her directions, but here I got irritated: she says to cook the custardy stuff until \"thickened.\"  I always wonder:  is that thickened as in it's not the consistency of water anymore OR thickened like pudding and in danger of curdling from overcooking?  I did the former but apparently should have done the latter because when I poured it on the bottom cake layer, it kept going. I poured on the ganache anyway. . .  grabbed one of my meat platters and plunked the cake plate on it.  I felt a bit deflated, but hoped that if looks would not wow the crowd, the flavors would. Well, it was good, but not great.  I thought the cakes were too dry and of course the creme wasn't where it was meant to be or could have slicked up the dry cake a bit.  The cakes used only butter for fat - could that make a dry cake just like it does in cookies?I'm going to keep working at fancy cakes.  I feel confident with pastry and cookies and (usually!) custards, so I'm determined to add cakes to the list.Sunday was also my sister's 30th birthday and the cake was partly for her too, although her blow-out party was earlier.  I made her a scarf using silk from my old shirt and some lightweight poly.  It was my first foray into sewing with such sheer, drapey stuff and thanks to my Bernina, it went smoothly.  In hindsight, the fancy stitch I used for topstitching was a bit puckery and a straight stitch would have been better.  I hope there's a camera in my future that can take close ups so I could show you better!I am blessed to have such a wonderful sis and mother. . . and too, my mother in law and sisters in law.

We looked at them and looked around, but didn't see anything, so we went on.  Then I got A LOT of bites on my legs one night.  In typical fashion, I ruminated on this until I was terribly afraid we had bed bugs. Do not google bed bugs, like I did, unless you want to worry and lose sleep, like I did.  I called two exterminators, who came and used flashlights to study every millimeter of all three mattresses in our house.  One guy said to me, \"If you've got 'em, you've got the cleanest bed bugs I've ever seen!\"  I was not amused.I started to clean as if we had bed bugs.  This involved washing and drying every scrap of fabric in the bedrooms; I couldn't bring myself to do that, so I *just* did the beds and curtains and changing pad.  I vacuumed everything.  I wiped down everything I could.  I prayed.  I cried.  I snapped at people.  Sometimes I apologized.Genevieve and I kept getting bites.  Then my sister looked at my legs and said, \"Margo, those look like flea bites.\"  So, with faint hope in my heart, I went back to Google, and after copious research, discovered that indeed, those were flea bites.  And that since we don't have carpet or pets, the fleas were hanging out in our beds, waiting for a good long session with Genevieve and me (the two guys didn't get bit at all).  So now I started cleaning as for fleas, which is simpler:  wash all the bedding, vacuum your fool head off for a week and make sure there's some boric acid going in the bag too to kill any survivors.  I bought one can of boric acid, but other than the electricity and water for all that laundry and vacuuming, my frenetic cleaning spared us the expense of foggers and exterminators.I learned that the beautiful nursery curtains that my mother-in-law made for me are washable.  The fabric, 100% cotton, was marked dry clean only, but I was desperate, so I washed them on delicate and ironed them.  No problem at all.  In the midst of my despair, I did take a few photos of this, thinking to share this discovery with you.All this happened in April. I kept on blogging and homemaking as usual, needing something positive to focus on.  I tell you now because these kinds of dark personal stories are instructive and build the sister-love among us.I think the fleas are gone, but it's still not funny to me.  Maybe next year I can look back and laugh and say, \"remember that time I thought we had bed bugs?\"P.S.  Thanks to Jennifer Jo's post for inspiring me to share this story!

Rather than patch the knees and buy her summer shorts, I cut off the legs and put the pretty woven ribbon on top of the hem I made.  I do like cutoffs, rest assured, but these shorts provided such an ideal blank slate for the delicious ribbon.  Bonus:  I got to experiment and manage the ribbon for a small project before trying to apply it to big project.Genevieve was with me when I bought the ribbon and she insisted on something with pink or, to my dismay, purple.  We compromised:  I chose the red ribbon and she chose the pink flowered one.  I then paired her choice with green ric rac because it was so narrow.

This version MUST soak overnight, as in the night kitchen method.Nutty texture - really delicious!  We ate applesauce on top.I had an annoyingly stray bag of steel cut oats in my freezer; sometimes, I just buy random bulk items and then hope I find a way to use them.  In this case, it turned out well, but usually I have some weird bag, usually unlabeled, at the bottom of my freezer.  Now that we have a compost pile, I should just compost that stuff.  Since I was too hungry and sleepy to take a picture of the steel cut oats baked oatmeal version, I'll just submit to you our compost pile for your viewing pleasure."},

This is the third quilt I've completed, but it's the first one that makes me feel like an artist.  I recall Kim's vision that started the quilt, fumbling around for fabrics, taking the advice of dear readers regarding Gee's Bend quilts, and getting deeply excited by my vision.  Making this quilt has increased my confidence and vision as an artist (I'm an artist!) and given me new ideas to play with.  I can't imagine this quilt going to a stranger; I know Kim will treasure it and I'll see it from time to time, so I can release this quilt with a light heart.The other morning, I made a traveling bag for the journey so Kim can take it safely back to the big city.  I used only my scrap bag and tried to echo the theme of the quilt without using any of the actual fabrics (Kim wants the leftovers for her own projects).  I have a few ends to tie up:1. name the quilt2. embroider a name/date tag and attach it3. \"photograph the crap out of it\" (says my husband)"},

{"title": "Lasagne with Homemade Pasta", "date": "Thursday, April 22, 2010", "text": "Because of the dark days challenge this winter, I started making pasta occasionally because I could use local whole wheat pastry flour. The good news is that it's not hard to make pasta and it's cheap, but the GREAT news is that homemade pasta makes the best, absolutely the best, lasagne ever! I had never found a lasagne recipe to love:  I didn't want to boil noodles first, but the overnight soaking recipes never got the right texture either. Well, folks, I have found a dependable, delicious and manageable recipe; it's satisfying in its vegetarian version, although you could add some sausage or proscuitto somewhere if you want. It's going to be my standard entertaining fare.I followed Martha Stewart's recipe in Martha Stewart's Cooking School. I know, I know, Martha is needlessly complicated, but lasagne is complicated to start with and at least Martha says you don't boil the noodles first.Have ready:1 batch pasta dough (I use the recipe from Alice Waters in The Art of Simple Food - it uses 2 cups flour to 2 eggs and 2 yolks). 2 cups ricotta mixed with 1 egg, some salt & pepper & nutmeg3-4 c. really good marinara sauce, herby and garlicky1 lb. mozzarella cheese, sliced (fresh is preferred)1 1/2 c. really good parmesan, grated medium1 greased 9x13 panYou can roll the pasta and stack it aside or roll it as you go - just grab a golf-ball sized chunk, roll it until you can almost see your countertop through it, flour it and set it aside.Spread 1 c. marinara in pan.Cover with a layer of pasta, overlapping if need be.Cover with 1/3 of the ricotta.Sprinkle 1/3 parmesan.Add another layer of pasta.1 c. marinaraLayer of pasta1/3 ricottaSprinkle parmesanAnother layer of pastaLayer of mozzarellaFinal layer of pastaFinal 1/3 ricottaRest of parmesanLast 2 cups of marinara.Torn pieces of mozzarellaBake at 375 for 45-55 minutes, until bubbly. Allow to rest at least 10 minutes before cutting. Martha says you can assemble this up to 12 hours before baking, so I think I will try it sometime for Sunday dinner.This past time, I had 3 sheets of pasta left over, so I bagged them and put them in the fridge. Today, my husband cut them and boiled them for lunch; the pasta had not suffered at all from the delay. I love that flexibility!I realize I haven't actually explained step by step how I make pasta, so if you want, I can do that. I will just reassure you that it's not hard like custards, pie crusts, and steaks which take true skill and experience."},

Whew. But I still felt bad.Everything turned out fine, and more importantly, we had lovely time of fellowship around our Sunday dinner table. I didn't take photos while dinner was laid or then in full swing, so what you see is from Saturday prep and later Sunday afternoon.Now, let's talk about the hot fudge sundae cake. I got the recipe from Beth after I posted about Wacky Cake, and it's AMAZING. Truly AMAZING. It's easy, cheap, sorta healthy, and incredibly good. I've been on a hunt for this kind of cake since first making it; I found more recipes and made two other cakes and I'll post about those this week too. But really, make this cake - you will wonder how you kept house without it!Hot Fudge Sundae CakeIn ungreased, 9x9 baking pan, mix:1 c. all purpose or WW pastry flour1/2 or 3/4 c. sugar2 Tbs. baking cocoa2 tsp. baking powder1/4 tsp. saltThen, dump in and mix with fork until smooth:1/2 c. milk2 Tbs. vegetable oil1 tsp. vanillaStir in 1 cup nuts, if desired.Spread batter evenly.Sprinkle evenly with:1 c. packed brown sugar1/4 c. baking cocoaPour over all:1 3/4 c. very hot waterBake at 350 for 40 minutes or until top is dry. Cool at least 10 minutes before serving. Spoon warm cake with its sauce into bowls. Top with ice cream or whipped cream or nothing at all. Try to act like you worked very hard in the kitchen to deserve the lavish compliments. Try not to make more than once a week.My notes to the recipe: I've made the cake twice now. Once we ate unsweetened whipped cream on it and yesterday, peanut butter ice cream. Because it's cake with its own fudge sauce, it can stand alone too, so don't let your lack of ice cream stop you from making this cake. I've used nuts both times - pecans once, walnuts the other time. I reduce the sugar in the cake part to 1/2 c., but not the brown sugar on top. This cakes keep perfectly, covered, on the counter and you can warm it up to serve it, or you can just take a bite as you walk by doing your afternoon work. You know.Thanks, Beth, for a wonderful recipe!"},

Next time, I'll take note of the total poundage, For the Record.  Shredded cheese works best for freezing, because blocks of cheese will get a bit crumbly.  However, I usually freeze blocks because that's what we use (I often will used sliced mozzarella on pizza, not shredded, because it's less of a mess).The photo is of a block of Muenster at $2.35 a pound and some Swiss for about $4 a pound.

I pretended that this was perfectly normal. (Aunt Maggie, do you recognize the pink bear you gave to Genevieve when she was born?  She named \"him\" Joey, and she chose him for the photo shoot.)See the yellow button?  All that pink and white was sweet, if a bit too boring for me.

Now I have a stash of free vitamin and mineral laden liquid to use in soups and the like.  If I think the flavor will be too thin, I do add a little powdered bouillion or salt.  Sometimes I'll use part homemade stock and part pot likker because making stock is a long process, whereas collecting pot likker is not.It's thrifty in several ways:1.  saves money because I don't have to buy vegetable stock2.  preserves health because there are valuable nutrients in the water3.  saves time because I'm already cooking the vegetables and the pot likker is an incidental product; I don't have to make or shop for vegetable stock"},

To that end, we painted the living room grey and the hallway a slightly darker shade of grey.  I did almost all the painting - during naptime and after the children were in bed.

I halved the amount of dressing and next time I will reduce the sugar - boy, them Southerners like SWEET.

The bathroom was around the corner.me (wheels turning):  I  see.  Thank you. . . .So I cut up some soft squares of fabric and ran a zigzag around the edge.  Now when I need a batch of wipes, I just make them the right dampness with plain water and put them in a lidded leftover container.  Nothing else.  We dispose of them in a little lidded container next to the changing table and about once a week, I wash them with the diaper covers and (now) a few cloth diapers."},

I saw the chance to use up some stock from my freezer before the warm weather makes us turn our noses up at soup. I usually think soup must have bread or crackers, but in this case, I had nothing local and was too lazy to bake local bread. So I filled out the meal with a favorite, reasonably nutritious dessert instead.Turkey Corn Noodle SoupI boiled up some homemade turkey stock, added some local organic frozen corn, and locally made whole wheat noodles. At then end, I snipped in some local organic spring onions and parsley, plus a dash of cayenne.The Reasonably Nutritious DessertHomemade yogurt from local milk, local egg, local home-canned peaches, local whole wheat pastry flour, local butter. If you glance at the recipe, it may look like too many steps to be simple and quick, but look more closely: I don't do fancy for family desserts!

I made a Lemon Sponge Pie. Lemon Sponge is a PA Dutchy thing, with meringue folded into a lemon custard part and baked. So, what I made was a simple salad of spinach, watercress, and mushrooms with honey-mustard dressing. By the way, do you know how easy it is to make honey-mustard salad dressing? I mix equal parts honey and mustard with enough olive oil to make it pourable. Done! I usually use a good brown or dijon mustard, not just the common yellow hot dog mustard.Saturday: -thawed ground beef-made Lemon Sponge PieSunday morning: -assembled Six-Layer Dish, set on timed bake-washed salad greens and put them in a dishtowel in fridgeSunday noon:-set table-sliced mushrooms into salad-made honey-mustard dressingI make that breakdown of tasks so that you can see how you could tweak it. Depending on your family or what time you get home from church (or wherever - you can apply these principles to other occasions), you could do everything ahead of time, even setting the table. Or you might realize you have enough time to make the salad when you got home.My husband told Ben to eat his salad with his fingers - almost-2-year-olds don't have the fork skills for salad. Ben happily dipped the leaves in honey-mustard and ate a lot. He has picked up this funny habit of calling all meat \"hot dog\" which is very ironic, considering we're rather snooty about such junk at our house (big exception: roasted over a fire) and I'm not sure where he ever ate or named a hot dog! So while he was eating the Sunday dinner yesterday, he kept looking up and piping with perfect enunciation, \"hot dog.\"Six-Layer Dish - a real workhorse for plan ahead meals (from More with Less)Layer in order given in 2 qt. greased casserole or Dutch oven.

I have increased the vegetables sometimes and decreased the meat, using scraps of ham or proscuitto. One time I added some cabbage instead of the carrots and yesterday my potatoes were rather shrimpy, so I added a turnip. I made this casserole one time when tomatoes were in season and sliced a tomato on top and then used 3 cups tomato juice. In the same season, I put in a few layers of fresh basil leaves. I have thought of adding minced garlic, too."},

The weight is just right and the colors make me so happy.  And the very week after I made it, my little girl said as we strolled into market, \"MOM!!

It was overlooked for weeks by the market staff and me, but spotted by my sharp-as-a-tack daughter.(knitted from pink cotton yarn and a crazy yarn that looked like string with tabs of pink and orange shoelaces every few inches; I knitted that scarf maybe 5 years ago)And because I adore this quote and want to give it full justice, not just a playful poke:\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times; it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness; it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity; it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness; it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair; we had everything before us, we had nothing before us; we were all going directly to Heaven, we were all going the other way.\" Charles Dickes - the opening lines of A Tale of Two Cities"},

(A variation I sometimes do: omit egg from dressing and reduce liquid to 1 1/2 cups; then, put chopped hard boiled eggs on top of the salad.)I serve the dressing separately from the dandelion; this amount can dress 4-5 cups chopped greens. You can use this as a dressing for any green salad, but I only use it on dandelion.One final note about this meal: just before I served it to my parents yesterday evening, I realized this was a dark days meal! Everything was local, except for the rolled oats on top of the apple crisp (and the usual salt, sugar, cinnamon, etc.). I was planning to make a different totally local menu today, but I'll save that one for next week."},

In the interest of keeping that kind of knowledge alive, I will share our breakfast and the pedestrian photo.I bought frozen waffles at my discount grocer.  WHAT?!  Yes, I bought frozen waffles.  The ingredients were normal, they were whole grain, and cheap.  They originally sold for $4.99 for 6, but I got them for $.99.  My children didn't even know what they were, since I don't have a waffle maker.  The brand is Lifestream and I got two flavors:  mesa something which is corn and flax, and the ones we had this morning which were 8 grain (quinoa, flax, wheat, etc.).I had saved the juice from a jar of home canned peaches with no clear goal in mind.  But this morning, I thickened it a little with cornstarch, added a pat of butter and a dash of cinnamon. Then I whipped some cream and cut it with a slightly less than equal amount of homemade plain yogurt.  I piled the cream on top of the waffles and drizzled them with peach syrup.  The children also had apples and peanut butter; the adults had coffee instead of fruit (you know).  It was delicious.A note about my food photography:  it is supposed to illustrate, not make your mouth water.  I wish I knew how to style food and I wish I had a slick camera, but I just use what I've got.

{"title": "Dark Days Week 17:  White Branch Sugar Cream Pie (et al)", "date": "Tuesday, March 16, 2010", "text": "Isn't that a lovely name for a pie? The recipe comes from the White Branch Church of the Brethren in Indiana, courtesy of my friend Rebecca. My father-in-law, who stopped by at dinnertime, said it tastes like pecan pie without the pecans. The local part was whole wheat pastry flour crust and local cream (plus the usual non-local suspects: sugar and salt). I have found through frustrating trials, that to use whole wheat pastry flour in a pie crust means I have to use shortening, not lard; lard + pastry flour = too fragile to handle. But I can use lard successfully if I use all purpose flour.However, we didn't just have pie for our dark days dinner. I made polenta with milk, mushrooms, a bit of sharp cheddar, and scallions (all local, organic) and then fried it in my own tallow. I was disappointed that the polenta was still rather bland after those additions (the recipe came from Simply in Season). We garnished it with some homemade marinara from the freezer. Plus we had a spinach and watercress salad with hard boiled eggs and shredded turnips (all local, organic). I've made this salad dressing three times in less than a week now, I love it so much. The dressing is not terribly local, although I did use a local scallion, but it's so so so good that you must make it. I begged it from my cousin's wife Beth after eating it at a Christmas family gathering.Beth's DressingIn a blender, combine:1/2 c. salad oil1/4 c. sugar2 Tbs. vinegar1-3 Tbs. onion, minced 1/2 tsp. salt1/4 tsp. dry mustardBlend until thick and syrupy and the sugar is dissolved. Make a spinach salad with one pound of spinach and other stuff: mushrooms, bacon, hard boiled eggs, shredded carrots, etc. etc, whatever you like. When you're ready the serve the salad, zap the dressing one more time and then pour it over the salad, tossing gently to distribute. Like any dressed salad, this one will not keep for later, but it's an easy job to eat it up!"},
{"title": "Sunday Treat", "date": "Monday, March 15, 2010", "text": "My Sunday treat is usually reading all afternoon, but yesterday, all I could think about was chocolate cake and reading. Fortunately, I had an easy solution at hand. The Wacky Cake recipe is strange (can anyone explain the chemistry of it??) so I like it for that, but it's also stupid-easy and so so so good. My Sunday obsession further extended to Italian Meringue (what Martha Stewart calls it and cautions novices to stay away) which I make using the clever cheater method called \"Quick Fluffy White Icing.\" It's like a marshmallow crossed with meringue - if you've never had it, it will change your cravings forever. It takes 7 minutes to make, start to finish. That is good news, ladies!Further Sunday decadence: we cut the cake a bare minute after it came out of the oven and dolloped the Italian Meringue right on top. And had seconds. A little indulgence is good for everyone; my family thought I was treating them, but the whole shebang took so little effort that I felt treated too. And then I finished reading The Book Thief by Markus Zusak for my book club. Humph.Wacky Cake - from my motherIn 9x13 ungreased metal pan, mix together:1.5 c. white flour1.5 c. WW pastry flour (you can use all white if you want)1 3/4 c. sugar (don't skimp - it's already reduced for a less sweet cake)6 Tbs. cocoa powder2 tsp. baking soda1/2 tsp. salt(a little instant coffee if you want)Make 3 holes in the dry mixture.In first hole: 1/2 c. vegetable oilIn second hole: 2 Tbs. apple cider vinegarIn third hole: 2 Tbs. vanillaPour 2 c. water over all and mix (I use a whisk) until all the lumps are gone. You will feel weird doing this, but mix it well.Bake at 350 for 35 to 40 minutes. I've never seen this cake out of the pan, but I suppose you could try if you halved the recipe and used a traditional cake pan.Quick Fluffy White Icing (from Mennonite Country Style with tweaks)Figure out a double boiler (a metal bowl that fits tightly on top of a pan). Fill the pan at least half full of water and bring to a boil.In top of double boiler (or metal bowl), combine off the heat:2 egg whitesscant 3/4 c. white sugarscant 1/3 c. corn syrup2 Tbs. water1/4 tsp. salt1/4 tsp. cream of tartarNow, set pan over the rapidly boiling water. Beat with electric mixer until mixture stands in stiff peaks (the tops of the peaks do not flop over when you turn off and lift the beaters to check). Remove from heat.Add and continue beating into very stiff peaks:1 tsp. vanillaKeep it in the fridge and beat or stir if it separates at all; I've kept it for about a week before with no ill effects. It's soooooo good you will think of all kinds of applications. A few I like: on graham crackers, on scones, on hot chocolate. . . it's a generous batch so just get carried away!Also on a Sunday note, we had dinner at church yesterday so all I made for Sunday dinner was bread to take along.

My aunt who knows a lot about vintage linens told me they could be lingerie bags.  I decided to make one for my girl.I turned out my scraps for Genevieve and told her to pick two fabrics she liked.  Same thing with buttons.  Don't you just admire her choices?  I must say, I am rather proud of her blend of patterns and colors.  I flipped up the corners of the envelope flap to further show off the pretty contrast.  She is enchanted with her own little stack of hankies in a fabric envelope she helped design (but not sew - I'm still building up patience for that).Updated:  A Tiny Tutorial1.  Cut 2 rectangles about double the height you want the finished envelope to be (but I play around with it, folding it to see what looks right).2.  Sew the rectangles together, right sides facing, leaving a few inches unstitched.3.  Turn the rectangle right side out through the open inches, and press.4.  Topstitch close to the end the whole way around, closing the hole.5.  Just fold up one end to make the envelope and sew the side seams.6.  Now fold down the other end - that's the flap.  You can decide to turn up the edges and put decorative buttons on (like I did) or do other fancy stuff:  a real closure of some kind like snaps or button/loop, ric rac or lace, etc., or a RUFFLE (wouldn't that be cute?).  It's so fun to play with colors and ideas in this way!  By the way, I first made my own envelopes with paper years ago, which is another creative option to fiddle with."},

{"title": "Dark Days Week 16:  Borsch with Homemade Beef Stock", "date": "Tuesday, March 9, 2010", "text": "When we bought an eighth of beef in the fall from a church friend, I asked the butcher for some soup bones too. And then I saw some bones for sale from my Amish butcher at market. A plethora of bones! After roasting bones for stock, I normally simmer them in my crockpot, but this batch was too big so it went into my big stockpot with some peppercorns, salt, vinegar, and onions. For two whole days.Then I skimmed it of most of the fat, packaged it up and tucked it in the freezer.  In true Great Depression-style, I saved the fat I skimmed and after a little research, discovered that in its now-rendered state, it is called beef tallow and is akin to lard. I've been frying some foods in it; I know about tallow candles and I learned more weird non-food uses here, but I'd like to know what else the housewives of yore did with tallow.With all that stock in my possession, a soup like Borsch took me a half hour to make. The recipe came from More with Less and I followed it closely since I hadn't made Russian Mennonite style Borsch before. I've made the shredded beet version, but this one had beef stock, potatoes, cabbage, onions, and tomatoes (all local and organic except that onion). My cabbage is the size a baby.It was seasoned with lots of dill and a hot pepper; unfortunately, my frozen chunk of local hot pepper was far hotter than I realized and my children couldn't eat much. At the table, we dolloped homemade plain yogurt on top.I scratched my head over what kind of bread to have; the only local bread I have in my repertoire is cornbread and that just didn't sound right here. Then I came across a quick bread, again in the More with Less, called Onion Cheese Loaf. I made it with local whole wheat pastry flour, local cheese, local butter/egg/milk, and subbed local garlic for the onion. It was a rich cheesy counterpoint to the spicy Borsch."},
{"title": "A Comforter is Done!", "date": "Monday, March 8, 2010", "text": "Celebrate with me! I'm so pleased to say that I finished this queen-sized comforter Saturday at my church women's retreat (thanks for your help, Naomi!).  Several women bring handwork to do while we sit and talk.  Because I'm so excited about finishing this thing, I bumped the Sunday dinner post to tomorrow.  Comforters do not get finished every day around here, so bear with me.Pattern Inspiration:Seeing this quilt of Leila's.  I knew I wanted a scrappy quilt with a simple pattern.  I made the bricks 4\" x 8\" which is a standard size for real bricks.Color Inspiration:I love blue.  And our bedroom is drowsy, cool blue, so I wanted the quilt to be easy on the eye without a lot of contrast.  Yet it could not be too boring, so I threw in a little lavendar and cool green and a few shots of strong blue.  To keep the colors even calmer, I used all that white sashing.  The dark blue ties and binding were a last minute wing-it that I really like.Materials and Cost:I bought a few inexpensive vintage pieces of fabric with this quilt in mind, but most of it came from Rebecca's stash.  Some of the white sashing is actually painting dropcloths because I was in a rush to finish piecing and didn't want to spend money for plain white cotton.  So there are a few spots of Coachlight (our dining room color) on the sashing!  The backing is a old blue sheet whose partner's elastic wore out and got cut up for blue bricks.  The batting is a cheap polyester blanket I got from Target; it was too slimy-feeling for my husband and me, so I decided to be 1930s-style and make it into a quilt.  I estimate the total cost is $45.Quilting:I intended to quilt it, but that dratted blanket prevented quilting.

The instructions were to bring my favorite brunch treat and I made sticky buns (Caramel Pecan Rolls from Recipes from the Old Mill: Baking with the Whole Grains).   First they rise overnight in the fridge (how handy).The next morning,  I took them out of the oven, drove them to the brunch, and when I tried to flip them at the brunch, they were cemented to the pan with hardened caramel.  Silly me - I now wrote a note in my cookbook to make sure the buns and caramel are warm, so they can be flipped out with the goo where it should be. Despite my irritation with the sticky buns, I loved prowling around the farmhouse and talking with friends, enjoying all the brunch treats we brought."},

Sewing therapy for me must be fast, fun color play, and practical.  This time I made another oven hand towel.  I used the template from a generous friend's stash and coincidentally, fabric from her stash as well!  It's the strangest dun color, but I love it.  I have enough that next time I need sewing therapy, I will find some turquoise to accent.  And I had to choose which side to put the ric rac on because when the top part is buttoned over the hand rail, part of both sides shows.  Maybe you have some brilliant ideas for me?  In my haste, I did not hem the linen very well, so I will be trimming threads off the towel part for a while.  But I went to bed happy."},

Our old tile fixture has narrow slots for toothbrushes - many modern toothbrushes have fat ergonomic handles or something. Our bathroom is tiny, our sink has narrow ledges and hanging our toothbrushes is the best storage option, so I must have toothbrushes that fit our vintage slots.2.  Children's toothbrushes are TTFW (too tacky for words).  They're loaded with licensed characters and thick with plastic doodads that never fit, again, through our vintage slots. (And what about that safe toothpaste for children who think toothbrushing is eating toothpaste off their brush?  The only kinds I've seen are Little Bear and Thomas the Train.  I object on principle!).3.  I have seen cool toothbrushes in Martha Stewart Living and Real Simple.  Don't laugh - you've seen them too and wondered why your drugstore only sells the kind with five colors and stripes in the bristles.Well, it turns out, I can buy them (randomly) at my discount grocery store!  This store is next to our paint store.  Since my husband and I are currently renovating an apartment and my job is painting, I've been to the paint store oh, fifty times in two weeks.  And I spotted these toothbrushes next door!  They're WOOD and at first I thought they were made two hours away, but on closer examination, they are (sigh) made in China.  But I bought about 12 because they were only $1.  You see only 6 in the photo, because I went back to the paint store the next day, slipped into the discount grocery, and bought more. Also notice in the photo my children's toothbrushes in the tile holder.  The only nice plain toothbrushes I could find were from a dental supply company, so I bought a box of them a year or so ago.  Only 450 to a box.  Yes, 450.  So I begged my friends to buy them and I still have lots left.  If you want some too, I'll hook you up for $1 apiece.  Just let me know in the comments and I'll email you details.  Because, after all, a simple toothbrush can be a beautiful thing."},

I'm going to buy a truckload when they're in season and freeze their butts. Yes, I am irritated.)But I got an idea: I cooked and chilled polenta (or mush, as my forebears called it) and broke it into squares to replace the 3 cups of cooked rice in the Bounty Rice from Simply in Season.Here's the recipe as I made it. Everything is local and organic except for the dried herbs and (drat it) that onion; well, the cornmeal wasn't organic, just local.**************************************************************Italian StewBrown together in a large pot or Dutch oven:a few slices bacon, chopped1/2 lb. ground beef1-2 onions, choppedAdd and stir.

Some of the polenta will dissolve, but some will be lumpish.Stir in, again gently:1/2 c. plain yogurtSprinkle top with 1 c. grated cheese (I used a local raw milk smoked cheddar) or sprinkle individual servings. This will be rather soupy after all.********************************************************We really liked the stew. My almost-2 year old had three helpings! We ate ours with a green salad of watercress, arugula, butter lettuce, and shredded turnip topped with homemade French. This is standard to our table right now because the greens are so available. I think the Italian stew would be nice with a hearty bread too, to dab up the juices."},

I set the oven on timed bake for 350 degrees for 1 hour, to end just as we walked in the door from church.When we got home from church, all I needed to do was set the table and put some coconut and raisins in little dishes to garnish the curry. I did a little experiment with the jasmine rice: I wanted to put some cardamom pods in the water, but in my hasty rummage, all I could lay my hands on was whole coriander. So I put in maybe 10 whole coriander. It was not enough to make the rice fragrant, so next time I will double it or give myself more time to root through my spices in the freezer.Updated for Beth:Red Lentil Coconut Curry (from Simply in Season, with some modifications)At some point while something is simmering, cook 2 cups lentils (red preferred, but I have used whatever) in 4.5 c. water.In large pot, saute:1 large onioncoconut oil or gheeAdd and reduce heat to low.

I was skeptical about the taste after enjoying Ouma's, but the directions included drying the rusks for 12 hours in the oven. I am a sucker for a strange recipe, so late one night (I'm not telling you how late), I set to work. Turns out, the rusks are comparable to Ouma's and way better than homemade biscotti.

Once a month in the winter, our church meets for a Soup & Bread Meal after the service.  Volunteers cook a soup (chili yesterday), and the rest of us bring bread and fruit, assigned by our last names.  With the chili in mind, I baked 18 double-corn muffins on Saturday, and had a lovely dinner with dear friends.  Just our place settings to wash at home and a lost cloth napkin to wonder over. . .Well, I felt smug because I bought my own bulk grains for hot cereal. I thought surely I beat Bob's Red Mill for price per pound. I did the calculations and lo, my cereal is not as cheap as I thought it was. Ahem. Bob's Red Mill 5-Grain Cereal, in bulk from their website is $1.75/lb. Suggested retail elsewhere puts the price at $2.55/lb. My cereal is $1.48/lb.Well, I'll finish the winter out with my thrown-together blend, but maybe next year I will start the winter with a big bag of Bob's and not fiddle with stocking separate grains, mixing them, and then grinding them in my blender.For the record, anyway, here is a frequent winter breakfast for my family.Bring 4 cups water and a little salt to boil. Grind 1 and 1/3 cups whole grains such as rye, spelt, quinoa, barley, buckwheat groats, amaranth, and millet in the blender until mostly powder with maybe a few nubbins. Pour the grains slowly into the water, stirring, and stir frequently for the first few minutes. Cook on low, covered, for 12-15 minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve as you would any hot cereal. In our house, we like it with milk, some brown sugar, raisins and nuts. This amount usually feeds my family of 2 adults and 2 small children; to adjust amounts, keep in mind that you should grind 1/3 cup grain for 1 cup boiling water. You really can use any whole grain and some people might also use legumes or beans for protein - we don't care for that taste and anyway, we get a complete protein from having the cereal with milk.I consider myself a thrifty consumer, so I should know by now that I must always, always do the calculations. I should not assume that, for example, big stores or chain stores are always cheaper. . . that on sale at one store is cheaper than another store. . .that buying a bigger size of something means it's cheaper. . . that organic or local is more expensive. . .Have you been caught by any of these stereotypes?"},

It tickled me to watch her pick the stitches, bypassing flowers and hearts for geometric shapes.  When her mom-attention tank was filled up (whew), I turned my attention to other sewing.  A few weeks ago I chose and cut out 11\"x17\" flannel pairs for baby burpcloths.  Last night, in a quick 15-minute snatch before dinner, I sewed them together with a spot left for turning.

Repeat until you have 1 stitch left (this is where my dishcloth is in the photo). Cut the yarn so you have a long tail. Feed it through the final loop and tighten.

The night before I want to bake bread, I get out my big bread bowl.Into the bowl:4.5 c. whole wheat flour1/2 to 1 c. starterAdd 3 and 3/4 c. lukewarm water while stirring, until a thick pasty batter is formed. Beat well. Cover (I use a platter).First replenish the starter by removing 1/2 to 1 c. from the sponge (the overnight mixture) and adding it to the starter.Then dump into the remaining sponge:1/2 c. oil1 Tbs. salt5-6 c. flour (I use 2 cups unbleached, the rest whole wheat)When dough comes easily away from the bowl but is still a bit sticky, knead for 5 minutes. Dough will be a little softer and stickier than commercial yeast dough. Cut dough into 3 equal lumps and shape into loaves. Place loaves in greased bread pans. Slit tops with a sharp knife. Cover with a damp dishtowel. Allow almost all day for rising (when I see the dough rounding up the towel) and don't expect it to double in volume. Heat oven to 425. Brush or spray loaves with water. Bake at 425 for 20 minutes. Spray/brush with water again and turn oven down to 375. Bake for 15 more minutes. Turn out on rack and cool before slicing.The night before:The next day after kneading:Tucking the loaves of dough in for a long rise:Risen! Ready for the oven:Done. The house smells like heaven. Glow of satisfaction.I love that this bread is made from flour, salt, oil, and water. It is so unfussy, too - give or take a few hours rising and it's fine. Recipes that demand long stretches of attention or care at critical points do not work well with my life at home with children. My yeast bread suffered from this neglect, but hallelujah! sourdough does not. Occasionally I still make yeast breads for special occasions, but I still gravitate towards ones that have a long rise: in the refrigerator or in the manner of No-Knead.As for the starter, I bake bread about every other week and it thrives just fine. Sometimes I forget to replenish the starter before I add the oil and salt to the sponge, so I just use plain flour and water. Possibly I am grossly mistreating my starter or overlooking a key step in my baking - I still have a lot to learn about sourdough, but for 8 months now, it's been working fine."},

You could warm up there, dry wet clothes, pull up a chair, and ruminate as you stared into the fire.I have no fireplace or even wood stove, but in my daily life, my bread is the hearth of our home. I bake our daily bread.Why I bake my family's bread:1.  The scent of bread baking is beyond compare.2.  It's the only healthy AND cheap AND delicious bread I know ($.97 a loaf for mostly organic, mostly whole wheat sourdough bread).3.  My grandmothers baked bread and I've been doing it for almost 10 years now.  I do love me a good tradition.4.  I feel like a goddess-provider, clever and competent.Now that I've explained why I do it, tomorrow I'll tell you how.  And if you're still interested, I'll relate some of my trials and experiments before arriving at my present recipe and method.  And I don't think my bread journey is finished - I recently started talking sourdough with two different experienced bakers from my church.  I have a lot to learn."},

This one was recommended by Leila at Like Mother, Like Daughter.  It's titled Confessions of an Organized Housewife by Deniece Schofield, published in 1982, and (hooray!) at my library.My main thought after reading it was, wow, I am already doing most of what she recommends.  Wow, maybe I am a good housekeeper. . . that has sustained me for a few weeks now.Schofield makes the point that having a clean, organized house frees you up to focus on things you really want to do.  Yes, that has been my experience.  If the house is at bottom organized and regularly cleaned, you can clean off the surface mess (ahem - TOYS) and surface dirt with a minimum of effort and irritation.Another good point:  if you do it well, you'll like housework.  Some organizational things Schofield does that I realized (joy!) I do already:1.  When I'm considering buying something, I ask myself where I'm going to put it in my house. 2.  I store things at or near point of first use. (as opposed to where it \"should\" be kept or where my mother kept it)3.  I store the children's toys on shelves - not in toyboxes or out of sight. 4.  I plan a few menus of varying involvement for a week and then as the week unfolds, I match them up to my schedule for the day. Overall, I do recommend this book. But then, I told you that I like to read housekeeping books. . ."},

One of my friends and I are determined to use our local whole wheat pastry flour to make more than just quick breads.  Back in the day, before trains began hauling hard winter wheat from the Midwest, settlers used the wheat they could grow here on the East Coast:  soft wheat which is what pastry flour is milled from.  But they certainly baked bread, the staff of life.  So I want to figure it out too.  Apparently the Smithsonian has colonial recipes; I'll keep you posted.So, excepting the crust, everything else was local:  my own pizza tomato sauce from the freezer, local organic goat milk mozzarella, local mushrooms.  Then we had a classic accompaniment:  green salad, made with wonderful local organic lettuces and raw turnips, topped with 1000 Island Dressing.  I explained my dressing in this post.At the last minute, my husband and I had some wine from, um, California.  As I write this, I realized there is local beer in the fridge.  Beer and pizza - what's my problem?  My memory?  Apparently I'm still getting the hang of this local thing. . ."},

I also sprinkled just a bit of powdered ginger and powdered garlic in at the end - a slow cooker can sometimes destroy nuanced flavors, in my opinion. Shred with 2 forks. Serve on top of rice or Asian noodles.I put brown rice in the oven (same proportions as white rice, same as stovetop) in a covered casserole. Timed bake for 1 hour, 10 minutes.The night before I made a winter cabbage salad, adding some chopped scallions and rice vinegar to emphasize the Asian flavors. In the summer, I use Thai basil from my little garden.If you've never had beef cooked in soy sauce, you should try it; the salt tenderizes the beef and the cooking mellows the whole thing into richness. You must have a crisp, clean tasting accompaniment for it such as pickled ginger, lightly steamed snow peas or broccoli, or an endive salad with oranges."},

As I lay on the sofa, I finally reached the last of the Southern Living magazines my friend Andrea had given me (thank you, Andrea!). I had torn out a few recipes and when I considered what to eat as we moved past the B.R.A.T. diet, I recalled the one below. It is named for the public health nurses who once showed young mothers how to make nutritious meals. I was amused that it was \"nursing\" my family back to health and strength.Community Nurse Macaroni & CheeseCook until very al dente:1 box (16 oz) macaroniMix together in bowl:1 c. dry milk1/4 c. flour1 tsp. salt2 c. water1 tsp.

Top with:1/2 c. bread or cracker crumbsBake at 375 for 35-45 minutes (until bubbly and edges are turning tan).It's an easy mac-n-cheese, but I can tell I'm not myself: normally I would have halved this recipe and still had leftovers. And I totally forgot to put the flour in until it was in the oven for 10 minutes, so I called my friend Rebecca for advice. On her recommendation, I whisked the flour with a bit of milk and tried to shove it down into the baking goop without disturbing the crumbs over much.Overall, we liked it, but I would have liked more creamy stuff clinging to the macaroni. However, I am not fond of making white sauces, so I might fiddle around with this one to get it more to my liking."},

Directions from More with Less.First soak 1/3 cup mung beans overnight.  I want to find local organic alfalfa seeds to sprout - it's on my to-do list, so I'll report back on the results.Then put the soaked beans in some kind of dishtowel that won't irritate you if it gets stained.  Fold the towel loosely over the beans.  Put the whole business in a colander, run warm water through it, and set it in a warm dark place to grow.  My warm dark place was inside a stock pot that I store on top of my refrigerator, covered with a beach towel just in case light was peeking in.  I know, very attractive.  Now write yourself a note because you have to run warm water through the cloth/beans three times a day for three or four days.  This is mine:After day one, hopefully your beans have started sprouting.In 3-4 days, or when the white sprouted part is at least an inch long, they're done!  Put them in the fridge and use them within a few days.Use them to make Eggs Foo Yung (along with local organic celery, spring onions, ground beef, and eggs).  So easy, so delicious, but next time I want to use some of my Christmas ham squirreled away in the freezer instead of ground beef.Eat with brown rice (organic, not local) and sauce with nothing local (sighhhh - they do grow soy beans around here - is local soy sauce in the future?).Then have some local apples, roasted while the rice baked, with local butter and non-local brown sugar.  With homemade yogurt from local milk.  My sister, who stopped by at dinnertime (\"really? what time is it??\") was very grateful.

So it does slide down if she is jumping on the trampoline or running to market.  See how nice Genevieve is standing in this picture?  I bribed her with a piece of gum.  She will do anything for gum.  Anyway, my friend Rebecca told me that back in the day, all little girls had suspenders on their skirts that solved this problem.  The suspenders could be worn over or under tops.  I've since seen this phenonmenon in Eloise Wilkin illustrations.  But I'm simply too lazy to put straps on G's skirt.  I did put a pocket on it, though, for her little hanky."},
{"title": "Sunday Dinner: Not Quite Corn Pone", "date": "Monday, January 25, 2010", "text": "On Saturday, I soaked some beans for a few hours, then cooked and seasoned them. I was planning to put corn pone on time-bake while we were at church. ButOn Saturday night when I was looking over final plans, I realized that I probably could not do corn pone on time-bake because the beans are supposed to be hot when you dollop the cornbread batter on top; plus, the batter just has baking soda in it and I haven't experimented with the night kitchen method for baking soda baked goods. I considered putting the beans on timed-bake to be hot when we got home and then putting the batter on top, but it has to bake for 30 minutes. That seemed a bit long for my goal.Too late to change plans entirely, I just defrosted cornbread and we ladled seasoned, juicy beans over cornbread for Sunday dinner. Just fine, and rather plain, to balance the rich 7-Layer Salad. This is a standard of Mennonite potlucks because it must be assembled entirely ahead of time and it's just dang good.First Genevieve helped me wash and tear spinach for the first layer.Then I used what I had: defrosted peas, chopped celery, grated carrot, chopped hard boiled eggs, and chopped spring onions. Just so you know, Mom, I do have the \"correct\" recipe!The final three layers are a mayonnaise dressing, grated cheese and bacon bits.Before going to church, I put the beans in the oven in my covered Dutch oven and set the timed baked for 40 minutes at 350, to finish at noon. When we got home, I had hot beans, defrosted corn bread, and a salad in the fridge. All we had to do was set the table. I squeezed in a quick photo.UPDATED7-Layer Salad Recipe (from my mother)1 med head lettuce, dried and torn1 c. diced celery1 c. frozen peas, defrosted 1/2 c. diced green pepper ( I usually use grated carrots)1 c. sweet onion, dicedLayer ingredients, starting with lettuce, in order given in large shallow pan - a glass 9x13 is best.  Spread dressing over top, sealing edges:1 and 1/2 c. mayo2 Tbs. sugara little glug of vinegarSprinkle with:1 and 1/4 c. grated Swiss4 slices bacon, cooked and crumbledCover tightly.  Refrigerate at least 8-10 hours. Serves 6-8 as a side dish. A very sturdy salad that keeps well in the fridge.  I do substitute vegetables - sometimes I use spinach instead of lettuce - and sometimes I add fresh parsley in addition to the bacon on top.  You can add sliced hardboiled eggs to the veggie layers too."},

But local things are disappearing from the farmer's market - things that I was counting on to be root-cellared are not even there. Now I am scrabbling to find local vegetables and suddenly I realized something that all locavores probably came to a long time ago:The food ethnic to my area, Pennsylvania Dutch, is based on what's available in the dead of winter: dairy, meat, and potatoes. This may seem obvious, but suddenly I understood all the PA Dutch specialties. And I realized, looking further, that other areas have an ethnic cuisine to match their off-season stores too. It tickles me to realize that even in our modern shipping era, we are still entangled in the roots of what grows here. So, here is my rather PA Dutch farm meal (well, minus the meat because my family only eats meat occasionally).I made a gratin with local cauliflower, local broccoli from the freezer, local organic onions, local milk, homemade bread, local organic cheddar, and local butter.The cheese sauce. . . to be spooned over the waiting steamed vegetables (I called this a \"cruciferous gratin.\")Gratin done, on the table with a side of Pickled Red Beets. This is a very traditional PA Dutch side dish that I canned this summer. My grandmother got the recipe from her mother and maybe it goes back even further - my grandmother doesn't know. This recipe appears in Simply in Season. You must make Red Beet Eggs with the leftover juice, not only because the eggs are magenta, but because they are so so so good.Thinking local, I recalled my frozen local cherries and whipped up this super-fast, delicious cobbler from More with Less.Fruit CrumbleIn a greased 8x8 baking dish, put 2.5 cups fruit (cherries, pared sliced apples or peaches); a little juice is fine.

{"title": "Sabbath Rest", "date": "Wednesday, January 20, 2010", "text": "I do not work on Sundays; I take a Sabbath the way I think God wants people to.  So I do pleasant things that refresh me:  go to church, nap, read, hike, and visit with family and friends.  I do not shop, dine out or do housework (except for Sunday dinner - more on that in a bit).There was a time, as a teacher, that I felt compelled by my work load to get a lot of schoolwork done on Sundays.  I hated Sundays more than any day of the week because I resented never getting a break.  Now I love Sundays.  And even though my housework is not onerous or overwhelming, I need that break and am usually happy to dive back into it on Monday mornings; and by Saturday, all I want is a long afternoon with a book.  It's balanced, see?In the spirit of celebration with family, we eat a big meal after church.  OK, ok, it's also a deep bow to tradition.  I make an effort to plate the food nicely in the kitchen or use nice serving dishes on the table; I want my family to know they are important enough to warrant the extra dishes and fuss that is associated with company.  Occasionally we light candles or have flowers too.Even though we have a big meal after church, I actually don't do a lot of cooking on Sundays.  Because my children are totally out of patience when church is over, I plan dinner so it's basically ready to go when we walk in the door.  I'd like to explain to you how I do this in a little series called \"Sunday Dinner\" because it's a different kind of meal planning and preparation.  Every Monday (not Sunday!!) I will post on our Sunday dinner.  Due to the exigencies of this meal, the photos will probably be less attractive: half-empty serving dishes and partially filled plates.  If you are not a Sabbath rester, you could still employ these techniques and recipes for days when you have no time to prepare dinner or want to use the time for something else (I occasionally run errands between 4 and 6pm - the children are rested from their naps and then I give them a big snack to keep them going).Here is last Sunday's dinner when it was over, as children were being whisked off to naps:This meal started on Wednesday when I put a chuck roast in the fridge to thaw.  On Saturday night, I browned it and put it in my slow cooker crock.  I piled it with the rest of the stuff from the recipes (I cobbled together about 3 recipes).  Whole baby bella mushrooms, carrot chunks, and sliced onions; red wine, beef stock, some canned tomatoes, dried thyme, pepper and salt.  Put the lid on the whole business and put the crock in the fridge.  On Sunday morning, as soon as I got up, I put the crock in the slow cooker and turned it on high.  When we left for church, I turned it to low.  I followed one of the recipes for thickening it when we got home, to my regret.  It called for a beurre manie, which is butter and flour rubbed together; it was too much fat.  I should have followed my instinct and whisked flour into cold wine or water and then into the hot stew.  When I thickened the stew, I also hacked the roast into smaller pieces, added some chopped garlic, more pepper and thyme, and a slug of Worcestershire sauce (to up the salt and flavor at the same time).Sunday dinner menu:Beef Bourguignonegg noodles (cooked when we got home)peas (freezer; cooked when we got home)pepper cabbage (got out of freezer on Saturday)I actually did more cooking when we got home from church than I usually do.  But that will be evident as this series progresses.  Meanwhile, I'd love to hear the whats and whys of your Sundays. . ."},

What happens when the snaps lose their \"snap\" and won't stay closed?  I confess that I have thrown some pants away.  But two things in my brain clicked recently:  I have sewing skills!  People with few resources would find a way to make this work! (thinking of the Great Depression and 40 year old VW bugs in Mexico)First I tried a tip an older woman gave me (at my husband's grandfather's funeral, no less, when Ben's overall legs kept popping open).  I gently hammered on the little post in the snap, trying to make it fatter so it would stick better in the other side.  Didn't work for me.I checked out the snaps at the fabric store.  It's not like replacing a button, apparently - buying presses and what-not.  Too fiddly and expensive.So I sewed Ben's pants' seams shut!! I actually cut out the strip of snaps on his denim overalls - the ones he's wearing in the photo - but on his lined corduroy overalls, I just sewed them closed.  I used a denim needle on my machine and went as far as I could, then finished the pants by hand. I'm so pleased that Ben is getting more wear out of the pants!"},
{"title": "The Thrifty Woman's Dream, or, I LOVE Leftovers!", "date": "Friday, January 15, 2010", "text": "First of all, I do not actually call the food in my refrigerator and freezer \"leftovers.\" I call it by its name, because no one wants to eat something called \"leftovers.\" If someone asks what we're having for dinner, I say, \"we are having Liberian Pumpkin again.\" How I manage the extra-food-which-is-not-called-leftovers:1. It's lunch for the children and me, and often, packed for my husband. Occasionally we have sandwiches for lunch, but in the main, lunch meat and cheese is expensive and the former is downright unhealthy. Besides, it's faster to heat up servings in the microwave than fiddle with making sandwiches that my daughter sobs over \"MOM!!! IT FELL APART!\"2. I freshen up the dish before I serve it againWays to freshen a dish: ***reheat it in the oven so the house fills up with its scent again - a scented house is one of the lovely benefits of cooking.***first saute an onion in the soup pot before dumping in the soup to reheat***add some minced garlic or snipped parsley at the end***melt some cheese on top3. I make dishes or look for recipes that transform previous dishes. The best ideas for this come from the More With Less cookbook. I rarely serve cornbread again, but use it instead in cornbread dressing. See what I did with baked corn here.4. I serve it with something different, made fresh, this time. Roast beef example here.5. If something can freeze well and it's enough for another meal, I freeze it. Then I pull this out for a meal that I don't have time to cook for (Sunday dinner, for example). This is my convenience food! Easy, healthy, thrifty.6. In my opinion, a leftovers buffet is bad. It involves fighting over choice leftovers, unappetizing combinations if you're the last in line, and unbalanced meals. I like to plan meals so they taste good together, but mixing up three days' worth of leftovers rarely makes winning combinations.7. If I go to the trouble to shop for ingredients, get out my pots and pans, and prep food, it is less trouble to just double the recipe than it is to start over from scratch another time for another meal. You have heard of people who do all their cooking for a month on one day; I'm using their concept, but making it more manageable.Finally, a picture and a recipe!A few nights ago I served Liberian Pumpkin. In my trusty More with Less is an idea for transforming leftover pasta and red sauce. Mix the leftover pasta with an egg and some grated cheese (if it's long pasta, I also chop it up a bit). My pasta is usually already slicked with olive oil, but you could add some melted butter here too. Press this into a greased pie pan, forming a pie crust configuration. Put some more cheese (or cottage cheese) in the bottom of the \"crust.\" Could add some vegetables here too. Then dump the thick sauce into the pie and sprinkle more cheese on top. Bake at 350 for 20-30 minutes - until heated well, and cheese is melted. This is more interesting than just heating up piles of spaghetti. In the case of the Liberian Pumpkin, the homemade noodles stayed so chewy, but glommed onto the cheese in an amazing way. That's what got me thinking about how wonderful leftovers really are."},

{"title": "Winter Cabbage Salad", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2010", "text": "When I was growing up, my mother would occasionally make a platter of shredded cabbage with sliced tomatoes on top. Over that she would sprinkle lemon juice (the bottled kind - this was the 80s after all). We commonly ate this with rice and beans. It was a good contrast in texture and flavor. But I tweaked the original recipe a bit and now we eat this pretty often, with more than just rice and beans. Local produce is sparse at market these days, but there is plenty of cabbage! And I'm with Erin on the lemons.In the bottom of the serving bowl, mix together:zest and juice of one lemon or limeabout 1/4 tsp. salt (or more to taste)1/2 tsp. sugar glug of olive oil - maybe 1 Tbs. - just enough to take the edge off the citrusShred cabbage however finely you have time and patience for to equal between 2 and 4 cups. Sometimes I mince a few garlic cloves too, or add a little parsley; one time my friend added finely chopped arugula. Toss cabbage (and other stuff) with dressing. This is good if it has a chance to sit for an hour or two. But if you keep it longer than 2 days, the salt draws too much water out of the cabbage and the whole business gets watery and soft. I have seen my husband eating it out of the fridge this way, so perhaps it's still fine.Another thing of note: sugar is well-used like salt. I add a smidge to things sometimes when I don't know what else to do, and just like salt can, it brightens or mellows flavors. In this salad, it is just softening the citrus a bit, along with the olive oil.Not a beautiful salad, but very tasty. And the beans & rice goulash we had with it looked like a brown pile, so we just ate it without taking pictures."},
{"title": "Gee's Bend Inspiration", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2010", "text": "I grew up saturated with a certain kind of modern Mennonite quilt:  carefully coordinated fabric bought specially for the design, intricate piecing with even more intricate infinitesimal white quilting on top.  The colors were peach, Williamsburg blue, mauve, and forest green in the 80s.  Now it seems to be pink and green.  These are the kinds of quilts that are made and sold at fundraising auctions.  Until a few years ago, I thought that's what quilts were.(Oh dear, I only have time for a short post - I've got the can of worms in my hand).Well, in short, I checked out The Quilts of Gee's Bend as recommended by Leila.  I had heard of Gee's Bend before, from USPS stamps, but never seen the quilts or the women up close.I am utterly amazed.  The quilts of Gee's Bend are amazing.  Shifting definitions and ideas in my head.  Already narrowing my eyes at my stash and my future quilt plans.  Fingering Kim's quilt with fresh vision and desire.  Wishing I could go talk to the ladies of Gee's Bend and feeling shy.This winter, I had been asking myself in irritation why I can't find a shorter project to sew than quilts; I even dabbled in painting and wallhangings.  But I adore the play of color and texture in quilts and then you get to USE THEM - other projects just don't satisfy.  I have been re-inspired by The Quilts of Gee's Bend."},
{"title": "Dark Days Week 8:  Liberian Pumpkin", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2010", "text": "I didn't intend to start making dinner at 5pm. But by 5:35, we were sitting down to dinner and I was quite proud of myself. My husband said, \"if this is Dark Days' eating, I hope the days get even darker.\" Awwww.All ingredients are from my county and organic with the exception of the cheese and broccoli - not organic. I should point out that before this speedy supper, I made Liberian Pumpkin and roasted broccoli numerous times; nothing like a new recipe to slow down supper.So. Here's how I did it.Brown some local, spicy sausage, 1-2 cups (if your sausage is regular, you can add some kind of hot peppers later or at the table). Set aside.Peel and whack up some squash - I used butternut - about 3-4 cups. Depends on how much squash you want left over (as soon as I hauled out the squash, my daughter asking hopefully if I was making pie - yes, my darling, later this week). Put in pan with some oil (or the leftover sausage grease if you're in a rush - ahem). While that's sauteing, chop up 1-2 onions and add.Cook and stir for maybe 10 minutes. When the squash is softening slightly and the onions are looking translucent, pour in 1 cup of something - wine, water, stock - add the browned sausage, and cover. Check it - depending on the size of the squash pieces, it could need 10-20 minutes to be soft enough. I like it when some squash has turned to mush and spread around, giving it a saucy quality; obviously this takes longer. Meanwhile, I was roasting broccoli and putting pasta water on to boil. I put a few tablespoons of salt in my pasta water which gives the pasta a wonderful briny taste. Here is my gorgeous local (not like last time!) pasta made by an Amish man named David Stoltzfus - so local that the label only says \"local free-range organic eggs and organic flour.\" Voila!!The Liberian Pumpkin recipe comes from Simply in Season with some minor modifications by me; they suggest eating it on rice which doesn't appeal to me. We also sprinkle ours with cheese (parmigiano reggiano if we're not eating local - tonight a local sharp cheddar).With a bit more time, I would have made a green salad with a sharp viniagrette; I like Liberian Pumpkin with something brisk and vinegary.Liberian Pumpkin (ingredients in a nutshell)1-2 c. browned sausage (spicy, or add hot sauce or dried hot peppers)3-4 c. chopped winter squash1-2 c. chopped onion1 c. stock, wine, or waterserve on pasta, top with cheese"},

{"title": "A Warm Lovey", "date": "Thursday, January 7, 2010", "text": "Recently my daughter has been asking for the hot water bottle when she takes her afternoon rest.  Hot water bottles and rice bags (fabric bag filled with dry rice, nuked in the microwave) are such a comfort in cold Northern winters - good for tummy aches, sitting-still-jobs, and beds that bodies haven't warmed up yet.  And I love making rice bags and hot water bottle covers - a colorful scrappy project that doesn't have to match anything, like potholders.  For the bottle cover, I messed around with the buttonhole function on my new Bernina when I made it last year:  a good test run where the results are not on display as they would be in garments.  The frog came empty from someone else's stash and my friend estimates her great grandmother made him in the 60s.  It was the work of 5 minutes to fill him with rice and sew shut.  I very carefully experimented with microwaving him because of his vintage button eyes, but it works just fine to heat him up."},

Zest and juice part of a (guilty) lemon; tame it with a bit of sugar and olive oil, add some salt. Then dress the leftover local organic roasted sweet potatoes, turnips, and (non-local) garlic. This is winter salad.Serve to delighted family. They like the taste, and I also like the ease, nutrition, and simplicity. A note about balanced meals: I am particular about having vegetables, carbs, and protein at meals. Chard Cheese Bake is basically complete: protein from the eggs and cheese, carbs from bread, and vegetables from chard and onion. But I like a bit more for dinner. So root vegetables, which hover between vegetable and carbohydrate, are a good companion for this meal. They are chewy and smoky from being roasted - a nice contrast to the soft, rich egg dish - and adding the extra punch of vegetable and tummy-filler for the children."},

The woman selling it started reminiscing: she knitted it for her sons and hoped to pass it on to her grandsons, but they - the sons and their wives - didn't want it. Whaaaat?! I bought it instantly with indignation and pity; she sold it to me for (sit down) a quarter.I took it home, darned the holes, and washed it.

They tasted like baking powder (THREE teaspoons!); they were hard and dry (probably the melted butter instead of oil that quick breads usually use); and despite what Nigella says, they are not loaded with dried cranberries at all.

Yes, Mom, I've been seeing these ugly terrycloth things cutesied up with ducks and hearts and whatnot for a long time.  These towels are very practical.  But mine is DIFFERENT!  It's hip and vintage-sweet.  You'll see, Mom:  I'll make more and maybe I'll even give you one (gasp).  You don't have Williamsburg blue and geese in your kitchen any more, hallelujah, so I'll make you a cool oven towel.A tradition in Sweden for a young girl to wake her family on December 13 with coffee and saffron buns.  These were very easy and so fun to roll out and shape."},
{"title": "Check? Check. And an Oven Towel", "date": "Saturday, December 12, 2009", "text": "Here I am, a bit nervous. It *seems* simple to blog, but is it? I'll find out!\r\rIn keeping with the point of this blog, here is a photo of an oven towel I made last night. It was 10pm when I pulled out my sewing machine and put my itchy fingers into my fabric scraps. I just \"shopped\" a glorious stash of fabric at my friend's mother's kind invitation, so I couldn't concentrate on, oh, dishes or getting children to bed or anything, until I cut into and stitched something up.\r\rThe oven towel was made with both fabrics from the mother's stash and a vintage button from my stash. I didn't measure or pin a thing, so I shouldn't be irritated that the box pleats are not even. But I am. This was mad hot get-it-done fever. \r\rI realized that this oven towel concept could be a great thing. I always flop any number of dishtowels over my oven handle and use them interchangeably for drying dishes and hands. Not very sanitary. So now I can reserve the oven towel just for hands. I hope.\r\rThis might be a Christmas present. I'm not sure if I can live with the imperfect box pleats or not. I'm pretty casual about projects for my own home, but for someone else? Hmmmm. In any case, I will be making more of these."}
