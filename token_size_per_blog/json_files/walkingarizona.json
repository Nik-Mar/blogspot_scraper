The skeletons are called calacas, which are whimsical representations of the deceased in various scenes of everyday life. They are often made of papier-mache, wood, clay, or sugar or in this case, iron.The calacas are displayed in homes, altars, streets, and cemeteries during the Day of the Dead, which takes place every year on November 1 and 2. They are meant to celebrate and remember the lives of the departed, as well as to mock death and show that it is not something to be feared. The calacas are also decorated with bright colors and flowers, especially marigolds, which are believed to attract the souls of the dead with their scent. The calacas are a unique and festive way of expressing the Mexican worldview and spirituality."},
{"title": "Dolphin Statue Cozumel, Mexico ", "date": "Wednesday, December 13, 2023", "text": "Quoting from Microsoft Bing Chat:Cozumel is an island and municipality in the Caribbean Sea off the eastern coast of Mexico’s Yucatán Peninsula. It’s located just off the east coast of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and is directly across the water from Playa Del Carmen. The island is known for its white sand beaches, coral reefs, and modern amenities.Cozumel was once a bustling Mayan community with as many as 10,000 local residents2. Sacred to the Mayan Moon Goddess, Ix Chel, the island and its temples were an important place of pilgrimage for women seeking fertility. The remnants of that once thriving civilization can still be seen today in the small ruins of San Gervasio in the island’s forested interior.Today, Cozumel is a popular tourist destination. It has two very different sides: the modern amenities around its main town of San Miguel, and numerous places on the far side of the island to get away from it all. Cozumel is considered a very safe area to travel to, especially compared to other parts of Mexico.Cozumel is especially known for its warm, tropical water, snorkelers and scuba divers from across the globe enjoy exploring the island’s reef, teeming with aquatic life. No trip to Cozumel is complete without a boat ride (or two) around the island’s magnificently blue waters.The tropical climate in Cozumel is reasonably predictable and easy to make plans around. Without much of a temperature difference throughout the year, (the average temperature lingers around 83° F) it’s the rainy season that travelers should pay attention to."},

{"title": "Olmec Colossal Head from Central America", "date": "Tuesday, October 24, 2023", "text": "This is a lifesize replica of an Olmec head found in a botanical garden on the island of San Miguel de Cozumel. This particular sculpture was reproduced from an Olmec head or colossal head labeled as number 1 in the Xalapa's museum of Anthropology. It is also known as \"el rey\" (the king) It was found in San Lorenzo, Tenochtitlán (name of the archeological site, usually shortened to San Lorenzo), located at Texistepec, State of Veracruz, México. It dates from 1200 to 900 years B.C. and is 2.9 meters high and 2.1 meters wide. See “File:Cabeza Colosal No1 Del Museo Xalapa.Jpg.” In Wikipedia, May 9, 2012. https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Cabeza_Colosal_n%C2%BA1_del_Museo_Xalapa.jpg&oldid=491549457 Here is a brief explanation of the origin of these remarkable carvings from “Cabeza colosal.” In Wikipedia, la enciclopedia libre, October 19, 2023. https://es.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cabeza_colosal&oldid=154729115.The Olmec colossal heads are stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders. They range in height from 1.17 to 3.4 meters (3.8 to 11.2 ft) and weigh an average of 8 tons.The heads date from at least 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the Olmec civilization, the first civilization to develop in Meso-America.The Olmec civilization flourished in the lowlands of southeastern Mexico, especially in the states of Veracruz and Tabasco, between 1500 and 400 BC. The heads are believed to portray powerful individual Olmec rulers, as they display unique facial features and expressions that may be considered portraits. The heads also wear protective helmets that were worn by the Olmec in battle and during the Meso-American ballgame. Some helmets have jaguar paws or talons as symbols of political and religious power.The boulders used for the heads were brought from the Sierra de Los Tuxtlas mountains of Veracruz, over 150 kilometres (93 mi) away from some of the Olmec sites. The method and logistics used to transport the stone remain unclear, but it is likely that they used river rafts and log rollers. The heads were sculpted using hard hand-held stones and drilled with reeds and wet sand to create depth and detail. They were probably originally painted with bright colors. Seventeen confirmed examples of the heads have been discovered to date, from four sites within the Olmec heartland: San Lorenzo, La Venta, Tres Zapotes, and Rancho La Cobata.The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major Olmec centers, but some were moved or buried by later cultures or natural events. Dating the monuments remains difficult because of the lack of archaeological context for many of them. Most have been dated to the Early Pre-classic period (1500–1000 BC) with some to the Middle Pre-classic (1000–400 BC) period."},

Furthermore, the two genera are very different in habitat, behavior and appearance, and are not even classified in the same family. Even though box turtles became very popular pets, their needs in captivity are complex and the capture of turtles can have serious detrimental effects on the wild population.The box turtle commonly lives over twenty years, with verified cases of lifespans exceeding 40 to 50 years.

Here is a modified quote from ChatGPT. Note, I am finding that using ChatGPT for \"research\" meaning looking up stuff and ending up using Wikipedia most of the time, is a resource as long as you spend the time to edit the response. I have marked the parts of the response in red that I would delete and included any additions or changes in blue. The Paris, France Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly referred to as the Paris Temple, is a religious edifice [The statement is redundant] located in the suburb of Le Chesnay-Rocquencourt, near Paris, France. It is one of the temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which is a global Christian denomination that is often informally referred to as the Mormon Church. The use of the term \"Mormon\" as applied to the Church or its members is not appropriate. The Paris Temple serves as a sacred place of worship and is considered to be a significant symbol of the Church's presence and growth in France and Europe.The history of the Paris Temple dates back to the mid-19th century when the first missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arrived in France in 1849. However, it was not until much later, in the early 20th 21st century, that the idea of constructing a temple in France was seriously considered. The Church announced its plans to build a temple in Paris on July 15, 1982,  in July of 2011. The announcement was met with excitement and anticipation among the French Latter-day Saint community.The construction of the Paris Temple began on August 7, 1987 24 24 August 2012, with a groundbreaking ceremony presided over by church leaders. The temple was designed in a modern style with classical elements, featuring a white granite exterior and a striking spire that reaches a height of 146 feet [There is no spire]. The temple was built on a 5.5 2.26-acre plot of land and has a total floor area of approximately 46,000 44,175 square feet.The Paris Temple was dedicated on May 21, 1994, by Gordon B. Hinckley, who was the president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at that time. The dedication ceremony was attended by thousands of church members and invited guests, and it marked the temple as a consecrated place of worship for Latter-day Saints in France and surrounding countries. The Temple was dedicated on 21 May 2017 by Henry B. Eyring. Since its dedication, the Paris Temple has been an important center of worship and spiritual activity for the Church's members in France and neighboring countries. It is used for various religious ceremonies, including baptism for the dead, endowments, and sealings, which are considered sacred ordinances in the Latter-day Saint faith. The temple is also a place where members can find peace, solace, and inspiration through prayer, meditation, and reflection.The construction and dedication of the Paris Temple have been seen as significant milestones in the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in France and Europe. It has become a symbol of the Church's growth and progress in the region, and it stands as a testament to the faith and dedication of its members. Today, the Paris Temple continues to serve as a spiritual anchor for Latter-day Saints in France and neighboring countries, as they strive to live according to their religious beliefs and principles.Here are some comments about the accuracy of the ChatGPT response. Superficially, the response looks impressive. It just happens to have some glaring errors and inappropriate comments. I proof-read the ChatGPT response and made some significant corrections. My corrections included deletions. The most obvious error from ChatGPT was a reference to a spire on the temple. The information about the size of the site and the size of the temple was totally inaccurate. The whole discussion about the dedication was entirely wrong and inaccurate. When you have something that is being used as much as ChatGPT that is this inaccurate, you have to think more than twice about using it."},

By the way, here is what Chat.OpenAI.com had to say about the castle.Coca Castle is a castle located in the town of Coca, in the province of Segovia, Spain. It is a well-known example of the fusion of Moorish and Gothic architectural styles.The castle was originally built in the 11th century by the Moorish ruler Almanzor as a military fortress to protect the region from Christian invaders. It was later expanded and renovated by the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella in the 15th century, adding Gothic elements such as pointed arches and ribbed vaults.As a result, Coca Castle is an interesting blend of both Moorish and Gothic architectural styles. The castle's exterior features the sturdy, fortified walls and towers characteristic of a military fortress, while the interior includes Gothic details such as pointed arches, ribbed vaults, and decorative plasterwork.Today, Coca Castle is a popular tourist attraction, offering visitors the chance to explore its history and architecture, as well as to enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding countryside.

The ranchers dragged chains across the desert with bulldozers and destroyed the juniper trees under the mistaken notion that removing the trees would improve the rangeland for cattle. It didn't and the juniper trees are still growing back. But the use of chains and bulldozers hasn't stopped. See \"Watch This 25,000-Pound Battleship Anchor Chain Rip Through Juniper in Nevada.\" The justification for this procedure is to improve the rangeland for species that already live in the area. Here is a link to the counter-argument, See \"Old Chaining Page: Chaining in the American West,\""},

Out of the nearly 600 cliff dwellings concentrated within the boundaries of the park, 75% contain only 1-5 rooms each, and many are single room storage units. If you visit Cliff Palace, you will enter an exceptionally large dwelling which may have had special significance to the original occupants.

The ‘petals’ are crystals flattened on the c crystallographic axis, fanning open in radiating flattened crystal clusters.The rosette crystal habit tends to occur when the crystals form under arid sandy conditions, such as a shallow salt basin becoming evaporated. The crystals form a circular series of flat plates that give the rock a similar shape to a rose blossom.Read more : https://www.geologypage.com/2020/03/desert-rose-what-is-desert-rose-how-do-desert-roses-form.html#ixzz7PcytqdkNThis is a closeup of one of the specimens that we have in our living room.  This is a gypsum mineral with sand."},

{"title": "Coralline Algae?", "date": "Monday, March 21, 2022", "text": "My best guess as to what this is, is coralline algae. Here is an explanation of what this might be from Wikipedia: Coralline Algae. Coralline algae are red algae in the order Corallinales. They are characterized by a thallus that is hard because of calcareous deposits contained within the cell walls. The colors of these algae are most typically pink, or some other shade of red, but some species can be purple, yellow, blue, white, or gray-green. Coralline algae play an important role in the ecology of coral reefs. Sea urchins, parrot fish, and limpets and chitons (both mollusks) feed on coralline algae. In the temperate Mediterranean Sea, coralline algae are the main builders of a typical algal reef, the Coralligène (\"coralligenous\"). Many are typically encrusting and rock-like, found in marine waters all over the world. Only one species lives in freshwater. Unattached specimens (maerl, rhodoliths) may form relatively smooth compact balls to warty or fruticose thalli.If you have a better guess, let me know. Oh, this photo was taken on the Pacific side of Costa Rica."},
{"title": "Shelf Fungi in Costa Rica", "date": "Saturday, March 19, 2022", "text": "As I travel around the world, I am always surprised to find things that are familiar and remind me of home. I have always been fascinated by shelf fungi. Here is a short explanation of this interesting fungus from Wikipedia: Polypore. Polypores are a group of fungi that form large fruiting bodies with pores or tubes on the underside (see Delimitation for exceptions). They are a morphological group of basidiomycetes-like gilled mushrooms and hydnoid fungi, and not all polypores are closely related to each other. Polypores are also called bracket fungi or shelf fungi, and they characteristically produce woody, shelf- or bracket-shaped or occasionally circular fruiting bodies that are called conks.Most polypores inhabit tree trunks or branches consuming the wood, but some soil-inhabiting species form mycorrhiza with trees. Polypores and the related corticioid fungi are the most important agents of wood decay, playing a very significant role in nutrient cycling and carbon dioxide production of forest ecosystems.Over one thousand polypore species have been described to science, but a large part of the diversity is still unknown even in relatively well-studied temperate areas. Polypores are much more diverse in old natural forests with abundant dead wood than in younger managed forests or plantations. Consequently, a number of species have declined drastically and are under threat of extinction due to logging and deforestation."},

Other falcons are more adapted to active hunting in flight. Kestrels are notable for usually having mostly brown in their plumage."},

The classification \"pheasant\" is paraphyletic, as birds referred to as pheasants are included within both the subfamilies Phasianinae and Pavoninae, and in many cases are more closely related to smaller phasianids, grouse, and turkey (formerly classified in Perdicinae, Tetraoninae, and Meleagridinae) than to other pheasants.I have seen several of these birds in Utah.

They have been found across the Earth, with dramatic forms found in the Jodhpur-Ajmer section of India's Thar Desert, Petra, Jordan, Coastal California and Australia, and even in the Arctic regions, and Antarctica. The common factors in the environments in which they are found are high salt concentrations and frequent or occasional desiccating conditions.These rocks are in a small mountain range in the West Desert of Utah called the Honeycomb Hills."},

They are native to the hot and dry (arid) parts of the Americas and the Caribbean.Early reports of the species were confused with the cassava (Manihot esculenta). Consequently, Linnaeus mistakenly derived the generic name from the Taíno word for the latter, yuca. The Aztecs living in Mexico since before Spanish arrival, in Nahuatl, call the local yucca species (Yucca gigantea) iczotl, which gave the Spanish izote.Izote is also used for Yucca filifera.These plants are the Boyce Thompson Arboretum near Superior, Arizona."},

{"title": "Poinsettia", "date": "Saturday, December 4, 2021", "text": "The plant most associated with Christmas is perhaps the poinsettia. This isn't really a flower. The red part of the plant are the leaves. The flowers are the tiny parts of the plant in yellow. Here is an explanation from Wikipedia: Poinsettia.The poinsettia (/pɔɪnˈsɛtiə/ or /pɔɪnˈsɛtə/) (Euphorbia pulcherrima) is a commercially important plant species of the diverse spurge family (Euphorbiaceae). Indigenous to Mexico and Central America, the poinsettia was first described by Europeans in 1834. It is particularly well known for its red and green foliage and is widely used in Christmas floral displays. It derives its common English name from Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first United States Minister to Mexico, who is credited with introducing the plant to the US in the 1820s. Poinsettias are shrubs or small trees, with heights of 0.6–4 m (2.0–13.1 ft). Though often stated to be highly toxic, the poinsettia is not dangerous to pets or children. Exposure to the plant, even consumption, most often results in no effect, though it can cause nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.Wild poinsettias occur from Mexico to southern Guatemala, growing on mid-elevation, Pacific-facing slopes. One population in the Mexican state of Guerrero is much further inland, however, and is thought to be the ancestor of most cultivated populations. Wild poinsettia populations are highly fragmented, as their habitat is experiencing largely unregulated deforestation. They were cultivated by the Aztecs for use in traditional medicine. They became associated with the Christmas holiday and are popular seasonal decorations. Every year in the US, approximately 70 million poinsettias of many cultivated varieties are sold in a six-week period. Many of these poinsettias are grown by Paul Ecke Ranch, which serves half the worldwide market and 70% of the US market.Euphorbia pulcherrima is a shrub or small tree, typically reaching a height of 0.6–4 metres (2–13 ft). The plant bears dark green dentate leaves that measure 7–16 centimetres (2.8–6.3 in) in length. The colored bracts—which are normally flaming red, with cultivars being orange, pale green, cream, pink, white, or marbled—are often mistaken for flower petals because of their groupings and colors, but are actually leaves. The colors of the bracts are created through photoperiodism, meaning that they require darkness (at least fourteen hours at a time for 6–8 weeks in a row) to change color. The plants also require abundant light during the day for the brightest color.The flowers of the poinsettia are unassuming. They are grouped within the cyathia (small yellow structures found in the center of each leaf bunch, or false flowers). Nothing is known about pollination in wild poinsettias, though wasps are noted to occasionally visit the cyathia. All flowers in the Euphorbiaceae are unisexual (either male or female only), and they are often very small in size. In Euphorbia, the flowers are reduced even more and then aggregated into an inflorescence or cluster of flowers. I don't usually do images in black and white, but these winter flowers growing in a greenhouse were most beautiful from their white color and form."},

The bones are on the side of a huge cut into a hill where bones have been found since 1909. They are still working on extracting the bones. Her is a quote from Utah.com about the monument. In 1909, paleontologist Earl Douglass was searching for fossils for the Carnegie Museum when he discovered a formation layered with prehistoric plant and animal fossils. A quarry was established and in 1915 Dinosaur National Monument was created to protect 80 acres in the quarry area. Today the monument includes 210,844 acres. Many fossils are embedded in a sloping rock formation that was once a sandbar on the edge of a large river. As the river carried animal carcasses downstream, many became stuck on the sandbar, which eventually turned to rock. As a result, fossils from hundreds of creatures are concentrated in a small area. Many fossilized bones have been partially exposed but left intact in the rock where they can be easily seen. A building was constructed over the area, which is now known as \"The Quarry\" at the monument.Research is ongoing. In Feb 2010, a team of paleontologists from Dinosaur National Monument, Brigham Young University, and the University of Michigan announced the discovery of a new, large, plant-eating dinosaur, Abydosaurus McIntosh.The Quarry area makes up only a small part of the land included within the national monument. The remaining area includes canyons cut by the Green and Yampa rivers. The park backcountry is incredibly rugged and remote. It is very scenic and some areas have high wilderness value."},

Within the park, the exposed formations range from the middle Jurassic Period (180 million years ago) to the Cretaceous Period (95 million years ago). Here is a description of the layers from a Kodachrome State Park Brochure:Carmel Formation: Deposits from an inland sea that existed 180 million years ago formed this layer. This is the oldest exposed formation in the park. The Carmel Formation is characterized by solid layers of the mineral gypsum, which forms white striations in the red colored cliffs in the lower elevations of the park.Entrada Formation: Lying just above the Carmel Formation is the red colored Entrada. The Entrada was formed from deposits that were laid down during the mid-to-late Jurassic Period, approximately 180 to 140 million years ago. It is primarily composed of fine grained sandstone along with gypsum, shale, quartz and clay. This formation is one of the most scenic in the park due to its color. It also forms the ubiquitous “slickrock” of southern Utah. Most of the sedimentary pipes found within the park occur in this formation.Henrieville Sandstone: Deposited near the end of the Jurassic Period, the Henrieville Sandstone is white to tan in appearance. Deposits of Henrieville Sandstone are almost unnoticeable in the main part of the park. However, Grosvenor Arch, located approximately 11 miles south of the park, was formed within this sandstone.Dakota and Tropic Shale Formations: These are the uppermost formations visible in the park.

In most cases, the models you see in the museums of sailing ships were part of the plans and promotion to raise money to build the ship. Military ships were no exception. It is interesting because a few of the model ships never became full-scale ships due to failure to raise the money or changes in plans by the governments. We have seen some very impressive collections of model ships in the Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.  This is a gilded model cannon from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It is dated to around 1745. There is some measure of controversy with this and other objects because they are accused of being obtained by military actions during the Dutch Empire.

Here is a description of the place from Wikipedia: Wieskirche. The Pilgrimage Church of Wies (German: Wieskirche) is an oval rococo church, designed in the late 1740s by brothers J. B. and Dominikus Zimmermann, the latter of whom lived nearby for the last eleven years of his life. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim-Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany.It is said that, in 1738, tears were seen on a dilapidated wooden figure of the Scourged Saviour. The legend of this miracle resulted in a pilgrimage rush to see the sculpture. In 1740, a small chapel was built to house the statue but it was soon realized that the building would be too small for the number of pilgrims it attracted, and so Steingaden Abbey decided to commission a separate shrine. Many who have prayed in front of the statue of Jesus on the altar have claimed that people have been miraculously cured of their diseases, which has made this church even more of a pilgrimage site.Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. \"Everything was done throughout the church to make the supernatural visible. Sculpture and murals combined to unleash the divine in visible form\".There is a popular belief that the Bavarian government planned to sell or demolish the rococo masterpiece during the secularization of Bavaria at the beginning of the 19th century, and that only protests from the local farmers saved it from destruction. Available sources, however, document that the responsible state commission clearly advocated the continuation of Wies as a pilgrimage site, even in spite of economic objections from the abbot of Steingaden.The Wieskirche was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983 and underwent extensive restoration between 1985 and 1991."},

The palace was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honour of Richard Wagner. Ludwig chose to pay for the palace out of his personal fortune and by means of extensive borrowing, rather than Bavarian public funds. Construction began in 1869, but was never fully completed.The castle was intended as a private residence for the King, until he died in 1886. It was open to the public shortly after his death. Since then more than 61 million people have visited Neuschwanstein Castle. More than 1.3 million people visit annually, with as many as 6,000 per day in the summerI think that this, and other hilltop castles in Germany and other places are the basis for the idealization of castles by Disney and other movie producers.

There is a steep, much used, trail from the North Rim down the Canyon and up to the South Rim. The trail along Bright Angel Creek is known as the North Kaibab Trail which starts at an elevation of 8241 feet and ends at the Colorado River at an elevation of 2480 feet above sea level. The trail is a difficult 14 miles long. The trip up to the South Rim is the Bright Angel Trail which leads to some confusion between the north and south rims. The Bright Angel Trail starts at the river, at about the 2400 foot level and ends at the South Rim at 6,850 feet of elevation. The entire hike from Rim to Rim is about 24 miles, one way.

The trains run back and forth between Denver, Colorado and Moab, Utah. We rode from Denver to Moab with a stopover in Glenwood Springs, Colorado. The views were spectacular and it was nice for a change to be a passenger rather than trying to navigate the mountain roads. The rail line has quite a story. Here is a summary from WikipediaL Denver and Salt Lake Railway. The Denver and Salt Lake Railway (D&SL) was a U.S. railroad company located in Colorado. Originally incorporated in 1902 as the Denver, Northwestern and Pacific (DN&P) Railway, it had as a goal a direct connection of Denver, Colorado, with Salt Lake City, Utah. It underwent numerous reorganizations throughout its financially troubled history and by the time the company was acquired in 1931 by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (D&RGW or Rio Grande), it had advanced only as far as Craig, Colorado. After the acquisition the line was connected to the D&RGW main, and the eastern half of the line was used to give the D&RGW a more direct route to Denver. The portions of the railroad still in use today are known as the Moffat Tunnel Subdivision of Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor. Amtrak’s California Zephyr service from Denver to Glenwood Springs follows much of the old D&SL route.The ride has spectacular views and riding on a train is quite an experience. The train travels slow enough that seeing the scenery is possible."},

Local materials used include cream-colored Roman brick and Peach Blow Sandstone; imported items included 12,000 yards of carpet and 2,000 rose bushes. The Hotel Colorado opened on June 10, 1893 to a program including a fireworks display, an orchestra in the ballroom, and dining at midnight for the 300 couples in attendance.The hotel quickly became a popular summer retreat, earning the nickname of \"the little White House of the West\" after extended visits by Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft.

The bird is also known as the American mourning dove, the rain dove, and colloquially as the turtle dove, and was once known as the Carolina pigeon and Carolina turtledove. It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds. It is also a leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70 million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six broods of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of sonation. The bird is a strong flier, capable of speeds up to 88 km/h (55 mph).

The common names refer directly to their horns or to their flattened, rounded bodies, and blunt snouts.The generic name Phrynosoma means \"toad-bodied\". In common with true toads (amphibians of the family Bufonidae), horned lizards tend to move sluggishly, often remain motionless, and rely on their remarkable camouflage to avoid detection by predators. They are adapted to arid or semiarid areas. The spines on the lizard's back and sides are modified reptile scales, which prevent water loss through the skin, whereas the horns on the head are true horns (i.e., they have a bony core). Of the 22 species of horned lizards, 15 are native to the United States. The largest-bodied and most widely distributed of the US species is the Texas horned lizard."},

Twenty-six species have been described, six of which occur in North America and the rest in Eurasia. Some species are considered to have subspecies as well. They are often considered pests due to their habit of defoliating trees. They are among the most social of all caterpillars and exhibit many noteworthy behaviors.Tent caterpillars are readily recognized because they are social, colorful, diurnal and build conspicuous silk tents in the branches of host trees. Some species, such as the eastern tent caterpillar, Malacosoma americanum, and caterpillars of the small eggar moth, Eriogaster lanestris, build a single large tent which is typically occupied through the whole of the larval stage, while others build a series of small tents that are sequentially abandoned. Whereas tent caterpillars make their tents in the nodes and branches of a tree's limbs, fall webworms enclose leaves and small branches at the ends of the limbs."},

As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a population of 35,193. In 2019 the estimated population was 38,797.The center of Hot Springs is the oldest federal reserve in the United States, today preserved as Hot Springs National Park. The hot spring water has been popularly believed for centuries to possess healing properties, and was a subject of legend among several Native American tribes. Following federal protection in 1832, the city developed into a successful spa town. Incorporated January 10, 1851, the city has been home to Major League Baseball spring training, illegal gambling, speakeasies and gangsters such as Al Capone, horse racing at Oaklawn Park, the Army and Navy Hospital, and 42nd President Bill Clinton. One of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the United States, the Assemblies of God, traces its beginnings to Hot Springs.Today, much of Hot Springs's history is preserved by various government entities. Hot Springs National Park is maintained by the National Park Service, including Bathhouse Row, which preserves the eight historic bathhouse buildings and gardens along Central Avenue. Downtown Hot Springs is preserved as the Central Avenue Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The city also contains dozens of historic hotels and motor courts, built during the Great Depression in the Art Deco style. Due to the popularity of the thermal waters, Hot Springs benefited from rapid growth during a period when many cities saw a sharp decline in building; much like Miami's art deco districts. As a result, Hot Springs's architecture is a key part of the city's blend of cultures, including a reputation as a tourist town and a Southern city. Also a destination for the arts, Hot Springs features the Hot Springs Music Festival, Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival, and the Valley of the Vapors Independent Music Festival annually."},

About 1,000,000 US gallons (3.8 ML) of 143 °F (62 °C) water flow from the springs each day. The flow rate is not affected by fluctuations in the rainfall in the area. Studies by National Park Service scientists have determined through radiocarbon dating that the water that reaches the surface in Hot Springs fell as rainfall 4,400 years earlier. The water percolates very slowly down through the earth's surface until it reaches superheated areas deep in the crust and then rushes rapidly to the surface to emerge from the 47 hot springs.Hot Springs Creek flows from Whittington Avenue, then is underground in a tunnel beneath Bathhouse Row (Central Ave).

A separate species, Viscum cruciatum, occurs in Southwest Spain and Southern Portugal, as well as in Morocco in North Africa and in southern Africa. The genus Viscum is not native to North America, but Viscum album was introduced to Northern California in 1900.European mistletoe has smooth-edged, oval, evergreen leaves borne in pairs along the woody stem, and waxy, white berries that it bears in clusters of two to six. The Eastern mistletoe of North America is similar, but has shorter, broader leaves and longer clusters of 10 or more berries.The eastern mistletoe native to North America, Phoradendron leucarpum, belongs to a distinct genus of the family Santalaceae.Over the centuries, the term has been broadened to include many other species of parasitic plants with similar habits, found in other parts of the world, that are classified in different genera and families such as the Misodendraceae of Chile and Argentina and the mainly southern hemisphere tropical Loranthaceae.So, whatever this actually is, we call it mistletoe."},

When the hot water makes its way through the rock layers to erupt as a geyser, it picks up a variety of minerals. As the water cools, those minerals are deposited on the area surrounding the geyser. Because the temperature of the water takes time to drop to the ambient temperature, bacteria and algae begin to grow right at up the the heat threshold. I am always fascinated by the details of the world around me."},

Here is a short history of the name from Wikipedia: Kodachrome Basin State Park. Evidence near the park suggests that Native Americans were the first to wander through the area. Around the turn of the 20th century, cattlemen from Cannonville and Henrieville used the basin as a winter pasture. In 1948 the National Geographic Society explored and photographed the area for a story that appeared in the September 1949 issue of National Geographic. They named the area Kodachrome Flat, after the brand of Kodak film known for its vibrant color rendition. In 1962 the area was designated a state park.

The flowers are usually large, showy and brightly colored, generally red, pink, yellow, or white (usually in warm colors). They often have a different colored blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals, collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations, and a long history of cultivation, classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14 other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.

One of our stops was in Birmingham, Alabama to see the exterior of the 16th Street Baptist Church and to visit Kelly Ingram Park across the street. Here is a short discussion from Wikipedia about the importance of this church. The 16th Street Baptist Church is a Baptist church in Birmingham, Alabama, United States, affiliated with the Progressive National Baptist Convention. In 1963, the church was bombed by Ku Klux Klan members. The bombing killed four young girls in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement. The church is still in operation and is a central landmark in the Birmingham Civil Rights District. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Since 2008, it has also been on the UNESCO list of tentative World Heritage Sites.Here is a description of the events in 1963 from the same article.During the civil rights movement of the 1960s, the 16th Street Baptist Church served as an organizational headquarters, site of mass meetings and rallying point for African Americans protesting widespread institutionalized racism in Birmingham, Alabama, and the South. The reverends Fred Shuttlesworth, who was the chief local organizer, Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)) leader Martin Luther King Jr., and SCLC leader James Bevel, who initiated the Children's Crusade and taught the students nonviolence, were frequent speakers at the church and led the movement.On Sunday, September 15, 1963, Thomas Blanton, Bobby Frank Cherry and Robert Edward Chambliss, members of the Ku Klux Klan, planted 19 sticks of dynamite outside the basement of the church. At 10:22 a.m., they exploded, killing four young girls - Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Denise McNair. Twenty-two other victims suffered injuries. They were there preparing for the church's \"Youth Day\". A funeral for three of the four victims was attended by more than 8,000 mourners, white and black, but no city officials.This was one of a string of more than 45 bombings within the decade. The neighborhood of Dynamite Hill was the most frequently targeted area during this time. The bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church increased Federal involvement in Alabama. President Johnson passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act the following year; and in 1965 the Voting Rights Act was passed, making literacy tests and poll taxes illegal.Following the bombing, more than $300,000 in unsolicited gifts were received by the church and repairs were begun immediately. The church reopened on June 7, 1964. A stained glass window depicting a black Jesus, designed by John Petts, was donated by citizens of Wales and installed in the front window, facing south. My life changed dramatically during the 1960s. I spent two years in Argentina as a full-time missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I came back with a changed perspective about poverty, racial equality, and civil rights."},

They float on or just beneath the surface of still or slow-moving bodies of fresh water and wetlands. Also known as \"bayroot\", they arose from within the arum or aroid family (Araceae), so often are classified as the subfamily Lemnoideae within the family Araceae. Other classifications, particularly those created prior to the end of the twentieth century, place them as a separate family, Lemnaceae.These plants have a simple structure, lacking an obvious stem or leaves. The greater part of each plant is a small organized \"thallus\" or \"frond\" structure only a few cells thick, often with air pockets (aerenchyma) that allow it to float on or just under the water surface.

{"title": "Central High School, Little Rock, Arkansas", "date": "Monday, April 12, 2021", "text": "On a recent trip through some of the southern states of the United States of America, we stopped off at the historic Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. During most of the early integration conflict in the United States, I was too young and inexperienced to appreciate what was going on. Now that I have seen a lot more history and learned a lot more about what was happening during my early years, I have a greater appreciation for the courage and sacrifices made to integrate our nation's schools. I spent many of my early years living in a totally segregated town. I did not even realize it was segregated until many years after I moved on to other places. Here is a brief summary of the importance of this Central High School from Wikipedia: Little Rock Central High School.Built in 1927 at a cost of $1.5 million, Little Rock Senior High School was designed in the Gothic Revival style; it was hailed as the most expensive, most beautiful, and largest high school in the nation. Statues of four figures over the front entrance represent ambition, personality, opportunity, and preparation. Its opening earned national publicity, with nearly 20,000 people attending the dedication ceremony. In 1953 it was renamed as Little Rock Central High School.At the time in Arkansas and other states across the South, public school educational facilities were legally racially segregated. In 1954 the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that such segregation in public schools was unconstitutional, and encouraged the states to integrate their schools. Related historic events in the 1950s changed education at Central High School and throughout the United States.LRCHS was the focal point of the Little Rock Integration Crisis of 1957. Nine Black students, known as the Little Rock Nine, were denied entrance to the school in defiance of the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ordering integration of public schools. This provoked a showdown between the Governor Orval Faubus and President Dwight D. Eisenhower that gained international attention.On the morning of September 23, 1957, the nine Black high school students faced an angry mob of over 1,000 Whites in front of Central High School who were protesting the integration project. As the students were escorted inside by the Little Rock police, violence escalated, and they were removed from the school. The next day, Eisenhower ordered the 1,200-man 327th Airborne Battle Group of the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to escort the nine students into the school. By the same order, he federalized the entire 10,000-man Arkansas National Guard, in order to remove them from the control of Governor Faubus. At nearby Camp Robinson, a hastily organized Task Force 153rd Infantry drew guardsmen from units all over the state. Most of the Arkansas Guard was quickly demobilized, but the ad hoc Task Force 153rd Infantry assumed control at Thanksgiving when the 327th withdrew, and patrolled inside and outside the school for the remainder of the school year.

My earliest memories of desert plants date from when I was very young and we had several huge agaves in our front yard. They were impressive because as a small child, they were very large and had sharp spines on the end of each leaf. Here is a more complete description from Wikipedia: Agave. Agave (/əˈɡɑːvi/, UK also /əˈɡeɪvi/,[2] Anglo-Hispanic: /əˈɡɑːveɪ/)[3] is a genus of monocots native to the hot and arid regions of the Americas, although some Agave species are also native to tropical areas of South America. The genus Agave (from the Ancient Greek αγαυή, agauê) is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves. Agave now includes species formerly placed in a number of other genera, such as Manfreda, ×Mangave, Polianthes and Prochnyanthes.Plants in this genus may be considered perennial, because they require several to many years to mature and flower. However, most Agave species are more accurately described as monocarpic rosettes or multiannuals, since each individual rosette flowers only once and then dies; a small number of Agave species are polycarpic.Along with plants from the closely related genera Yucca, Hesperoyucca, and Hesperaloe, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants in hot, dry climates, as they require very little supplemental water to survive. Most Agave species grow very slowly. Some Agave species are known by the common name \"century plant\""},

Almost all species are easily recognised as Leucospermum because of the long protruding styles with a thickened pollen-presenter, which jointly give the flower head the appearance of a pincushion, its common name. Pincushions can be found in South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and Mozambique.The shrubs mostly have a single stem at their base, but some species sprout from an underground rootstock, from which the plant can regrow after fire has killed the above ground biomass. In a larger group of species, specimens are killed by fire, and their survival depends on the seeds. In all species, seeds are collected by ants, which take them to their underground nests to feed on their ant breads, a seed dispersal strategy known as myrmecochory. This ensures that the seeds do not burn, so new plants can grow from them.This interesting flower was found in the Los Angeles Arboretum and Botanic Garden, in Arcadia, California."},

{"title": "Sun Dog", "date": "Saturday, January 30, 2021", "text": "I got a call from one of my daughters who told me to go outside and look at the sun dog. This turned out to be one of the brightest and most distinctive sun dogs I had ever seen. Most people are not aware of this phenomenon but it is not uncommon. What is uncommon is to have the sun dog almost as bright as the sun itself. If you don't know about sun dogs see the following Wikipedia article, \"Sun dog.\" Here is a quote from the article.Sun dogs are commonly caused by the refraction and scattering of light from plate-shaped hexagonal ice crystals either suspended in high and cold cirrus or cirrostratus clouds, or drifting in freezing moist air at low levels as diamond dust. The crystals act as prisms, bending the light rays passing through them with a minimum deflection of 22°. As the crystals gently float downwards with their large hexagonal faces almost horizontal, sunlight is refracted horizontally, and sun dogs are seen to the left and right of the Sun. Larger plates wobble more, and thus produce taller sundogs.Sun dogs are red-colored at the side nearest the Sun; farther out the colors grade through oranges to blue. The colors overlap considerably and are muted, never pure or saturated.[4] The colors of the sun dog finally merge into the white of the parhelic circle (if the latter is visible).The same plate-shaped ice crystals that cause sun dogs are also responsible for the colorful circumzenithal arc, meaning that these two types of halo tend to co-occur. The latter is often missed by viewers, since it is located more or less directly overhead. Another halo variety often seen together with sun dogs is the 22° halo, which forms a ring at roughly the same angular distance from the sun as the sun dogs, thus appearing to interconnect them. As the Sun rises higher, the rays passing through the plate crystals are increasingly skewed from the horizontal plane, causing their angle of deviation to increase and the sun dogs to move farther from the 22° halo, while staying at the same elevation.It is possible to predict the forms of sun dogs as would be seen on other planets and moons. Mars might have sun dogs formed by both water-ice and CO2-ice. On the gas giant planets—Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune—other crystals form clouds of ammonia, methane, and other substances that can produce halos with four or more sun dogs.By the way, the sun is on the left."},

Several varieties are recognized by the Japanese, distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, and cream. The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke, which is made up of the Kohaku, Taisho Sanshoku, and Showa Sanshoku varieties."},

{"title": "Oxen", "date": "Sunday, January 24, 2021", "text": "You might be surprised by this explanation about oxen from Wikipedia: Ox.An ox (plural oxen), also known as a bullock in Australia and India, is a bovine trained as a draft animal. Oxen are commonly castrated adult male cattle; castration makes the animals easier to control. Cows (adult females) or bulls (intact males) may also be used in some areas.Oxen are used for plowing, for transport (pulling carts, hauling wagons and even riding), for threshing grain by trampling, and for powering machines that grind grain or supply irrigation among other purposes. Oxen may be also used to skid logs in forests, particularly in low-impact, select-cut logging.Oxen are usually yoked in pairs. Light work such as carting household items on good roads might require just one pair, while for heavier work, further pairs would be added as necessary. A team used for a heavy load over difficult ground might exceed nine or ten pairs.In short, usually, an ox is a cow or more specifically a steer.  There is no specific animal that is an ox."},

There is an ongoing controversy about the names of physical features on the landscape. Many of these names were applied when the public sense of political and social correctness was not nearly so heavy-handed as it is now. I am certainly in favor of changing the names of geographic features and even manmade places that reflect prejudice and are derogatory to any group of people whether racially motivated or merely rude and inappropriate, but I also think that every rock on the face of the earth does not need its own special name. This \"peak\" however is grossly inappropriately named and a new designation for this rock formation at the mouth of Rock Canyon is long overdue.  Here is a view of the same canyon from across the valley.

The building has never been a home to a monarch and stood roofless until 1957.The structure was commanded by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who wished to establish his residence close to the Alhambra palaces. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V intended to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. The project was given to Pedro Machuca, an architect whose biography and influences are poorly understood. At the time, Spanish architecture was immersed in the Plateresque style, still with traces of Gothic origin. Machuca built a palace corresponding stylistically to Mannerism, a mode still in its infancy in Italy. The exterior of the building uses a typically Renaissance combination of rustication on the lower level and ashlar on the upper. Even if accounts that place Machuca in the atelier of Michelangelo are accepted, at the time of the construction of the palace in 1527, the latter had yet to design the majority of his architectural works."},

Here is the current definition of a desert from the USGS article \"What is a desert?\"There are almost as many definitions of deserts and classification systems as there are deserts in the world. Most classifications rely on some combination of the number of days of rainfall, the total amount of annual rainfall, temperature, humidity, or other factors. In 1953, Peveril Meigs divided desert regions on Earth into three categories according to the amount of precipitation they received. In this now widely accepted system, extremely arid lands have at least 12 consecutive months without rainfall, arid lands have less than 250 millimeters of annual rainfall, and semiarid lands have a mean annual precipitation of between 250 and 500 millimeters. Arid and extremely arid land are deserts, and semiarid grasslands generally are referred to as steppes.In case you don't automatically convert metric measurements, here are the equivalents: 250 millimeters = about 10 inches and, of course, 500 mm is about 20 inches. Heber Valley where the Deer Creek Reservoir is located gets about 20 inches of rain a year making it right on the edge of the semi-arid definition. Where I live in Provo, we get about 18 inches of rain a year. The U.S. average rainfall across the entire country is about 38 inches of rain a year. However, currently, Utah County, where we live and the location of the Deer Creek Reservoir are both under an Exceptional Drought. The entire state has had less than an inch of rain in the last 60 days."},

The Ironton Works, as it was known, was one of the largest pig iron plants in the west, and was built beginning in 1922 by Columbia Steel on a 385-acre site near Springville. To move slag cars between the coking plant and blast furnaces, Columbia ordered a single 0-6-0 from Baldwin that was delivered in 1923 and numbered 200. By the next year the plant was in full production, and the first pig iron was produced. Coal (to be converted to coke for use in the by-product ovens) was mined locally and delivered to the plant by Columbia's own short line, the Carbon County Railway.Columbia returned to Baldwin shortly after the plant opened for an additional 0-6-0, No.300, which was built and delivered in May 1925. Modern in design, the 300 features piston valves, power reverse and a Westinghouse cross-compound air compressor. By comparison, sister 200 was a bit older in design, having just one single-stage compressor. A slope-back tender was necessary for visibility while switching."},

{"title": "Shoreline of Utah Lake", "date": "Saturday, October 17, 2020", "text": "Both Utah Lake and the Great Salt Lake in Utah are remnants of the huge Lake Bonneville the largest Late Pleistocene paleolake in the Great Basin of western North America. Quoting from Wikipedia: Lake Bonneville,The Western Interior Seaway preceded Lake Bonneville. Lake Bonneville was a pluvial lake that formed in response to an increase in precipitation and a decrease in evaporation as a result of cooler temperatures. Lake Bonneville covered much of what is now western Utah and at its highest level extended into present-day Idaho and Nevada. Many other hydrographically closed basins in the Great Basin contained expanded lakes during the Late Pleistocene, including Lake Lahontan in northwestern Nevada.Here in Utah Valley, we live right next to the \"Bench\" which is really the old shoreline of Lake Bonneville. Here is some further explanation about this huge lake from the article cited above:Lake Bonneville was not a “proglacial” lake, although it did form between about 30,000 and 13,000 years ago when glaciers at many places on Earth were expanded relative to today during the last major glaciation. For most of its existence (that is, during the transgressive plus regressive phases) Lake Bonneville had no river outlet and occupied a hydrographically closed basin. Changes in lake level were the result of changes in water balance caused by climate change (a simplified version of the water-balance equation is inputs equal outputs plus-or-minus storage changes). Storage changes are equal to volume changes, and changes in volume are correlated with changes in lake level. When inputs (i.e., precipitation; runoff in rivers) were greater than outputs (i.e., evaporation from the lake surface; evapotranspiration in the basin), lake level rose, and when outputs were greater than inputs, lake level fell. Changes in global atmospheric circulation led to changes in the water budget of Lake Bonneville and other lakes in the Great Basin of western North America. Mountain glaciers in the Bonneville drainage basin stored less than 5% of the water that Lake Bonneville held at its maximum, so that even if all the mountain glaciers in the basin melted at once and the water flowed into the lake (this didn't happen—it took thousands of years for the mountain glaciers to melt, and Lake Bonneville was falling by that time), it would have had little effect on lake level. Lake Bonneville had no river connection with the huge North American ice sheets. While Lake Bonneville existed the patterns of wave- and current-forming winds were not significantly affected by the Laurentide and Cordilleran ice sheets in northern North America."},

This photo was taken from the Copper Pit Overlook on a very high ridge looking over the mine. The access road to the overlook is barely passible for a regular car but not impossible for a four-wheel-drive, high clearance vehicle. I drove our Subaru Outback up the road without a problem. Here is a short explanation of the mine from Wikipedia: Bingham Canyon Mine.The Bingham Canyon Mine, more commonly known as Kennecott Copper Mine among locals, is an open-pit mining operation extracting a large porphyry copper deposit southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah, in the Oquirrh Mountains. The mine is the largest man-made excavation, and deepest open-pit mine in the world, which is considered to have produced more copper than any other mine in history – more than 19 million tons. The mine is owned by Rio Tinto Group, a British-Australian multinational corporation. The copper operations at Bingham Canyon Mine are managed through Kennecott Utah Copper Corporation which operates the mine, a concentrator plant, a smelter, and a refinery. The mine has been in production since 1906, and has resulted in the creation of a pit over 0.75 miles (1,210 m) deep, 2.5 miles (4 km) wide, and covering 1,900 acres (3.0 sq mi; 7.7 km2). It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966 under the name Bingham Canyon Open Pit Copper Mine. The mine experienced a massive landslide in April 2013 and a smaller slide in September 2013. Butterfield Canyon is in the Orquirrh Mountains on the west side of the Salt Lake Valley. It is a relatively unknown canyon because of the narrow winding road with steep grades. Part of the road is still unpaved and quite rough. However, for those with some fortitude, the ride is well worth the 10 mph limitations imposed by the road. If you are at all faint of heart when faced with thousand-foot drop-offs on the side of a narrow road, I would not recommend the drive. The weather was fabulous and the Fall leaves were stunning."},

The area is designated as the Kofa National Wildlife Refuge. Here is a short history of the Wildlife Refuge from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website.Major Frederick R. Burnham, a frontiersman turned conservationist, observed that populations of bighorn sheep were sharply declining and appealed to the Boy Scouts to take up the cause. For two years, more than 10,000 boy Scouts and their leaders campaigned to protect bighorn sheep through a “save the bighorns” poster contest, talks, and dramatizations on the radio and at school assemblies. As a result of the campaign, land was set aside for the establishment of Kofa Game Range (as the refuge was originally known) and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge. Kofa Game Range was managed jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management until 1976 when it was awarded to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and renamed Kofa National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge's name was derived from an acronym for one of the area’s most notable mines, the King of Arizona gold mine.  Kofa National Wildlife Refuge is part of the National Wildlife Refuge System, a national network of lands and waters managed for the benefit of wildlife and you. The refuge offers excellent opportunities to enjoy wildlife-dependent activities, including wildlife watching and photography, hiking, camping, and limited hunting.

I am fascinated by these fungi and have thought that I should have begun my studies with fungi and lichen years ago. Here is a brief explanation of these unusual fungi from Wikipedia: Polypore. Polypores are a group of fungi that form large fruiting bodies with pores or tubes on the underside. They are a morphological group of basidiomycetes-like gilled mushrooms and hydnoid fungi, and not all polypores are closely related to each other. Polypores are also called bracket fungi, and their woody fruiting bodies are called conks.Most polypores inhabit tree trunks or branches consuming the wood, but some soil-inhabiting species form mycorrhiza with trees. Polypores and the related corticioid fungi are the most important agents of wood decay, playing a very significant role in nutrient cycling and carbon dioxide production of forest ecosystems.Over one thousand polypore species have been described to science, but a large part of the diversity is still unknown even in relatively well-studied temperate areas. Polypores are much more diverse in old natural forests with abundant dead wood than in younger managed forests or plantations. Consequently, a number of species have declined drastically and are under threat of extinction due to logging and deforestation.Polypores are used in traditional medicine, and they are actively studied for their medicinal value and various industrial applications. Several polypore species are serious pathogens of plantation trees and are major causes of timber spoilage."},

{"title": "Walnut Canyon National Monument, Arizona", "date": "Friday, August 28, 2020", "text": "Walnut Canyon National Monument is known for its remarkable rocks and ancient cliff dwellings but it is also a lovely canyon. Here is a quote from the National Park Service website for the National Monument. Walnut Canyon has a long human history. Artifacts show that Archaic peoples, who traveled throughout the Southwest thousands of years ago, occupied the canyon at times.Later came the first permanent inhabitants, who flourished in the region from about A.D. 600 until 1400. Archeologists labeled this prehistoric culture Sinagua, from the old Spanish name for the region, Sierra de Sin Agua, or “mountains without water.”Scattered families farmed the canyon rims for centuries, growing small gardens of corn, squash, and beans. During the 1100s, many moved into limestone alcoves below the canyon rim, where they constructed the cliff dwellings we see today. The Walnut Canyon community thrived for another 150 years before the people moved on.If you look carefully at the lower right of the photo, you can see part of the paved staircase dropping down into the canyon to the level of the cliff dwellings. Walnut Canyon is about 7000 feet above sea level and the descent to see the cliff dwelling goes down almost 200 feet into the canyon with lots of stair steps."},

{"title": "Split-rail Fence, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania", "date": "Saturday, August 15, 2020", "text": "I grew up with barbed wire fences so I am fascinated with split-rail fences. Here is a short description of the history of this type of fence from Wikipedia: Split-rail fence.A split-rail fence or log fence (also known as a zigzag fence, worm fence or snake fence historically due to its meandering layout) is a type of fence constructed in the United States and Canada, and is made out of timber logs, usually split lengthwise into rails and typically used for agricultural or decorative fencing. Such fences require much more timber than other types of fences, and so are generally only common in areas where wood is abundant. However, they are very simple in their construction, and can be assembled with few tools even on hard or rocky ground. They also can be built without using any nails or other hardware; such hardware was often scarce in frontier areas. They are particularly popular in very rocky areas where post hole digging is almost impossible. They can even be partially or wholly disassembled if the fence needs to be moved or the wood becomes more useful for other purposes. During the American Civil War, these split rail fences were a major source of firewood for both the Union and Confederate armies.Split rail fences were made of easy to split, rot-resistant wood. Traditionally American chestnut was the timber of choice until chestnut blight eliminated this tree. Currently, most split rails are made from cedar. Whether of chestnut or cedar, these logs were cut to a length of 10 to 12 feet (3.0 to 3.7 m) and split down the length of the log. Each half was then split into quarters, then eighths and so on until the rails were of a usable size. A log may produce from four rails from an 8-inch (20 cm) log to over a dozen from larger logs. The rails are stacked on top of one another. Most split rail fences have the rails stacked in an interlocking zig-zag fashion that is self-supporting, easy to create, easy to repair, and easy to disassemble.On the Colorado Plateau where I spent some of my younger years, there were no trees except junipers and they were not tall enough or straight enough to make split-rail fences. The juniper trees were only used for fence posts."},

{"title": "Looking at the Wasatch Front in Utah Valley", "date": "Thursday, August 13, 2020", "text": "Much of the western part of Utah is in what is called the \"Basin and Range Province.\" Here is a short description of that area of the United States and part of Mexico.The Basin and Range Province is a vast physiographic region covering much of the inland Western United States and northwestern Mexico. It is defined by unique basin and range topography, characterized by abrupt changes in elevation, alternating between narrow faulted mountain chains and flat arid valleys or basins. The physiography of the province is the result of tectonic extension that began around 17 million years ago in the early Miocene epoch.The numerous ranges within the province in the United States are collectively referred to as the \"Great Basin Ranges\", although many are not actually in the Great Basin. Major ranges include the Snake Range, the Panamint Range, the White Mountains, the Sandia Mountains, and the Tetons. The highest point fully within the province is White Mountain Peak in California, while the lowest point is the Badwater Basin in Death Valley at −282 feet (−86 m). The province's climate is arid, with numerous ecoregions. Most North American deserts are located within it.The Wasatch Front is a metropolitan region that runs from the city of Nephi on the South to Brigham City on the north. This photo is on the east side of Provo in the southern part of the Wasatch Front in Utah Valley. The mountains in the photo are part of the Wasatch Mountains and form the front as the east side of the long valleys that are the basins of the Basin and Range Province.

There are several varieties of onions most commonly seen in this white variety and a red variety. Here is a brief explanation of the plant from Wikipedia: Onion. The onion plant has been grown and selectively bred in cultivation for at least 7,000 years. It is a biennial plant, but is usually grown as an annual. Modern varieties typically grow to a height of 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in). The leaves are yellowish- to bluish green and grow alternately in a flattened, fan-shaped swathe. They are fleshy, hollow, and cylindrical, with one flattened side. They are at their broadest about a quarter of the way up, beyond which they taper towards a blunt tip. The base of each leaf is a flattened, usually white sheath that grows out of the basal plate of a bulb. From the underside of the plate, a bundle of fibrous roots extends for a short way into the soil. As the onion matures, food reserves begin to accumulate in the leaf bases and the bulb of the onion swells.Lately, some cultivated onions in the United States have been recalled because of potential salmonella poisoning."},

We stayed at a National Forest Service campground and enjoyed the view and the access to the lake. Reservations for camping in Utah are sometimes a challenge because of the popularity of the locations but we are tent campers and so we do not compete with all the RV campers.

{"title": "Provo Pioneer Village, Provo Utah", "date": "Wednesday, July 15, 2020", "text": "No, this is not a photo of the Provo Pioneer Village but it down there somewhere in the city. Some time ago, I took several photos of the Provo Pioneer Village and posted them here on Walking Arizona. The Village was built and organized next to a Provo City Park by the Brigham Young Chapter of the Sons of the Utah Pioneers. The photos have not and will not be offered for sale. After the photos had been online for a couple of years, I got an angry comment from someone claiming ownership of the entire premises and demanding that I take down my photos. Since the Village is open to the public and there are no signs limiting photos, I had no notice that someone owned all the rights to the pioneer artifacts and re-creations on display. Too bad they didn't bother to post a sign saying no photos allowed. I was happy to give the Village a little publicity but in response, I think I have taken all the photos down. Normally, unless posted otherwise, a public place can be photographed and the photograph sold without obtaining any specific permission. I am always careful not to include recognizable people in my photos unless they show a street scene or other very public place. As to the Sons of the Utah Pioneers, I have about 15 or more great and great-great-grandparents who crossed the Plains and qualify as \"pioneers\" by arriving in the Salt Lake Valley before 1868. I have been asked many times to join a chapter of the National Society of the Sons of Utah Pioneers and have always deferred because of time constraints. Now, I suppose I have another reason for not joining this organization. I can't imagine the person that demanded that I take down my photos \"owned\" all of the objects in the Village but if he was speaking on behalf of the National Society of the Sons of Utah Pioneers, I suppose he could limit photographs under a claim of ownership but I failed to see any notice on the premises about photography being limited. I wonder if he knows how many photos of the Provo Pioneer Village there are online? A quick look showed me hundreds, if not thousands of photos of the Village. I guess he better get busy telling all these people to take down their photos. The issue of copyright of photos is complex but the issue of taking photos in public places depends on the local definition of \"public.\" Obviously, on military installations and other government areas, photography can be restricted or prohibited without specific permission. With a photograph, there is an issue of whether or not the photo was published. But in the case of a public attraction, all of the items on view are certainly published (put on public view) and some may be more than a hundred years old. However, the copyright law in the U.S. is that anything published that could be protected is now in the Public Domain if published before 1925. In my opinion, it would nearly impossible to prove that any of the items on public display as old artifacts could be claimed to be protected by copyright. In fact, any work (artifact) published before 1977 without a copyright notice is also in the Public Domain. So it would probably be necessary to put a notice on any more recent items that are still covered by copyright.So why did I take all the photos down? Simple, I don't want to have anyone think that I intentionally or otherwise violated someone's claim to ownership or copyright. I have published, to the date of this post, 4497 photos without a previous claim of any nature involving copyright or whatever. I own the copyright to all these photos. They are my original work. Oh, by the way, if I missed a photo of anything in the Village, I will be glad to take it down. Let me know. I suppose I do have to disclose at this point that I may have a subscription to the Sons of the Utah Pioneer's Pioneer magazine that was given to me as a gift but I have yet to see a copy arrive because it is published quarterly. I like the magazine, too bad I have a problem with the organization. I will be glad to give up my subscription if that is a problem for the Society also. In the future, the Utah Lake Trail will almost circumnavigate Utah Lake. Presently, it is a short extension of the Provo River Trail that follows the shoreline of the lake for about a mile or so. The trail becomes almost impassible just before it ends abruptly. The vast expanse of grass and other plants on the left side of the Trail is the Provo River Delta which is currently being reconverted into an active river delta. Currently, the Provo River runs on the south side of the historic delta in a river channel. After excavating some river channels on the delta, part of the river will be diverted into the delta area. The Utah Lake Trail is also planned to be extended. We hope we live that long."},

Grafitti on manmade structures is disrespectful and damaging but graffiti on nature shows a disconnection with the world and is a desecration. Here is another example from the Bonneville Lakeshore Trail. This area is only about a 10-minute walk from my house. Quoting from Wikipedia: Plymouth Rock:Plymouth Rock is the traditional site of disembarkation of William Bradford and the Mayflower Pilgrims who founded Plymouth Colony in December 1620. The Pilgrims did not refer to Plymouth Rock in any of their writings; the first known written reference to the rock dates to 1715 when it was described in the town boundary records as \"a great rock.\" The first documented claim that Plymouth Rock was the landing place of the Pilgrims was made by Elder Thomas Faunce in 1741, 121 years after the Pilgrims arrived in Plymouth.In 1774, the rock broke in half during an attempt to haul it to Town Square in Plymouth. One portion remained in Town Square and was moved to Pilgrim Hall Museum in 1834. It was rejoined with the other portion of the rock, which was still at its original site on the shore of Plymouth Harbor, in 1880. The rock is now ensconced beneath a granite canopy designed by McKim, Mead & White.It is a nice tradition and it is a beautiful place. The rock in on the beach under the \"canopy\" you can see in the middle of the photo."},

It amazes me that this small, inconspicuous partnership can grow in such a hostile environment: on the side of a rock where temperatures reach almost 150 degrees in the summer. Here is a short explanation about lichen from Wikipedia:A lichen (/ˈlaɪkən/ LEYE-ken or, sometimes in the UK, /ˈlɪtʃən/, LICH-en) is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria living among filaments of multiple fungi species[1] in a mutualistic relationship. Lichens have different properties from those of its component organisms. Lichens come in many colors, sizes, and forms and are sometimes plant-like, but lichens are not plants. Lichens may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose), flat leaf-like structures (foliose), flakes that lie on the surface like peeling paint (crustose), a powder-like appearance (leprose), or other growth forms.I have often thought that I should have gotten a degree in Lichenology, a branch of mycology."},

It is native to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, the Mexican state of Sonora, and the Whipple Mountains and Imperial County areas of California. The saguaro blossom is the state wildflower of Arizona. Its scientific name is given in honor of Andrew Carnegie. In 1994, Saguaro National Park, near Tucson, Arizona, was designated to help protect this species and its habitat.Some saguaros are cristate or \"crested\" due to fasciation.A house sparrow nesting on a saguaro cactusSaguaros have a relatively long lifespan, often exceeding 150 years. They may grow their first side arm around 75–100 years of age, but some never grow any arms. Arms are developed to increase the plant's reproductive capacity, as more apices led to more flowers and fruit.A saguaro can absorb and store considerable amounts of rainwater, visibly expanding in the process, while slowly using the stored water as needed. This characteristic enables the saguaro to survive during periods of drought. The saguaro cactus is a common image in Mexican culture and American Southwest films.We grew a saguaro cactus from about 5\" tall to over 10 feet tall when we moved from Mesa, Arizona to Provo, Utah. That took about 30+ years. One of the things I miss most in Utah is the cactus. But the mountains are a great tradeoff."},

I have no idea if this works because it is not my fence, but it looks interesting nonetheless. We have a herd of about seven or eight deer that come to our yard area almost daily.

Although it has been reported from Kashmir and India, recent evidence suggests that specimens from these areas may be a different species. Western salsify has been introduced into North America where it has become widespread, being reported from all the continental United States except for a few in the far south-east, and all provinces of Canada except Newfoundland and the northern territories.Along with tumbleweeds, tamarisk, and other introduced plants, salsify is listed as a \"noxious weed.\" I have always thought of the incongruity of having a list of endangered species alongside a list of noxious, invasive weeds.

Cobblestones are naturally shaped stones, usually rounded and are designed for horses to get a good grip when pulling a load. Both cobblestones and setts have been used since ancient times. Streets paved with stones are still used in some parts of the eastern United States but most of them have been paved over with asphalt. I have seen streets being paved with setts and I would characterize the process as labor-intensive. These particular setts were found in Germany. Here are some observations about setts from Wikipedia.A sett, also known as a block, Belgian block or sampietrini, is a broadly rectangular quarried stone used in paving roads and walkways. Formerly in widespread use, particularly on steeper streets because setts provided horses' hooves with better grip than a smooth surface, they are now encountered rather as decorative stone paving in landscape architecture. Setts are often referred to as \"cobbles\", although a sett is distinct from a cobblestone in that it is quarried or worked to a regular shape, whereas the latter is generally a small, naturally-rounded rock.

He is buried in the church he designed earlier: the 'Zuiderkerk'. The building of the Westerkerk was finished and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser (1595-1676) and inaugurated on June 8, 1631. The church has a length of 58 meters and a width of 29 meters. The high nave is flanked by the two lower aisles. The three-aisled basilica has a rectangular plan with two transepts of equal dimensions. As a result, the plan for this church was given the form of two Greek crosses connected with each other. (a patriarchal cross).Several older churches in Amsterdam, such as Oude Kerk and Nieuwe Kerk, were originally built before the Reformation and were converted to Protestantism during the Reformation in 1578. The Westerkerk was one of the first purposely built Protestant churches. The Noorderkerk and Zuiderkerk preceded the Westerkerk.

As well as being the scientific name, iris is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species, as well as some belonging to other closely related genera. A common name for some species is 'flags', while the plants of the subgenus Scorpiris are widely known as 'junos', particularly in horticulture. It is a popular garden flower.The often-segregated, monotypic genera Belamcanda (blackberry lily, I. domestica), Hermodactylus (snake's head iris, I. tuberosa), and Pardanthopsis (vesper iris, I. dichotoma) are currently included in Iris.Three Iris varieties are used in the Iris flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.An Iris by any other name..."},

There are 67 of these formations inside the State Park and a few more outside the Park. What is most interesting about these particular formations is that there is no generally accepted theory about how they were formed. Here is a quote from the Geoscience Research Institute article entitled, \"Classic Pipes and Dikes in Kodachrome Basin.\"The mechanism for intrusion is problematic and may never be known. Hannum (1980) has suggested that the pipes came from cold springs. Hornbacher (1984) favors seismically induced sediment liquefaction and intrusion. The relatively smooth and striated wall pattern of some pipes (Figure 3) favors the latter interpretation. To add to the mystery, there seems to be little or no disturbance of bedding planes or indication of compressive strain in the sediments surrounding the pipes. This suggests that both the pipe material and the surrounding sediments were soft when the pipes formed.You may want to read the entire article."},

One explanation is that the area was once similar to Yellowstone National Park with hot springs and geysers, which eventually filled up with sediment and solidified. Through time, the Entrada sandstone surrounding the solidified geysers eroded, leaving large sand pipes. Sixty-seven sand pipes ranging from two to 52 meters have been identified in the park.I have seen most of the sixty-seven pipes in the Park.

This adaptation made by the architect has met with very favorable comment from creative architectural artists who have seen it. The exterior of the building is classic in design, that is, it follows the general lines of the master artists and architects of Greece who have been rated as the world's masters in the art of building. The lower or ground floor has been treated as the pedestal upon which have been placed the two upper floors which form the interior of the magnificent order.

It is a lovely spot and very conveniently located.Sandstone is ubiquitous on the Colorado Plateau. Most of the iconic photos associated with this part of the United States either feature sandstone or sand dunes. In this image, the white-capped spires are  \"pipes\" or chimnies of controversial origin. However, the surrounding sandstone has a well-understood origin. Here is an explanation of the origin of sandstone from Wikipedia: Sandstone.Sandstones are clastic in origin (as opposed to either organic, like chalk and coal, or chemical, like gypsum and jasper). They are formed from cemented grains that may either be fragments of a pre-existing rock or be mono-minerallic crystals. The cements binding these grains together are typically calcite, clays, and silica. Grain sizes in sands are defined (in geology) within the range of 0.0625 mm to 2 mm (0.0025–0.08 inches). Clays and sediments with smaller grain sizes not visible with the naked eye, including siltstones and shales, are typically called argillaceous sediments; rocks with larger grain sizes, including breccias and conglomerates, are termed rudaceous sediments.The formation of sandstone involves two principal stages. First, a layer or layers of sand accumulates as the result of sedimentation, either from water (as in a stream, lake, or sea) or from air (as in a desert). Typically, sedimentation occurs by the sand settling out from suspension; i.e., ceasing to be rolled or bounced along the bottom of a body of water or ground surface (e.g., in a desert or erg). Finally, once it has accumulated, the sand becomes sandstone when it is compacted by the pressure of overlying deposits and cemented by the precipitation of minerals within the pore spaces between sand grains. The most common cementing materials are silica and calcium carbonate, which are often derived either from dissolution or from alteration of the sand after it was buried. Colors will usually be tan or yellow (from a blend of the clear quartz with the dark amber feldspar content of the sand). A predominant additional colourant in the southwestern United States is iron oxide, which imparts reddish tints ranging from pink to dark red (terracotta), with additional manganese imparting a purplish hue. Red sandstones, both Old Red Sandstone and New Red Sandstone, are also seen in the Southwest and West of Britain, as well as central Europe and Mongolia. The regularity of the latter favours use as a source for masonry, either as a primary building material or as a facing stone, over other forms of construction."},

The patterns of erosion in Kodachrome Basin are so complex that I suppose anything might be possible but I was intrigued by this solitary rock."},
{"title": "Mallard Duck", "date": "Wednesday, April 22, 2020", "text": "Mallard ducks are rather common but that does not diminish their beautiful feathers. Here is an explanation about Mallards from Wikipedia: Mallard.The mallard (/ˈmælɑːrd/ or /ˈmælərd/) (Anas platyrhynchos) is a dabbling duck that breeds throughout the temperate and subtropical Americas, Eurosiberia, and North Africa and has been introduced to New Zealand, Australia, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, the Falkland Islands, and South Africa. This duck belongs to the subfamily Anatinae of the waterfowl family Anatidae. The male birds (drakes) have a glossy green head and are grey on their wings and belly, while the females (hens or ducks) have mainly brown-speckled plumage. Both sexes have an area of white-bordered black or iridescent blue feathers called a speculum on their wings; males especially tend to have blue speculum feathers. The mallard is 50–65 cm (20–26 in) long, of which the body makes up around two-thirds the length. The wingspan is 81–98 cm (32–39 in) and the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm (1.7 to 2.4 in) long. It is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks, weighing 0.72–1.58 kg (1.6–3.5 lb). Mallards live in wetlands, eat water plants and small animals, and are social animals preferring to congregate in groups or flocks of varying sizes. This species is the main ancestor of most breeds of domesticated ducks."},

So, I am unlikely to get a photo of this gazelle anywhere else. Here is a summary of this beautiful animal from the website for the Smithsonian’s National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute.The dama gazelle, also called the mhorr or addra gazelle, is the largest of the gazelles and was once common and widespread in arid and semi-arid regions of the Sahara. There are currently three recognized subspecies of Nanger Dama: N. dama ruficollis, N. dama dama, and N. dama mhorr. The Smithsonian's National Zoo exhibits N. dama ruficollis. Nanger dama ruficollis, is the lightest in coloration and the most eastern subspecies of the three. Common names for this subspecies include Addra Gazelle, Kordofan Gazelle, and Nubian Red-necked Gazelle. The upper part of their body is mostly reddish brown, whereas the head, rump and under parts are white. Both males and females have horns. They curve back and up, but reach a length of only about 17 inches (43 centimeters) long.

Today there are traces of the outer curtain wall, as well as a number of towers – some in ruins others standing – that mark the boundary where the outer moat circled the castle. All of the outer towers were rectangular in shape. The second curtain wall has a gate near the inner keep with a high brick arch enclosed by a geometric border, the alfiz, which is a classic Moorish design feature. The inner curtain wall has several towers and a talus as well. It has centered cylindrical towers on each side and smaller turrets between them, while the talus is constructed all the way down to the moat. The towers on the corners of the walls are rectangular. The surviving wall is machicolated. This coupled with the talus served as a formidable defence. The battlements on the walls have been constructed as both ornament and as defensive fortifications, so they have been built with crests that jut out from the walls. Brickwork in Mudejar has been used here as well."},

The genus Agave (from the Ancient Greek αγαυή, agauê) is primarily known for its succulent and xerophytic species that typically form large rosettes of strong, fleshy leaves. Plants in this genus may be considered perennial, because they require several to many years to mature and flower. However, most Agave species are more accurately described as monocarpic rosettes or multiannuals, since each individual rosette flowers only once and then dies (see semelparity); a small number of Agave species are polycarpic.Along with plants from the closely related genera Yucca, Hesperoyucca, and Hesperaloe, various Agave species are popular ornamental plants in hot, dry climates, as they require very little supplemental water to survive. Most Agave species grow very slowly. Some Agave species are known by the common name \"century plant\"."},

The portion of the temple that was being torn down was added in a previous restoration. A new larger section of the temple will be added where the current addition is being removed.This Spanish wrought iron (de hierro forjado)  candlestick was found in the Coca Castle in Coca, Spain. Here is a short explanation from Wikipedia: Wrought iron:Wrought iron is an iron alloy with a very low carbon (less than 0.08%) content in contrast to cast iron (2.1% to 4%). It is a semi-fused mass of iron with fibrous slag inclusions (up to 2% by weight), which gives it a \"grain\" resembling wood that is visible when it is etched or bent to the point of failure. Wrought iron is tough, malleable, ductile, corrosion-resistant and easily welded. Before the development of effective methods of steelmaking and the availability of large quantities of steel, wrought iron was the most common form of malleable iron. It was given the name wrought because it was hammered, rolled or otherwise worked while hot enough to expel molten slag.[note 1] The modern functional equivalent of wrought iron is mild steel, also called low-carbon steel. Neither wrought iron nor mild steel contain enough carbon to be hardenable by heating and quenching."},

This was an ornamental arch built in the 16th century, and it was demolished in 1888 due to urban needs. The wall continues to the south and then to the west, in a section that included the Postigo del Consuelo, the Portillo de la Canaleja and the gates of San Martín, la Luna and del Sol.

Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average 100–115 cm (39–45 in) from beak tip to end of tail, with a 155–215 cm (61–85 in) wingspan. The two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water.We enjoyed seeing quite a few of these large birds."},

This subspecies, native to the central plain states, was first described in 1879, and has relatively long legs, better adapted to a prairie habitat. Its body feathers often have a green-coppery sheen. The tips of the tail and lower back feathers are a buff-to-very light tan color.

Here is an excellent example of the views I see while walking. I know this blog is called \"Walking Arizona\" but my horizons continue to expand and who knows where I will be walking next?Despite what you may have heard in a history class, \"Did Marie-Antoinette really say “Let them eat cake”?\" This quote from History.com explains that it is very unlikely that Marie-Antoinette said anything like that:It’s one of the most famous quotes in history. At some point around 1789, when being told that her French subjects had no bread, Marie-Antoinette (bride of France’s King Louis XVI) supposedly sniffed, “Qu’ils mangent de la brioche”—“Let them eat cake.” With that callous remark, the queen became a hated symbol of the decadent monarchy and fueled the revolution that would cause her to (literally) lose her head several years later. But did Marie-Antoinette really say those infuriating words? Not according to historians. Lady Antonia Fraser, author of a biography of the French queen, believes the quote would have been highly uncharacteristic of Marie-Antoinette, an intelligent woman who donated generously to charitable causes and, despite her own undeniably lavish lifestyle, displayed sensitivity towards the poor population of France. That aside, what’s even more convincing is the fact that the “Let them eat cake” story had been floating around for years before 1789. It was first told in a slightly different form about Marie-Thérèse, the Spanish princess who married King Louis XIV in 1660. She allegedly suggested that the French people eat “la croûte de pâté” (or the crust of the pâté). Over the next century, several other 18th-century royals were also blamed for the remark, including two aunts of Louis XVI. Most famously, the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau included the pâté story in his “Confessions” in 1766, attributing the words to “a great princess” (probably Marie-Thérèse). Whoever uttered those unforgettable words, it was almost certainly not Marie-Antoinette, who at the time Rousseau was writing was only 10 years old—three years away from marrying the French prince and eight years from becoming queen."},

Setts are often confused with \"cobblestones.\" The difference is that a sett is a quarried stone of a specific shape and cobblestone is a naturally rounded stone of a uniform size. The sett blocks are called sampietrini in Latin derived countries. The edges of the streets and roads made of setts are usually larger granite blocks called \"kerbs.\" In American English we call our cement relatives \"curbs.\" But the original kerbs were not always raised.

It is a herbaceous perennial which grows annual pseudostems (false stems made of the rolled bases of leaves) about one meter tall bearing narrow leaf blades. The inflorescences bear pale yellow with purple flowers and arise directly from the rhizome on separate shoots. Ginger is in the family Zingiberaceae, which also includes turmeric (Curcuma longa), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum), and galangal. Ginger originated in Island Southeast Asia and was likely domesticated first by the Austronesian peoples. It was transported with them throughout the Indo-Pacific during the Austronesian expansion (c. 5,000 BP), reaching as far as Hawaii. Ginger is one of the first spices to have been exported from Asia, arriving in Europe with the spice trade, and was used by ancient Greeks and Romans. The distantly related dicots in the genus Asarum are commonly called wild ginger because of their similar taste.The older I get, the more I like spices and spicy food. Abundant rainfall along the edge of the Wasatch Front produced quite a crop of grass.

Here are some brief descriptions of the two kinds of Spanish chorizos above.This homemade \"chorizo is made with minced meat and pork fat, seasoned with paprika and garlic, all stuffed in natural casings. The red color so characteristic of chorizo ​​is given by paprika. This characteristic is what differentiates Spanish chorizo ​​from other sausages and sausages from other places. The chorizo is stuffed in pork gut, either from the small intestine or from the large intestine (cular), in our time edible skins of non-animal origin are used.\" See https://www.jamonarium.com/es/cms/33/chorizo-embutido-tradicional-ingredientes-elaboracion-tiposChorizo de Cantimpalos PGI. A cured sausage product made from fresh fatty pork, with salt and pimentón (a type of Spanish paprika) as basic ingredients, to which garlic and oregano may also be added, and subjected to a drying and maturing process. It may be presented in thick or thin slices. See https://www.foodswinesfromspain.com/spanishfoodwine/global/food/products/product-detail/PRG2017732663.htmlI actually like both kinds of chorizos."},
{"title": "Amsterdam Canal", "date": "Saturday, December 7, 2019", "text": "With over 19 million tourists and only 850,000 residents, Amsterdam is constantly busy. On average, there are an additional 52,000 people out in the streets and seeing the sights every day of the year. Tourists are both a blessing and a curse. In the next few years, the number of tourists is expected to increase to over 29 million a year. Obviously, with this huge influx, the facilities of the city are spread thin. On the other hand, many of the residents benefit from the influx of tourists. I lived in Mesa, Arizona for many years and there the increase in \"snowbirds\" was estimated at about 300,000 as compared to the number of full-time residents of just over 500,000. Many of the local businesses focused only on the winter visitors and tourists."},

Juan de la Hoz, carves out this typical Segovian house \"having this façade built in which from the plinth to the ledge, except for the gaps, only ashlars carved in diamond point enter Thus, this ornament does not appear sown here and there by the façade as in that of the Salmantine shells, but rather covers it all, lending it a character of rudeness and medieval sullenness . \"Throughout its history, the building has passed through various owners, both public and private, and in the 1970s it was transferred to the Ministry of Education and Science that rehabilitated and adapted it to install a School of Applied Arts in it, beginning to operate in 1977 .A very interesting building. Here is another photo showing the carved wall."},

But if you look closely, you will see a major difference in the construction in Segovia, Spain. The tiles are laid curve up instead of curve down as they uniformly are in Arizona. I can't guess which method is better. It seems like curve down would help remove rainwater more efficiently. It is the differences in the details that make traveling around interesting. This is the Iglesia de San Millán in Segovia, Spain."},
{"title": "Snow in Utah Valley", "date": "Wednesday, December 4, 2019", "text": "The amount of snow that falls in any given area is generally related to the altitude above sea level, the general level of precipitation, and the latitude of the location. Utah Valley gets an average of 17 inches of rain a year and also averages 46 inches of snow. Of course, the valley gets less snow than the surrounding mountains. Just a few miles east of Provo (shown in the photo) the Sundance Ski Resort gets an average of 113 inches of snow a year. We live within a few dozen feet of the highest homes in Utah Valley and the elevation of our home is about 5000 feet above sea level. The elevation of the valley floor is about 4700 feet above sea level. For comparison, the base elevation of Sundance Ski Resort is 6,100 feet. We live right next to the slope of the bench and our home is almost completely shaded during the winter months so the snow seldom melts after the first major snowfall."},

Driving has been a challenge, but with an all-wheel-drive Subaru and off-road tires, we haven't had any trouble so far. However, whenever you drive in Utah Valley you need to be very aware of the other drivers. Red-light running is endemic and worse when there is snow."},

This street likely goes back to Roman times and the paving stones may actually have been used up to a thousand years ago. Here where I live, they tear down old buildings (with a few exceptions) and repave roads regularly. There is a huge cultural gap between living in my condo and those who live on a street like this. But the difference is likely that I have spent years of my life living in places like this photo but it is unlikely that the people who live on this street have spent years of their lives living in condos in Utah."},

This photo is bridge #1. In the Summer, the water in the creek only runs down the canyon to about this location so crossing the creek without a bridge would not be much of a problem, but in the Spring, there can be a lot of water and it would be moderately dangerous to try a crossing. Some of the bridges are more elaborate. The bridges have become goals for hiking up the canyon. The complete hike to the Rock Canyon Campground is about 5.5 miles up and back from the mouth of the canyon. You gain about 1,700 feet in elevation if you go all the way to the campground. The trail is heavily used on weekends when the weather is good."},

{"title": "The End of Life as we Know It", "date": "Wednesday, November 20, 2019", "text": "One of the fixtures of the old western ranch or farm is an abandoned vehicle or piece of farm equipment left to rust in a field or even in the front yard. I have wondered if the comparative prevalence of these abandoned vehicles is due the lack of trees or if the West is somehow different than the East. Both of the above vehicles would seem to have some value but that value has to be less than the cost of transporting these vehicles somewhere to have them repaired. What I have seen is that the owner buys a new car or truck rather than repair the old one and then just neglects to get rid of the older vehicle. On this particular ranch, we counted about 18 abandoned vehicles some dating back almost 100 years.Ranches and farms in the western part of the country probably do not have any more junk laying around than those who live in more moderate climates. But the dryness of the desert preserves metal and wood far beyond the automatic rust and mold of the East. Someone leaned that saw blade against the wagon wheel ages ago. It looks like it could have been there for over a hundred years and it is likely to be there another hundred. It gives you pause about the importance of material things in our lives, or it should."},

I think of beauty, solitude, majestic, open, inviting, lovely, special, home, and all of the other positive terms we associate with the outdoors and other beautiful places. The West Desert of Utah is one of those special places that provide all of the positive associations. The birds are American avocets or Recurvirostra Americana."},

All of the camping reservations for Havasupai are taken on the first day the registration is opened.

This is the Wieskirche or White Church. Here is a short explanation of this remarkable church from Wikipedia: Weiskirche.The Pilgrimage Church of Wies (German: Wieskirche) is an oval rococo church, designed in the late 1740s by brothers J. B. and Dominikus Zimmermann, the latter of whom lived nearby for the last eleven years of his life. It is located in the foothills of the Alps, in the municipality of Steingaden in the Weilheim-Schongau district, Bavaria, Germany. It is said that, in 1738, tears were seen on a dilapidated wooden figure of the Scourged Saviour. This miracle resulted in a pilgrimage rush to see the sculpture. In 1740, a small chapel was built to house the statue but it was soon realized that the building would be too small for the number of pilgrims it attracted, and so Steingaden Abbey decided to commission a separate shrine. Many who have prayed in front of the statue of Jesus on the altar have claimed that people have been miraculously cured of their diseases, which has made this church even more of a pilgrimage site. Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the Wessobrunner School. \"Everything was done throughout the church to make the supernatural visible. Sculpture and murals combined to unleash the divine in visible form\"."},

There are so many exceptional cliffs in Rock Canyon, in the Wasatch Front, above Provo, Utah, that almost any place you look there are interesting potential climbs. These rocks are on the north side of the Canyon right at the entrance. They are hardly ever considered by the fair-weather climbers because there are better climbs in different parts of the Canyon. Additionally, the uphill sides of these rocks are almost level. Also, the rocks are a fairly steep climb up the slope and there are better rock faces a short distance away that start practically on the trail up the Canyon. I have seen them used to establish a Tyrolean traverse between the two slabs."},

The locomotives were 132 feet long and weighed 1.2 million pounds. Because of their great length, the frames of the Big Boys were \"hinged,\" or articulated, to allow them to negotiate curves. They had a 4-8-8-4 wheel arrangement, which meant they had four wheels on the leading set of \"pilot\" wheels which guided the engine, eight drivers, another set of eight drivers, and four wheels following which supported the rear of the locomotive. The massive engines normally operated between Ogden, Utah, and Cheyenne, Wyo. There are seven Big Boys on public display in various cities around the country. They can be found in St. Louis, Missouri; Dallas, Texas; Omaha, Nebraska; Denver, Colorado; Scranton, Pennsylvania; Green Bay, Wisconsin; and Cheyenne, Wyoming. Big Boy No. 4014 was delivered to Union Pacific in December 1941. The locomotive was retired in December 1961, having traveled 1,031,205 miles in its 20 years in service.  Union Pacific reacquired No. 4014 from the RailGiants Museum in Pomona, California, in 2013, and relocated it back to Cheyenne to begin a multi-year restoration process.

A river is a river, always there, and yet the water flowing through it is never the same water and is never still. It’s always changing and is always on the move. And over time the river itself changes too. It widens and deepens as it rubs and scours, gnaws and kneads, eats and bores its way through the land. Even the greatest rivers- the Nile and the Ganges, the Yangtze and he Mississippi, the Amazon and the great grey-green greasy Limpopo all set about with fever trees-must have been no more than trickles and flickering streams before they grew into mighty rivers.The Strawberry River runs into the Duchesne River and then into the Green River which eventually joins the Colorado River and mostly dries up before it reaches the Gulf of California or the Sea of Cortez depending on which side of the border you happen to live on. It is interesting to think about the fact that the water in this placid stream will end up growing the vegetables from the California Imperial Valley by way of the All-American Canal."},

Kokanee have a dark blue back with silvery sides. As the spawning season approaches, kokanee turn from silver to orange to deep red and the male develops a characteristic hook-jaw common to the Pacific salmon. A deeply forked tail also distinguishes them from rainbow, cutthroat and brown trout. They are present in reservoirs such as Flaming Gorge, Porcupine and Strawberry reservoirs. Kokanee Salmon is simply the name for a Pacific Sockeye Salmon when it is landlocked.

Other windmills were and are being used to grind grain, pump water, and as an industrial power source. Here is a short quote about the uses of windmills from the dutchnews.nl article entitled \"It’s windmill weekend: 10 things you should know about Dutch windmills.\"The energy generated by wind and watermills was used to turn any raw material that needed pounding, mauling, shredding, hacking or mixing into a tradeable product. The Zaanstreek paper mills, for instance, were renowned throughout the world for their good quality paper. In fact, the American Declaration of Independence was printed on sheets produced there. There were mustard mills, hemp mills, grain mills, snuff mills, cocoa mills, oil mills, chalk mills, paint mills and saw mills. Because of their ability to turn trees into planks (for shipbuilding) much more quickly, the latter were instrumental in making the Netherlands a powerful and very rich sea-faring nation. In fact, some say the first industrial estate in the world was a complex of 23 saw mills on the Kostenverlorenkade in Amsterdam.

{"title": "Canal Bridge, Amsterdam, the Netherlands", "date": "Wednesday, September 18, 2019", "text": "Amsterdam is a city of canals. The history of the canals is fascinating. Here is a short introduction from Wikipedia: Canals of Amsterdam.Much of the Amsterdam canal system is the successful outcome of city planning. In the early part of the 17th century, with immigration rising, a comprehensive plan was put together, calling for four main, concentric half-circles of canals with their ends resting on the IJ Bay. Known as the \"grachtengordel\", three of the canals are mostly for residential development (Herengracht or ‘’Patricians' Canal’’; Keizersgracht or ‘’Emperor's Canal’’; and Prinsengracht or ‘’Prince's Canal’’), and a fourth, outer canal, the Singelgracht, for purposes of defense and water management. The plan also envisaged interconnecting canals along radii; a set of parallel canals in the Jordaan quarter (primarily for the transportation of goods, for example, beer); the conversion of an existing, inner perimeter canal (Singel) from a defensive purpose to residential and commercial development; and more than one hundred bridges. The defensive purpose of the Nassau/Stadhouderskade was served by moat and earthen dikes, with gates at transit points but otherwise no masonry superstructures. Construction proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian Geert Mak calls it – not from the center outwards as a popular myth has it. Construction of the north-western sector was started in 1613 and was finished around 1625. After 1664, building in the southern sector was started, although slowly because of an economic depression.[which?] The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the Amstel river and the IJ Bay, was not implemented for a long time. In the following centuries, the land went mostly for park, the Botanical garden, old age homes, theaters and other public facilities – and for waterways without much plan. Several parts of the city and of the urban area are polders, recognizable by their postfix -meer meaning 'lake', such as Aalsmeer, Bijlmermeer, Haarlemmermeer, and Watergraafsmeer. The canals in Amsterdam are now used for tourism, recreation, houseboats, and a relatively small amount of private transport compared to the main modes of walking, light rail, subway, and bicycle. Most of the canals are paralleled by automobile roads on both sides."},

This was one of the most significant mass balance losses within the past 2,000 years (Haeberli et al. 2007).Switzerland relies on hydroelectric power for 50% of its energy supply, and much of this is sourced from glacial meltwaters provided by the Swiss Alps (UNEP 2008).A rise in temperature of 2 degrees Celsius would decrease the snow reliability of high-altitude ski resorts by over 20%, with even more drastic results for low-altitude resorts. This would be potentially disastrous to Switzerland's tourism-dependent economy (Koenig et al. 1997).From our short visit to the high mountains in Switzerland, the degree of loss of ice cover was abundantly evident."},

He is buried in the church he designed earlier: the 'Zuiderkerk'. The building of the Westerkerk was finished and completed by his son Pieter de Keyser (1595-1676) and inaugurated on June 8, 1631. The church has a length of 58 meters and a width of 29 meters. The high nave is flanked by the two lower aisles.

Taking photos in the mountains is always a little frustrating. You can see these grand vistas spread out before you but when you take a photo the mountains shrink and the distances increase and the whole impression of the mountains seems to condense into a travel photo. We hiked about 5 miles along this ridgeline trail high up in the mountains. It seemed like we were much higher than we actually were because of the snow and glaciers on the higher mountains. We were only at about 6000 feet or so while hiking and that would put us only slightly higher than where we live in Provo, Utah. Obviously, we did not feel any effects of the altitude."},

The river begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the German Rhineland and the Netherlands and eventually empties into the North Sea.We spent some time at this lovely overlook above the river."},

The time it takes to get to the very top enhances the size. You also have to pay to get a ride to the top and stand in long lines. But it is iconic and the view from the top is spectacular. You might think it can be seen from all over Paris but it is really only viewable from certain angles because of the trees and other buildings.So far, our trip to Europe has left one overriding impression of a lot of people. The Palace of Versailles was no exception. The lines were impossibly long and the tour of the palace was basically wading through crowds of people. I have seen quite a few wonderful things in Europe and Versailles is certainly impressive in its own way, but I can certainly see why there was a French Revolution."},

It is actually located in Le Chesnay, outside of Paris. It is a relatively new temple and was dedicated in 2017. Unlike many of the temples, it is not prominently located on a hill or downtown area. It is very conservative looking from the street, but beautiful from the surrounding garden. Our visit was very short but it was wonderful to be near a temple even for that limited time.I am not much impressed by excess in any form. The palace, now a museum, at Versailles shows the lengths to which excess can be taken. The consequence of this show of wealth ultimately resulted in the French Revolution. Perhaps, here in the United States, we are going in the same direction with the majority of the wealth of our country concentrated in a very small percentage of the population. If there is any good lesson from Versailles, it is that excess in any form leads to unexpected consequences."},

The visit was wonderful, but the crowds were a little less than wonderful. Some places are so familiar from travel images that you are surprised when you actually visit them. The Abbaye du Mont Saint-Michel, France is one of those places. What they do not show you in the travel images is the huge mob of people visiting the Abby. We literally got stuck in a traffic jam of people for about twenty minutes or so and could not move more than a few feet. The narrow and steep streets were packed with people and the only way to stop or get out of the stream was to step into a store or shop. Otherwise, the whole visit was spectacular."},

It is definitely an advantage to have power tools and huge combines for the farms we have today, but if you are going to cut an acre or so of land, it is a lot quieter and just as efficient to use a scythe. The last time I was using one, I quickly realized that it would take me some time to get down the rhythm that would keep me moving through the weeds.

Accounts of log structures date back to antiquity. One early mention of log construction was from the Roman author Vitruvius who wrote a multi-volume work called De architectura. See Wikipedia: Vitruvius. Here is a short summary of the history from Wikipedia: Log cabin.Construction with logs was described by Roman architect Vitruvius Pollio in his architectural treatise De Architectura. He noted that in Pontus (modern-day northeastern Turkey), dwellings were constructed by laying logs horizontally overtop of each other and filling in the gaps with \"chips and mud\". Historically log cabin construction has its roots in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe. Although their origin is uncertain, the first log structures were probably being built in Northern Europe by the Bronze Age (about 3500 BC). The image above shows a detail of a log cabin built in Utah Valley, Utah in the late 1800s. You can see that the method of construction had changed little from ancient times. This particular cabin was made by simply piling the logs up since there are no notches in the logs to secure them together."},

I liked the texture and color of the wood.We took a short trail with flowers almost over our heads. The trail went on and on but we turned back because of the mosquitoes, flies, and other bugs.

It was originally constructed as a small fortress in AD 889 on the remains of Roman fortifications, and then largely ignored until its ruins were renovated and rebuilt in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid emir Mohammed ben Al-Ahmar of the Emirate of Granada, who built its current palace and walls. It was converted into a royal palace in 1333 by Yusuf I, Sultan of Granada.[1] After the conclusion of the Christian Reconquista in 1492, the site became the Royal Court of Ferdinand and Isabella (where Christopher Columbus received royal endorsement for his expedition), and the palaces were partially altered in the Renaissance style. In 1526 Charles I & V commissioned a new Renaissance palace better befitting the Holy Roman Emperor in the revolutionary Mannerist style influenced by humanist philosophy in direct juxtaposition with the Nasrid Andalusian architecture, but it was ultimately never completed due to Morisco rebellions in Granada. Alhambra's last flowering of Islamic palaces was built for the last Muslim emirs in Spain during the decline of the Nasrid dynasty, who were increasingly subject to the Christian Kings of Castile. After being allowed to fall into disrepair for centuries, the buildings occupied by squatters, Alhambra was rediscovered following the defeat of Napoleon, who had conducted retaliatory destruction of the site. The rediscoverers were first British intellectuals and then other north European Romantic travelers. It is now one of Spain's major tourist attractions, exhibiting the country's most significant and well-known Islamic architecture, together with 16th-century and later Christian building and garden interventions. The Alhambra is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the inspiration for many songs and stories.Once again, it is amazing."},

One theme of such a view in Spain is the common use of half-round tiles for roofs. Our home in Mesa, Arizona had just such a roof and the advantage was that absent a structural problem such as dry rot on a supporting beam, the roof was almost permanent. Americans have a tradition of wood or asphalt shingles both of which are flammable to some extent. Tile roofs are completely fireproof. Both shingles and tile are only as good as their underlayment, the real roof. From my experience, shingle roofs are common because they are relatively easy to install. Tile roofs take more time and skill but last indefinitely. I guess I would prefer tile roofs if I had a choice. Snow is also a factor. Tile is definitely warm climate."},

Here is a short explanation of the Garden from Wikipedia: Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso.Extending over 1,500 acres (6.1 km2), the gardens around the palace are one of the best examples of 18th-century European garden design in the Jardin à la française style in Spain. [7] The French designer from the official French royal offices of Robert de Cotte was René Carlier,[8] who used the natural slope of the site in the palace grounds design, for enhancing axial visual perspectives, and to provide sufficient head for water to shoot out/up from the twenty-six sculptural fountains in the formal gardens and landscape park. Sculptors arrived from Paris to execute designs on the site. They included: René Frémin (1672–1744, at La Granja until 1738), to whom the execution of many vases and sculptures was attributed in 18th-century inventories; Jean Thierry; and others who are little more than names in archival references.This is one of the largest such gardens I have ever seen.

{"title": "Coca Castle Moat", "date": "Thursday, July 4, 2019", "text": "From books and movies, I had a standard concept of a castle that includes a moat. Here is a short description of moats from Wikipedia: Moat.A moat is a deep, broad ditch, either dry or filled with water, that is dug and surrounds a castle, fortification, building or town, historically to provide it with a preliminary line of defence. In some places moats evolved into more extensive water defences, including natural or artificial lakes, dams and sluices. In older fortifications, such as hillforts, they are usually referred to simply as ditches, although the function is similar. In later periods, moats or water defences may be largely ornamental. They could also act as a sewer. I guess my idea of moats and castles changed dramatically the moment I realized I was looking at a real castle and a real moat. This is Coca Castle in Spain. The moat is about 60 to 70 feet deep and was probably filled with water at some time. I have revised almost all I have seen about castles from movies. What you might have seen is mostly fantasy."},

Interestingly, they won't let you take photos inside the palace but I do find a lot of interior photos online. I guess you have to apply to take photos and have an appointment or whatever. I did like the garden.The White Stork, Ciconia ciconia, is ubiquitous in Spain. You need to look for their nests on tall structures such as this old smoke stack and on church spires. They are very graceful flyers and because of their large size, they are very noticeable.

The Aqueduct really started high up in the mountains many miles from the city. The water channel is the square dark spot on the blocks at the end. The entire structure was engineered to the right slope to carry the water all the way through the city. We walked the entire length of this preserved part of the Aqueduct.It is common in many countries to advertise events by posting (gluing or taping) bill (signs or posters). This is true in Spain. However, here is a posted notice saying that it is prohibited to post notices or bills or posters. In addition, there is another item posted on top of the notice. This says two things: the notice is being disregarded and apparently there are some exceptions to the no posting rule. These postings are so common, they are likely ignored for the most part unless they have some political or commercial value.It is hard to imagine the artistic effort that went into the construction of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain. Here is a short summary of the work:The decoration consists for the upper part of the walls, as a rule, of Arabic inscriptions—mostly poems by Ibn Zamrak and others praising the palace—that are manipulated into geometrical patterns with vegetal background set onto an arabesque setting (\"Ataurique\"). Much of this ornament is carved stucco (plaster) rather than stone. Tile mosaics (\"alicatado\"), with complicated mathematical patterns (\"tracería\", most precisely \"lacería\"), are largely used as panelling for the lower part. Similar designs are displayed on wooden ceilings (Alfarje).[4] Muqarnas are the main elements for vaulting with stucco, and some of the most accomplished dome examples of this kind are in the Court of the Lions halls. The palace complex is designed in the Nasrid style, the last blooming of Islamic Art in the Iberian Peninsula, that had a great influence on the Maghreb to the present day, and on contemporary Mudejar Art, which is characteristic of western elements reinterpreted into Islamic forms and widely popular during the Reconquista in Spain.See Wikipedia: Alhambra."},

{"title": "Ávila, Spain: Churches and Walls", "date": "Thursday, June 27, 2019", "text": "It seems incongruous to drive on a freeway and then through a modern looking city to arrive at a huge wall and find an ancient city in the middle of the modern one. Ávila, Spain has an impressive wall and quite a few churches. It does seem to be missing a castle, but you never know, there might be one or two. You can walk around the inner city on the ancient wall or you can walk around the wall outside of the city.We have been climbing a lot of stairs and walking long distances lately to explore some of the castles and churches in Spain. Some of the castles have been largely deserted and remote, others have been in the middle of towns and full of hundreds of tourists. This is the Alcázar in Segovia and is definitely in the tourist category. Like most of the older buildings, this castle has been reconstructed and maintained. Here is a short explanation about the structure from Wikipedia: Alcázar of Segovia.The Alcázar of Segovia (literally, \"Segovia Fortress\") is a medieval alcázar located in the city of Segovia (Castile and León, Spain), a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Rising out on a rocky crag above the confluence of two rivers near the Guadarrama mountains, it is one of the most distinctive castle-palaces in Spain by virtue of its shape – like the bow of a ship. The Alcázar was originally built as a fortress but has served as a royal palace, a state prison, a Royal Artillery College and a military academy since then. It is currently used as a museum and a military archives building."},

{"title": "The Aqueduct of Segovia, Spain", "date": "Monday, June 24, 2019", "text": "This is the first and most imposing old structure that I have seen outside of North and South America. Here is a short explanation of the date and method of construction from Wikipedia: Aqueduct of Segovia.As the aqueduct lacks a legible inscription (one was apparently located in the structure's attic, or top portion), the date of construction cannot be definitively determined. The general date of the Aqueduct's construction was long a mystery, although it was thought to have been during the 1st century AD, during the reigns of the Emperors Domitian, Nerva, and Trajan. At the end of the 20th century, Géza Alföldy deciphered the text on the dedication plaque by studying the anchors that held the now missing bronze letters in place. He determined that Emperor Domitian (AD 81-96) ordered its construction and the year 98 A.D. was proposed as the most likely date of completion. However, in 2016 evidence was published which points out to a slightly later date, by 112 AD. The first section of the aqueduct contains 36 semi-circular arches, rebuilt in the 15th century to restore a portion destroyed by the Moors in 1072. The line of arches is organized in two levels, decorated simply, in which simple moulds hold the frame and provide support to the structure. On the upper level, the arches are 5.1 meters (16.1 ft) wide. Built in two levels, the top pillars are both shorter and narrower than those on the lower level. The top of the structure contains the channel through which water travels, through a U-shaped hollow measuring 0.55 tall by 0.46 meter diameter. The top of each pillar has a cross-section measuring 1.8 by 2.5 meters (5.9 by 8.2 feet), while the base cross-section measures 2.4 by 3 meters (7.9 by 9.8 feet). The aqueduct is built of unmortared, brick-like granite blocks. During the Roman era, each of the three tallest arches displayed a sign in bronze letters, indicating the name of its builder along with the date of construction. Today, two niches are still visible, one on each side of the aqueduct. One of them is known to have held the image of Hercules, who, according to legend, was founder of the city. The other niche now contains the images of the Virgen de la Fuencisla (the patroness of Segovia) and Saint Stephen.We visited the Aqueduct on the day of the Feast of St. John the Baptist, a national holiday."},

This Brandt Automatic Cashier. The idea is that you enter the amount of sale and it dispenses the change. Here is a short explanation of the machine from a blog post entitled, \"Antiques and appraisals: The Brandt Automatic Cashier.\"Brandt Manufacturing was founded by Edward J. Brandt of Watertown, Wisconsin. In the early 1920s he was employed at a small bank, and was in charge of making a lot of coin transactions as well as payroll disbursement for local companies. Because working with change was so time-consuming, he wanted to find an easier and error-free way to handle coins. After banking hours Brandt developed this automatic cashier to help. By the late 1950s he had expanded his business into Chicago (where he had built a large factory), Washington, DC, and Canada. At the 1964 World’s Fair, all coin receipts were handled using these machines. Brandt Manufacturing went through several changes and buyouts over the years. The Glory Group of Japan purchased the company in 2012.Most of the same machines I saw online dated from the 1920s.

{"title": "Mushrooms", "date": "Thursday, June 13, 2019", "text": "Have you ever wondered why they are called \"mushrooms?\" Apparently, the word originated from the Old French word meisseron. Here is a speculative etymology from Wikipedia: Mushroom.The terms \"mushroom\" and \"toadstool\" go back centuries and were never precisely defined, nor was there consensus on application. Between 1400 and 1600 AD, the terms mushrom, mushrum, muscheron, mousheroms, mussheron, or musserouns were used. The term \"mushroom\" and its variations may have been derived from the French word mousseron in reference to moss (mousse). Delineation between edible and poisonous fungi is not clear-cut, so a \"mushroom\" may be edible, poisonous, or unpalatable. Cultural or social phobias of mushrooms and fungi may be related. The term \"fungophobia\" was coined by William Delisle Hay of England, who noted a national superstition or fear of \"toadstools\". The word \"toadstool\" has apparent analogies in Dutch padde(n)stoel (toad-stool/chair, mushroom) and German Krötenschwamm (toad-fungus, alt. word for panther cap). In German folklore and old fairy tales, toads are often depicted sitting on toadstool mushrooms and catching, with their tongues, the flies that are said to be drawn to the Fliegenpilz, a German name for the toadstool, meaning \"flies' mushroom\". This is how the mushroom got another of its names, Krötenstuhl (a less-used German name for the mushroom), literally translating to \"toad-stool\"."},

When they go on sale, we may have them every day until the price goes up and our consumption goes down.

{"title": "Spring Runoff in Rock Canyon, Wasatch Front, Provo, Utah", "date": "Saturday, June 8, 2019", "text": "There are 25 photos in this post. The mountains of Northern Utah have received double the amount of snow and rainfall during the early part of 2019. The normally dry lower part of Rock Canyon, near Provo, Utah, is flooding the normally dry roadways and creating spectacular rapids and small waterfalls.This photo is near the mouth of the Canyon.The trail up the Canyon is usually quite busy. You can easily see why it is called Rock Canyon.This is a device to measure the water flow. Usually, at this point, if there is any water, it is just a trickle.While you are walking up the trail, you can hear the rocks in the creek rolling and crashing. It sounds like distant thunder.People hiking up the Canyon have certain distance markers. This is known as the big rock.We have lived in Provo for five years (with one year spent in Annapolis, Maryland) and this is only the second time we have seen the Creek running and never this high.The sides of the canyon are very steep and there are many places that are frequented by rock climbers. This is a talus slope. It makes for very difficult climbing.Where the streambed is narrow, there is an almost constant low rumble from the rocks being moved down the Creek.The Creek is narrow in places, but quite deep and the sound of the water is a low roar.As you walk up the Canyon, the vegetation changes from scrub oak to aspens and pines.This is the first bridge.The water here is normally clear, but the runoff is so large that it is eroding the banks of the usually small stream at this point.This is the second bridge.Compared with the flow of rivers across the United States, this is not too impressive. But when you are used to a trickle of water, it sounds and looks impressive.This is an old cement covered water ditch that used to carry water for homes and irrigation down the Canyon. The Canyon supplies about 15% of the water used by Provo but almost all of it is piped from springs up near the head of the Canyon.The rock formations are impressive.It is hard to imagine the forces in the earth could bend rocks like you can see in the above image.I took this photo from the third bridge but didn't get a photo of the bridge.Here is the fourth bridge. Time to turn around and go back down the Canyon.View from the fourth bridge.A welcome drinking fountain on the way up or down. Vandals had broken the fountain earlier in the year but the Provo Department of Water Resources fixed it in time for summer.Parts of the trail used to be paved and at the bottom of the Canyon, some of the trails are still paved. The trail is clean and there are some picnic and restroom facilities at the trailhead. Part of the Canyon is under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service and part is owned by the Provo City. The Rock Canyon Preservation Alliance has a Conservation Easement on some of the land at the mouth of the Canyon. Although Provo City claims the entire Canyon, it is jointly claimed by the National Forest Service. The lower part of the Canyon is heavily used by hikers, mountain bikers, rock climbers and picnicers.Because of the Canyon's proximity to Provo City and the usually dry vegetation, open fires are prohibited. One challenge of the Canyon is the number of dogs. During this walk up the Canyon, I counted 17 dogs and 7 of them were not on leashes.This is the first gate area next to a small parking area. The current parking is inadequate and spills over into the adjoining neighborhoods. We live approximately 300 yards from the mouth of the Canyon.One fairly common sight in university science buildings is a Foucault Pendulum. Here is a short explanation of what this is and does.The Foucault pendulum (English: /fuːˈkoʊ/ foo-KOH; French pronunciation: ​[fuˈko]) or Foucault's pendulum is a simple device named after French physicist Léon Foucault and conceived as an experiment to demonstrate the Earth's rotation. The pendulum was introduced in 1851 and was the first experiment to give simple, direct evidence of the earth's rotation. Today, Foucault pendulums are popular displays in science museums and universities.At either the North Pole or South Pole, the plane of oscillation of a pendulum remains fixed relative to the distant masses of the universe while Earth rotates underneath it, taking one sidereal day to complete a rotation. So, relative to Earth, the plane of oscillation of a pendulum at the North Pole – viewed from above – undergoes a full clockwise rotation during one day; a pendulum at the South Pole rotates counterclockwise. When a Foucault pendulum is suspended at the equator, the plane of oscillation remains fixed relative to Earth. At other latitudes, the plane of oscillation precesses relative to Earth, but more slowly than at the pole.See Wikipedia: Foucault pendulum. You can see the white pieces that are knocked over as the earth turns."},

Unlike the early pioneer origins of BYU, UVU was first established in 1941 as Central Utah Vocational School (CUVS) with the primary function of providing war production training and became a permanent state institution in 1947. As the school grew in size,  a campus was constructed in Provo, Utah on University Avenue. In 1963, the name of the school was changed to Utah Trade Technical Institute (Trade Tech). This is the name I first remember hearing. In 1987, as the school continued to develop, the name was changed again to Utah Technical College at Provo. Quoting from the History of UVU:The institution was approved in 1966 to grant Associate of Applied Science degrees, in 1967 to offer general education courses, in 1971 to grant Associate of Science degrees (discontinued in 1974 and reinstated in 1981), and in 1987 to grant Associate of Arts degrees. With its expanded degree offerings, the institution’s name changed again to Utah Valley Community College in 1987. In 1993, the institution’s name changed to Utah Valley State College and the mission was expanded to include the offering of bachelor’s degrees. On July 1, 2008, the institution underwent another mission and name change to Utah Valley University and began offering master degree programs.Utah Valley University has now become the largest university or college in the state of Utah.  In fact, the number of college students in Utah is almost as large as the population of Salt Lake City, the state's largest city.

The Overland Station was built in 1863 at the present marked site, which was a more defensible location. Stone outlines of the 1863 station are still visible.There are remnants of a round fortification built just behind the station which served as a lookout and place of refuge.

{"title": "A Profusion of Spines", "date": "Wednesday, March 20, 2019", "text": "Spines on a cactus are functional. Of course, they have the function of protection but the protection extends to shading the main part of the plant from the sun. Most cactus, but not all, live in arid climates. The ability to store water and maintain life in drought conditions is a major part of their survival. But some cactus have carried their production of spines to an extreme. Here is a comment on the function of spines for both protection and shade from James D. Mauseth, Section of Integrative Biology, The University of Texas, Austin.Many cacti are protected from full sunlight by a dense covering of spines. Rather surprisingly, perhaps as many as half of all cactus species are adapted to dark rainforests (Epiphyllum, Rhipsalis) or semi-shady shrublands/grasslands (Echinopsis, Mammillaria, Notocactus) or cool, wet, cloudy highlands (Austrocylindropuntia, Oroya, Soehrensia) (Habitats are described in Cactus Odyssey). Such plants would be killed quickly by exposure to full sunlight in Phoenix, Arizona. Species in such cool or semi-shady habitats often have either just a few spines or only very short ones. However, cacti from intensely sunny, hot deserts often must have a complete covering of spines. In many cases, the spines are so strong and painful that they obviously offer both protection and shade, but in many species the spines are so soft that a hungry, thirsty animal would chew through them with no trouble. The benefit of such spines definitely appears to be blocking sunlight and thus preventing the plant from over heating, the chlorophyll from being bleached and the plant's DNA from being damaged. For example, in Mammillaria plumosa, spine epidermis cells project outward as long trichomes, giving the spine a feathery  appearance. In other species, the spines are flat, thin and papery, being too flexible to deter animals, but broad enough to shade the plant (as well as to camouflage the cacti among the grasses with which it grows)."},

Several varieties are recognized by the Japanese. Koi varieties are distinguished by coloration, patterning, and scalation. Some of the major colors are white, black, red, orange, yellow, blue, and cream. The most popular category of koi is the Gosanke, which is made up of the Kohaku, Taisho Sanshoku, and Showa Sanshoku varieties.I have very little experience with fish or fishing but I do know that carp are only edible when they come from a pond, lake, stream, or river that is not polluted. When I was young, I heard about how to cook a carp. You cook it on a board until the meat is tender and well cooked and then you eat the board."},

{"title": "The Creeping Devil Cactus", "date": "Wednesday, February 20, 2019", "text": "As the Creeping Devil cactus or Stenocereus eruca grows it actually creeps across the desert. The stems of the cactus grow along the ground and then take root into sandy soil. If the cactus gets too long, the end or tail dies off and the cactus literally moves across the desert floor. Here is an explanation of the cactus from Wikipedia: Stenocereus eruca.Stenocereus eruca, commonly known as creeping devil, is a member of the family Cactaceae. It is one of the most distinctive cacti, a member of the relatively small genus Stenocereus. It is endemic to the central Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, and is found only on sandy soils, where it forms massive colonies. As with all cacti, creeping devil is succulent, and is reported to contain mescaline and sterols. Growth patterns can be widely scattered as individual stems; in favorable localities they can form impenetrable patches of branching stems measuring several metres across. The creeping devil is columnar, with a very spiny stem which is creamy green in color, averaging 5 cm in diameter and 1.5–2 m long, with only the terminal end raised from the ground. A height of 20–30 cm is normal since this cactus is recumbent (it grows in a horizontal manner). The large, nocturnal flowers are white, pink, or yellow; usually 10–14 cm long with a spiny ovary, and flowering sparingly in response to rain. The spiny fruit is 3–4 cm long with black seeds. Creeping devil lies on the ground and grows at one end while the other end slowly dies, with a succession of new roots developing on the underside of the stem. The growth rate is adapted to the moderate, moist marine environment of the Baja peninsula, and can achieve in excess of 60 cm per year, but when transplanted to a hot, arid environment the cacti can grow as little as 60 cm per decade. Over the course of many years, the entire cactus will slowly travel, with stems branching and taking root toward the growing tips, while older stem portions die and disintegrate. This traveling chain of growth gives rise to the name eruca, which means \"caterpillar\" as well as the common name creeping devil.This is one of my favorite cactus plants and I always like to say hello to them when I visit the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona."},

They range over most of the United States, even in very cold locations and on the Eastern Seaboard. Some of the plants have large edible fruit. However, the plants and fruit are very difficult to deal with because of the tine spines known as glochids. Here is an explanation from Wikipedia: Glochid.Glochids or glochidia (singular \"glochidium\") are hair-like spines or short prickles, generally barbed, found on the areoles of cacti in the sub-family Opuntioideae. Cactus glochids easily detach from the plant and lodge in the skin, causing irritation upon contact. The tufts of glochids in the areoles nearly cover the stem surfaces of some cactus species, each tuft containing hundreds of glochids; this may be in addition to, or instead of, the larger, more conspicuous cactus spines, which do not readily detach and are not generally barbed.If you have ever had contact with glochids, you will remember the experience. We have found one way to remove them is with athletic tape. The tape sticks to the spines and pulls them out but it is not a pleasant experience."},

Here are some interesting facts about these valuable plants:One study found 175,000 bromeliads per hectare (2.5 acres) in one forest; that many bromeliads can sequester 50,000 liters (more than 13,000 gallons) of water. A wide variety of organisms takes advantage of the pools of water trapped by bromeliads. A study of 209 plants from the Ecuadorian lowlands identified 11,219 animals, representing more than 300 distinct species, many of which are found only on bromeliads. Examples include some species of ostracods, small salamanders about 2.5 cm (1 in) in length, and tree frogs. Jamaican bromeliads are home to Metopaulias depressus, a reddish-brown crab 2 cm (0.8 in) across, which has evolved social behavior to protect its young from predation by Diceratobasis macrogaster, a species of damselfly whose larvae live in bromeliads.

It may be hard to imagine this dry looking canyon filled with brown rushing water many feet deep, but some of these canyons have a huge drainage area and even a small or moderate storm can fill them with water rather suddenly. The storm could be many miles away and the water can travel great distances before filling up the slot.

The current shut-down of the United States government is a good example. Because of the shut-down, theoretically, I could drive down this road and then drive off of the road with impunity because there would be no Federal agents to enforce the provision requesting that I stay on the road. But how stupid is that? I don't have to drive hundreds of miles into the desert to find a place to ruin the environment by driving off-road. I can do that quite comfortably closer to home. But should I do something just because there is no one around to prevent me from doing it? Unfortunately, from reading the news it would seem that this is what many people believe is how our country operates: if you can't get caught, you can do anything you want. What happened to decency and moral responsibility? Do we all want to live in a dump? Perhaps we need to realize that we create our own environment and begin by cleaning our own houses and treating \"public\" property with that same level of care and consideration.By the way, you might have to click on this image and enlarge it to read the sign which says \"Please stay on the road.\""},

Born into a family of artists, Calder's work first gained attention in Paris in the 1930s and was soon championed by the Museum of Modern Art in New York, resulting in a retrospective exhibition in 1943. Major retrospectives were also held at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1964) and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (1974). Calder's work is in many permanent collections, most notably in the Whitney Museum of American Art, but also the Guggenheim Museum; the Museum of Modern Art; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; and the Centre Georges Pompidou. He produced many large public works, including .125 (at JFK Airport, 1957), Pittsburgh (Carnegie International prize winner 1958, Pittsburgh International Airport) Spirale (UNESCO in Paris, 1958), Flamingo and Universe (both in Chicago, 1974), and Mountains and Clouds (Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C., 1976). Although primarily known for his sculpture, Calder also created paintings and prints, miniatures (such as his famous Cirque Calder), children's book illustrations, theater set design, jewelry design, tapestries and rugs, and political posters. Calder was honored by the US Postal Service with a set of five 32-cent stamps in 1998, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, posthumously in 1977, after refusing to receive it from Gerald Ford one year earlier in protest of the Vietnam War.I had a year of art history while at the University of Utah and this introduction to the world of art has helped me appreciate my visits to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere."},

This image is a piñon pinecone with the pine nuts or piñons ripe and ready to eat. I used to eat these more when I was a lot younger. They are sort-of pricey to buy outside of the areas where they are harvested.Here is a short explanation about these mid-sized trees from Wikipedia:The pinyon or piñon pine group grows in the southwestern United States, especially in New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. The trees yield edible nuts, which are a staple of the Native Americans, and still widely eaten as a snack and as an ingredient in New Mexican cuisine. The name comes from the Spanish pino piñonero, a name used for both the American varieties and the stone pine common in Spain, which also produces edible pine nuts typical of Mediterranean cuisine. Harvesting techniques of the prehistoric Indians are still being used to today to collect the pinyon seeds for personal use or for commercialization. The pinyon nut or seed is high in fats and calories. Pinyon wood, especially when burned, has a distinctive fragrance, making it a common wood to burn in chimineas. The pinyon pine trees are also known to influence the soil in which they grow by increasing concentrations of both macronutrients and micronutrients.If you have spent any time at all on the Colorado Plateau, you will have seen forests of these trees. There are eight different species of the true piñon or Pinus:Pinus cembroides – Mexican pinyonPinus orizabensis – Orizaba pinyonPinus johannis – Johann's pinyon (includes P. discolor – border pinyon)Pinus culminicola – Potosi pinyonPinus remota – Texas pinyon or papershell pinyonPinus edulis – two-needle piñon or Colorado pinyonPinus monophylla – single-leaf pinyonPinus quadrifolia – Parry pinyon (includes P. juarezensis).These additional Mexican species are also related and mostly called pinyons:Pinus rzedowskii – Rzedowski's pinePinus pinceana – weeping pinyonPinus maximartinezii – big-cone pinyonPinus nelsonii – Nelson's pinyonThe three bristlecone pine species of the high mountains of the southwestern United States, and the lacebark pines of Asia are closely related to the pinyon pines."},

The medal is normally awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress. Because the medal is presented \"in the name of Congress\", it is often referred to informally as the \"Congressional Medal of Honor\". However, the official name of the current award is \"Medal of Honor.\" Within United States Code the medal is referred to as the \"Medal of Honor\", and less frequently as \"Congressional Medal of Honor\". U.S. awards, including the Medal of Honor, do not have post-nominal titles, and while there is no official abbreviation, the most common abbreviations are \"MOH\" and \"MH\". There are three versions of the medal, one for the Army, one for the Navy, and one for the Air Force. Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version. The Medal of Honor was introduced for the Navy in 1861, soon followed by an Army version in 1862.

The left hand and right foot barely protrude, while the bent left leg and knee jut into the air. The 17-foot (5.2 m) high right arm and hand reach farther out of the ground. The bearded face, with the mouth in mid-scream, struggles to emerge from the earth. The Awakening was created by J. Seward Johnson, Jr. in 1980 as part of Washington, DC's 11th annual Sculpture Conference, and the sculpture was originally installed at Hains Point in East Potomac Park, Washington, D.C.. Hains Point was designated by Congress as the site for a National Peace Garden in 1987. Although no work had started on the National Peace Garden for many years, the decision still prompted the eventual sale of the sculpture by its owner, The Sculpture Foundation. Milton Peterson purchased the sculpture for $750,000 in 2007 for installation at his new National Harbor development in Maryland. Crews removed The Awakening from Hains Point in February 2008 for its move to National Harbor. At the National Harbor development, the sculpture was installed on a specially built beach along the Potomac River. We were surprised to find out that National Harbor was a real estate development with stores and resort hotels.

{"title": "Gasoline Automobile Patent Model", "date": "Sunday, October 7, 2018", "text": "This is the Selden Automobile Patent Model from 1879 from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Here is the explanation of this unusual patent. This explanation shows the damage that a patent that is too broad can cause.George Selden's dubious claim that he invented the automobile cast a shadow on the early auto manufacturing industry. His claim rested on a patent application for a \"road-engine\" that he had filed in 1879. A lawyer schooled in science, Selden was intrigued by the challenge of devising an engine light enough to propel a road vehicle. He designed a small, improved version of George Brayton's compression engine of 1872 and filed a patent application for \"a liquid-hydrocarbon engine of the compression type\" combined with broadly defined chassis components. Selden deliberately delayed issuance of the patent until 1895, when automobiles were attracting more attention. Soon a patent-pooling association of auto manufacturing companies demanded and received royalties from other manufacturers for the right to produce Selden's \"invention.\" Henry Ford, then just entering the automobile industry, became locked in a highly-publicized legal battle with the Selden interests when his application for a license was turned down in 1903. Ford blasted monopolistic control and exploitation by the \"automobile trust\" and forever fixed his image as an independent businessman fighting a corporate Goliath for the good of all. Ford's victory in court raised his standing in the automotive industry and made him one of the best known businessmen in America. In 1911 the Selden patent was limited to vehicles with Brayton-type engines as modified by Selden, and his influence quickly faded."},

Artificial hearts are typically used to bridge the time to heart transplantation, or to permanently replace the heart in case heart transplantation is impossible. Although other similar inventions preceded it from the late 1940s, the first artificial heart to be successfully implanted in a human was the Jarvik-7 in 1982, designed by a team including Willem Johan Kolff and Robert Jarvik. An artificial heart is distinct from a ventricular assist device (VAD) designed to support a failing heart.

The basic system could be expanded with up to 48 KB of RAM (in 16 KB increments), and up to four floppy disk drives and/or hard disk drives. Tandy/Radio Shack provided full-service support including upgrade, repair, and training services in their thousands of stores worldwide. By 1979, the TRS-80 had the largest selection of software in the microcomputer market.

{"title": "Patent Models: Pin Making Machine", "date": "Monday, October 1, 2018", "text": "A pin making machine from 1841 built by John I. Howe. Here is part of the explanation of this particular patent model from the Smithsonian American History Museum.This model was filed with the application to the U.S. Patent Office for Patent Number 2,013 issued to John Ireland Howe on March 24, 1841. Howe’s invention was a design for an automated common pin making machine. The goal of the design was to improve upon his earlier patented pin making machine which had not found commercial success. His design was mechanically very complex; the patent document comprised 20 pages of detailed text and five of diagrams. Howe had been a physician working in the New York Alms House where he had observed the inmates making pins by hand. He began to experiment with machinery for automating the process and sought the help of Robert Hoe, a printing press builder, to provide mechanical expertise. His design was for a machine that would take a roll of wire, cut the wire for each pin to proper length, sharpen and polish the pointed end of the pin, and finally form the other end into a metal head. The machine consisted of a series of individual chucks (devices much like on lathes) mounted radially on a vertical shaft that rotated inside a horizontal circular frame. Around the circumference of the frame were mounted various tools that shaped the pins. As the vertical shaft rotated, it brought the chucks into alignment with the tools. One type of tool was the point forming file, or mill. The chuck, which was rotating along the axis of the pin, would make the pin tip contact the file thus grinding it into shape. The file was also rotating as well as moving forward, backwards, and side-to-side in a complex manner so as to produce a point which was round, smooth, free from angles, and slightly convex in shape. Howe made provisions for multiple such tools to progressively shape the point. The other major tool was the head forming mechanism. A carrier removed the pin from its chuck and inserted its blunt end into a set of gripping jaws that held it into a set of dies. The dies formed a thickened section of metal at the end of the pin. A second carrier extracted the pin and inserted the thickened section into a second set of dies which then flattened and formed the final pin head. The machines made from the patent design enabled the Howe Manufacturing Company become one of the largest pin manufacturers in the United States. The patent model is constructed primary of metal and is about one foot square and one foot tall. It represents the essential elements of the design such as the rotating set of chucks mounted on the vertical shaft, the sharpening mills, and the head making mechanisms. It shows how the rotating table brings the pins to the point sharpening mills. While it is uncertain that the model would be capable of actual pin production, it appears that turning the attached hand crank would cause the machine to go through the motions of actual pin production."},

Interest grew quickly after it was featured on the cover of the January 1975 issue (published in late November 1974) of Popular Electronics, and was sold by mail order through advertisements there, in Radio-Electronics, and in other hobbyist magazines. The designers hoped to sell a few hundred build-it-yourself kits to hobbyists, and were surprised when they sold thousands in the first month. The Altair also appealed to individuals and businesses that just wanted a computer and purchased the assembled version. The Altair is widely recognized as the spark that ignited the microcomputer revolution as the first commercially successful personal computer. The computer bus designed for the Altair was to become a de facto standard in the form of the S-100 bus, and the first programming language for the machine was Microsoft's founding product, Altair BASIC."},

{"title": "Antique Washington Mantel Clock ", "date": "Saturday, September 1, 2018", "text": "This Washington Mantel Clock was manufactured in France. Here is some commentary about these clocks from the Classical American Homes Preservation Trust.No less inventive or diverse, the twenty-one mantel clocks at Classical American Homes range in date from 1800 to 1840 and in terms of their design and subject matter can be divided into four broad thematic categories: ancient Greek mythology, classical architecture, scenes from everyday life in the early nineteenth century, and allegories in which the sculptural figures on the clocks are emblematic of certain abstract concepts, such as the fleeting nature of beauty and youth, patriotism, and glory. The two Washington clocks at Classical American Homes (figures 1 and 2) fall squarely within this final category.These Washington clocks belong to a larger group of approximately two dozen closely related examples, two-thirds of which measure approximately 19-1/2 inches tall and the remainder reduced in height by about 4 inches to make them more affordable. Products of a sophisticated clock-making industry in Paris that required the talents of sculptors, founders, clockmakers and the tradesmen/designers who organized their manufacture and sale, these foreign-made clocks are nonetheless iconic and among the most prized possessions of American museums and collectors. Examples of the more desirable taller clocks like the two at Classical American Homes can be found in the permanent collections of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Winterthur Museum, The White House, and the Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the Department of State. Despite their rarity and value, Dick Jenrette has managed to acquire not only these two ormolu Washington clocks but a third as well, which he purchased for the Americana collection at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. We call that going for the gold. We saw this example at the Hammond-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland. This clock is about ten inches high."},

The common spelling of these artifacts is Inca Quipu. Here is one explanation of the spelling change from Wikipedia.Quipu is the Spanish spelling and the most common spelling in English. Khipu (pronounced [ˈkʰipu], plural: khipukuna) is the word for \"knot\" in Cusco Quechua. In most Quechua varieties, the term is kipu.The use of the letter \"k\" is a phonetic convention. The Quechua have no uniformly accepted method of transcription. There are a number of English/Quechua Quechua/English dictionaries online and from what I could see, most of them use a standard Spanish transcription method. Here is a link to the Quechua alphabet. There is actually a Highest Academy of the Quechua Language or Academia Mayor de la Lengua Quechua (AMLQ), Quechua: Qheswa simi hamut'ana kuraq suntur. It is a private institution in Cusco, founded in 1990, concerned with the \"purity\" of Quechua.The Khipu or Quipu is described in a Wikipedia article entitled, \"Quipu.\" Here is a short description from the article.A quipu usually consisted of colored, spun, and plied or waxed thread or strings made from cotton or camelid fiber. The Inca people used them for collecting data and keeping records, monitoring tax obligations, properly collecting census records, calendrical information, and for military organization. The cords stored numeric and other values encoded as knots, often in a base ten positional system. A quipu could have only a few or up to 2,000 cords. The configuration of the quipus has been \"compared to string mops.\" Archaeological evidence has also shown the use of finely carved wood as a supplemental, and perhaps more sturdy, base to which the color-coded cords would be attached. A relatively small number have survived.This photo was taken in the National Museum of the American Indian."},
{"title": "Mayan Calendar", "date": "Saturday, August 18, 2018", "text": "When I was attending the University of Utah and majoring in Spanish, I got into a discussion with one of the Spanish professors who categorically maintained that the Pre-Columbian Indigenous population of the Americas never developed a system of writing. To this day, most of the historical and anthropological accounts of the ancient civilizations in North, Central, and South America refuse to acknowledge the existence of written documents. I had been reading the old account of the \"Spanish Conquest\" in the original documents and knew that the Catholic Priests had systematically burned all of the books they found as \"heresy.\" Although this is well known, there are still statements that no writing existed in the Americas. Here is a quote from one Wikipedia article espousing the \"accepted\" position of most American anthropologists and historians in the United States.The Popol Vuh is a creation narrative written by the K'iche' people before the Spanish conquest of Guatemala, originally preserved through oral tradition until approximately 1550 when it was written down. See Wikipedia: Popol Vuh.Here is another article, Wikipedia: Maya codices, that presents an entirely different picture of the early writings.There were many books in existence at the time of the Spanish conquest of Yucatán in the 16th century; most were destroyed by the Catholic priests. Many in Yucatán were ordered destroyed by Bishop Diego de Landa in July 1562. In his conviction of the superiority and absolute truth of Christianity, De Landa wrote: We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.Here is another account from the Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas:Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas lamented that when found, such books were destroyed: \"These books were seen by our clergy, and even I saw part of those that were burned by the monks, apparently because they thought [they] might harm the Indians in matters concerning religion, since at that time they were at the beginning of their conversion.\" The last codices destroyed were those of Nojpetén, Guatemala in 1697, the last city conquered in the Americas. With their destruction, access to the history of the Maya and opportunity for insight into some key areas of Maya life was greatly diminished.My major for graduate work was in Linguistics, at that time part of the Anthropology Department. My views and the views of the professors at that time differed considerably and I made the fortuitous decision not to pursue a career as a linguist. It is only recently when doing some reading about the current status of linguistics, that I realized how fortunate that decision was.The Library of Congress is not at all like you might expect it to be. Of course, it is the largest library in the world, but it is also a huge building with lots of hallways and side rooms with locked doors. It is very accessible, but also somewhat mysterious.

They are Venus Fly Traps or Dionaea muscipula from exotic locations in North and South Carolina. I am continually surprised at the collections of items in Washington, D.C. from the ridiculous to the sublime. But what is more interesting is the fact that in all the huge museums and collections, how little is dedicated to anything on the west side of the Allegany Mountains. Here is an explanation of Venus Fly Traps from Wikipedia:The Venus flytrap (also referred to as Venus's flytrap or Venus' flytrap), Dionaea muscipula, is a carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States in North Carolina and South Carolina. It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if another contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. Triggers may occur if one-tenth of the insect is within contact. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption."},

One of these places is the Bartholdi Park, the location of this large Bartholdi Fountain. Here is an explanation of the fountain from the United States Botanic Garden website.Frederic Auguste Bartholdi (1834-1904) is best known for creating the Statue of Liberty. Bartholdi created this cast-iron \"Fountain of Light and Water\" for the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. The fountain, cast in Paris by A. Durenne, weighs 30,440 pounds, stands 30 feet high, and has caryatid figures 11 feet in height. Bartholdi saw its combination of iron, gas light and water as symbolically appropriate for a modern city. The fountain was purchased by the U.S. Congress for $6,000 at the suggestion of Frederick Law Olmsted, the famous landscape architect who designed the Capitol Grounds. It was moved to Washington, D.C., in 1877 and placed at the base of Capitol Hill on what used to be Botanic Garden grounds. The gas lamps, lighted by battery in 1881, made the fountain a popular attraction at night. The lights surrounding the basin were added in 1886, and the round glass globes replaced the original gas fixtures when the fountain was completely electrified in 1915. During the relocation of the Botanic Garden in 1927, the fountain was dismantled and erected in its present location in 1932. Over the years, the fountain was regularly repaired and maintained. From 2008 to 2011, it was taken off site for a full restoration and updated with energy-efficient systems and water treatment technology. This work ensures that Bartholdi Fountain will continue to provide enjoyment for many years to come."},

The nominate subspecies in its breeding plumage has a white head with a yellowish wash on the crown. The nape and neck are dark maroon–brown. The upper sides of the neck have white lines along the base of the gular pouch, and the lower fore neck has a pale yellowish patch.

I have been taking photos of old farm equipment for years and this example is from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Here is a rather long explanation of this tractor from a Wikipedia article entitled, \"Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company.\"Based in Waterloo, Iowa, the company was created by John Froelich and a group of Iowa businessmen in 1893, and was originally named the Waterloo Gasoline Traction Engine Company. In 1892, Froelich had invented the first practical gasoline-powered tractor, and the new company was given the opportunity to manufacture and sell the tractor Froelich designed. Unfortunately, the tractor was not successful commercially, and of the four tractors built by the company only two were purchased, and these were later returned to the company by unsatisfied customers. In 1895, the company was sold to John W. Miller and renamed the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company. Miller decided to stop producing tractors and instead focus on building plain gasoline engines. Following several years of research and development, the company once again began to manufacture tractors in 1911, but none would sell well until 1913, when twenty “Waterloo Boy” tractors were produced. In 1914 the company introduced the Model R Waterloo Boy. This tractor proved immensely popular, and over eight thousand were sold before the line was discontinued in 1923. The company also had great success with the Model N, which was introduced in late 1916. Despite the company's name, both the Model R and Model N burned kerosene for fuel. By this time, several other companies had begun to build and sell tractors, but the Waterloo Boy was easily one of the most popular. In 1918, Deere & Company, a farm equipment company based in Moline, Illinois purchased the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company for $2,100,000. Deere & Company had been anxious to enter the growing tractor market, but its own initial designs had proved unsuccessful. Executives at Deere & Company decided to purchase the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Co. because field tests indicated that the Waterloo Boy tractor had the best performance. After the sale was completed, the company became known as the John Deere Tractor Company, but tractors produced by the company continued to be sold under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced.Maybe I should have been in the tractor business instead of computers?Color and texture make up an interesting design pattern.

The outside world was unaware of the development of color variations in Japanese koi until 1914, when the Niigata koi were exhibited at an annual exposition in Tokyo. From that time, interest in koi spread throughout Japan. From this original handful of koi, all other Nishikigoi varieties were bred, with the exception of the Ogon variety (single-colored, metallic koi) which was developed relatively recently. The hobby of keeping koi eventually spread worldwide. Koi are now sold in many pet aquarium shops, with higher-quality fish available from specialist dealers. The collection of koi throughout the years has become quite the social hobby for many who have ponds. It is also common for hobbyists who are passionate about their koi to join a club specifically for their koi and ponds.

The swamp is part of the flood zone of the Anacostia River or estuary. The water rises and falls with the tides. The area is administered by the National Park Service and is called the Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens. It is really a formerly private water garden. Here is a very short history from the website.Remnants of this original wetland edge two sides of the ponds near the boardwalk. The value of local wetlands was lost to the English, accustomed to English bogs. They cleared the high land of protective forests to build farms in the1600s. Later, the Industrial Revolution increased deforestation for fuel, fences, and homes. Unprotected by forest, soil washed into the Anacostia River and deep channels that once harbored sturgeon, filled with silt. Coming here in the 1800s,Walter Shaw found the wetlands were a good place to build his water garden. By building the paths that separate ponds from the tidal marsh, Shaw built a garden that would provide beauty and profit. His daughter, Helen, would become an ambassador for water gardening and the Shaw Gardens. It was Helen who would successfully lobby Congress to save the gardens from dredge operations in the Anacostia River, and accidentally save a section of the original marsh. It would be many decades before we rediscovered the social value of wetlands. Today the historic ponds and the natural wetland areas that support them are managed by the National Park Service, in a balance that demonstrates sustainable management known to those first residents. Explore, see what stories the land can tell and, perhaps, see value in the park that is unique to you."},

It is interesting that some of those photos have tens of thousands of views and saves. But the photos I particularly like are seldom popular. When I took this photo, I was surrounded by hundreds of photographers taking photos of the lotus flowers. I am assuming many of those will end up online. This virtual flood of images makes each of the images have less impact than they would in a studio or viewed in a museum. But I do not take photos with the expectation that they will become popular, I take them for my own desire to express what I think and feel about the world around us."},
{"title": "Water Lily with leaves ", "date": "Saturday, July 7, 2018", "text": "These beautiful flowers are water lilies or Nymphaeaceae. Here is a general description of the family.Nymphaeaceae /ˌnɪmfiːˈeɪsiː/ is a family of flowering plants, commonly called water lilies. They live as rhizomatous aquatic herbs in temperate and tropical climates around the world. The family contains five genera with about 70 known species. Water lilies are rooted in soil in bodies of water, with leaves and flowers floating on or emergent from the surface. The leaves are round, with a radial notch in Nymphaea and Nuphar, but fully circular in Victoria and Euryale.This is a lotus flower or Nelumbo nucifera. Lotus plants have beautiful flowers and are even more amazing as plants. Here is a short description from Wikipedia: Nelumbo nucifera.Nelumbo nucifera, also known as Indian lotus, sacred lotus, bean of India, Egyptian bean or simply lotus, is one of two extant species of aquatic plant in the family Nelumbonaceae. The Linnaean binomial Nelumbo nucifera is the currently recognized name for this species, which has been classified under the former names, Nelumbium speciosum Willd. and Nymphaea nelumbo, among others. (These names are obsolete synonyms and are avoided in current works.) This plant is an aquatic perennial. Under favorable circumstances its seeds may remain viable for many years, with the oldest recorded lotus germination being from that of seeds 1,300 years old recovered from a dry lakebed in northeastern China. It has a very wide native distribution, ranging from central and northern India (at altitudes up to 1,400 m or 4,600 ft in the southern Himalayas), through northern Indochina and East Asia (north to the Amur region; the Russian populations have sometimes been referred to as \"Nelumbo komarovii\"), with isolated locations at the Caspian Sea. Today the species also occurs in southern India, Sri Lanka, virtually all of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and northern and eastern Australia, but this is probably the result of human translocations. It has a very long history (c. 3,000 years) of being cultivated for its edible seeds, and it is commonly cultivated in water gardens. It is the national flower of India and Vietnam.The seeds, rhizomes, and stolons are edible."},

As commander of the Continental Army, he rallied Americans from thirteen divergent states and outlasted Britain's superior military force. As the first president, Washington's superb leadership set the standard for each president that has succeeded him. The Washington Monument towers above the city that bears his name, serving as an awe-inspiring reminder of George Washington's greatness. The monument, like the man, stands in no one's shadow. The Washington Monument, designed by Robert Mills and eventually completed by Thomas Casey and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, honors and memorializes George Washington at the center of the nation's capital. The structure was completed in two phases of construction, one private (1848-1854) and one public (1876-1884). Built in the shape of an Egyptian obelisk, evoking the timelessness of ancient civilizations, the Washington Monument embodies the awe, respect, and gratitude the nation felt for its most essential Founding Father. When completed, the Washington Monument was the tallest building in the world at 555 feet, 5-1/8 inches.As a comparison, the present (2018) tallest building in the world is the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is 2,717 feet high. This building is a thousand feet higher than the One World Trade Center in New York City. Also, the Empire State Building is now listed as the 40th tallest building."},

Here is a short explanation of the manufacture of this series of tractors from Wikipedia: International Harvester.For model year 1939, industrial designer Raymond Loewy was hired to design a new line of tractors. The sleek look, combined with other new features, created what is known as the Farmall \"letter series\" (A, B, BN, C, H, and M) and the McCormick-Deering \"standard series\" (W-4, W-6, and W-9). Model year 1941 had the introduction of the model MD, the first rowcrop diesel-powered tractor; over a decade later, IH's largest competitor, John Deere, introduced a diesel option on their rowcrop tractors. The letter series tractors were updated to the \"super\" series in 1953 (with the exception of the A, which had become a \"super\" in 1947, and the B and BN, which were discontinued in 1948) and received several improvements. Many of these tractors (especially the largest: the H, M, and W models) are still in operation on farms today. Especially desirable are the diesel-powered MD, WD-6, and WD-9. These tractors carried forward the unique gasoline start diesel concept of the WD-40.The Farmall H series was produced from 1939 to 1953. Here is a quote from the Wikipedia article \"Farmall H.\"The Farmall H, produced by International Harvester under the Farmall brand from 1939 to 1953, is a two-plow row crop tractor. It was the most widely-produced of International Harvester's \"letter series\", with approximately 390,000 produced over the 14-year run. The H is equipped with a 4-cylinder engine with a 152-cubic-inch (2,490-cubic-centimetre) displacement and a 6-volt, positive ground electrical system with generator, (when so ordered or retrofitted). The transmission contains six total gears: five forward and one reverse. It was the smaller of the two prominent row crop tractors produced by IH from the late 1930s to the early 1950s, along with the Farmall M and its variants, yet could still use the same implements.This particular tractor is obviously no longer in service."},

Here is a description of this frog from Wikipedia. The American bullfrog (Lithobates catesbeianus or Rana catesbeiana), often simply known as the bullfrog in Canada and the United States, is an amphibious frog, a member of the family Ranidae, or “true frogs”. This frog has an olive green back and sides blotched with brownish markings and a whitish belly spotted with yellow or grey. The upper lip is often bright green and males have yellow throats. It inhabits large, permanent water bodies, such as swamps, ponds, and lakes, where it is usually found along the water's edge. The male bullfrog defends a territory during the breeding season. His call is reminiscent of the roar of a bull, which gives the frog its common name. This frog is native to southern and eastern parts of the United States and Canada, but has been widely introduced across other parts of North, Central and South America, Western Europe, and parts of Asia, and in some areas is regarded as an invasive species. The bullfrog is harvested for use as food in North America and in several countries into which it has been introduced. It is also cultured in controlled environments, though this is a difficult and not always successful undertaking. Some international trade in frog legs occurs for human consumption. Bullfrogs are used in biology classes in schools for dissection and are sometimes kept as pets.As you can tell from this article if you dissected a frog in high school biology, it was probably one of this frog's relatives. I found this frog sitting in a pool at the National Botanical Garden in Washington, D.C.Whenever I take a photo of a plant, I try to identify it. In this case, I was taking photos in the National Botanical Garden and in this case, I take a photo of the plant label if I can find one.

Unfortunately, there was no label on this plant so I used Google Images to match an image and finally a possible identification as Combretum constrictum.Strict federal and state laws prohibit the collection of historical artifacts.

When I finally went back for another look, the weather had changed and so did my appreciation for the magnificence of the canyon and since then I have been back on every possible opportunity."},

The artist is René François Ghislain Magritte. Here is a short introduction to Magritte from the Wikipedia.René François Ghislain Magritte (French: [ʁəne fʁɑ̃swa ɡilɛ̃ maɡʁit]; 21 November 1898 – 15 August 1967) was a Belgian surrealist artist. He became well known for creating a number of witty and thought-provoking images. Often depicting ordinary objects in an unusual context, his work is known for challenging observers' preconditioned perceptions of reality. His imagery has influenced pop, minimalist and conceptual art. Some of my photographs are also optical illusions.  For example, The Endless Escalator published on March 28, 2018.There are certain artists, such as Edward Hopper and Maynard Dixon, who paint the way I take photographs. This painting in the Smithsonian American Art Museum was painted by Edward Hoppen in 1933. It is called \"Ryder's House.\" If you were to go back through my photos on this website, you would see many photos that have similar themes, composition, and light as this photo. For example, my photo of the Government House in Annapolis, Maryland on May 14, 2018. The subject matter of my photos may not be on the East Coast, but my selection of views reflects the same type of emphasis on form and color. It is not that I am copying anyone, but I I do feel that my photos are in a particular genus of American art."},

{"title": "393 Year Old Tree Survived Atomic Blast", "date": "Sunday, June 3, 2018", "text": "This lovely Bonsai tree was potted back in 1625, just 5 years after the Pilgrims came to America. It has been pruned and kept alive all that time. It is a Japanese White Pine, Pinus parviflora 'Miyajima'. I cannot imagine what it would take for all those generations of gardeners to keep this plant alive and well. It also survived the Atomic Bomb attack in 1945 in Hiroshima. Here is the explanation from an article on PBS, 3 August 2013 entitled, \"Centuries-old bonsai that survived atomic bomb gets honored 70 years later.\"The Washington Post reported that the tree was originally donated to the Arboretum by a bonsai master named Masaru Yamaki. It was part of a gift of 53 trees given to the Arboretum’s National Bonsai and Penjing Museum in honor of the U.S. bicentennial. No mention was made of the tree’s history, and it wasn’t until the brothers showed up that the tree’s incredible story was even known. The tree’s history will be honored on Thursday, the 70th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. The tree was originally located in a walled nursery belonging to Yamaki that was less than two miles from Hiroshima. This distance, however, was just far enough away to shield it from the blast. Jack Sustic, curator of the Bonsai and Penjing Museum, told the Post that the tree must have been against a wall where it was shielded from the blast. Photographs taken at the Yamaki Nursery just after the bombing show the pine standing in its pot, unharmed."},

This painting was part of the Public Works of Art Project, California from 1933 to 1934. It was painted by Millard Sheets who was born in Pomona, California in 1907 and died in Gualala, California in 1989. Here is a summary of the painting's subject from the Smithsonian's American Art Museum website.These ramshackle tenements were home to poor families in the Bunker Hill neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles during the Great Depression. The artist failed to show that just to the left of this view a cable car line called Angels Flight offered a ride up the steep hill. In the painting a lone figure trudges up steps toward once elegant Victorian mansions that had degenerated into boardinghouses. Millard Sheets, an up-and-coming young California artist, enjoyed drawing and painting the people and houses of this colorful neighborhood. Here he shows women who have finished washing and hanging out their laundry in the days before electric appliances lightened these chores. Now the women stop to gossip while leaning on stair rails, or sit in the shade to avoid the hot afternoon sun.Sheets, like many artist members of regional committees, proudly gave his painting as a gift to his country. The shabbily dressed women in Tenement Flats would be startled to discover that this painting would hang in the elegant surroundings of the White House. PWAP paintings like this one were displayed in reception areas to show President Roosevelt’s commitment to art and to ordinary Americans across the country.Having hiked in many slot canyons of the west, I am familiar with the concept of walls on both sides, but there are only a very few of these western slot canyons that have roads and cars.

{"title": "The Hubble Space Telescope", "date": "Wednesday, May 30, 2018", "text": "One of the familiar displays at the National Air and Space Museum is this full-scale mockup of the Hubble Space Telescope. Here is the description of the display from the Smithsonian website.Prior to undertaking construction of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) the Lockheed Missile and Space Company built a full-scale mockup in 1975 for conducting various feasibility studies. Initially a low-fidelity metal cylinder for testing handling procedures for the proposed spacecraft, the test vehicle evolved continuously as Lockheed proceeded through its feasibility studies and was awarded the contract to build the actual spacecraft. The test vehicle eventually served as a frame on which the cables and wiring harnesses for the actual spacecraft were fabricated. It was also used for simulations in developing maintenance and repair activities in orbit. Dynamic studies on the test vehicle including vibration studies and thermal studies led to its being designated the Hubble Space Telescope Structural Dynamic Test Vehicle (SDTV). The artifact was stored outdoors at Lockheed in Sunnyvale Ca., until it was donated to NASM in June 1987 and shipped to the Garber facility. There it was refurbished and restored to its 1976 configuration. It went on display in the Space Hall in March 1989. In 1996 the SDTV was removed from exhibit in order to upgrade the object to simulate the actual HST as it was being deployed from the Shuttle. This major upgrade, generously supported and executed by Lockheed, HST subcontractors, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and NASM staff and volunteers, involved fabricating the equipment section for the Optical Telescope Assembly, the aperture door, high gain antennae, solar arrays, aft shroud handrails, and numerous other details. A major addition was realistic multi-layer (non-flight) thermal blanketing and taping, interface hardware, wave guides, and the umbilical. NASA also provided a large equipment cradle to allow the upgraded object to be displayed from the floor at a dramatic angle. The completed artifact was reinstalled in Space Hall in early 1997."},
{"title": "The Knockdown by Mahonri Young", "date": "Wednesday, May 30, 2018", "text": "Artists, paintings, sculpture, and practically everything else from the western part of the United States is almost entirely missing from the National Gallery and the other exhibits which are part of the Smithsonian Museums in Washington, D.C. Here is one of the few exceptions. This small sculpture is by Mohonri Young. Here is what the Smithsonian has to say about the artist.Mahonri Young loved sports when he was a boy and often attended boxing matches with his younger brother, Wally. On a trip to Paris in 1926, he began his popular Prizefighter series, which includes The Knockdown. Images of sporting events and athletes were very popular in the American art market during the 1920s and 1930s, and Young's pieces, which emphasize the excitement and danger of boxing, brought him widespread recognition. Here, he captured the moment when the loser falls to the mat, emphasizing his defeat by making his body appear to melt into the base of the sculpture. The winner, in contrast, seems to spring upward as he follows through with a devastating left hook.What did they leave out? Here is a quote from the Wikipedia article about Mohonri Young.Mahonri Macintosh Young (August 9, 1877 – November 2, 1957) was an American sculptor and artist. Although he lived most of his life in New York City, two of his works, the This Is The Place Monument and the Seagull Monument are featured prominently in Salt Lake City, Utah. Mahonri was the grandson of the second President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and first Governor of Utah, Brigham Young.Hmm. Perhaps they don't know Utah is part of the United States?While walking around the Mall in Washington, D.C. you are likely to see quite a few things. Some of them are unexpected. Here is a description of how this bronze cast head of a triceratops was created from a Smithsonian article entitled, \"From a computer-generated model, sculptors cast a bronze triceratops that Looks like the real thing.\"Equipped with the latest technology, experts set out two years ago to create a more perfect triceratops. The 1905 body was too large for its head, so scientists used a computer to produce a new skull 15 percent larger than the original. Using three-dimensional laser-scanning techniques unknown even five years ago, conservators also created an anatomically correct skeleton made of resin, plaster and fiberglass. The left shoulder blade, for instance, which had originally been sculpted by guesswork, was replaced with a mirror image of the right blade. The finished dinosaur, some 20 feet long and 8 feet tall, is what you see in the newly renovated Dinosaur Hall at Natural History. (A computer image can be viewed on-line here.) Triceratops’ original skull and a few other carefully preserved bones are also on display alongside the replica. Diceratops, the skeleton of a baby styracosaurus, centrosaurus and various dinosaur relatives are there too. But getting back to that big bronze head outside the museum, which was cast from the same computer-generated model as the skeleton inside: to make it, the Smithsonian chose sculptors at Millersville University, near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and sent them a rubber mold of the new skull, sectioned into eight pieces for transport. The sculptors reassembled the pieces, which averaged eight by six feet, and poured several layers of molten wax into the mold. Making a hollow wax head is complicated. Because the wax version of triceratops was produced from a laser-generated model, it lacked the exact markings of the original fossil. Artists spent more than a thousand hours sculpting in the details. “We used photographs and visited the museum to see the fossil firsthand,” says George Mummert, one of the three sculptors in residence at Millersville.Read more: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/heads-up-51625718/#swasSXhcs08STTCo.99"},

It is labeled as \"Untitled (I Am a Man).\" This painting obviously reminded me of the following book:Hofstadter, Douglas R. 1989. Gödel, Escher, Bach; An Eternal Golden Braid. Vintage.Hofstadter's book is one of the most influential works on reality, math, symmetry, and intelligence. Here is a short explanation of the book from Wikipedia: Gödel, Escher, Bach.By exploring common themes in the lives and works of logician Kurt Gödel, artist M. C. Escher, and composer Johann Sebastian Bach, the book expounds concepts fundamental to mathematics, symmetry, and intelligence. Through illustration and analysis, the book discusses how self-reference and formal rules allow systems to acquire meaning despite being made of \"meaningless\" elements. It also discusses what it means to communicate, how knowledge can be represented and stored, the methods and limitations of symbolic representation, and even the fundamental notion of \"meaning\" itself.One dominant theme in the book is the philosophical and mathematical issue of self-referential statements. This painting is self-referential on more than one level. In my family, reading Gödel, Escher, Bach; An Eternal Golden Braid was highly recommended. I am fascinated with the way windows frame and delineate the outside world. Here, the window includes a glimpse into the interior as well as the world beyond. The reflections in the glass change our view of reality. We think we are seeing out a window, when, we are really looking back at ourselves and the window becomes a mirror to more than what our eyes can see."},

Here is a quote from Wikipedia about how high the buildings can be in our Capitol City.The height of buildings in Washington is limited by the Height of Buildings Act. The original Act was passed by Congress in 1899 in response to the 1894 construction of the Cairo Hotel, which is much taller than the majority of buildings in the city. The original act restricted the heights of any type of building in the city to be no higher than 110 feet (34 m), 90 feet (27 m) for residential buildings. In 1910, the 61st United States Congress enacted a new law which raised the overall building height limit to 130 feet (40 m), but restricted building heights to the width of the adjacent street or avenue plus 20 feet (6.1 m); thus, a building facing a 90-foot (27 m)-wide street could be only 110 feet (34 m) tall. However, building heights are measured from the sidewalk or curb to the edge of the roof. Architectural embellishments, mechanical rooms, and common rooftop structures may be exempted from the overall height limit, provided they are set back from the roof line.The only tall buildings near the city are across the Potomac River in Virginia."},

Oh well, we will be here in the Fall and see the country and the buildings again I suppose.Originally, the seal of Maryland was an actual seal used to verify documents and records.Here is a description of the history of the Maryland State Seal or the Great Seal of Maryland from the Maryland State Archives website.The Great Seal of Maryland is used by the Governor and the Secretary of State to authenticate Acts of the General Assembly and for other official purposes. The Secretary of State is the designated custodian of the Great Seal, and provides guidance on its use. Only the reverse of the Great Seal is used officially. In 1959, however, the obverse was described in statute and has been considered part of the Seal (Chapter 396, Acts of 1959). Often, it adorns public buildings. The first Great Seal was brought over during the early days of the Maryland colony, but was stolen by Richard Ingle during his rebellion of 1645. Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Lord Baltimore, sent a similar seal from England in 1648 for the use of the Maryland Chancellor. Except for the period of crown rule (1692-1715), that Great Seal remained in use until the end of the 18th century, the Maryland Council having authorized continued use of the provincial seal on March 31, 1777 (Constitution of 1776, sec. 36). A new seal with republican imagery was adopted by the Governor and Council on February 5, 1794. Designed by Charles Willson Peale, the Maryland Seal of 1794 remained in use until 1817. In that year, the General Assembly adopted a single-sided Great Seal bearing an eagle holding a shield. Another seal authorized in 1854 depicted an eagle and a version of the Calvert arms (Chapter 81, Acts of 1854). Maryland readopted the reverse of the original Calvert seal in 1874 (Joint Resolution no. 9, Acts of 1874; Joint Resolution no. 5, Acts of 1876). This new seal corrected the imagery of the Calvert arms in the seal of 1854. It is the seal in use today. In 1959, the General Assembly adopted the seal by statute and codified its description (Chapter 396, Acts of 1959). Revisions to the law were enacted in 1969 (Chapter 79, Acts of 1969; Code General Provisions Article, secs. 7-101 through 7-104).The seal depicts a farmer and a fisherman. This will probably not be the only photo showing the Great Seal.One thing that is interesting about living in a new area for a while is the difference in cars. You would rarely see one of these Chrysler/Plymouth Prowlers in Utah. But I see a lot of very expensive and or rare cars here in Annapolis. I saw this one parked in front of the Maryland State House in Annapolis, Maryland.The Plymouth Prowler, later the Chrysler Prowler, is a retro-styled production car manufactured and marketed from 1997 to 2002 by DaimlerChrysler, based on the 1993 concept car of the same name. The Prowler was offered in a single generation in a front-engine, rear-drive, rear-transmission configuration — with an overall production of 11,702. See Wikipedia: Plymouth Prowler.I also see quite a number of Range Rovers and few old sports cars driving the streets. There are far fewer pickup trucks but SUVs seem to be the most common type of vehicle. This probably reflects the reason why Ford Motor Company recently announced that they were discontinuing the manufacture of all their sedan automobiles.

This is where the Governor of Maryland, presently Larry Hogan, lives. This was a wonderful opportunity and so far, the most impressive building and grounds we have seen in Annapolis. Here is a description of the Fountain from The Maryland State Archives website.This beautiful Victorian-style fountain was created and installed in the garden at Government House in 1990. The fountain was designed by Graham Landscape Architects in Annapolis and sculptor Lyle Beddes of Historical Arts and Casting helped to create it. The design includes many images that represent Maryland and its bounty, including corn, crabs, tobacco, terrapins and the Baltimore Oriole, the state bird. The fountain was the inspiration of former governor William Donald Schaefer and his official hostess Hilda Mae Snoops. It cost $169,000 and was paid for with private funds. In 1994, Governor Schaefer officially dedicated the fountain to Mrs. Snoops, who died in 1999. Government House, which stands across the street from the historic Maryland State House in Annapolis, was built in 1868 as a high Victorian mansion. In 1935, it was expanded and completely renovated into the style of a five-part Georgian house. The fountain stands near a bay window that still remains from the building's Victorian beginnings.The Maryland State House sits on one of the highest points in Annapolis. This is not very high but the building can be seen from most of the downtown area. The statue in the foreground is to Thurgood Marshall, Here is a summary of Marshall's career from the Wikipedia article with his name.Thurgood Marshall (July 2, 1908 – January 24, 1993) was an American lawyer, serving as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from October 1967 until October 1991. Marshall was the Court's 96th justice and its first African-American justice. Prior to his judicial service, he successfully argued several cases before the Supreme Court. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Marshall graduated from the Howard University School of Law in 1933. He established a private legal practice in Baltimore before founding the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, where he served as executive director. In that position, he argued several cases before the Supreme Court, including Smith v. Allwright, Shelley v. Kraemer, and Brown v. Board of Education, which held that racial segregation in public education is a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Marshall to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Four years later, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed Marshall as the United States Solicitor General. In 1967, Johnson successfully nominated Marshall to succeed retiring Associate Justice Tom C. Clark. Marshall retired during the administration of President George H. W. Bush, and was succeeded by Clarence Thomas.The cloud of steam in the photo is coming from a vent to the heating and cooling system in the area of the government buildings. Here is a quote from the Wikipedia article about the Severn River in Maryland.The Severn has a watershed area (including the water surface) of 81 square miles (210 km2), or 69 square miles (180 km2) of land. Thus, its total watershed area is 15% water. Its source is the beginning of the non-tidal nine-mile long Severn Run in northwestern Anne Arundel County in Severn, Maryland. The river enters the Chesapeake Bay near the major port city of Annapolis, also the capital of Maryland. Most famous for the United States Naval Academy campus situated at the mouth of the river, the Severn provides an access point to the Chesapeake Bay not just for midshipmen but also for fishermen and pleasure boaters. Several tributary creeks drain highly developed areas, including Weems Creek and its nontidal portion Cowhide Branch, which drain most of the Annapolis Mall and the Anne Arundel Medical Center.This river looks like a huge lake or part of the ocean. Technically at this point, it is an estuary because it has tidal fluctuations. We cross this river several times a week traveling to the Annapolis Stake Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The large building on the shore that looks like a mansion is a care center."},

It stresses the importance of maintaining strong family connections and of preserving and honoring one's family history and cultural heritage. The Memorial is dedicated especially to all of our African ancestors whose names, unlike Kunta Kinte's, are lost forever in the oceans of time. It also is for all people - African, Asian and European - who arrived in the New World in bondage, whose unpaid labor forged the backbone of this nation's rise to greatness. It is dedicated also to their descendants, who strive to create a nation that celebrates ethnic diversity within the spirit of brotherhood, mutual respect, and understanding.Annapolis is a nice walking city. This is the historic center of the city of Annapolis, Maryland.

His father was Charles Carroll the Settler, (I – the first), (1661–1720), an immigrant to Maryland who had arrived in the colony in 1689 with a commission as Provincial Attorney General, and had accumulated a vast fortune, emerging as Maryland's wealthiest citizen. Charles Carroll of Annapolis inherited and extended his father's fortune but, as a Roman Catholic, was barred from participation in Maryland politics. It would fall to his son, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, (III), (1737–1832), one of the signers (and the longest-lived) of the Declaration of Independence, to see religious toleration restored to Maryland and many political and scientific/technological advances in the newly independent state.The weather warmed up, the rain stopped, and we had time for a wonderful walk around downtown Annapolis, Maryland.

Several species have small heads of inconspicuous flowers surrounded by an involucre of large, typically white petal-like bracts, while others have more open clusters of petal-bearing flowers. The various species of dogwood are native throughout much of temperate and boreal Eurasia and North America, with China and Japan and the southeastern United States particularly rich in native species. Species include the common dogwood Cornus sanguinea of Eurasia, the widely cultivated flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) of eastern North America, the Pacific dogwood Cornus nuttallii of western North America, the Kousa dogwood Cornus kousa of eastern Asia, and two low-growing boreal species, the Canadian and Eurasian dwarf cornels (or bunchberries),  Cornus canadensis and Cornus suecica respectively.The Senate Chambers in the beautifully restored Maryland State House.

The Continental Congress met in the Old Senate Chamber from November 26, 1783 to August 13, 1784. During that time, George Washington came before Congress to resign his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and the Treaty of Paris was ratified, marking the official end of the Revolutionary War. The State House is where the Maryland General Assembly convenes for three months each year, and the elected leadership of the state — the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the House of Delegates and president of the Senate — all have their offices here."},

Installation took approximately 10 days.The torch was \"illuminated\" by the application of 2312-karat gold leaf, square by square, a process that took about three days. Expert architectural gilder Lisa Da Silva Cotter completed the gold leafing of the flame. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) recommended the award of a $5.2 million contract to PEC Inc., Laurel, Md., in October 1995 to replace the Jefferson's copper roof, dome, and torch. Subcontractor James Myers Co. Inc., Beltsville, Md., is responsible for the ornamental work on the roof, including the torch. The original torch was removed in January 1996 and used to make molds for the new one, which was created in heavy-duty copper. Assembled in four sections, the pedestal is riveted onto a steel substructure and then soldered. The torch was molded in one piece. A lightning rod about the size of a pencil will project about 12 inches from the tip of the flame.We walked by this beautiful tree on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol Building.

Here is a short description from Wikipedia: List of Curtiss P-40 Warhawk variants:The P-40E played a major role in the defense of Philippines, Java (NEI), Australia and New Guinea in 1942, and with the Desert Air Force (DAF) in intense fighting against the Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica also in 1942. The P-40E was also an important type for the Soviets, particularly in the Leningrad area but also in the siege of Moscow and at Stalingrad. In the Desert War the arrival of the heavily armed, fast and maneuverable Kittyhawk led to the accelerated retirement of the Bf 109E and its replacement by the faster and more maneuverable Bf 109F. The top scoring DAF squadrons, including No. 3 Squadron RAAF and No. 112 Squadron RAF, transferred from the Tomahawk to the Kittyhawk, scoring many kills against Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica types, helping the DAF to hold on through this tough period. Many RAF and SAAF P-40 units also took heavy casualties - especially as Me 109F variants began to arrive in Theater in late 1941."},

Here is a short explanation of the sculpture from the Wikipedia article, \"The Veiled Nun.\"The Veiled Nun is an 1860 marble bust depicting a female figure. Despite the name, the woman depicted is not a nun. Sculpted by Italian artist Giuseppe Croff, it is considered one of the artist's greatest works. The bust was popular with visitors to the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. from 1874 until the museum closed in 2014. The bust is now displayed in the National Gallery of Art.Here is a further description of the work.The Veiled Nun is a 20.75 in (52.7 cm) tall marble bust depicting a female figure wearing a veil.[1][2][3] The fine details give the illusion of the veil being opaque and transparent.[4] Because of the woman's stylish coiffure and embroidered veil, she is not a nun, but rather a woman of means or an allegorical figure.[2][3][4] According to photographer David Finn and art historian Susan Joy Slack, \"the mysterious nature of the work, its inward focus, and the relative 'foreignness' of veiled figures to American museumgoers caused early visitors to refer to her as a nun, and the appellation has remained.\"[4] The bust has been described as a \"fine example of a detailed rendering of texture and form\", a \"tour de force of carving\" and \"carved to make stone look like silk\".It is really one of the most remarkable things we have seen in the museums in Washington, D.C.

Wiseman was able to get his plane up to 100 feet in the air and traveled smoothly for the first four miles. But four and one-half miles out, the engine started to quit. Wiseman was forced to land in a muddy field, breaking one of the planes skids as he landed. The crew repaired the plane, and covered it with a canvas tarp. The next morning, the tarp was laid out on the muddy field, and used as Wiseman's runway. The plane managed to make the rest of the trip that day, securing Wiseman's place in history as the first plane to carry airmail. A second airmail trip was made the day that Wiseman landed.

Here is a description of the statue:The Smithsonian’s two monumental Easter Island stone figures, or moai, represent some of the most popular and intriguing exhibits at the National Museum of Natural History. Since their arrival in 1887, one or both has always been on exhibit. Exceedingly rare, the statues—one a complete statue, the other a head—remain today the only such figures in a public museum in the United States. These distinctive stone figures are a quintessential feature of Easter Island, or Rapa Nui. Most of them were made between the years 1100 and 1680, and are carved primarily out of volcanic tuff (solidified ash) from the extinct volcano, Rano Raraku. To date, a total of 887 are known to have been made, though many never made it out of the volcanic quarry. Each statue likely represented the deceased head of a lineage, and many were positioned on stone temple platforms facing inland to keep watch over their respective communities. These icons of the Pacific have been well known to outsiders since the time of Captain Cook’s visit in 1774. The British collected a very significant statue, known as Hoa Hakananai’a, in 1868, the first statue to be removed from the island. A few years later, Britain’s great rival, the French, also came and carried away a stone figure. Both figures have always been prominently displayed, and are today at the British Museum in London and the Musée du quai Branly in Paris.This Olmec Head is in front of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Here is the description of the head.The National Museum of Natural History has had a long and involved research program centered on the Olmec culture in southern Mexico. Outside the museum you will see an exact 1.78m (5.84 ft) tall carved stone replica of Colossal Head #4. This sculpture was created by Ignacio Pérez Solano. He carved the 6 ton head out of volcanic stone, and faithfully replicated the original head carved by the Olmec about 3000 years ago. This replica was a gift to the Smithsonian from Miguel Alemán Velazco, then governor of the state of Veracruz, Mexico. In 1946, Smithsonian archaeologist Matthew W. Stirling excavated the original head, named \"San Lorenzo Colossal head #4\" after the town near which it was discovered. Now on display at the Museum of Anthropology in Xalapa, Veracruz, it was lent to the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History in 1978 for the “Treasures of Mexico”exhibit. During its exhibition here it was displayed on the mall steps, where either the banded iron or the fossil wood can presently be seen."},

The species is distributed in subtropical and tropical locations throughout the southeastern United States, as well as Central and South America, and has been collected infrequently in a few locales in Africa. The body of the lichen forms continuous, circular crust-like patches on dead wood, readily recognizable by the prominent red pigment. The older, central region is covered with red, spherical to cylindrical granules. Moving outwards from the center, zones of color may be distinguished, the first gray-green, the second white, and finally a bright red cottony rim. The red and green colors of this unmistakable woodland lichen give the appearance of a Christmas wreath, suggestive of its common North American name, the Christmas wreath lichen. The red pigment, called chiodectonic acid is one of several chemicals the lichen produces to help tolerate inhospitable growing conditions."},

If this fence were a border fence there would be several legal questions. Where is the boundary land? Is the fence entirely on one parcel or is it a shared fence? If it is a shared fence, where on the fence is the boundary line? The questions go on and on and barbed wife solves all these questions and many more."},

From January of 1785 until the middle of 1786, his diaries are full of his plant explorations and details of his landscaping accomplishments. He planted aspen trees along the serpentine avenues, dogwood, maple, poplar, and mulberry in the shrubberies, and wagon-loads of Virginia pine in the wilderness areas. Washington’s excitement with his progress is evident in his diary entries, and with great satisfaction he recorded on March 3, 1785, “Employed myself the greatest part of the day in pruning and shaping the young plantation of Tree & Shrubs.”The tree is tagged with a metal plate with the note that the tree was planted by George Washington. We haven't been too lucky yet with our weather while here on the East Coast.

A sunstone served as the capital, or head, of each pilaster. A star stone was placed above each sunstone. The order of the stones recalled the woman described in Revelation 12, “clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars” (Rev. 12:1). When the original temple was under construction, the New York Spectator published the following review of the temple sunstones in an article about Nauvoo: “On the top, not far from fifty feet high, is an ideal representation of the rising sun, which is a monstrous prominent stone face, the features of which are colossal and singularly expressive. . . . These all stand out on the stone boldly. Their finish is admirable and as complete as any of the best specimens of chiseling on the Girard College at Philadelphia.” Continuing:The first sunstone was installed on September 23, 1844.7 The original sunstones were actually two pieces of stone. The lower, face portion was carved from one piece of limestone, and the trumpets from another. The sunstones were six feet high and six feet six inches wide at the top.This is one of the amazing artifacts in the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.Who would have imagined that the Apple II computer would start one of the world's richest companies?

One is the famous Tucson Ring Meteorite and the other is it companion slab. Quoting from Marment Meteorites:Two masses of the Tucson meteorite were found in 1850, but native people must have known about these masses of iron for centuries before that. One was the ring-shaped Irwin-Ainsa mass, the second the paired, bean-shaped, Carleton mass. The meteorites consist of 92% iron with 8% silicate inclusions, which is very high for an iron meteorite. Tucson may be the result of an impact between an iron asteroid and a stony asteroid. The parent body of the Tucson meteorite cooled rapidly, so there is no Widmanstätten pattern present. The Tucson meteorite is classified as an ungrouped ataxite iron with silicate inclusions. Each of the Tucson masses has its unique history. The first recovered and the larger of the two is the 688 kg ring-shaped mass, also called the Ring or Signet, Ainsa and Irwin-Ainsa Meteorite at various times in history: The earliest account of the meteorites is by a Sonoran official, Jose Francisco Velasco, who says several iron masses were found between Tucson and Tubac, in Puerto de los Muchachos and at the foot of Sierra de la Madera. One mass, he said, was taken to Tucson. Later, the second known mass, Carleton, was also transported from the mountains to Tucson. Both masses had been used as anvils in blacksmith shops.The Mexican troops left Tucson in 1856, leaving behind the famous meteorites. In 1860, the Smithsonian Institution asked Lieutenant Irwin, an army physician and amateur naturalist in the area, to go to Tucson to recover the Tucson Ring meteorite. He found it, pulled it out of the ground, and entrusted it to a man who was to go to the coast and deliver it by ship to the museum. The man carried out his mission, but told the Smithsonian that his great-grandfather had discovered the meteorite. The family name, Ainsa, was given to the meteorite.

Jefferson finally received a chair in 1818, after Hemmings had made his own version, but Hemmings quickly created at least two more chairs later with the actual chair as a model.[3] At least one attributed to Hemmings still exists.It appears to be very similar to The furniture attributed to Hemmings."},

From the outside of the house, where it was pouring rain, it would look just like a door into the house. But on the inside, it was disguised as a window to give an illusion of symmetry with a real window on the same side of the room. This is the Hammon-Harwood House in Annapolis, Maryland. Here is an explanation from the Wikipedia article about this house.The Hammond–Harwood House is a five-part brick house with a five-bay two-story central block, two-story end wings and one-story connecting hyphens on either side. The central block has a shallow hipped roof. The wings project toward the street with three-sided hipped-roof bays. The hyphens are rendered as a blind arcade, with the central bay a door opening with a pediment above. There is little decoration, with plain rubbed brick flat arches over the windows. Ornament is confined to the central bay, whose door is framed by engaged Ionic columns and topped by a fanlight. Above the door the second floor window is framed with a surround and entablature. The interior presents the appearance of symmetry where it is in fact not symmetrical, using false doors where necessary to maintain the illusion. The main rooms are the first-floor dining room and the second-floor ballroom immediately above, at the rear of the house overlooking the garden. The dining room features an opening, centered in the facade, that is treated as a door on the outside and as a window on the inside.Because of the rain, you will have to wait for any photos of the exterior."},

Meade, Maryland. It is a free private museum and is extremely interesting and quite busy. The original Rosetta Stone is in the British Museum. I was surprised at how large it is. Here is a description from Wikipedia: Rosetta Stone.The Rosetta Stone is 1,123 millimetres (3 ft 8 in) high at its highest point, 757 mm (2 ft 5.8 in) wide, and 284 mm (11 in) thick. It weighs approximately 760 kilograms (1,680 lb). It bears three inscriptions: the top register in Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the second in the Egyptian Demotic script, and the third in Ancient Greek. The front surface is polished and the inscriptions lightly incised on it; the sides of the stone are smoothed, but the back is only roughly worked, presumably because this would have not been visible when it was erected.I have read about the Rosetta Stone since I was very young and have been interested in breaking codes and old languages. Of course, this interest ended up by getting a Masters Degree in Linguistics and being in the Military Intelligence branch in the Army, but I am still interested. If you don't know about the Rosetta Stone, here is another quote from Wikipedia.The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele, found in 1799, inscribed with three versions of a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy V. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic script and Demotic script, respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. As the decree has only minor differences between the three versions, the Rosetta Stone proved to be the key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs.Oh, the Museum had a first edition copy of Jean-François Champollion's book about the decipherment of Egyptian Hieroglyphics. CHAMPOLLION, Jean François, Jacques Joseph CHAMPOLLION-FIGEAC, and Olivier Charles Camille Emmanuel de ROUGÉ. 1844.

Here is a brief introduction to the house from Wikipedia: Hammond-Harwood House.The Hammond–Harwood House is a historic house museum at 19 Maryland Avenue in Annapolis, Maryland, USA. Built in 1774, is one of the premier colonial houses remaining in America from the British colonial period (1607–1776). It is the only existing work of colonial academic architecture that was principally designed from a plate in Andrea Palladio’s I Quattro Libri dell’Architettura (The Four Books of Architecture) (1570). The house was designed by the architect William Buckland in 1773–74 for wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It was modeled on the design of the Villa Pisani in Montagnana, Italy, in Book II, Chapter XIV of I Quattro Libri dell’Achitettura. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960, and is now managed by a non-profit organization as a museum.We thoroughly enjoyed our tour even though we had to walk in the rain to get from our parking spot to the house."},

{"title": "Cycad", "date": "Thursday, February 8, 2018", "text": "This is not a palm tree or even related to a palm tree. This is a cycad. Here is an explanation about what they are from Wikipedia: Cycad:Cycads /ˈsaɪkædz/ are seed plants with a long fossil history that were formerly more abundant and more diverse than they are today. They typically have a stout and woody (ligneous) trunk with a crown of large, hard and stiff, evergreen leaves. They usually have pinnate leaves. The individual plants are either all male or all female (dioecious). Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow very slowly and live very long, with some specimens known to be as much as 1,000 years old. Because of their superficial resemblance, they are sometimes mistaken for palms or ferns, but they are not closely related to either group. Cycads are gymnosperms (naked seeded), meaning their unfertilized seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by pollination, as contrasted with angiosperms, which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized pollinators, usually a specific species of beetle. They have been reported to fix nitrogen in association with various cyanobacteria living in the roots (the \"coralloid\" roots). These photosynthetic bacteria produce a neurotoxin called BMAA that is found in the seeds of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a human food chain as the cycad seeds may be eaten directly as a source of flour by humans or by wild or feral animals such as bats, and humans may eat these animals. It is hypothesized that this is a source of some neurological diseases in humans."},

New York: Macmillan, 1967.It appears from searching on WorldCat.org that the book is rather rare. There is a second edition that is available but used copies of the first edition are listed at over $50 on Amazon. Here is a short summary of the Enigma Machine from Wikipedia:The Enigma machines were a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic and military communication. Enigma was invented by the German engineer Arthur Scherbius at the end of World War I. Early models were used commercially from the early 1920s, and adopted by military and government services of several countries, most notably Nazi Germany before and during World War II. Several different Enigma models were produced, but the German military models, having a plugboard, were the most complex. Japanese and Italian models were also in use.I understand that there are a number of examples on display at the U.S. National Cryptologic Museum here in Maryland and I hope to visit that museum soon."},

Hartford served in several prominent campaigns in the American Civil War as the flagship of David G. Farragut, most notably the Battle of Mobile Bay in 1864. She survived until 1956, when she sank awaiting restoration at Norfolk, Virginia.This helm was salvaged from the ship and is on exhibit in the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland. Albert A. Michelson (1852-1931) was known for his experiments for measuring the speed of light. Here is a short summary of what he did from The University of Chicago.A master at the art of measurement, Michelson devised experiments noted for their simplicity. Thus measurements of the velocity of light used a rapidly rotating, multifaceted mirror to reflect a beam of light. When the speed was correctly adjusted, light reflected from the rotating mirror struck a mirror held in a fixed position and returned to strike the next face on the spinning mirror. The time needed for the next face to rotate into position to precisely reflect the light was the time required for the light to travel the known distance to the stationary mirror and back. His earliest attempts, made with materials costing barely ten dollars, measured the speed of light at 186,508 miles per second, or within two hundred miles of the actual value.Above is one of the mirrors used by Michelson. Michelson attended the Naval Academy and the apparatus is in the Naval Academy Museum.  Here is a link to a short biography of Michelson from the Wikipedia article about his life."},

Although the current pulpit was not installed until a renovation in 1943 it is still notable that the renowned pastor and future Chaplain to the US Senate, Peter Marshall, spoke from the previous pulpit in this same location on Sunday December 7th, 1941 - only hours before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor; he was not actually appointed to the position of Chaplain to the US Senate until 1947.

This bust may copy a wax statue made to commemorate Lorenzo's survival in 1478, when an assassination plot took the life of his younger brother. The simple costume, with a distinctively Florentine padded and draped headdress, reflects Lorenzo's claim to be merely a respected citizen rather than a de facto prince. Cleaning in recent years (completed 2006) has brought out the original bright reds, warm flesh tones, and a light beard. The brooding face suggests the forceful intelligence behind Lorenzo's power. This haunting likeness may have been molded from his death mask."},

A woman dressed in a blue jacket with fur trim stands serenely at a table in a corner of a room. The scales in her right hand are at equilibrium, suggestive of her inner state of mind. A large painting of the Last Judgment, framed in black, hangs on the back wall of the room. A shimmering blue cloth, open boxes, two strands of pearls, and a gold chain lie on the sturdy table. Soft light comes in through the window and illuminates the scene.

Here is some history of the building from the National Gallery of Art website.The National Gallery of Art was conceived and given to the people of the United States by Andrew W. Mellon (1855–1937). Mellon was a financier and art collector from Pittsburgh who came to Washington in 1921 to serve as secretary of the treasury. During his years of public service he came to believe that the United States should have a national art museum equal to those of other great nations. In 1936 Mellon wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt offering to donate his superb art collection for a new museum and to use his own funds to construct a building for its use. With the president’s support, Congress accepted Mellon’s gift, which included a sizable endowment, and established the National Gallery of Art in March 1937. Construction began that year at a site on the National Mall along Constitution Avenue between Fourth and Seventh Street NW, near the foot of Capitol Hill.There is a lot more history on the website.

We began our visits with a trip to the National Gallery of Art. This is a painting by Fra Angelico and Fra Filippo Lippi called The Adoration of the Magi. It was painted sometime between 1440 and 1460 A.D. I love the color and symbolism of this painting. The detail is incredible. Here is a description of the painting from a Wikipedia article:The Adoration of the Magi is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippino Lippi. It is signed and dated at 1496. It is housed in the Uffizi of Florence. The panel was painted for the Convent of the San Donato agli Scopeti, in substitution of the one commissioned in 1481 to Leonardo da Vinci, who left it unfinished. In 1529 it was acquired by Cardinal Carlo de' Medici and in 1666 it became part of the Uffizi collection. Filippino Lippi followed Leonardo's setting, in particular in the central part of the work. Much of its inspiration was clearly derived from Botticelli's Adoration of the Magi, also in the Uffizi: this is evident in the disposition of the characters on the two sides, with the Holy Family portrayed in the centre under. Similarly to Botticelli's work, Filippino also portrayed numerous members of the Medici cadet line, who had adhered to the Savonarolian Republic in the period in which the work was executed. On the left, kneeling and holding with a quadrant, is Pierfrancesco de' Medici, who had died 20 years before. Behind him, standing, are his two sons Giovanni, holding a goblet, and Lorenzo, from whom a page is removing a crown. The general style is that of Filippino's late career, characterized by a greater care to details and by a nervous rhythm in the forms, influenced by the knowledge of foreign painting schools (as also in the landscape of the background).I realize that this isn't one of my usual landscape photos, but from time to time, I have uploaded photos from museums and will continue to do so.  You can see more detail in the photo by clicking on the image.

Here is the information about this cemetery from Wikipedia:Annapolis National Cemetery Annapolis National Cemetery is one of the 14 national cemeteries established by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 to accommodate the dead from the American Civil War. The original plot of land was leased, and later purchased, from Judge Nicholas Brewer. During the Civil War, Annapolis was a Union recruit training center. There was also a parole camp nearby (approximately three miles from what was then the city line) where Union prisoners who had been exchanged for Confederate prisoners were held until they could be returned to their own units. The conditions in the camp were crowded and were not particularly sanitary; many soldiers wound up in one of the army field hospitals at the U.S. Naval Academy and at St. John's College in downtown Annapolis. A large number succumbed to wounds they bore when they arrived, small pox, typhoid fever, dysentery or any of a number of other diseases. Most of the original interments were men who died in the parole camp or the field hospitals. Several Confederate prisoners, and one Russian national, also died in Annapolis and are buried in the cemetery. Many soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen who served during, or died in, subsequent wars - as well as some of their dependents - are also interred there. Annapolis National Cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. We are discovering some very interesting places."},

One of them is the ability to see the forms of the trees instead of viewing them as green blobs.

Trail conditions vary from fair to very poor. Several trails are unsuitable for horses. The area is starkly beautiful and often rugged, but can be inhospitable to those not equipped to meet nature on her own terms.

Here is a good description from the Wikipedia article, \"Cerrusite.\"Cerussite (also known as lead carbonate or white lead ore) is a mineral consisting of lead carbonate (PbCO3), and an important ore of lead. The name is from the Latin cerussa, white lead. Cerussa nativa was mentioned by Conrad Gessner in 1565, and in 1832 F. S. Beudant applied the name cruise to the mineral, whilst the present form, cerussite, is due to W. Haidinger (1845). Miners' names in early use were lead-spar and white-lead-ore. Cerussite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system and is isomorphous with aragonite. Like aragonite it is very frequently twinned, the compound crystals being pseudo-hexagonal in form. Three crystals are usually twinned together on two faces of the prism, producing six-rayed stellate groups with the individual crystals intercrossing at angles of nearly 60°. Crystals are of frequent occurrence and they usually have very bright and smooth faces. The mineral also occurs in compact granular masses, and sometimes in fibrous forms. The mineral is usually colorless or white, sometimes grey or greenish in tint and varies from transparent to translucent with an adamantine lustre. It is very brittle, and has a conchoidal fracture. It has a Mohs hardness of 3 to 3.75 and a specific gravity of 6.5. A variety containing 7% of zinc carbonate, replacing lead carbonate, is known as iglesiasite, from Iglesias in Sardinia, where it is found.This particular specimen came from Arizona and was originally part of the state mineral museum which still remains closed. It was displayed at the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum. This is actually a photo of a red hibiscus flower sitting on the grass. I did not pick the flower. I just found it sitting on the grass. There were no flowers around and I could not guess where it came from.Carnegia gigantea forma cristata is a relatively rare form of the more common version of the iconic saguaro cactus. Cresting is not unique to the saguaro. Many other species of cactus demonstrate this apparent deformity. The actual cause of the cresting is not known but theories range from lightning strikes to genetic diseases. Only about one in 250,000 saguaros are crested. All saguaro cactus are protected by law in the State of Arizona. This particular specimen was found at the entrance to the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum near Tucson, Arizona."},

Within the family Bromeliaceae, pitcher morphology and carnivory evolved twice (Brocchinia and Catopsis). Because these families do not share a common ancestor who also had pitfall trap morphology, carnivorous pitchers are an example of convergent evolution.This particular pitcher plant was growing in the Buffalo Botanical Gardens in New York state."},

Here is a description of how the plant catches insects.It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs on their inner surfaces. When an insect or spider crawling along the leaves contacts a hair, the trap prepares to close, snapping shut only if another contact occurs within approximately twenty seconds of the first strike. The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against wasting energy by trapping objects with no nutritional value, and the plant will only begin digestion after five more stimuli to ensure it has caught a live bug worthy of consumption. See Wikipedia: Venus flytrapHere is a further description from the same article.The leaf blade is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are likely homologous with the tentacles found in this plant’s close relatives, the sundews. Scientists have concluded that the snap trap evolved from a fly-paper trap similar to that of Drosera."},

{"title": "A Burl", "date": "Monday, November 6, 2017", "text": "A burl or bur or burr (in the UK) is a deformed growth on a tree trunk or branch. Here is a description of the growth from the Wikipedia article entitled, \"Burl.\"A burl results from a tree undergoing some form of stress. It may be caused by an injury, virus or fungus. Most burls grow beneath the ground, attached to the roots as a type of malignancy that is generally not discovered until the tree dies or falls over. Such burls sometimes appear as groups of bulbous protrusions connected by a system of rope-like roots. Almost all burl wood is covered by bark, even if it is underground. Insect infestation and certain types of mold infestation are the most common causes of this condition. In some tree species, burls can grow to great size. The largest, at 26 ft (7.9 m), occur in coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) and can encircle the entire trunk; when moisture is present, these burls can grow new redwood trees. The world's second-largest burls can be found in Port McNeill, British Columbia. One of the largest burls known was found around 1984 in the small town of Tamworth, New South Wales. It stands 6.4 ft (2.0 m) tall, with an odd shape resembling a trombone. In January 2009, this burl was controversially removed from its original location and relocated to a public school in the central New South Wales city of Dubbo.This particular burl was in a grove of trees on Vancouver Island, Canada.  The wood from burls is prized for its remarkable grain and hardness. Unfortunately, illegal cutting of burls is a major problem in some areas of the world."},

Here is an article about the origin of this pair of skis from Wikipedia.Kauko Esko Järvinen (15 December 1907 – 7 March 1976) was a Finnish competitor in the Nordic combined and military patrol (precursor to biathlon). He won an individual bronze medal in the Nordic combined at the 1929 World Championships. At the 1928 Winter Olympics he finished fifth in the Nordic combined and 22nd in the ski jumping event. He also placed second in the team military patrol, which was a demonstration sport at those Olympics, and served as the flag bearer for Finland at the opening ceremony. After retiring from competitions Järvinen opened a ski manufacturing factory in Lahti, which ran until 1974 and went bankrupt in 1991, yet his son continued small-scale production of wooden skis. His brother Erkki was an Olympic triple jumper.Sometimes it takes a little detective work to identify the things I find to photograph. The bindings on this pair of skis were manufactured in Sweden by the Rottefella Ski Binding Company. Here is an article about the bindings.Rottefella is a Norwegian ski binding manufacturer. The name refers to the three-pin binding invented by Bror With in 1927, more formally known as the 75mm Nordic Norm. The binding was the standard for cross-country skiing for decades. Rottefella also produces one of the two systems that have largely replaced the 75mm, the New Nordic Norm.Here is a wider view of the skis."},

How many of us are like this grasshopper?Commercial flowers are a common part of many of our lives. but we seldom think about the individual flowers.

Some sockeye live and reproduce in lakes and are commonly called kokanee, which is red-fish name in the Sinixt Interior Salish language and silver trout in the Okanagan language.[7][8] They are much smaller than the anadromous variety and are rarely over 35 cm (14 in) long. In the Okanagan Lake and many others, there are two kinds of kokanee populations – one spawns in streams and the other near lake shores. Landlocked populations occur in the Yukon Territory and British Columbia in Canada, as well as, in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, New York, Utah, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming in the United States. Nantahala Lake is the only place in North Carolina where kokanee salmon are found.[3] The fish, which is native to western North America, was stocked in Nantahala Lake in the mid-1960s by the NC Wildlife Resources Commission in an attempt to establish the species as a forage fish for other predator fishes in the lake. This stock has remained and become a favorite target for anglers.[9]The fish are normally silver color but only turn red when they are spawning. Once the male fish spawn, they die. The Fish and Game Department of the State of Utah supports a fish trap to help propagate the fish. Although I am not a fisherman, we had a really good time seeing the amazing fish and we even got to hold them."},

{"title": "Bryce Canyon Overlook", "date": "Thursday, September 14, 2017", "text": "Bryce Canyon is not a canyon. It is really a series of eroded amphitheaters along the edge of a mesa or high plateau. Many of the Utah of national parks and monuments have become impacted with millions of visitors. Bryce Canyon National Park is no exception. However, almost all of the visitors stay pretty much along the rim drive adjacent to parking areas. During busy times, parking is at a premium, but the trails below the rim remain almost unvisited. In addition, relatively few of the visitors drive past the first few overlooks. Considering the impact of the huge amount of traffic in such a small area, it is a mystery why the National Park Service has not instituted mandatory shuttle services in all of the national parks in Utah. This is especially true in Arches National Park. Bryce Canyon National Park does have a shuttle service but the park is still open to private vehicle traffic. In the case of both Bryce Canyon National Park and at Arches National Park mandatory shuttle service would cut down on the traffic and congestion in the parks. Mandatory shuttle service works well on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park and in Zion National Park."},

You have to pay a fee to enter the canyon because it is \"owned\" and operated by a concession from the Navajo Nation. All slot canyons are inherently dangerous and Antelope Canyon is no exception. Not only do people get stuck in slot canyons, they also get killed when there are sudden flash floods. In the past 20 years, at least 68 people have been killed in flash floods in Arizona.

As news of the gold strike spread many prospectors and businessmen rushed to Bannack hoping to strike it rich. In 1864, Bannack was named as the first Territorial Capital of Montana. Remaining in Bannack for only a short time, the Capital moved on to Virginia City. In 1863 gold had been discovered near Virginia City and at that time many prospectors left Bannack in hopes of finding the mother lode in Virginia City. However, some people stayed in Bannack and explored the use of further mining techniques. From the late 1860's to the 1930's, Bannack continued as a mining town with a fluctuating population. By the 1950's gold workings had dwindled and most folks had moved on. At that point the State of Montana declared Bannack a State Park.

{"title": "Green Bananas", "date": "Sunday, June 18, 2017", "text": "Bananas are really edible berries. There seem to be an almost endless variety of bananas. However, here in the United States, there are only a very limited number of varieties that are commonly sold. If you want to see what is really available, you need to travel to a tropical country. The forces of commerce severely limit the number and variety of types of bananas the will ever be available here. Here is an explanation from Wikipedia about how they grow.The banana plant is the largest herbaceous flowering plant. All the above-ground parts of a banana plant grow from a structure usually called a \"corm\". Plants are normally tall and fairly sturdy, and are often mistaken for trees, but what appears to be a trunk is actually a \"false stem\" or pseudostem. Bananas grow in a wide variety of soils, as long as the soil is at least 60 cm deep, has good drainage and is not compacted. The leaves of banana plants are composed of a \"stalk\" (petiole) and a blade (lamina). The base of the petiole widens to form a sheath; the tightly packed sheaths make up the pseudostem, which is all that supports the plant. The edges of the sheath meet when it is first produced, making it tubular. As new growth occurs in the centre of the pseudostem the edges are forced apart. Cultivated banana plants vary in height depending on the variety and growing conditions. Most are around 5 m (16 ft) tall, with a range from 'Dwarf Cavendish' plants at around 3 m (10 ft) to 'Gros Michel' at 7 m (23 ft) or more. Leaves are spirally arranged and may grow 2.7 metres (8.9 ft) long and 60 cm (2.0 ft) wide. They are easily torn by the wind, resulting in the familiar frond look."},

These medium-sized gulls breed in colonies on islands and levees in lakes and rivers. You'll also spot them in pastures, scrublands, and garbage dumps as they often forage miles from the colony, eating everything they can find from mayflies to garbage.

The bill is grayish overall in most birds, though breeding birds become reddish on the underside of the throat. The back, rump, and tail are streaked with gray and dark brown, sometimes with a rusty hue. In adult pelicans, the breast and belly are a blackish-brown and the legs and feet are black.

Quoting from the Wikipedia article Pineapple:John Kidwell is credited with the introduction of the pineapple industry to Hawaii; large-scale pineapple cultivation by US companies began in the early 1900s. Among the most famous and influential pineapple industrialists was James Dole, who moved to Hawaii in 1899 and started a pineapple plantation in 1900. The companies Dole and Del Monte began growing pineapples on the island of Oahu in 1901 and 1917, respectively. Dole's pineapple company began with the acquisition of 60 acres (24 ha) of land in 1901, and grew into a major company, the Dole Food Company. Maui Pineapple Company began pineapple cultivation on the island of Maui in 1909. In the US, in 1986, the Pineapple Research Institute was dissolved and its assets divided between Del Monte and Maui Land and Pineapple. Del Monte took cultivar '73–114', dubbed 'MD-2', to its plantations in Costa Rica, found it to be well-suited to growing there, and launched it publicly in 1996 as 'Gold Extra Sweet', while Del Monte also began marketing '73–50', dubbed 'CO-2', as 'Del Monte Gold'. Dole ceased its cannery operations in Honolulu in 1991, and in 2008, Del Monte terminated its pineapple-growing operations in Hawaii. In 2009, the Maui Pineapple Company reduced its operations to supply pineapples only locally on Maui, and by 2013, only the Dole Plantation on Oahu grew pineapples in a volume of about 0.1 percent of the world's productionThe Bromeliaceae include the pineapple. There are 3475 known species. Quoting from the Wikipedia article Bromeliaceae:They are among the basal families within the Poales and are unique because they are the only family within the order that has septal nectaries and inferior ovaries.[4] These inferior ovaries characterize the Bromelioideae, a subfamily of the Bromeliaceae.[5] The family includes both epiphytes, such as Spanish moss (Tillandsia usneoides), and terrestrial species, such as the pineapple (Ananas comosus). Many bromeliads are able to store water in a structure formed by their tightly-overlapping leaf bases. However, the family is diverse enough to include the tank bromeliads, grey-leaved epiphyte Tillandsia species that gather water only from leaf structures called trichomes, and a large number of desert-dwelling succulents.I learn something every day. A few of the species of Heliconia are native to the indigenous to certain islands of the Western Pacific. Their common name is Lobster Claws. Quoting from Wikipedia: Heliconia:The Heliconia are a monophyletic genus in the family Heliconiaceae, but was formerly included in the family Musaceae, which includes the bananas (e.g., Musa, Ensete;[11]). However, the APG system of 1998, and its successor, the APG II system of 2003, confirm the Heliconiaceae as distinct and places them in the order Zingiberales, in the commelinid clade of monocots.The Lā'ie, Hawaii Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was dedicated on November 27, 1919, and rededicated on November 21, 2010.

Despite the horses, they were called 20 mule team wagons. Here is a description of the wagons from Wikipedia.In 1877, six years before twenty-mule teams had been introduced into Death Valley, Scientific American reported that Francis Marion Smith and his brother had shipped their company's borax in a 30-ton load using two large wagons, with a third wagon for food and water, drawn by a 24-mule team over a 160-mile stretch of desert between Teel's Marsh and Wadsworth, Nevada. The twenty-mule-team wagons were designed to carry 10 short tons (9 metric tons) of borax ore at a time. The rear wheels measured seven feet (2.1 m) high, with tires made of one-inch-thick (25 mm) iron. The wagon beds measured 16 feet long and were 6 feet deep (4.9 m long, 1.8 m deep); constructed of solid oak, they weighed 7,800 pounds (3,500 kg) empty; when loaded with ore, the total weight of the mule train was 73,200 pounds (33.2 metric tons or 36.6 short tons). The first wagon was the trailer, the second was \"the tender\" or the \"back action\", and the tank wagon brought up the rear. With the mules, the caravan stretched over 180 feet (55 m). No wagon ever broke down in transit on the desert due to their construction.I remember this most because of the 452 television episodes of the program, Death Valley Days."},

There are two Asiatic species (the blue or Indian peafowl originally of India and Sri Lanka and the green peafowl of Myanmar, Indochina, and Java) and one African species (the Congo peafowl native only to the Congo Basin). Male peafowl are known for their piercing call and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic species, who have an eye-spotted \"tail\" or \"train\" of covert feathers which they display as part of a courtship ritual. The term peacock is properly reserved for the male; the female is known as a peahen, and the immature offspring are sometimes called peachicks.Here is an interesting discussing how the peacocks attract females with their tail feathers.

It is located right off one of the main streets in La Jolla, California. I should note that the noise and smell are quite prominent. Obviously, the bird population is a subject of some disagreement. See \"La Jolla Seeks Relief From Bird Stench.\" Those in favor of the birds note that the environmental protections implemented over the past few years have brought back some of the endangered species. Quoting from the article:La Jolla is a state-designated area of \"special biological significance.\" That means California strictly regulates its waters to protect its abundant marine life, which also attracts birds. \"We're kind of a victim of our own success,\" said Robert Pitman, a marine biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service in La Jolla. \"We've provided a lot of bird protections so now we're getting a lot of birds.

Here is a summary from the Wikipedia: Jungle article.The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word jangala (Sanskrit: जङ्गल), meaning uncultivated land. Although the Sanskrit word might refer to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense \"tangled thicket\" while others have argued that a cognate word in Hindi did refer to forests. The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used to refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the unkempt tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.Tropical forests are commonly lumped in with the term \"jungle.\" But as I have pointed out in previous posts, tropical forests are usually open and easily traversed due to the canopy blocking nearly all of the sunlight.

Shortly after the United States declared war on Mexico in May 1846, Brigadier Stephen Watts Kearny was tasked with conquering Mexico’s northern provinces, New Mexico and California. While Kearny demonstrated his considerable gift for administrative command with his acquisition of the New Mexican territory, he faced a more difficult task in California. Expecting a show of force from the Mexican Californios, Kearny set out west from New Mexico. Upon reaching California, Kit Carson intercepted him and his men, who informed him the territory had been taken by American settlers in the Bear Flag Revolt. Kearny sent 200 of his men back to New Mexico with the news and continued forward with one-third of his force. Unfortunately, the success of the revolt had been exaggerated and, before reaching their destination, Kearny and his men encountered a group of Californios intent on keeping more U.S. troops out of their homeland. In the subsequent Battle of San Pasqual, 19 of Kearny’s men and an untold number of Californios lost their lives. Initially, the dead were buried where they fell, but by 1874 the remains had been removed to the San Diego Military Reservation. Eight years later, the bodies were again reinterred at what is now Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. In 1922, the San Diego chapter of the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West had a large boulder brought from the battlefield and placed at the gravesite with a plaque affixed that lists the names of the dead."},

This is a species of the genus of Heliconiaceae and the family of Heliconia. This particular plant is growing the Costa Rican jungle. There are currently about 100 different species of Heliconia. Here is a description of the family from Wikipedia: Heliconia.These herbaceous plants range from 0.5 to nearly 4.5 meters (1.5–15 feet) tall depending on the species. The simple leaves of these plants are 15–300 cm (6 in-10 ft). They are characteristically long, oblong, alternate, or growing opposite one another on non-woody petioles often longer than the leaf, often forming large clumps with age. Their flowers are produced on long, erect or drooping panicles, and consist of brightly colored waxy bracts, with small true flowers peeping out from the bracts. The growth habit of heliconias is similar to Canna, Strelitzia, and bananas, to which they are related.The flowers can be hues of reds, oranges, yellows, and greens, and are subtended by brightly colored bracts. The plants typically flower during the wet season. These bracts protect the flowers; floral shape often limits pollination to a subset of the hummingbirds in the region."},

There is a Wikipedia entry for the Great Curassow:The great curassow (Crax rubra) (Spanish: hocofaisán, pavón norteño) is a large, pheasant-like bird from the Neotropical rainforests, its range extending from eastern Mexico, through Central America to western Colombia and northwestern Ecuador. Male birds are black with curly crests and yellow beaks; females come in three colour morphs, barred, rufous and black. These birds form small groups, foraging mainly on the ground for fruits and arthropods, and the occasional small vertebrate, but they roost and nest in trees. This species is monogamous, the male usually building the rather small nest of leaves in which two eggs are laid. This species is threatened by loss of habitat and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as \"vulnerable\".This is likely one of the more unusual birds I have seen the wild. We arrived in Costa Rica in the middle of the night and it was surprising to arise the next morning and find out that we were deep in a dry desert. During the dry season, there is practically no rain on the northwest coast of the country. Most of the trees lose their leaves and the ground is very dry, the grass has turned brown and the shrubs are mostly desiccated. Of course, I felt quite at home in the desert was happy to see the cactus and other desert plants. The image above shows a portion of the beach and between high and low tides.

One of the advantages of being on the West Coast is that the sunsets over the ocean. When I lived in Panama, the isthmus is oriented from west to east. So the sun sets over the mountains. But in Costa Rica, the ocean is on the west side of the country. So we had gorgeous sunsets out over the ocean. Of course, we eventually got into the jungle and you couldn't see the sunset at all.After having lived in the jungle for two years, I very much appreciated the variety of plants and animals. In our recent visit to Costa Rica, I relived some of my earlier jungle experiences. One of the most impressive was seeing the variety of animals and plants. There is a wet and a dry season in the jungles. Whatever the season, there are always beautiful flowers almost everywhere you look. In the desert, I appreciate the flowers because they are relatively rare, usually small, and difficult to spot. In the jungle, the opposite is exactly the case.

Over one million of these typewriters were produced and sold mainly to the home market. Here is a description of the Oliver Typewriter Company from the Wikipedia article:The Oliver Typewriter Company had begun operating in 1895, with its headquarters on the ninth floor of a building on the corner of Clark and Randolph Street in Chicago. In 1896, manufacturing moved from Iowa to Woodstock, Illinois, when the City of Woodstock donated a vacant factory once used by the Wheeler and Tappan Company on the condition that the Oliver Typewriter Company remain there at least five years. Manufacturing was divided into six departments: type bar, carriage, assembly, tabulators and adjustment, inspection, and an aligning room. The company's headquarters moved to the Oliver Building, now a Chicago landmark on the National Register of Historic Places, when it was completed in 1907. Starting in 1899, the company established sales networks by encouraging customers to become local distributors. This method of marketing relied on word of mouth and emphasized sales made directly to neighbors (door-to-door) and, after 1905, sales on credit. In response to increased competition in the late 1910s, however, the company eliminated its network of local salesman and used the resulting savings in commissions to reduce the typewriter's $100 ($1,400 in 2017) price by half. Sales increased and, at its peak, the company's labor force of 875 was producing 375 machines daily.Some time ago, I was with one of my grandchildren and ran across a photo of a typewriter. On a whim, I ask my grandson if he knew what the machine was. He had no idea and had never seen a typewriter in his life.

It was a silver mining town approximately 90 miles (140 km) south-southwest of Salt Lake City, Utah. This area was considered part of the Tintic Mining District and also produced bismuth, copper, gold, and lead. Settlement began with the first mining strikes here in 1869. Silver City was inhabited until 1930 after the mines ran out. Jesse Knight, known as the \"Mormon Wizard\" for his ability to find ore easily, decided to build a smelter in Silver City because it had the flattest ground in all of the Tintic Mining District. Silver City had several mines in 1890, but the mines hit water and were abandoned. Now there is nothing left other than a few holes where mines were, and a number of tailings piles. It is interesting how quickly the desert takes over and the cement walls of the smelter take on the patina of the desert. When I view something as strange as this ruin spread over acres of land, I have a tendency to view the entire subject as an abstract. Here, the walls of the smelter have lost their identity as a human artifact and have become organic.Sunsets in Florida are quite different than the ones we experience here in the mountains of Utah.

Consequently, a number of species have declined drastically and are under threat of extinction due to logging and deforestation.The article goes on to explain shelf fungi,Bracket fungi, or shelf fungi, are among the many groups of fungi that comprise the division Basidiomycota. Characteristically, they produce shelf- or bracket-shaped or occasionally circular fruiting bodies called conks that lie in a close planar grouping of separate or interconnected horizontal rows. Brackets can range from only a single row of a few caps, to dozens of rows of caps that can weigh several hundred pounds. They are mainly found on trees (living and dead) and coarse woody debris, and may resemble mushrooms. Some form annual fruiting bodies while others are perennial and grow larger year after year. Bracket fungi are typically tough and sturdy and produce their spores, called basidiospores, within the pores that typically make up the undersurface.I have always been fascinated by fungi, especially shelf fungi and mushrooms.

It was made of cast aluminum. Here is a description of the item from the Smithsonian National Museum of American History website.By the late 19th century, many American workers were paid in cash. Putting together packets with precisely the right bills and coins was a tedious task. In the 1890s, Edward J. Brandt, a cashier at the Bank of Watertown in Watertown, Wisconsin, invented a machine that could dispense change automatically. The machine dispenses change in amounts between 1 cent and 99 cents. It has eight channels across the front, three for pennies, one for nickels, two for dimes, one for quarters and one for 50-cent pieces. Above and behind the channels is an array of 99 plastic keys, numbered from 1 to 99. Pressing another key, marked \"5,\" releases five pennies. On the right are keys marked 10, 25, 25 and 100 that give change for these amounts. The entire coin holder can be removed from the mechanism for storage of coins. Pushing down a key moves a bar that pushes coins from a channel into a compartment with a trap door at its base. Pushing the trap door back releases change into the hand. A mark on the front and the back of the machine reads reads: BRANDT AUTOMATIC CASHIER. A mark on a brass plate on the back of the machine reads: PATENTED (/) JULY 11, 1899. . . (/) DEC. 12, 1916 (/) 48184 93421 10014 PATENTS PENDING (/) T.M.Reg.U.S.Pat.Off.

{"title": "Knee Roots", "date": "Wednesday, March 22, 2017", "text": "One of the most fascinating aspects of a visit to a swamp are these plant formations called \"knee roots.\" They seem to grow in a number of different types of trees. Here is a description of Cypress knees:A cypress knee is a distinctive structure forming above the roots of a cypress tree of any of various species of the subfamily Taxodioideae. Their function is unknown, but they are generally seen on trees growing in swamps. Some scientists have thought they may help in oxygenation to the tree's roots or assist in anchoring the tree in the soft, muddy soil.Technically, they are called pneumatophores. Here is a further description of their development. Pneumatophores are erect roots that are some form of upward appendage or extension of the underground root system. Because these roots are exposed at least part of the day and not submerged underwater, the root system can obtain oxygen in an otherwise anaerobic substrate.This particular article, entitled, \"Guide to the Mangroves of Singapore, How Plants Cope in the Mangroves, further explains:In Bruguiera and Ceriops the horizontal roots growing just below the soil surface periodically grow vertically upwards then immediately loop downwards to resemble a bent knee. By repetition, a single horizontal root develops a series of knees at regular intervals. The aerial portions (knees) of these roots help in aeration of the whole root which because it spreads so widely, improves anchorage in the unstable mud.I have always been impressed with the adaptation of plants to the dry deserts of the world, I guess I am learning about areas that have a little more water."},

{"title": "There is beauty all around", "date": "Monday, March 20, 2017", "text": "This flower-like cluster will turn into a pinecone. Pinecones have their own beauty, but how many of us have noticed these clusters? These are actually male pinecones. Here is an explanation of the process from Pennsylvania State University.One of the most fascinating things i found out about pine trees is their reproductive methods. Unlike most trees which flower in order to reproduce, conifer trees (all trees that produce cones for reproduction) actually have two different kinds of cones, males and females. The male cones, which are much smaller than female cones, are responsible for spreading mass amounts of pollen to the wind. If you are a Pennsylvania native, you have no doubt walked outside in the spring only to find everything covered in a thin layer of yellow dust. This is pollen released from the male cones looking for unfertilized female cones. As for the females, they begin as hard, tightly compacted cones with unfertilized seeds safe between closed scales. When the female cones begin growing, the scales open up slightly to allow the males pollen to reach the seed and begin the fertilization process. The scales close back up, and for the next three years they remain closed as the seeds inside grow and reach maturity. After three years, the fully grown female pinecones re-open and allow the fully grown seeds to be taken by the wind or animal in order to find soil in which it can germinate and grow into a pine tree sprout. When we saw these male pinecones, we also saw that our car was covered with pollen. I picked one of these up off of the ground and showed it to my two-year-old granddaughter and ask her what that was. Although she was only two years old she immediately said that it came from a pine tree. Some of us notice what is going on around us and others do not."},

{"title": "Alligators all around", "date": "Friday, March 10, 2017", "text": "When you go to visit relatives in Florida or Georgia, one thing that you have to see is alligators in the wild. The alligator or Alligator mississipiensis is native to only America and China. All other reptiles that look like this are usually crocodiles. But alligators live in the United States and American crocodiles live only in Central and South America. This particular alligator was swimming in a pond and chasing ducks. Here is a quote from the Wikipedia article about alligators telling how big they get.An average adult American alligator's weight and length is 360 kg (790 lb) and 4.0 m (13.1 ft), but they sometimes grow to 4.4 m (14 ft) long and weigh over 450 kg (990 lb). The largest ever recorded, found in Louisiana, measured 5.84 m (19.2 ft). The Chinese alligator is smaller, rarely exceeding 2.1 m (6.9 ft) in length. In addition, it weighs considerably less, with males rarely over 45 kg (99 lb).We used to grow wisteria as an ornamental and slightly unusual plant but when we came to Georgia, we found out that it is quite common and grows wild on the trees all over the area around Augusta. In fact, it is considered a weed in some cases. There are eight different species of wisteria and there is quite a complex taxonomy for the plant. Here is a quote from the Wikipedia article:The botanist Thomas Nuttall said he named the genus Wisteria in memory of Dr. Caspar Wistar (1761–1818). Questioned about the spelling later, Nuttall said it was for \"euphony,\" but his biographer speculated that it may have something to do with Nuttall's friend Charles Jones Wister, Sr., of Grumblethorpe, the grandson of the merchant John Wister. (Some Philadelphia sources state that the plant is named after Wister.) As the spelling is apparently deliberate, there is no justification for changing the genus name under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. However, some spell the plant's common name \"wistaria\", and is decisively for the \"wistaria\" spelling. Genetic analysis shows Callerya, Afgekia and Wisteria to be each other's closest relatives and quite distinct from other members of the tribe Millettieae. Both have eight chromosomes.We are very impressed with the flowers but, of course, we do not have to control its growth in our yard in Utah."},

The mines piped in water for industrial use, but residents had to buy drinking water for ten cents a gallon.Mines in the area around Mammoth produced ore, silver, and gold.

The first was the most difficult to find. It is called Knightsville and was a mining town in the late 1800s. This image shows the remains of the large schoolhouse that are located on a hill above the rest of the town. Quoting from Wikipedia:Knightsville is a ghost town located in the East Tintic Mountains on the northern slope of Godiva Mountain, approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) east of Eureka, in the northeastern corner of Juab County in central Utah, United States. A silver mining camp, Knightsville was established and operated as a company town by local mining entrepreneur Jesse Knight. The town was inhabited from 1896 until approximately 1940.It is interesting how quickly the desert takes over and even the cement ruins start to disappear. Here is a little bit of the history of Knightsville.Jesse Knight came to the Tintic Mining District in 1896, with little money and no previous mining knowledge or experience.[2] Against the advice of experienced geologists, he sank a mine shaft that quickly reached a rich body of ore. In response to those who had doubted, he named it the Humbug Mine. Opening about a half dozen mines in the east Tintic area, Knight became one of the region's richest mine owners. His membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was conspicuous in an industry dominated by non-Mormons, and his successes brought him the nickname \"the Mormon Mining Wizard\".[3] Knight disapproved of the drunkenness and other vices of the typical mining camp lifestyle. He decided to build his own model town to house the miners near the Humbug Mine.[4] He started Knightsville by having 20 houses built on Godiva Mountain.[2] He soon expanded to 65 homes[3] and two boarding houses.[2] There were stores, churches, hotels, and a post office.[4] But Knightsville became known as \"the only mining camp in the United States without a saloon\"; as the landowner Knight would not permit a saloon to operate in town.[3]"},

There is almost a saturation of the media promoting Utah's natural wonders as a tourist destination and millions of people, heeding the advertising, flock to the National Parks and Monuments in such great numbers that there a danger that their popularity will destroy the very objects of their adoration. At the same time, the entire state seems to resist adding any further \"protection\" to areas that are even more vulnerable. In the past few years, two huge areas of the state have been added to the roster of National Monuments, both bitterly opposed by some of the residents of the state.As an example, in 2006 there were 2,589,250 visitors to Zion National Park in south-central Utah. By 2016, that number had grown to 4,317,028, just in that one National Park. Tourism is booming. The Utah Tourism Industry Association statistics for the Fall of 2016 show spending by tourists in Utah to be $8.17 billion dollars and 8.370 total visits were made to Utah's five National Parks. Despite this obvious incentive, the State of Utah seems to be turning its back on taking further advantage of this huge state benefit. Much of this money comes from people who live outside the state and do not require state supported services.The opposition to the newer National Monuments seems entirely focused on the narrow issues of the expansion of activities that are not calculated to benefit the state at all, such as increased coal mining while alternative energy options are growing.

I thought it was interesting how closely the color and texture of their coats matched the ground around where they were hiding. They were all along the trails and we saw them in bunches of six or seven at a time."},

But I doubt that anyone else saw the same image. Most of those who were in the area were undoubtedly focusing on the birds. Oh yes, there are a lot of birds in this photo."},

Here is a photo at the Gilbert Water Ranch Riparian Preserve. We were walking around in shirt sleeves and taking photos in the sunshine. Later this week when we return to Provo, I will post a shot of our yard or some other appropriate place. I do love the desert, but I also love the snow, ice and mountains. Scenes of snow appear to be monochromatic. Unless the light is just right, the white of the snow overpowers the darker areas of the scene and most of the color of the trees and brush look black. Taking a photo such as this one also requires the photographer (me) to stand outside in the freezing cold. The danger here is that the camera equipment becomes too cold to operate properly and also that a return to a warm house will cause condensation on the lens and inside the camera.In this shot, I liked the contrast between the snow and the branches of the trees."},

Once, when I was very young, my father got a huge pile of wood to feed the fireplace in the winter. The wood came from a local box factory. Most of the wood was unseasoned pine and burned very quickly with very little heat, but once and while there would be a knot in the wood and the oil from the knot would burn longer and hotter. I began to wonder how many pieces of wood were there in that huge pile. So, I got a pencil and began numbering the pieces. I don't remember the number but it was very large for a young child. For years afterward, I would find pieces of wood with numbers to remind me of my early curiosity about large numbers.One of the benefits of visiting the low deserts of Arizona during the winter is that there are some spectacular flowers. Orchid trees were first found in Hong Kong and all of the plants all over the world come from one tree in the Hong Kong Botanical Garden. My daughter has a large, very beautiful tree growing in her backyard."},

With flashlights and headlamps, it is not that uncommon that we will find ourselves hiking at night. In the low deserts around the Salt River Valley in Arizona, we would hike at night to avoid the intense heat of the desert. In the mountains, we hike at night to avoid the same intense sunlight and heat of the high mountains. Hiking at night has its rewards, we get to see both the sunset and sunrise. My latest night-time hike was the climb up Mount Timpanogos. I am sure I will have additional opportunities to hike in the dark in the future."},

We have been treated to a series of storms that have come a few days apart, leaving almost no time for the existing snow to melt before new snow is laid down. If this continues, we will start to have a difficult time piling all the snow where it doesn't interfere with the roads and walkways. I realize that this amount of snow would be nothing compared to some places with lake-effect snow, but here it is quite unusual considering the comments of long-time residents."},

The reflection of the sun in the pool gives and unworldly aspect to this view of the Norris Geyser Basin. The temperature was close to freezing and every hot spring had a visible plume. Most of Park facilities were closed for the season so we had an uncrowded view of the geysers and pools."},

The towns in the distance are American Fork and Lehi with Eagle Mountain is the far distance. This part of the climb is a narrow avalanche chute. The very steep trail zig-zags back and forth across this narrow ravine filled with loose rock. It is one of the more difficult stretches of the whole climb. What is surprising is how high you have to climb to get to the top. I have climbed much higher than the top of Timpanogos, but there are few very high mountains such as this where you can look directly down into the city."},

We love walking around with the crowds of people and viewing the displays and enjoying the spirit of the Christmas season. This is a special time of year and we look forward to celebrating the birth of our Savior Jesus Christ and remembering the stories of his birth and life.We have had an interesting weather year so far. It was warm until late in the Fall and only one major snowstorm so far. Timpanogos has been covered in snow quite a few times, but the snow has melted on the west side in between snow storms. Right now, it is covered in snow and it looks like it might stay until Spring. There is another big snowstorm forecasted and we might be able to use our newly purchased snowshoes by next week.You could get caught up in the color and texture of the sandstone on the Colorado Plateau, but what is most evident is the layers of rock laid down over millions of years and then eroded away into the fantastic array of shapes. None of these areas is very inviting to permanent living, but they are very interesting to visit. This happens to be the Needles section of Canyonlands National Park in southern Utah."},

As a city dweller, you can think of this as a 50 story building, estimating about ten feet for each floor. I think the tallest building in Utah right now is the 26 floor Wells Fargo Center. So this rock formation is twice as tall. There are many buildings in the United States taller than 50 stories.

In Yellowstone National Park, you can get a sizable fine for just walking on a thermal formation even if you don't get injured or die. In one case, someone fell into a hot pool and his body was entirely dissolved by the acids in the water before any recovery could be made.

The weather along the Wasatch Front is more interesting and variable than Mesa and that alone is a good reason to be here.

The snow is piling up rather rapidly and I suspect that I will be out shoveling some driveways pretty soon. People ask me how I like the cold weather compared to our home in Mesa. The hot lower desert has some different challenges but I like the snow just fine and don't mind the cold all that much."},

Goblin Valley has also been the scene of a recent controversy regarding some vandalism when a visitor pushed over one of the formations and documented the destruction on YouTube. Fortunately, the perpetrator was arrested and later convicted. The incident highlights the delicate balance between allowing free access to such natural wonders and the damage done by that access."},

Here is one of those valleys. It may look like snow on the ground, but it is salt. These valleys are impressive in the silence and solitude. They are obviously not a prime place for future development and they are not scenic enough to ever be considered to be a national park or monument. Subsequently, they are a nice place to visit."},

There are also some Cylindropuntia bigelovii or teddy bear cholla in the background. In some place in the Arizona Sonora Desert you can hardly walk without being in danger of spines from these lovely plants. The spines are barbed and in some cases, if you get stuck, it will take a strong pull with a pair of pliers to get the spines out. That is not a pleasant experience."},

This view of the rock is only visible from the Fremont Saddle at the end of a relatively short, but steep, trail into the rugged interior of the Superstition Mountain Wilderness Area.

{"title": "Summer Flowers for the Fall", "date": "Tuesday, November 8, 2016", "text": "I have thousands and thousands of photographs many of which are of flowers. The usual flower photo is iconic. It shows the lovely flowers with perfect lighting and most frequently a single bloom unless it is a bouquet. But flowers are living plants and not all plants are studio ready. My flowers are not always sitting in a studio or available under optimal lighting conditions. Sometimes the days are cloudy or the lighting may not be optimal. Here I like the color and the mass of flowers. I see the beauty regardless of the conditions of the photo. I also see the form and texture which changes every minute as the light changes. Computer assisted digital photography has almost completely eliminated reality from photos and movies.Sometimes the details of the photo are not as important as the patterns shown in the final image. This metal sculpture was outlined against the clouds and all detail was lost in the contrasting image. I find the pattern more interesting that enhancing the image to show the detail of the column. I usually see these patterns in rocks and landscapes, but here I found this one in Toronto, Canada."},

Had I not gone downtown, I would have left and never felt the need to return. But there were some interesting things and some beauty in the downtown area of the city. Yesterday, in driving around Utah Valley, the polar opposite of Toronto, I saw two bicycle riders stopped by the police for some reason or another. I was reminded of this when I saw this bicycle signal in Toronto. I think of all the years I rode a bike and it never occurred to me that anyone was interested in how or where I rode.This image of a large apartment building in Toronto, Canada is the antithesis of my landscape photos of the vast distances on the Colorado Plateau. I can't really imagine what it would be like to live in an apartment in a building like this. The view from these windows must be impressive, but the idea of living in a huge pile of boxes does not impress me at all. I was attracted by the nearly abstract pattern made by the blocks of red and black. If you forget that it is a building and simply look at the design, it is interesting in that way."},
{"title": "The Bow Hunter", "date": "Saturday, November 5, 2016", "text": "Scattered around the canyons of Utah and Arizona, petroglyphs are fairly common. Occasionally, you see them on isolated rocks. In some areas, such as Nine Mile Canyon in Utah, they are found all along the canyon walls for many miles. This hunting scene includes a rather thin hunter with a large bow hunting big horn sheep and what is probably a buffalo. Although we associate the herds of buffalo with the Great Plains, it is obvious from this petroglyph that Utah had herds of buffalo in prehistoric times. Today, there are two rather substantial herds of buffalo in Utah; Antelope Island in the Great Salt Lake and the Henry Mountains in southcentral Utah.Almost all of the commercial photography we see today has been carefully selected for a uniformly bright and clear view of the subject. In real life, as opposed to the fantasy world of commercial photography, or views are usually not so clear and unrestricted. From the standpoint of publication, this photo would be uniformly rejected by anyone trying to \"sell\" a photograph. But I find this type of image more interesting than the usual promotional landscape. I was standing next to this roaring stream, but due to the thickness of the vegetation, I was extremely limited in my ability to get a \"clear shot\" of the water. In addition to the obstruction of the trees, I was standing quite a distance from the water with a steep, very muddy bank between me and the open edge of the stream. It was also a completely overcast day with threatening rain. All of that, unfortunately, does not come through the photo, but nevertheless, the texture and color of the water and the contrasting color and texture of the trees is what this image is all about."},

The plants have been used for thousands of years to treat asthma, hay fever, and congestion from colds.

{"title": "Ripples", "date": "Saturday, October 29, 2016", "text": "These waves or ripples in the sand are caused by the saltation of the sand grains when blown by the wind. The distance between the ridges is dependent on the average size of the sand grains and the average speed of the wind.

This is a relatively small area of sand dunes caused by the wind funnelling through a narrow but shallow canyon. This was the day before the opening of The Hunt in Utah and every campsite was filled and the roar of trucks and ATVs was almost constant, but there is little the can do but leave tracks that are very quickly erased by the wind. To give you some perspective here, the dot on the dune is an ATV and the smaller dots are people. I usually try to avoid having people in my landscapes but this was an exception and the essence of this beautiful place.The early morning sun hit the canyon wall just right to show the texture and highlight the color of the sandstone. The wind was blowing and it was rather chilly standing out in the half-dark morning waiting for the sun to come up but the wait was worth the cold and dark. This is southern Utah at its best and finest."},

What is not allowed under the laws of the United States is to hasten the process in any way. There have been a couple of notable cases where natural features have been destroyed recently and the consequences for the perpetrators have been severe."},

Canyonlands is one of the last great wilderness areas of the United States, not because it is so remote, but because it is so difficult to get into and explore.

This is not a composite photo. The water in the foreground is a waterpocket on the sandstone that catches and holds rainwater for a period of time. The big rock is the slickrock where these pockets are located. The rest of the photo is the actual background."},
{"title": "Slickrock", "date": "Wednesday, October 19, 2016", "text": "First of all \"slickrock\" is a misnomer. Slickrock is rough sandstone and not slick at all, but the term comes from the fact that the land is difficult to traverse on a horse with iron shoes. There are huge areas of the Colorado Plateau that are covered with this almost level, exposed sandstone with little vegetation. The slickrock sheds water and contributes to the incidence of huge flash floods in the canyons even with very little rainfall. For me it is a joy to walk over because it is relatively smooth and open. Some people seem to get lost in this kind of country, but I can't imagine how, you can almost always see for miles."},
{"title": "Across the Canyons", "date": "Tuesday, October 18, 2016", "text": "This country is very deceptive. Between where I am standing and the butte you can see in the distance, there are at least two major and very deep canyon systems. If you were to try to walk towards the buttes and cliffs in the distance, you would have to negotiate the cliffs of the canyons beginning in about 200 feet towards the low rocks in the foreground."},
{"title": "More Canyonland Rocks", "date": "Monday, October 17, 2016", "text": "As I walk around on the slickrock, the view changes every few steps. If I were to take every photo offered by the changes, I would stay almost in the same place all day. but here is an example of the way the landscape can change. The previous photo I uploaded was only a few feet away from this one. You can see how rapidly the tranquil scene evolved as I walked along the slickrock.Landscape designers sometimes go to great lengths to create natural looking environments surrounding a building or a house. In my opinion natural processes always do a better job. I could take endless photos of rock formations highlighting the color and texture of the rocks, the plants and the sky. Canyonlands National Park is a place of endless views but it also comes back down to reality in the more focused and limited tableaus arranged by nature."},
{"title": "Bryce Canyon Views", "date": "Sunday, October 16, 2016", "text": "Bryce Canyon National Park in Southern Utah is one of the major National Parks in terms of the number of visitors. However, it is interesting that all of the visitors are concentrated along the rim of the huge mesa that forms the walls of the amphitheaters that are called a canyon. We find the the minute you leave the rim and go anywhere else in the National Park area, the number of people drops off dramatically. It is somewhat sad that the major impact of most of Utah's National Parks is now people rather than scenery. If you want solitude in Utah, visit the Parks in January or February, if you can get through the snow."},

I hope to see some cactus at the Desert Botanical Garden while we are there. These are Cardon cactus from Mexico. They look similar to Saguaro cactus but they are actually larger. This is a photo out of my archives from a few years ago.A cold front will move in with some mountain snow and then it warms up again and all the snow melts. This cycle keeps up for a month or so until the temperatures finally fall to the point where the snow level comes down to the valley. Right now we are waiting for another big storm to come in, but it probably moved off to the north. Watching the seasons change is like a very old movie with a very slow story line and a very familiar plot."},

How many of us today live in a house that has these kinds of architectural elements? The Darwin D.

I can only wonder why the very large homes in the neighborhood did not take a lesson from what Wright had created?"},
{"title": "Some Really Strange Petroglyphs", "date": "Thursday, October 13, 2016", "text": "If you look closely, you can see some rather strange figures in this crowded collection of petroglyphs. I think the one with the four large fingers and toes and the elongated ghost figure are some of the more unusual ones I have seen. There are several other designs that also seem unusual such as the long figure with the circle at each end, one filled and one open. It is interesting to speculate what the ancients were trying to convey with this rock art."},
{"title": "A Pleasant Drive", "date": "Wednesday, October 12, 2016", "text": "The only way to really see the beauty in Arizona and Utah is to get off the main roads and head back into the countryside on dirt roads. Of course, in many cases, such drives turn into adventures and so it is well to be prepared with a high clearance 4-wheel drive vehicle. But in any event, the drives turn out to be worth the effort. This road eventually defeats even our desire to risk high centering our vehicle on a rock.It is difficult to focus on one individual leaf when you are confronted with walls of color. The intensity of the Fall colors depend on subtle differences in temperature and the length of daylight. According to the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry these changes are caused by the breakdown of the chlorophyll in the leaves. To quote from this article,But in the fall, because of changes in the length of daylight and changes in temperature, the leaves stop their food-making process. The chlorophyll breaks down, the green color disappears, and the yellow to orange colors become visible and give the leaves part of their fall splendor. At the same time other chemical changes may occur, which form additional colors through the development of red anthocyanin pigments. Some mixtures give rise to the reddish and purplish fall colors of trees such as dogwoods and sumacs, while others give the sugar maple its brilliant orange. The autumn foliage of some trees show only yellow colors. Others, like many oaks, display mostly browns. All these colors are due to the mixing of varying amounts of the chlorophyll residue and other pigments in the leaf during the fall season.Hmm. for some reason understanding all that does not increase the pleasure of looking at the beautiful colors."},

Now that Fall has come, I have been so busy that I have not taken the time to go for a walk up the canyon, but I think about it a lot. When we decided to move to Provo, I thought about the nice walks we could take up the canyon and that has been the case, but not as frequently as I imagined.Oceans and beaches are iconic. But there are many places along the oceans where there are rocks and cliffs rather than sandy beaches. You don't usually see romantic views of couples struggling along the rocks and these cliffs are not usually featured in ads for cruises. I find the rocks and cliffs a lot more interesting than the sand. You just have to watch where you step and climb around a little to enjoy the views."},

{"title": "Working Our Way to the Top", "date": "Wednesday, October 5, 2016", "text": "Unless you are content to stay on the well-worn trails in the high mountains, you will find yourself scrambling up the sides of the mountains and picking out a trail over rock falls and talus slopes. Mountains, by their very nature, are high and steep. I often find myself in situations where the exposure to falls involves hundreds, perhaps thousands, of feet. It is usually easier to climb through the trees because the rocks are more stable, but it is also hard to avoid the loose rocks of the talus slopes if you want to make any progress. On this occasion, we did not make the top of the ridge, but that was not our objective in any case."},

Some other parts of the United States are famous for their Fall display of colors, but here in the Wasatch Mountains, you have to travel a bit and go looking for the color. Because of the timing of the storms coming in at this season, finding the leaves when they are in full color is rather tricky. We caught some beautiful days in between the storms and preserved a few memories.Our visits to the high mountains are about to end with huge Winter-like storms. In just one week or so, many of the leaves on the hillsides had already fallen. The highest aspen trees were just turning yellow and there may be one more visit if the snow stays off the roads for a while. The air was clean and crisp and the smell of winter was just beginning."},

It is as if you were living in the color rather than just seeing it from a distance. Here the contrast between the dark trunks of the trees in the shadow and the colors of the leaves gives a sense of standing in the forest and experiencing the light."},
{"title": "Early Fall in the Wasatch", "date": "Saturday, October 1, 2016", "text": "Just a very short drive up a dirt road just east of our home takes us into the high country of the Wasatch Mountains. The colors of the leaves are remarkable and the air is crisp with scent of the newly fallen leaves. The rain and snow this past week was just enough to keep down the dust but not enough to leave the road muddy. We saw a number of trees that had fallen down on the road in the past week since our earlier trip up the mountain."},

This photo is on a ridge high above Pittsburg Lake and very close to the Alta Ski Resort. But this is on the American Fork Canyon side of the mountains. All of this area was extensively mined and evidence of the old mines can be seen if you know what to look for and where to look."},
{"title": "Pittsburg Lake, Utah", "date": "Thursday, September 29, 2016", "text": "Considering the time and effort it takes to reach this isolated lake in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, you would think you were far from civilization, but just over that ridge are two of the largest and most developed ski resorts in the state: Alta and Snowbird. You can see the top of the Snowbird lift if you look carefully and were looking in a different direction than that shown in the photo. Knowing that we were just a jump over from the ski resorts did not make this location any less remote. I am also careful to avoid showing all the people who were in the area at the same time. Oh well, so much for photos showing any reality."},
{"title": "A Corner of Goblin Valley", "date": "Wednesday, September 28, 2016", "text": "In digging back through my huge archive of photos, I decided it had been a while since I re-visited Southern Utah. Well, technically, almost all of Utah is southern to me here in Provo, but this is part that is considered to be the canyonlands of the Colorado Plateau. This is Goblin Valley. When I first visited this beautiful place, it was at the end of a very long and dusty dirt road. There were no signs and no development of any kind. Eventually, the entire area became \"popular\" and became part of a Utah State Park. Now, the road is paved. There is a large campground with bathrooms and showers and there are lots and lots of tourists."},

Here is a description of the mountains from the Wikipedia article entitled appropriately, \"Henry Mountains.\"The Henry Mountains are located in the southeastern portion of the U.S. state of Utah and run in a generally north-south direction, extending over a distance of about 30 miles (50 km). They were named by Almon Thompson in honour of Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The nearest town of any size is Hanksville, Utah, which is north of the mountains. The Henry Mountains were the last mountain range to be added to the map of the 48 contiguous U.S. states (1872), and before their official naming by Powell, were sometimes referred to as the \"Unknown Mountains.\" In Navajo, the range is still referred to as Dził Bizhiʼ Ádiní (\"mountain whose name is missing\").The highest peaks in the range are over 11,000 feet. This is a view looking west from Highway 95 near Hite, Utah."},

This was the first real snow of the season, discounting a brief skiff of snow on the mountain tops with the last rain storm. The weather is supposed to warm up and I suppose that most of this new snow will melt rather quickly. But we are now in the season when the storms start coming down from the northwest and the snowpack in the mountains will not melt again until next Spring. We started dragging out our warm clothes and getting ready for more snow. It is an interesting experience to once again, in my old age, return to seasons after living for so many years in the low deserts of Arizona."},

This road and all the mountains are now covered with a couple of inches of new snow. The road turns into a muddy mess with rain or snow and we were fortunate to make our trip to the mountains before the storm came in. The leaves will have all fallen by the time the sun comes out and the road is passable unless it snows again and then it will be closed for the Winter.We saw this lovely arrangement of straw and pumpkins in front of a house down the road from ours. We live in a condo and I am quite sure they wouldn't like straw or pumpkins in the front yard. But we can enjoy what others put out for the world to see."},

I love to eat squash and pumpkins are just another variety of squash, actually Cucurbita pepo. There are few other varieties but the orange ones shown above are the ones most commonly associated with the holiday. From my perspective, using pumpkins for decoration and then throwing them away is a loss of perfectly good food. I would rather eat them than carve them."},

The weather didn't last and it was the next day when the storm arrived and likely covered much of this with snow. We realized when we got to this point on the Squaw Peak Road that we were only about three miles or so from our home in Provo although the drive was much further up the canyon.Slowly the warmth of Summer departs and the air has a decided chill. The first snow appears on the tops of the mountains and even though there are still a few days of warm weather, it is inevitable that the temperatures will fall and Winter will come. The snow on Mount Timpanogos did not last very many days, but a new storm is covering the mountain and the snow level is dropping to 7000 feet so there is likely a new blanket of snow that will wait until Spring to melt."},

You might want to click on this image to see it at a larger size.In the distance is Washington State's Olympic Peninsula. Judging by the size and quantity of driftwood on the shore of Vancouver Island, I suspect that this placid scene with almost no waves can change into huge waves from the storms of winter.

The summer greens turn to golden brown and we know that cold weather and perhaps some snow can't be far behind. The contrast between a green, recently mowed lawn and the wild grasses in untended fields are an analogy for our world. Somehow, even though green lawns are attractive, I like the fields better."},

When I was young, they were so common we used them as actual rugs on the floor. Today, they are considered museum pieces and high quality rugs sell for thousands of dollars. The design of the rugs and baskets speak directly to my soul. Some kinds of designs seem foreign to me, like those from the Far East, but I still have rugs and jewelry. I commonly wear a Navajo silver and turquoise belt buckle."},

The reality is far different. In 2015, there were 4,150, 217 visitors to the Park. Driving and parking in the Yosemite Valley are difficult to say the least and impossible most of the time during the summer months. I have experienced the same congestion in a number of other parks including Zion National Park, Arches National Park and Bryce National Park. Some of the National Parks, like Zion, have excluded vehicular traffic and vastly improved the parking and traffic issues, but even in Zion, when you have to wait in line to walk across the Virgin River, you lose all sense of beauty of the location. The worst congestion I have experienced recently in National Parks has been in Glacier National Park and Zion National Park. I have stayed away from some of my favorite areas, such as Arches National Park, simply because of the traffic congestion and parking problems."},

This is one of the Sierra Nevada in California. The sky was so blue that it was almost black, so the photo looks a little dark but that is how it looks when you are standing there. Also, with distance, the oxygen in the air turns all mountain scenes blue. Just like the sky is blue. So if you see a bright, mountain scene, the photo has been substantially altered."},

If you were standing in front of this waterfall, you would likely be unable to see the texture of the water. Rather than a rough surface, the water would appear to be a continuous stream. Which is the reality? Is this the reality of the waterfall or is the roaring, rushing water its reality? By capturing this image, I have chosen to carve out one moment of time and make it more important than the stream."},

The mission was built between 1783 and 1797 and was originally established in 1692 by Father Eusebio Francisco Kino. See Wikipedia: Mission San Xavier del Bac. Restoration of the structure was completed in the late 1900s. It is a lovely place visit and the Mission is still used weekly for church services.I do miss the cactus in the desert. Living in Utah, cactus plants are relatively rare. I always enjoyed the Spring season from March through June when the cactus were blooming the low desert around Mesa, Arizona. The trade off is the enjoyment of many lovely annuals here in Utah. But, in my opinion, none of them come close to the waxy beauty of the cactus flowers."},

It is estimated that over 5,000 people have perished going over Niagara Falls. See Wikipedia: List of objects that have gone over Niagara Falls. The first recorded person to survive going over the falls was Annie Edson Taylor, who went over the falls in a barrel in 1901.

Some of the photos I took were of the same subjects, but the sky and the falls were different. This photo is iconic and with the number of people at the Falls on any given day, there are probably millions of these photos out there. So why do I want to take an iconic photo? Well, I can always hope that my own photo is quite a bit different than the snapshots taken by the average tourist. Look at a few dozen or so photos of the Falls and see what you think."},

{"title": "The Rock Cairn", "date": "Saturday, September 10, 2016", "text": "When we are out hiking on unfamiliar trails, especially in the mountains or on the Colorado Plateau, we watch for piles of rocks, called cairns, that indicate a trail. There is also a pastime that involves trying to make piles of rocks and balance them. This image is likely the later since there were no trails on this beach. In some National Parks, I have seen signs telling tourists not to disturb the cairns because they are historic trail markers. I don't think this pile qualifies."},
{"title": "From Below the Covered Bridge", "date": "Friday, September 9, 2016", "text": "This is another photo of the same covered bridge in New England. The first shot did not show the dramatic location of the bridge so I walked down a path to the creek below the level of the bridge to take more photos.Most of the images of covered bridges are nostalgic, sort-of Currier and Ives, type of representations. But in reality, covered bridges were and are built to solve a problem with heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures. Because bridges are over water, the moisture from the river or stream tends to build up on the bridges as ice. The covered bridges were built to prevent the accumulation of ice and snow on the colder surface of the bridges. The reason for this this that there is no subsurface under the bridge and so it is cooling down from both the top and bottom. If you drive around where there are not covered bridges you will commonly see signs that say watch for ice on bridge."},

Once they turn to seed, they also make a feathery, beautiful array of parachute seeds. There are really a lot of different varieties of what we collectively call dandelions, but it doesn't really matter, they are all classified as noxious weeds. I guess I can claim that some of my best friends are noxious weeds."},

{"title": "The Summit of Mount Washington", "date": "Sunday, September 4, 2016", "text": "When you are walking or climbing to the top of a high mountain, you are usually watching your feet. As you climb it is very common that the summit can only be seen once you are actually on top or very close. On many mountains, the actual highest point is not overly obvious. I can think of several mountains where you have to wander around a bit and find the highest pile of rocks before you feel like you have actually reached the top. Mount Washington is no exception, but here, at least, there was a sign pointing out the top. In all fairness, I should point out that we drove our car to within a few dozen yards of the top of the mountain in this case."},
{"title": "High Mountain Tundra", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2016", "text": "High on the slopes of Mount Washington in New Hampshire, above the tree line, the vegetation changes to reflect the altitude and climate. The alpine tundra system, as it is called, consists primarily of sedge, rush and heath meadows and felsenmeer barrens. The treeline in the White Mountains is between 4,200 and 4,900 feet. I can compare that to the tree line I can see out my window on Mount Timpanogos from Utah Valley that is at about 10,600 feet. In driving up Mount Washington, I was impressed by the rapid change from thick forests to alpine tundra. These low plants are the \"forest\" of the high mountains."},

I see some important symbolism here, not only from the perspective given by the Temple, but as the principle of eternity affects our lives.A split rail fence requires no metal hardware at all. The whole thing is dependent on gravity to keep it together so it is remarkable how long they last. Although I do have to observe that many of the split rail fences you see are modern reconstructions. The first patent for barbed wire was issued in 1867, so the most common fence I saw in my childhood was barbed wire. We used to call it \"bobbed wire\" probably because we didn't know that the pokey parts were \"barbs.\" By the way, split rail fences are definitely more an eastern phenomena than they are in the West.Damselflies are similar to dragonflies. They are predatory and they eat mosquitos which makes them my friends. They are insects of the order of Odonata and the suborder of Zygoptera. There are damselfly fossils dating back more than 250 million years. Classification of the damselflies is currently being reorganized. This particular damselfly was buzzing around a small stream near the Sacred Grove on the Smith Family Farm in upper New York State."},

This particular farmhouse is near Whitehall, Vermont.The advantage of beginning a hike up a mountain before sunrise is the experience of watching the sun slowly highlight the mountains tops. We were well up Mount Timpanogos when the sun started to shine on the mountain tops and it was difficult to stop and take enough photos of the changes in the light and still keep going up the mountain with some urgency. The main reason for starting up the mountain so early was to avoid coming down during the heat of the day. Well, our tactic worked to some extent, we did get down in the middle of the afternoon, but we survived more from some cool breezes than from the timing of the hike. Fortunately, we had more than enough water, although I did lose a few pounds of water that I regained as soon as I had enough to drink."},

This is a relatively short hike from a large parking lot on the Alpine Loop that circles Mount Timpanogos but starting (or ending) in Provo Canyon and then connecting to American Fork Canyon.

This far south, the only remnants of a glacier are these small firn snow fields on the eastside of Mount Timpanogos. Some refer to these snowfields as a glacier, but they would have be made of ice and moving to qualify. Given the fact that this summer has been one of the hottest on record, even this small amount of snow will not persist for long. The huge piles of glacial moraine can be seen in the foreground and up on the next level above the lower cliff.

It was a beautiful day and there were crowds of people climbing the mountain. But for each person it a singular experience. It is an interesting experience to do something like this with your grandchildren. I sort-of ran out of oxygen about 11,000 feet but kept going to the top. This is the top ridge of the mountain look mostly north into the Salt Lake Valley. I could actually see my own house, if I looked the other direction, from here."},

As is sometimes the case the real flower looks fake and the fake flowers look real.When the trees in the mountains begin to grow, the winter snow deforms them downward. As the continue growing they curve upward to compensate for the pressure of the snow. This is one way you can always tell which direction is down when you are hiking in the mountains.

I don't think you will see that much moss in the Wasatch Mountains. We live in a semi-desert region and since we have lived here there has been a moderate to severe drought. So we don't see much water in the streams. Some of the larger creeks and rivers have water but that is about it.Have you ever dreamed of owning your own island? Did your dream include something like the one above or one a little bit larger? Perhaps yours had palm trees and warm breezes? But there is something about an island that starts me dreaming about exploring and uncharted wilderness. Technically, we all live on islands, i.e. land completely surrounded by water, it is just the size that makes the difference."},

This photo was taken while we were visiting Fundy National Park in New Brunswick.This is a sample of what passes for a trail in Utah. All of those rocks are loose and climbing is a task of maintaining your balance with a pack and at the same time trying to negotiate the places where the rocks aren't moving down the hill. In addition, the weather was hot, even this early in morning, and we were starting out at about the 8,000 foot level and climbing to more than 9,000 feet. On this particular trail, there was not one level section for more than a mile and half."},

You can see from the photo that the boat is crammed with people. There are several boats and they run at about 10 minute intervals. Everyone gets a thin plastic raincoat that is disposable and is recycled at the end of the ride. The attractions at the Falls are pricey but that doesn't stop thousands of visitors from around the world from standing in long lines to take the drenching ride."},

It is a place similar to Pike's Peak in Colorado with a lunch room, museum, weather station and a cog railway to the top. I had to keep reminding myself that Mount Washington was only 6,288 feet high, which is only slightly higher than where we live in Provo, Utah at about the 5,000 foot level along the Wasatch Mountains. For comparison, Pike's Peak is 14,115 feet high and when on top, you really feel the altitude. By the way, all those people are standing in line to have their picture taken on top of the mountain."},
{"title": "View from the top of Mount Washington", "date": "Saturday, August 6, 2016", "text": "This is not a view I associated with the eastern part of the United States. A road was built to the top of the mountain back in 1861 and then opened to the public as a toll road for tourists. It is still a toll road, but it is worth the trip. The road is almost completely paved except for about a mile or so near the top of the mountain. We drove to the top and compared to some of the very narrow and precipitous roads we have driven in the West, the road was quite tame. It is definitely a tourist destination and we had to wait in line for a considerable period of time to get our photograph taken. If you look back through my recent photos, you will see the one taken by another tourist of us at the top.We had an interesting discussion about the claims made by this sign. Mount Washington is the highest mountain east of the Mississippi River in the United States. It is marked by its long accessibility by way of a road all the way to the very top of the highest point. The weather there is truly terrible, but those of us who live in the West think that the severity is somewhat overrated. The fact is that there is a permanent weather station at the top of the mountain. Out here, we have hundreds, perhaps thousands, of higher mountains that have no similar weather stations. In the natural world, claims about maximums and minimums depend more on the ability to make recordings than they do on actual conditions.While standing very close to a huge waterfall, in this example Niagara Falls, you get an overpowering impression of the motion and confusion of the rushing water. But just a short distance away, in the foreground, you can see the quiet tranquility of the wild flowers. No matter how turbulent the times we live in, we can always find our own haven of peace and tranquility. For me, it has always been the sure knowledge I have of truthfulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the reality of his earthly mission as the Son of God."},

They built a log home and outbuildings where they resided for approximately seven years. In late 1825 they moved a few hundred feet south to their new frame home. Their son, Hyrum, had arranged to purchase the eighty acres of land surrounding the log home. Following his marriage to Jerusha Barden, in November of 1826, Hyrum and his wife resided in the log home. In the spring of 1829, Father and Mother Smith and their younger children returned to the log home where they lived with Hyrum’s family until the fall of 1830."},

To hike and then drive to Albion basin from here on trails and roads would be almost 50 miles and take the better part of a day.The Sonnenberg Gardens & Mansion State Historic Park is a an extensively preserved Victorian country estate located in Canandaigua, New York. The 50 acre estate has formal and informal gardens, the historic mansion above, the Lord and Burnham greenhouse complex and supposedly, views of Canandaigua Lake. We never did see the lake from the mansion or the estate, but the rest was remarkable. The mansion was built in 1887 and the surrounding gardens developed between 1902 and 1920. We took the opportunity to do an extensive tour of both the mansion and the surrounding gardens. I do think that living in this large mansion would have been more of a burden than an opportunity."},

They attract insects to the sticky appendages they have on their leaves and then when the insects get stuck, they dissolve all the nutrients in the bug. They are rather pretty plants altogether.If you like to walk, high in the Wasatch Mountains of Utah, you can find Pittsburg Lake. For such a remote spot, it is a quintessential destination for Utah. I really have to admit that it take some effort to get to this location. I won't say I was out of shape, but I could have used a few more hikes like this one to prepare. I am ready to go back again any time. Because of the loose rocks and dust, I would classify the trail to this lovely lake as among the worst short hikes I have experienced in my long years of hiking."},

We live across the street from the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest. Many of these roads are very rough and this is one of those. The road goes between the large rock on the left and the cliff on the right. You shouldn't think about what happens if there is another vehicle coming up the road towards this narrow section, but it does happen as this is a very heavily traveled road. One of the vehicles either has to move as close as possible to the cliff or back up. I might also mention that to the left the road drops off about 200 feet into a canyon. There is no shoulder."},

I sometimes pity those who plan out their trips with a daily agenda. We usually travel in a general direction for an unspecified time and see what we can find.

The Canal is 363 miles long and we drove along most of it as we drove from Albany to Buffalo. This image is a stretch of the Canal near Palmyra, New York. The Canal has 36 locks and an elevation differential of about 565 feet. The Canal is still used by commercial craft."},

This is one of the superb benefits of driving around on the back roads of the United States. This is The Sonnenberg Gardens and Mansion State Historic Park and it is worth going out of your way to see. One of the benefits of traveling (if there are any) is that we get to visit surprising places that were previously unknown to us. We do not travel with an agenda. We decide the next stop when we are done with each stop. In this case, we decided to visit the Buffalo Botanical Gardens in Buffalo, New York. The Gardens are based upon the famous Crystal Palace in Kew Gardens Palm House in England. It was an extraordinary experience and I will be sharing some of the highlights as I put up photos. Orchidaceae has about 28,000 currently accepted species distributed in 763 genera. Orchids comprise about 6% to 11% of all seed plants on the earth. There are now more than 100,000 hybrids and cultivars so you can imagine the variety."},

I have been intensely interested in Frank Lloyd Wright and his architectural work since the 6th grade when our teacher took us to listen to him speak at the Women's Club in Phoenix, Arizona. When we visited this gem in Buffalo, New York, we were impressed with the location. Interestingly, none of the surrounding houses are in any way distinguished or even noteworthy. This house built in about 1905 is timeless in its design. Quoting from the HillCumorah.org website:Come feel the Savior's love Experience one of the world's great outdoor theatrical productions. Each July, seven evening performances are presented on the beautiful Cumorah hillside next to the Visitors' Center. A beautiful story on an enormous 10 level stage, twelve-tower lighting, state-of-the-art sound system, Hollywood special effects, and a costumed cast of over 650 provide a truly spectacular show.Quoting further from the website:It all began in the early 1920's when a small group of missionaries from New York City gathered for the Cumorah Conference at the Joseph Smith Farm to celebrate Pioneer Day, the day when Brigham Young first entered the Salt Lake Valley in 1847.  In July of 1934, the conference was moved from the Farm to the Hill Cumorah. Today the Pageant, with its incredible staging, lighting, special effects and costuming is still carefully designed to keep its message of Jesus Christ's love for us both simple and pure.  The opening processional of the entire costumed cast through the audience is quite similar to the beginning of many of the great medieval pageants.We enjoyed three nights of watching the Pageant this year."},

Toronto, Canada is distinctive in its abundance of high-rise apartment islands and the downtown area has them in abundance. Most of my life, I have lived in very horizontal cities. Phoenix, Arizona is the polar opposite of Toronto. Size is not the issue. Toronto is only about half a populous as Phoenix, but has many, many times the number of high-rise buildings.

Here the earth was pushed up in a fold that stretches for over 100 miles. From space this feature looks like a long light-colored line and from most of the road, it looks like a low ridge. It is only when you walk into or drive into the unassuming hill that you begin to get an idea of its complexity. The reason it is called the Waterpocket Fold is because the tilted rock layers catch rainwater in profusion. The Fold is lined with narrow box canyons and slot canyons.

The rock formations are so from any normal landscape view, the confusion of images can be overwhelming. You can find yourself without the ability to focus on any one part of a scene. Your impression is that there are an abundance of details and no overall picture. At the same time, when you take a photo, you abstract part of the image into its constituent parts and fail to see the complex whole.It is hard to imagine what some of the petroglyphs in the Nine Mile Canyon in central Utah were supposed to represent. This was one of the more interesting examples. Unfortunately, this is also an example of the damage that is being done by thoughtless visitors. You can see some markings on the rock that are obviously newly added. the one dot to the extreme right is evidence of a bullet. We saw several sites that had been shot at multiple times. It is likely that the two marks near the head of this unusual petroglyph are also bullet marks. I think it is interesting that you can get five years in jail and a $250,000 fine for copying a video CD, but the penalties for defacing irreplaceable native art are hardly enforced and usually treated as misdemeanors."},

Most dirt roads take you to places where there are a lot fewer people than a mall on a weekend. I am mostly a dirt-road type of person. I haven't been to a mall on a weekend for as long as I can remember and I just drove up to this beautiful location on a very bad dirt road about a week ago.The dry climate of the Southwest is conducive to the preservation of wood and metal. In most parts of the United States, this fence would have long ago deteriorated and disappeared under a new layer of vegetation.

In the dark, trying to drive home, we got lost on the wrong road and ended up in the middle of the mountains many miles from where we needed to be. We had a long, dark drive home when we finally got turned around properly.Sometimes when you take a photo, the appearances can be deceiving. This unusual rock formation is called the Mummy. It is located in Nine Mile Canyon, right next to a huge natural gas well with a fenced compound. I had to crop the photo to get rid of the fence in the photo.

It comes from the Fremont tradition of art. It is a big panel. The Canyon is located in east central Utah, just north of Price. If the land had not been privatized early in Utah history and was not now full of oil wells and natural gas wells, it would be a prime candidate for a national park or monument. There is a clam that this is one of the sites with the most rock art in the United States, but there are other locations with similar collections.

Here the landscape draws you into the view of the spectacular rock formation in Kodachrome Basin State Park at the very southern edge of Utah."},
{"title": "Canyonlands Vista", "date": "Thursday, June 16, 2016", "text": "The vast distances involved in a photo such as this one always seem to have a blue cast. The reason is very simple. The light coming from the distant mountains is colored by the same process that makes the sky blue. You normally do not see the blue cast because the amount of air between you and any given object is relatively small. It is only when these distances are visible that the colors shift towards blue. This is Canyonlands National Park in southern Utah."},
{"title": "Pacific Coast of Vancouver Island", "date": "Wednesday, June 15, 2016", "text": "Of course the color here is predominantly blue. The wind was blowing onshore very hard and the spray from the waves was creating a light fog just off the shore. This is a contrast with the bright sunshine and beautiful colors of the landscape out my window today in the mountains of Utah."},
{"title": "Tidal Flat", "date": "Tuesday, June 14, 2016", "text": "At some places along the coast of Vancouver Island, the slope of the shore is so shallow that the tide change reveals almost a mile of flat sand. The change in the tide can be as much as 14 feet or 43. meters in some areas. It is very interesting to walk out to the edge of the ocean and look at all of the plants and animals left behind by the retreating water. The surface of the sand is firm and it is relatively easy to avoid the shallow tidal pools that remain. The tide comes back in rather quickly and so when the tide turns, it is a good idea to start walking towards the shore."},
{"title": "Seascape", "date": "Monday, June 13, 2016", "text": "There is an extreme contrast between living next to a mountain range with high peaks and snow and looking out over the ocean. We have been having rain showers move through the area along the mountains lately and I guess this view of the Pacific Ocean explains a lot about why I live in the mountains rather than along the seashore."},
{"title": "Amphitrite Point Lighthouse, Uculuelet, British Columbia", "date": "Sunday, June 12, 2016", "text": "We often form mental images of different things by association. The Amphitrite Point Lighthouse, Uculuelet, British Columbia does not match our mental image of a lighthouse. Neither does the location seem to match the usual conception. We spent some time climbing around on the rocks only to discover a poorly placed sign advising us that the rocks were slippery and dangerous."},
{"title": "Canyon Walls", "date": "Saturday, June 11, 2016", "text": "There are so many details in this image it is almost overwhelming. You probably will not notice the white flowers in the foreground. You will notice the strange protruding rock formations and the texture of the sandstone walls. This is a box canyon and we are only a short distance from the end of the canyon. It is right around the next bend. There is so much to see and explore it is beyond comprehension. This photo was taken in the Kodachrome Basin State Park in southern Utah."},
{"title": "Tulip Contrast", "date": "Friday, June 10, 2016", "text": "What I like about photography is the ability to see contrasting textures. Here we have the contrast between the beautiful tulips, the green of their stems, the dark blue of the container and the cement and wood backdrop. The colors are also an important part of the composition."},
{"title": "Shamrocks", "date": "Thursday, June 9, 2016", "text": "Some plants have an entire universe of cultural associations. If we called this clover, it would not be the symbol of Ireland and St. Patrick. There is no consensus as to which variety of clover is the \"true\" shamrock. You can take your pick, so to speak: Trifolium dubium, Trifolium repens, Trifolium pratense, Medicago lupulina, Oxalis acetosella. None of these is the same as the ones in the photo above."},
{"title": "Apples", "date": "Wednesday, June 8, 2016", "text": "We have been having a succession of cultural adjustments is moving from the low desert to the mountains. One of these has been the availability of some kinds of fruit. In Mesa, Arizona we hardly ever purchased an orange or any citrus fruit because we had our own trees. Here in Utah, citrus it relatively expensive so we have purchase a lot more apples and other more northern, cooler climate fruit. It has been quite a change."},
{"title": "A Dramatic Canyon", "date": "Tuesday, June 7, 2016", "text": "The contrast between this Canadian canyon and those in my own desert Southwest of the United States is so great that it is hard to imagine they are on the same planet. The obvious difference is the amount of rainfall and the average annual temperatures. In the Phoenix, Arizona area, where I lived most of my life, the average rainfall is about 8 inches a year. Here on Vancouver Island the average rainfall is between 260 inches on the west coast to some areas in Saanich Penninsula with 25 inches a year. This compares to the annual average in Provo, Utah where I now live of about 20 inches a year. Hence, the contrast."},
{"title": "Not Always Obvious", "date": "Monday, June 6, 2016", "text": "We came upon this sign as we were walking across a bridge over the Englishman River on Vancouver Island in Canada. Usually, like the signs in Arizona that say \"Ice may be present in Winter\" these types of signs are obvious. In this case, the placement of the sign was puzzling. There are no steep cliffs evident. However, if I turned around and looked the exact opposite direction, I would have seen a steep cliff. I might also note that all cliffs are steep. That seems to be the nature of cliffs in general. I guess it was important to let me know that this particular cliff was steep for some reason."},
{"title": "Englishman River, Vancouver Island", "date": "Sunday, June 5, 2016", "text": "In the desert SouthWest of the United States, we had slot canyons and you can tell the level of the floods by the tree trunks caught in the canyon walls, sometimes thirty feet up the walls of the canyon. I assume that the logs caught here above the water reflect the same flood possibilities. I have seen flash floods in the desert but I have not been to Canada enough to see any of these rivers in flood stage, but I imagine it is pretty scary."},
{"title": "Multiple Faces in the Moss", "date": "Saturday, June 4, 2016", "text": "Study the moss covered rock for a few minutes. If you are like me, you will begin to see multiple faces of animals and people. If you look further in the image, you will see even more faces. I am very familiar with this phenomena, I see faces all around in almost any random pattern I look at. The phenomenon is called pareidolia. I do have to keep reminding myself that the faces are not really there."},
{"title": "The Texture of the Rocks", "date": "Friday, June 3, 2016", "text": "We were scrambling around on these rocks next to the Pacific Ocean coast of Vancouver Island and found them to be very sharp and dangerous. I am guessing that the sharp edges of the rocks were caused by fracturing due to freezing and thawing cycles. This was a very picturesque area, especially with the sea stacks in the distance. The day was brilliantly sunny for a change but road construction in the area limited our options for visiting the coastline."},
{"title": "Sandstone and Clay", "date": "Thursday, June 2, 2016", "text": "When I was quite young, I remember riding a bus from Salt Lake City to Phoenix. I was sitting by an older lady who made some disparaging comments about the desolate, desert landscape we were traveling through. I can remember my reaction was instantly one of defense. I don't think I was successful in convincing the lady of the beauty of the dry, rocky desert we were traveling through. But I did realize, even from my youth, that the desert had its own unique appeal. There is nothing ordinary or common about the deserts in Arizona or Utah. Every part of both states has its own appeal. I love visiting the desert and I will as long as I am able."},
{"title": "Dried Mud Still Life", "date": "Wednesday, June 1, 2016", "text": "I have been fascinated all my life at the way mud dries and cracks. We used to call this puzzle mud and carefully pick up the pieces to see how they were formed. I was interested to see my grandchildren doing exactly the same thing with this mud deposit. I also like the rich brown colors and the abstract shape of the wetter part of the mud. Beauty, color and texture are everywhere you look."},
{"title": "Almost Abstract", "date": "Tuesday, May 31, 2016", "text": "I like to see the forms and contrasts in nature. Sometimes these forms become almost abstract when then lose their larger context. This photo is almost black and white, in fact, I considered showing it in black and white, but decided I liked the tiny color accent from the branch in the left hand corner."},
{"title": "Late Spring Iris", "date": "Monday, May 30, 2016", "text": "It is almost summer here in Utah Valley. The last Spring flowers to bloom in profusion are the iris. We have a number of different varieties in our front yard. We had iris at our older home in Mesa, Arizona, but after we moved about 12 years ago, we did not have any. Now, here in Utah we are planting iris and other flowers again."},
{"title": "The Mayflower II", "date": "Sunday, May 29, 2016", "text": "I have tens of thousands of photos in my archive and I have been backing them up onto new hard drives recently.

{"title": "Spring Flowers in the Desert", "date": "Saturday, May 28, 2016", "text": "The desert is full of contradictions. It is supposed to be dry and desolate, but it is often beautifully green and covered with flowers. We have been walking in the hills next to our home and looking at the beautiful wildflowers. Spring is nice but the other seasons are also."},
{"title": "Driftwood on the Beach", "date": "Friday, May 27, 2016", "text": "Most of the beaches I visit are devoid of driftwood. This Canadian beach is on the Juan de Fuca Strait. It is bordered by heavily forested islands and the mainland. There are big storms that push huge logs up onto this narrow stretch of rocky beach. It is a beautiful place but not at all inviting for swimming or water sports. The wind was blowing very hard right into the camera."},
{"title": "Moss Covered Branches", "date": "Thursday, May 26, 2016", "text": "We always seem to be attracted to excess. We love the richest, the fastest, the biggest of everything. I guess I am not different. But I see images within the images. Excess only leads to more excess. But here I see animals and faces in the shapes. I never tire of the excesses of nature, but I am often saddened by the excesses of men."},
{"title": "Falling Water", "date": "Wednesday, May 25, 2016", "text": "Waterfalls have an almost universal attraction. This waterfall is on the Englishman River on Vancouver Island, B.C. The water falls into a narrow canyon about ten feet wide and is very spectacular. Of course the fact that there is enough water to make a waterfall is a novelty to someone who spent most of their life in the dry desert. Arizona has some spectacular waterfalls but nothing like this with and abundance of water."},
{"title": "Land of the Earth and Sky", "date": "Tuesday, May 24, 2016", "text": "Exploring the box canyons and cliffs of Kodachrome Basin State Park in Utah opens up a wonderland of formations.

{"title": "Kodachrome Landscape", "date": "Monday, May 23, 2016", "text": "There is a surreal quality to the rock formations in Kodachrome Basin State Park in Southern Utah. The pipes, as they are called, are the attraction and draw attention to themselves inordinately. But the rest of the sandstone outcrops and cliffs are also spectacular. We had a beautiful, but windy, day to hike around the hills and washes of this mainly desert region. I took some of the shots over and over because of the changing light conditions from the very fast moving clouds."},
{"title": "Grosvenor Arch", "date": "Sunday, May 22, 2016", "text": "I realize that this is yet another view of this arch recently. But we just got back from another trip there. About eleven miles down the Cottonwood Canyon Road south of Cannonville, Utah is one of the most spectacular natural stone arches in the State of Utah. Situated in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, it is called Grosvenor Arch, after Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor (1875-1966) President of the National Geographic Society and editor of the National Geographic Society Magazine. The dirt road to the arch is not for low clearance vehicles or the faint of heart. We have seen people turn around and go back when faced with the ruts, the mud, sand and rocks of the road."},
{"title": "Rain Forest Canyon", "date": "Friday, May 20, 2016", "text": "The world is full of extremely rugged country. Most of the photos you see are of country that is tame and insipid. These views give you impression that life and the world are simple and uncomplicated. Just the opposite is the case. The world is full of cliffs and deep water. One of the worthwhile challenges in life is learning how to both survive and appreciate the process of survival."},
{"title": "Yellow and Red Tulips", "date": "Thursday, May 19, 2016", "text": "I have really been enjoying the progression of Spring flowers here along the Wasatch Front. In the low deserts of Arizona, flowers bloom all year long and the usual, cultivated varieties begin blooming in January and February. Tulips are very rare because of the heat. The contrast here in the mountains is that the cooler temperatures are practically perfect for most of the cultivated varieties. I still miss the cactus flowers and probably always will, but I am happy to see the tulips and iris blooming."},
{"title": "Vancouver island Sunset", "date": "Wednesday, May 18, 2016", "text": "This particular image coveys a sense of serenity and peace at the end of the day. Appearances can be misleading. In fact, a few yards across this bay, there was a large colony of very vocal sea lions and the noise level was almost deafening. They barked all day and all night. Being from the city, it didn't take us very long to ignore the sound but this photo does bring back the memory of the sea lion colony."},
{"title": "Vancouver Island Coastline", "date": "Tuesday, May 17, 2016", "text": "I haven't decided between mountains and the ocean, I guess there are places with both. Either the ocean or the mountains are very different that the desert I have lived in most of my life. I guess I like all the places. Right now, I live next to a high mountain at the mouth of a rocky canyon, but I can see living by the ocean also. But to get this view, I would have to move even further north and that will probably not happen."},
{"title": "Rainforest Flowers", "date": "Monday, May 16, 2016", "text": "These delicate flowers looked like the were dancing above the green of rainforest floor.

{"title": "Clouds over Toroweap", "date": "Sunday, May 15, 2016", "text": "The contrast between the dramatic clouds and the deep canyon is striking. This is the Toroweap Overlook, where you can see straight down 3000 feet to the Colorado River. It is a remote section of the Grand Canyon National Park that is not suffering from too many tourists. There are still places where you can go and be alone or nearly alone."},
{"title": "Fog on the Lake", "date": "Saturday, May 14, 2016", "text": "If you spend a lot of time out in the forest and deserts of the world, you will see some unusual things. This was one of the more unusual things. This fog or cloud was right on the surface of the water. The low angle of the sun made long dark lines through the fog and if looked like other parts of the image were floating in the air."},
{"title": "Uinta Mountain lake", "date": "Friday, May 13, 2016", "text": "The Uinta Mountains of northeastern Utah rise well above the tree line and appear rocky and barren. But down in the lower valleys they are heavily forested with many small lovely lakes. Summer is a beautiful time of year to visit, if you can avoid the mosquitos. Unfortunately, like many parts of the country, an extended drought has killed many trees through bark beetle infestations. But it is still an amazingly beautiful place to visit."},
{"title": "Colorado Plateau ", "date": "Thursday, May 12, 2016", "text": "The Colorado Plateau is a strange mixture of sand, stone and sky. This image is actually taken inside of the Grand Canyon. the high cliffs you can see in the distance are like a huge staircase beginning at the Colorado River at extending upward in giant leaps to over 8000 feet in some places. This photo was taken just a few yards from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon gorge."},
{"title": "The Arches of Southern Utah", "date": "Wednesday, May 11, 2016", "text": "There are only certain types of rocks that have the characteristics to create rock arches. Parts of Southern Utah have these formations in abundance. You might get the idea that Arches National Park had some sort-of monopoly on arches, but they can be found on many back roads all over the Colorado Plateau and in adjacent areas also. Not all are as spectacular as the Grosvenor Arch located near the Arizona/Utah border, but they can be seen and found in many unexpected locations. Let's just say that you need a high-clearance vehicle and four-wheel drive would be nice to find them. You might also have to hike a few miles. That is not the case with this arch, it is right on a very rough, easily accessible road, unless it is raining, like it was the day this photo was taken."},
{"title": "Late Evening at the Grand Canyon", "date": "Tuesday, May 10, 2016", "text": "As evening falls over the Grand Canyon, the light turns the entire canyon into lovely pastels of lavender and dark blue with rose colored highlights. The plateau that forms the Rim of the Canyon is almost flat and the light conditions are easily affected by the amount of cloud cover and the way the clouds reflect the light from the setting sun. Whenever I am visiting the Canyon, I try to see both the sunrise and the sunset. It makes for wonderfully long days of watching the light change every few minutes."},
{"title": "The North Rim", "date": "Monday, May 9, 2016", "text": "The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is less accessible and has far fewer visitors than the South Rim. It is also a thousand feet higher in altitude and the views of the Canyon are separated by dirt roads and require a lot more effort to find and view. Many of the parking areas end a distance from the Rim and require moderate to long hikes to reach the vantage points. But, it is all worth the effort and the bonus is you are often the only person visiting the overlook."},
{"title": "Stone People", "date": "Sunday, May 8, 2016", "text": "The stories of the Superstition Mountains in Arizona are so bizarre and strange that you don't know what to believe and what is really superstition. One story says that the local Indians believed that these rock formations were stone people. I haven't been able to substantiate that story. But the rock formations are impressive and the country is very rugged."},
{"title": "Temperate Rainforest", "date": "Friday, May 6, 2016", "text": "A temperate rainforest is a coniferous or broadleaf forest that is located in a temperate zone and receives a large amount of rain. Vancouver Island is part of the Pacific temperate rainforests ecoregion and in some places receives up to 10 feet of rain a year. This compares to the average of around 10 inches or less a year in the Southwest deserts of the United States. The average rainfall here in Provo, Utah is about double the desert with about 20 inches of rain."},
{"title": "The Victoria, B.C. Harbor", "date": "Thursday, May 5, 2016", "text": "A few years ago, I took one of my favorite photos of the Victoria, B.C. harbor in the rain. This was a sunny, but windy day, and I took a more expansive photo from a different perspective. Vancouver Island is turning out to be one of my favorite places. We were interested to see people buying palm trees and banana trees at a local Costco store, so we assume that either the weather is mild enough for these plants or a lot of them are grown indoors. It is an interesting place and very beautiful."},
{"title": "The Amphitheater at Bryce Canyon", "date": "Wednesday, May 4, 2016", "text": "I decided it was time to return to the desert and the canyon country for a while. Utah has five National Parks and has been promoting them as tourist destinations for some time now. The state's campaign has been overwhelmingly successful in drawing huge crowds to these five parks. We have found that the visiter experience has been seriously degraded as a result of huge crowds and we are probably going to avoid some of the parks in the future during some times of the year. The interesting thing is that all you have to do is move a short distance off of the \"beaten path\" to find all the beauty and solitude you might desire. Bryce is a good example of a park that looks like rush hour on the freeway at some times and can be almost entirely empty at other times. However, some of the parks, like Zion and Arches are almost lost causes. But, there are so many other beautiful places to go, we will never run out of opportunities to visit them."},
{"title": "Seattle Harbor at Night", "date": "Tuesday, May 3, 2016", "text": "This image is another of that class of images that verge on the abstract.

{"title": "A Plethora of Tulips", "date": "Monday, May 2, 2016", "text": "If one is pretty, then thousands must be thousands of times prettier? Well, no. Fields of flowers have their appeal, but I am more inclined to appreciate one tulip than a whole field of tulips. Masses of colorful flowers are a great attraction but at the same time they detract from the pleasure of just a single blossom. I do love flowers, but I love them more individually than in clusters."},
{"title": "Reflections in Seattle", "date": "Sunday, May 1, 2016", "text": "From time to time, I see the abstract in what is around me.

{"title": "Seattle and Mount Ranier", "date": "Saturday, April 30, 2016", "text": "Seattle, Washington is the antithesis of Phoenix, Arizona. Phoenix is all about wide open spaces and being uncrowded. Downtown Seattle is just the opposite. Without a knowledge of the streets, Seattle is a nightmare. Phoenix has traffic, but there is always the option to drive other streets and avoid the congestion. This might be true in Seattle, but it is not true to someone who does not drive there regularly. Seattle has dramatic views. Phoenix not so much. There is a lot to see and do in downtown Seattle. Again, Phoenix, not so much. The weather in Seattle is cool and very wet. Well, you can guess the weather in Phoenix is exactly the opposite. What is interesting is that people live in both places."},
{"title": "Almost Fake", "date": "Friday, April 29, 2016", "text": "If I hadn't seen these growing on a bush, I would think they were artificial flowers. I have been enjoying the trees and bushes in bloom. Our daffodils bloomed a little this year and our irises are starting to bloom. The peonies are starting to bud out and will also bloom shortly. I am still not sure that they are a substitute for cactus flowers, but I do like irises. This has been a relatively wet Spring and so the trees are all blooming. The fruit trees are already through with their blossoms but there a plenty of other flowering trees to replace them."},
{"title": "Snoqualmie Falls, Washington", "date": "Thursday, April 28, 2016", "text": "Not all giant waterfalls are sequestered away in the wilderness. This lovely waterfall is a major tourist attraction and located just a few yards from a major highway. The parking lot was full to overflowing and the lookout points were crowded with the typical American tourist types (including us). You can get some idea of the size of the waterfall from the hotel on the rim to the upper left. This was a pleasant diversion from what turned out to be a very long trip by car from Utah to Washington state and then on to Canada."},
{"title": "Spring Snow on Timpanogos", "date": "Wednesday, April 27, 2016", "text": "You can see the dramatic difference the change in elevation has on the temperature by looking at the snow on the Wasatch Mountains. Mount Timpanogos dominates the sky to the north of where we live and during the day we see major changes in the quality of the light on the mountain. We can have snow falling at our house and drive down the hill two blocks and have nothing but rain. We didn't get any of the new snow showing on the mountains."},
{"title": "Ornamental Cabbage", "date": "Tuesday, April 26, 2016", "text": "I am always amazed at the variety of colors in plant leaves. I also wonder if ornamental cabbage is good to eat? I guess I could look it up online. (time passes) Hmm. I did look it up online and yes, you can eat them, but usually they are grown for their colorful leaves. I guess this is another plant we could grow and eat."},
{"title": "The Burden of Time", "date": "Monday, April 25, 2016", "text": "This is an image from the old Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Site on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Site is a 19th-century coastal artillery fort on the Colwood, British Columbia side of Esquimalt Harbour, (Greater Victoria/Victoria BC Metropolitan Area). It was first established in around 1870 with most of the construction happening between 1894 and 1897. It was designated a National Historic Site in 1958. See Wikipedia: Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Site.The fort is no longer in use and was decommissioned in 1956. In walking around the site, you can see how quickly wind, rain and freezing temperatures can begin to disassemble all that we can build. In addition, moss and lichen have taken their toll on the rocks and cement used to build the fort. The passage of time leaves its mark everywhere."},
{"title": "The Fisgard Lighthouse, Vancouver Island", "date": "Sunday, April 24, 2016", "text": "The Fisgard Lighthouse is the first lighthouse constructed on Canada's west coast and it is still operational. It is preserved in the Fisgard Lighthouse Historical Site near the city of Victoria, British Columbia on Vancouver Island. It was built in 1860 before Vancouver Island was officially part of Canada. We visited on a day when the wind was fiercely blowing and it was quite chilly. The amount of drift wood on the shore indicates the severity of the storms that pass this way."},
{"title": "Brilliantly Yellow", "date": "Friday, April 22, 2016", "text": "My heart rejoices in the beauty all around me. Unfortunately, rather than sit and contemplate all this beauty, I have a very busy and involved life. One of my neighbors was pointing out that we have two comfortable chairs on our patio and we could sit outside and look at the beautiful plants and flowers. Fat chance. But that does not mean that I don't appreciate those few times when I do make an effort to look around and drink in my surroundings. These lovely tulips look like they are individually hand painted."},

This beach is actually right next to the downtown section of Victoria and part of the Beacon Hill Park."},
{"title": "Fields of Tulips", "date": "Monday, April 18, 2016", "text": "Viewed from a short distance, tulips, like people, merge into crowds. Even when we view both tulips and people in large aggregations, we need to be aware of the beauty of the individual flower or person. Likewise, when we are in crowd, it is easy to get lost and become part of  the background. But when that happens we need to focus on our own individuality. When I take photos of flowers it is easy to focus on the large groupings, but the richness of the experience of looking at flowers and people is to examine their own unique individuality."},
{"title": "Canadian West Coast Surf", "date": "Sunday, April 17, 2016", "text": "You have to go to the edge of the land in Canada to reach the open Pacific Ocean. This image came from the west coast of Vancouver Island on a very windy day. We love the colors and even the wind, but it does make it difficult to stand and take photos. Taking a photo with this much movement requires a steady hand and a fast shutter speed."},

{"title": "Utah Valley Sunset", "date": "Saturday, April 16, 2016", "text": "We have a winter view of the sunsets over the mountains to the west of us. In the Spring, the leaves come back on all the trees and the view is somewhat restricted. But we enjoy it while we can. If there is a really nice sunset, like this one, I can walk a few feet to the north or south and get a clear view of the horizon. Of course, the sun appears to move north and south with the seasons and so the position of the sunset also changes. In the middle of the Winter the sun is so far south that any sunset is blocked by the hillside right next to my window. So, it is either trees or hill, but I can always make a short trip up the hill and see the entire valley unobstructed."},

This is one of the most popular places in downtown Seattle. I understand that the city comes by and cleans this all off the walls periodically and then it comes back with renewed vigor. This is only a very small portion of the walls. It is on both sides of a narrow alleyway accessible mostly by foot traffic. It is very crowded and I had to wait a while before I could get a photo without someone standing and sticking bubblegum to the wall. Ugh."},

Late in the afternoon, we decided to visit the Space Needle. I had gone up in the Space Needle back in 1962. I had been to Seattle several times since then but had not gone up in the Space Needle. The weather was chilly and windy but the air was clear and it was impressive to see the sun set and the lights come out."},
{"title": "Found on the Beach", "date": "Wednesday, April 13, 2016", "text": "On Vancouver Island the tides rise and fall up to 3 feet every 12 hours of so. As a consequence, in locations where there is little slope, great expanses of tidal flats appear. In some places, you can walk almost a mile from the high tide level. It is a very interesting experience to walk out onto an enormous flat expanse of sand that is underwater two times a day. I thought these aquatic plants were unusual because they look vaguely like crab claws."},

The damage was caused by a severe wind storm after the ground had become fully saturated. The juxtaposition of the new windfall over the older fallen trees demonstrates that this type of event happens on a regular basis. We were glad that we did not experience this extreme weather event first hand."},

{"title": "Superstition Cliffs -- A Study Number Five", "date": "Thursday, April 7, 2016", "text": "Walking across the desert like this, in the absence of a trail, is extremely difficult. It sometimes looks like you could just walk over to the nearest hill and you find that the way is blocked by a deep canyon. The distances are also deceiving. It would take a very long time to climb to the top of the ridge shown in the distance."},
{"title": "Superstition Cliffs -- A Study Number Four", "date": "Wednesday, April 6, 2016", "text": "The Superstition Mountains were formed from five (or four, depending on the source) large volcanic caldera explosions. Most of the cliffs are Ryolite or welded tuff. Because of the overlapping nature of the formations, there is no clear drainage pattern and the canyons run all different directions. It is extremely difficult to navigate until you become used to the terrain."},

Everything looks about the same and many people get disoriented and some die from the heat or exposure. Since it is so close to a very large city, it is a popular place but can be deadly on the late Spring, Summer or Fall. In fact, it is dangerous almost all the time."},

This is one of the few trails that is still open to the public where you can gain access that is not blocked by no trespassing signs.Normally, a rock outcropping such as this one would simply be another pile of rocks in the desert, but this pile of rocks is famous because it is located in Scottsdale, Arizona. It is called Pinnacle Peak and has a popular short walking trail around the prominent rock. This peak is visible from many parts of the eastern end of the Salt River Valley and is a destination for local rock climbers."},

It is the highest masonry dam in the world. Construction on the dam started in 1906 and was completed in 1911. Travel to the dam site was over what is now known as the \"Apache Trail,\" a rugged dirt road over the Superstition Mountains and still an adventure to drive. In my years in Arizona, I drove the road many times and I am still amazed at the persistence of the dam builders who hauled endless wagon loads over the steep grades, particularly that portion of the road known as Fish Creek Hill."},

But to find a lot of balanced rocks in the same relatively small area is remarkable. It is evident here that the balanced part of these formations are rocks that just happen to be harder than the surrounding rock that has all weathered away. That seems like a very simple explanation until you are actually standing there looking at the rocks, then it all seems almost impossible."},

There have been some widely publicized news stories about vandalism that involved rock formations. All of these formations are in the Escalante Grand Staircase National Monument and destruction of these formations would be a Federal crime. If you do hike out to see these formations or other similar ones, don't climb on them or whatever that might destroy them. You might like to come back some time and see them again, even if no one is around and you don't get caught."},

I suppose that tells you something about my mental state, or not, depending on which camp you happen to be in. Well, I can remember several instances when people saw religious images in things as common as a cheese sandwich and on the floor of Terminal 3 of Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. I guess my tendency is to see animals and monsters."},

This photo could be any of a thousand places but it happens to be on east side of Capital Reef National Park. I would call this a typical photo of the southern part of Utah but I could take a very similar photo in Arizona and unless you knew better, you could not tell which state I was in when I took the photo.

Here, the fog in the Winter has coated the existing snow bank with large ice crystals. Is water a mineral? Water in its liquid form is not classified as a mineral but naturally occurring ice is a solid and therefore classified as a mineral. A mineral, by definition, occurs and is formed naturally. Manmade ice or other crystals are not technically minerals. Water and mercury are the only two naturally occurring, inorganic substances with a definitive chemical formula that occur in a liquid state at normal temperatures. - See more athttp://www.minerals.net/mineral/water.aspx#sthash.GU8JhwNg.dpuf"},

I can't say I tried them however. I was too busy taking photos and trying to stay warm."},
{"title": "Frost on a Branch", "date": "Sunday, February 14, 2016", "text": "We went for an outing to look for birds and found the world filled with the most amazing frost crystals. These extraordinary crystals were formed when there was a dense fog and freezing temperatures. The light conditions were not optimal and it was very cold, but had the sun come out, the frost was so light and fragile that it would have disappeared in an instant. These particular crystals were about three inches long. The slightest breeze caused showers of crystals to come off of the trees and fall like snow. These crystals were very near to Utah Lake on the Provo River Trail."},
{"title": "Foggy Crystals on Snow", "date": "Saturday, February 13, 2016", "text": "The last few days we have had very foggy, freezing weather in Utah Valley. The freezing fog has created delicate crystals on the deep layer of snow in our front yard. I found that these delicate crystals were hard to photograph because of the camera refused to focus on the surface of the brightly lit snow in the afternoon when the fog had lifted. I finally captured a few shots and found that by converting the images to gray scale, I could see more detail in the frost. Yes, these are very small crystals, probably about a half and inch long and they completely cover the surface of the snow."},

{"title": "A Time for Ice", "date": "Tuesday, February 9, 2016", "text": "There is a time and a season for everything under heaven and this is the time for ice. Conditions have to be just right for icicles to form. The snow has piled up unmelted on our roof for a couple of weeks and now the temperatures are high enough during the day to start the snow melting and then freezing when it trickles down from the gutters or the roof. I am interested in the branching near the end of the ice. These ice formations remind me of helictites in the caves I have explored. I am guessing that the same forces that form these branches in icicles also contribute to the helictites."},

After living in the desert for over forty years consecutively, I am really enjoying the snow and ice. Yes, there are limitations and annoyances about having cold, wet snow all around, but the benefits of seeing the beauty of it all far outweighs the inconvenience. The weather has apparently ideal for growing huge icicles on all the houses. The ones out my window are about three feet long but we have seen some over four feet long. I am sure that few people here in Utah Valley feel like icicles are much of a benefit, but I am fascinated with their form and the mere fact that they exist. The weather might warm up in the next few days and I expect that they will disappear."},

I like snow.\" It may be cold but the views are spectacular."},
{"title": "The Great Salt Lake", "date": "Saturday, January 30, 2016", "text": "They are saying that the Great Salt Lake is at almost is historic lowest level. Every time the Lake recedes because of a drought or whatever, the scientists start wringing their hands over the fact the Lake may dry up. Then the weather turns around and the Lake comes back to flood subdivisions built while the Lake was low. Since what we see today is merely a remnant of Lake Bonneville that covered most of what is now Utah, if scientists had been there thousands of years ago, they really would have had something to wring their hands over."},

This river begins in the White Mountains and runs north and west until it joins the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon. My Great-grandparents settled along this river in the late 1800s. At that time, this was almost their only supply of water. They had to put the water in barrels and let the red mud settle out until top portion of the water was drinkable. Normally, the stream is almost dry. In this image, there is a \"flood\" or there is actually water running down the river. When there is water it is called a flood since the river is usually almost dry. You can see how desolate the land is in this area. It is typical for this part of the country. By the way, the wind blows about 360 days a year."},
{"title": "Classic Grand Canyon", "date": "Sunday, January 24, 2016", "text": "With the Colorado River visible in this view of the Grand Canyon, this is classic. It is impossible to tell that the weather was freezing and the wind was blowing snow only a few hours earlier.

{"title": "Grand Falls of the Little Colorado River", "date": "Saturday, January 23, 2016", "text": "Who would believe that a huge waterfall exists out in the middle of the vast Colorado Plateau? The key is that it is dry most of the year. Only when there is enough rainfall to make the river flood is there runoff that makes a huge waterfall. Of course, the water is not sparkling blue and white, it is the color of the sandstone and mud. When you are standing next to the waterfall the spray leaves mud spots on your clothes and skin. It is had to get a perspective of size anywhere on the Plateau, but this waterfall is taller than Niagara Falls in New York state."},

It is expected that there will be over 500,000 visitors to the Temple before its dedication on 20 March 2016. During the past year or so, we have been privileged to visit the open houses held for four other Temples and my impression is that this is the best organized such event we have attended.The new Provo City Center Temple is a reconstruction of the historic Provo Tabernacle that was destroyed by a fire on 17 December 2010. The exterior of the building was salvaged and used as the basis for the reconstruction. The interior of the building as completed is exquisite. It is clearly the highest quality and most impressively beautiful handiwork I have ever seen, including the previously visited Temples. The finish is unbelievable down to the door handles and hinges."},

But with sunlight, the canyon comes alive. To some extent, these images are \"staged\" in that the ray of sunlight is highlighted by throwing sand and dust into the air and then running out of the way so photos can be taken. The light changes in the canyon almost constantly and it is quite a trick to get a good photograph."},
{"title": "Return to Antelope Canyon", "date": "Monday, January 18, 2016", "text": "My photo archive has tens of thousands of photos and only a small percentage will ever be shared by this blog. From time to time, I think it a good idea to revisit some of the places I have been in the past ten years. Antelope Canyon in Arizona is one of the places I intend to revisit. But I also know that there are several other slot canyons in the area and I will likely visit a few of them also. This is one of the most photographed slot canyons in the world because of its easy access and fantastic light and shapes."},
{"title": "A Little Snow at the Grand Canyon", "date": "Saturday, January 16, 2016", "text": "The day we were here at the Grand Canyon, it was snowing and blowing sideways. We ate at the Bright Angel Lodge restaurant and drove home to Mesa, Arizona the same day. Unfortunately, where we live now is more than twice as far as it was to drive to Mesa from the South Rim, but it is closer to the North Rim. There are always trade offs in life."},
{"title": "Grass against the snow", "date": "Friday, January 15, 2016", "text": "The patterns in Winter are more subtle than those of the summer. This shot of wind blown grass does not have a high color contrast, but the detail is terrific. This is the kind of shot that needs to be blown up on a large print."},
{"title": "First Light", "date": "Thursday, January 14, 2016", "text": "I am often asked if I ever sleep. I guess I get up early and go to bed late because I might miss something. This was a very cold day and I opened the shade just in time. I ran out without a coat and took a few quick shots. The temperature was down in the teens. I didn't stay long, but I can't resist the light and color."},
{"title": "An Old Saguaro", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2016", "text": "A saguaro cactus can grow for about a hundred years before it sprouts its first \"arm\" or branch. This particular plant is probably several hundred years old. There is something innately impressive about age. We instinctively admire the ability of any organism to survive. Unfortunately, old saguaros are not usually much different than those that are far younger because for some unexplained reason, not all of the cactus grow arms. There is no real way to tell how long these plants live, but we know they live more than 150 years."},
{"title": "A Rare Spring Treat", "date": "Tuesday, January 12, 2016", "text": "From the photos I put here on WalkingArizona, you probably cannot tell the overall story. For example, the Claret Cup flowers in this photo are actually very rare in the wild. Unless you go to a cactus garden such as the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, Arizona, you very unlikely to ever see this particular cactus, much less when it is in bloom. I have been fortunate to find them blooming out in the desert. Here is a photo of a plant growing in Northern Arizona at the end of a very rough, dirt road.If I had been there one week before or after, I would have missed the flowers and may not have noticed the cactus at all."},
{"title": "Yucca and Saguaro", "date": "Monday, January 11, 2016", "text": "I am not sure that snow and mountains completely substitute for flowers in the desert. I love the flowers that bloom here along the Wasatch Front, but I have a special affinity for the desert and its flowers. The scenery here in Provo is certainly a lot more dramatic than the more subtle beauty of the Arizona-Sonora Desert but the desert is still a large part of my soul. I guess I live in three worlds; the low deserts of Arizona, the sandstone of the Colorado Plateau and the high mountains of Northern Utah. Each of these has had a special place in my life of walking in Arizona and Utah."},
{"title": "A Colorful Butterfly", "date": "Saturday, January 9, 2016", "text": "Looking at piles of snow on the ground outside of my window, I decided to spread some butterfly photos around. You don't see many butterflies in Provo, Utah in the Winter. In fact, you don't see many flying insects at all. Winter doesn't seem to deter the spiders however. We still see them crawling around but mostly inside. But soon Spring will be here and we will be worrying about the heat of Summer before we know it."},
{"title": "The Liberty Torch", "date": "Friday, January 8, 2016", "text": "Inside the base of the Statue of Liberty in the New York Harbor, there is duplicate of the Liberty Torch. The Torch has been changed and replaced at least three times over the years. This version is preserved but no longer used. Apparently, the glass panel leaked and the leaks were causing damage to the statue and so the current torch was made and put in place."},
{"title": "Ellis Island from the boat", "date": "Thursday, January 7, 2016", "text": "Some time ago, I had the chance to visit Ellis Island. In my years of doing genealogical research, I have often referred to the list of the immigrants who came through this particular point of debarkation near New York City, New York. It seems that none of my ancestors came through this particular port of entry, mainly because they all arrived from Europe before Ellis Island came into existence, but millions of other immigrants came to America through this facility."},
{"title": "Evening at the Grand Canyon", "date": "Wednesday, January 6, 2016", "text": "When you are visiting the Grand Canyon, you miss a wonderful opportunity if you don't go to a viewpoint and sit there and watch the sun set or rise. During the day, the light may be intense and the Canyon can become 2 dimensional. But when the sun is at an angle, you can see the layers of cliffs and buttes. It is a dramatic process and you might also find yourself surrounded by others with the same idea."},
{"title": "Ice Lace", "date": "Tuesday, January 5, 2016", "text": "I caught this image of the snow on a fence as it was slowly melting with temperatures just over freezing. These are not large formations, no more than an inch or so across, but they are very unusual. If it were any warmer, the snow would have melted directly and any colder and they would not have formed at all."},
{"title": "Storm at the Grand Canyon", "date": "Monday, January 4, 2016", "text": "I thought it was time to get back to photos of the Grand Canyon. Some photographers fall in love with the Canyon and concentrate on photos of just the Grand Canyon, but I like almost all of the Colorado Plateau and I am happy taking photos from Capital Reef in Utah all the way down into Arizona. Too many photos of the Southwest show iconic good weather and light conditions. The reality is that many days are cloudy and have either rain or snow. The South Rim is at over 7000 feet above sea level and you are not going to have the same weather for even an entire day except on rare occasions."},
{"title": "Oil Lamp from Israel", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2016", "text": "Oil lamp replicas are a common tourist purchase in Israel. There are hundreds (thousands) of designs. They are commonly used in Sunday School lessons referring to the Biblical story of the 10 virgins. They are even sold on Amazon.com and many cost less than $10. There are some for as little as $3.Most of us think of gypsum as a white powdery substance, if we think of it al all. It is the main component of dry wall and many other products. But it also forms fabulous crystals. They are very delicate and have a tendency to shed, but if protected, they are quite a collectors item. I have decided that taking macro shots of crystals involves a lot of pre- and post-production work with Photoshop and Lightroom. This another photo using the Shotbox from Shotbox.me."},
{"title": "Canyon Contrasts", "date": "Saturday, January 2, 2016", "text": "One of the most difficult times to photograph is when there is a huge contrast between the background and the foreground. In this case, both the foreground and the background are interesting, but the main subject is the light on the distant cliff. This photo could have been cropped like this to eliminate any of the foreground.But I decided I liked to show how it looked when I was standing there take the photo."},
{"title": "Quartz in Sphalerite and Pyrite ", "date": "Friday, January 1, 2016", "text": "For some time now, I have been wanting to expand my photographic experience to include making photos of objects in a light box environment. A light box allows the photographer to make detailed images of objects with a very controlled lighting thereby eliminating harsh shadows and at the same time creating a uniform background. I recently purchased a light box from a new startup, Shotbox.me, that exactly fits my needs. In the future, I will be including photos of everything from soup to nuts and from a to z. This is a specimen of the minerals quartz in sphalerite with pyrite. I hope you see the potential of presenting minerals and other objects in this fashion as I experiment with different backgrounds and lighting."},
{"title": "Snow Crystals", "date": "Thursday, December 31, 2015", "text": "If you look closely at the edge of the snow, you will see some extraordinary crystals. I cannot tell you how hard it is to get good photos when it is late in the afternoon, in the shade of a canyon wall, with a telescopic lens and it is about 14 degrees. I was concerned that my camera might freeze. Most cameras are built to work only down to about freezing or 32 degrees Fahrenheit. Most of the problems occur when the camera is moved from a very warm temperature to a very cold one and from cold to warm. If you are in this position, I would suggest reading up on operating your camera or smartphone in a very cold environment."},
{"title": "Temple Square Lights for Christmas", "date": "Wednesday, December 30, 2015", "text": "Technically this reflecting pool used to be Main Street in Salt Lake City, Utah but it is now part of a park area adjacent to Temple Square. The light display will end shortly with the coming of the New Year but will be back again next Christmas. As I get older, it seems that the years pass much more quickly. I do enjoy the lights and the season."},
{"title": "Winter Snowscape", "date": "Tuesday, December 29, 2015", "text": "This image is almost monochromatic, i.e. black and white. I shows what the snow looks like when you get out into the canyons and the mountains. The temperature was about 15 degrees Fahrenheit and there was no wind. I was surprised that the stream was not entirely frozen over, but it hadn't been that cold for very many days and it may yet freeze. The beauty of the snow and the way the snow covers the rocks and trees almost overcomes the fact that you are cold and potentially wet. I don't survive well at this temperature, but once my hands go numb, it doesn't bother me as much."},
{"title": "A Bighorn Mountain Sheep", "date": "Monday, December 28, 2015", "text": "We live right next to the Wasatch Mountains and have seen both mountain goats and bighorn sheep on occasion in the canyons near our home. Bighorn sheep or Ovis canadensis are native to North America. I have seen these animals as far south as the deserts of Arizona, but never in the numbers that live in the Wasatch. These animals are a subspecies known as Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, while the ones in Southern Arizona are most likely Desert bighorn sheep. This image was taken with a very long lens when I was standing about fifty yards away from the herd."},
{"title": "Herd of Mountain Sheep", "date": "Sunday, December 27, 2015", "text": "We are usually surprised to see one or two mountain sheep in the Wasatch Mountains next to our home, but in this case, we saw a whole herd. There were at least thirty individuals in this herd. This happened right at the mouth of American Fork Canyon as we were returning from a snowshoe outing on the Little Mill Campground trail. It was about 17 degrees outside and I jumped out of the car and took some quick shots."},
{"title": "Christmas Snowfall", "date": "Saturday, December 26, 2015", "text": "We woke up on Christmas morning, 2015, to the heaviest snowfall we have yet seen since we moved to Provo, Utah. It was a Christmas present that was entirely unexpected. We spent the rest of the day quietly at home since it took most of the day to clear a path from our garage to the street. This image is actually right out in front of our house. We live at the edge of a thick stand of trees and a steep hill."},
{"title": "Nativity Presentation on Temple Square, Salt Lake City, Utah", "date": "Friday, December 25, 2015", "text": "Every year Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah attracts tens of thousands of visitors to see the lights and to watch the Nativity presentation. This year, as is usual, it was cold and there were a few flurries of snow. It looks like there is a light pillar from one of the towers of the the Temple, but the light beam comes from the Nativity and catches the snow falling. The big building to the right is the Tabernacle, home of the Tabernacle Choir. The tall building in the background is the Church Office Building."},
{"title": "A Wintery Night with Temple Square", "date": "Thursday, December 24, 2015", "text": "As I waited to cross South Temple in the cold, wet December weather in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, I was stopped by the beauty of the lights and the Temple. There are likely few more impressive Christmas celebrations than those on Temple Square. You can glimpse the huge crowds of people and imagine the impact of the lights and the season. I finally had to put my camera away because it was getting too wet from the snow."},
{"title": "Christmas Lights on Temple Square", "date": "Wednesday, December 23, 2015", "text": "It was a dark and snowy night when we visited Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah to see the annual Christmas Light display. Even though it was wet and cold, we enjoyed the beautiful lights and the music and displays. We probably walked around for over an hour and then made our way home on the crowded freeways to Utah Valley. We were greeted by more snow at home and had to shovel the driveway to get the car into the garage. The trip was still worth the effort."},

{"title": "Last Light", "date": "Sunday, December 20, 2015", "text": "We have been having strange weather. It has been snowing off and on and then warming up. So the all the snow has been melting. Just now it is snowing again heavily and we will likely have a white Christmas. We just watched a car get stuck on the ice in the street in front of our house. Winter is only a couple of days away, so I am guessing we will have a lot more snow."},

{"title": "An Afternoon Chat", "date": "Wednesday, December 16, 2015", "text": "Sitting around is usually reserved for warm sunny days or warmer evenings. I don't think we have ever spent even an hour sitting out in these patio chairs. The next day, the snow was even deeper. Welcome to the Frozen North."},
{"title": "Waiting for the Spring", "date": "Tuesday, December 15, 2015", "text": "Well, the snow finally arrived here in the Frozen North. We woke up to a major snow event and ended up shoveling the snow twice in one day. As I was out shoveling the snow, I was grateful for the opportunity. It was satisfying to be out doing something that had a beginning and an end. To celebrate the snow we took a walk up the hill in the snow and made a snow angel. Because we moved from Mesa, Arizona to Utah, the first question we are asked is how we like the snow. My answer is it is very nice and we love to watch it, walk in it and I even like to shovel it. We don't particularly like to drive in it however."},
{"title": "The Long View", "date": "Monday, December 14, 2015", "text": "The vast Colorado Plateau is a study in understatement. This ridge is probably two or more miles away from the spot where the photo was taken. There is nothing except the sage brush in the foreground that can provide an insight into the scale. The cliffs on the face of the ridge (or butte, as they are sometimes called) are probably about 300 feet high. It would likely take me almost an hour to walk over to the bottom of these cliffs. This photo was taken at Cathedral Valley in the Capitol Reef National Park. Part of the land in the photo is inside the Park and some is not."},
{"title": "Vertical Canyons", "date": "Sunday, December 13, 2015", "text": "Because of the softness of underlying strata, erosional forces create almost vertical canyons in the fact of this formation. Deeper canyons are created when the overlying rock is fragmented or missing. I have seen the same type of formations with steep almost vertical canyons on a very small scale when I dig in sand that has been alternatively watered by rain and then dried. The particles of sand form the same types of layers and as you dig away the sand, miniature cliffs form that look very similar to these formations."},
{"title": "Red Stripe", "date": "Saturday, December 12, 2015", "text": "These hills are unusual because of the stripes of colorful minerals in the various levels or strata. Bentonite is an absorbent aluminium phyllosilicate clay consisting mostly of montmorillonite. The absorbent clay was given the name \"bentonite\" by Wilbur C. Knight in 1898, after the Cretaceous Benton Shale near Rock River, Wyoming. The different types of bentonite are each named after the respective dominant element, such as potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), and aluminium. See Wikipedia: Bentonite. Some of my early memories are of playing on just sort of a hill in Eastern Arizona."},
{"title": "Hanging Canyon", "date": "Friday, December 11, 2015", "text": "This is a hanging canyon. The canyon on the side of this cliff with the trees ends in an undercut cliff. If for some reason you happened to be trying to walk down this canyon, you would have a very complicated situation. It looks like you could continue to walk along the edge of the drop off but there might not a be a way down without backtracking up the canyon. This image dramatically illustrates the difficulty in traveling in this sandstone labyrinth called the Colorado Plateau. This photo was taken in the Capital Reef National Park in Central Utah."},
{"title": "Erosion", "date": "Wednesday, December 9, 2015", "text": "The soft Bentonite clay soil of the Colorado Plateau erodes into some of the most complex formations. The design made by this hill could be used as an example of fractals. It is hard to capture the essence of the country when your photo is limited to a small sample of what you can see when you standing there looking at the scenery. The solution would seem to be taking a 360 degree virtual image but each photographic format has its own advantages and limitations."},
{"title": "Kodachrome Basin", "date": "Monday, December 7, 2015", "text": "Now you can probably see why it is called Kodachrome Basin. The main area of the strange pipe is enclosed in a high ridge. You might have to click on this photo to enlarge it to see all the detail. There is one very large pipe near the middle of the photo and many smaller ones in the area. This is in the middle of the Colorado Plateau and the different bands of sedimentary rocks are clearly visible."},
{"title": "Kodachrome Basin Pipes", "date": "Sunday, December 6, 2015", "text": "One of my favorite camping spots in Utah or Arizona is Kodachrome Basin State Park almost to the border of Arizona deep in the sandstone cliffs of Southern Utah. It is a relatively small area with lot of interesting formations. Unlike some of the more popular national parks, Kodachrome is not nearly as busy or crowded. It is not particularly on the road to anywhere so there is less traffic than some other areas of Southern Utah. If you are thinking of camping, you will need reservations."},
{"title": "Lake Clouds", "date": "Saturday, December 5, 2015", "text": "When you are standing there beside the lake, you can see the reflection, but there is no sense of unreality. When you look at the same scene through the eye of the camera, you can see that the whole landscape is transformed into a surreal abstract. You need to focus on the water and soon it will appear to be floating in the air in like a solid wall in an apparently ordinary looking landscape."},
{"title": "Storm over Bryce Canyon", "date": "Friday, December 4, 2015", "text": "We might all like to have warm, sunny weather all of the time. If so, we can move north and south with the seasons. But I like weather, no matter what kind comes along. I have found that images like this are not as popular as those showing people basking in the sun on a tropical beach, but Bryce Canyon and other such locations are my preferred venue. I would much rather be in a storm on the Colorado Plateau than sitting on a beach with a calm ocean. The images that result from my standing out in the rain or snow are not as bright as those with sunshine, but they do depict what is going on when I took the photo."},
{"title": "Back to Winter Again", "date": "Thursday, December 3, 2015", "text": "Well, it is that time of year again. We see all this strange white stuff falling out of the air and it piles up and looks like Winter. We get to wear a lot more clothes than we were used to from living in the low desert for years. Despite the inconvenience I really do like snow. It is a pleasant change from brown and green for a while. Of course, Winter is just beginning and I might become less enthusiastic as the months roll on."},
{"title": "Cross Bedding", "date": "Wednesday, December 2, 2015", "text": "The pattern of the sandstone in this image indicates that the formation was composed of ancient sand dunes. The theory is that the sand dunes became frozen in place when they were cemented by water with a high concentration of calcium. The different patterns in the rock were caused by changes in the pattern of the winds. The vertical lines come from the stresses imposed on the rocks as they were uplifted to their present level."},
{"title": "Zion Vista", "date": "Tuesday, December 1, 2015", "text": "Even when the temperatures outside say that Winter is on its way, I still remember the summer days in Southern Utah and particularly days spent in Zion Canyon. I just read that Zion had a record number of visitors so far in 2015. We added to that number, but I am almost sure that most of them were there the days we visited. I have been there many times and have never seen such crowds. I think we will concentrate on other areas of the state and maybe return to our favorite places in Arizona. The only other place with so many people is the Grand Canyon and Zion is a lot smaller area and the canyon concentrates all the people together. At the Grand Canyon there are a lot of people but they are spread out over miles of the Rim."},
{"title": "Snowstorm on Timpanogos", "date": "Monday, November 30, 2015", "text": "It was about 27 or 28 degrees outside and I was just starting to shovel some snow off our steep driveway when I looked at this gorgeous view of the top of Mount Timpanogos. I had to run in and get my camera so I could take this shot before the clouds closed in and it started to snow again. Lovely time of the day to be out and about. I really do like snow."},
{"title": "Western Desert Mountains of Utah", "date": "Sunday, November 29, 2015", "text": "One of the most interesting things about living along the Wasatch Front is that all of the towns and people are plastered along the western edge of the mountains from Nephi to Logan. If you drive west, within a few minutes you will leave Utah Valley and cross over into the western deserts. This area is characterized by huge valleys with hardly any development and just a few roads. The roads are mainly dirt with one or two exceptions. This is called the Basin and Range Province. The huge flat valleys are in between long north/south lines of hills and mountains. The valleys or basins are usually treeless and are covered in a sea of sage brush. It is one of my favorite places because of the vast open areas and the fact that there are so few people. Not that I would like to live there, but it is appealing in its emptiness."},
{"title": "At Home", "date": "Saturday, November 28, 2015", "text": "Everywhere I go there are scenes that tell a story. The furniture in this image correspond to the type of chairs and tables that were prevalent when I was much younger. Usually, they were single pieces handed down from a grandparent. We have a table very similar to this one in our home today that came from a grandparent. I still have several hurricane lamps similar to the one in photo. These items are old enough to be considered part of a museum."},
{"title": "Corona around the Moon", "date": "Friday, November 27, 2015", "text": "This is a photo of the moon shortly after it rose over the mountains to the east. There is a scattering of high clouds that were moving rapidly from the right to the left in the photo. The colors in the corona were quite distinct. You can also see some faint moondogs, light effects at right angles. These appear as faint purplish spots at the 12:00, 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 positions around the moon. There is also a faint double corona effect."},
{"title": "Self Portrait in Reflection", "date": "Thursday, November 26, 2015", "text": "I was walking by the Harmon Building on the Brigham Young University campus and decided to take a self portrait. I guess I am indicating that the world is very big and I am a very small part of it. It also shows how present the mountains are in this world of the Utah Valley. We had an interesting conversation about the mountains. One of my daughters said she could never figure out why it was called Utah Valley because she could not see the mountains on the west side. Well, there are mountains to the west, but they are not nearly as imposing as the Wasatch Front to the east. Provo is in a valley, in fact, the entire area is called the Great Basin because there is no river drainage outside of the valleys. All of the water flows ultimately into the Great Salt Lake."},
{"title": "Frost", "date": "Wednesday, November 25, 2015", "text": "The last few days have been both very cold and very warm. We have had highs close to the 60s and lows in the 20s. This one morning the temperature dropped into the mid-20s and the ground was frozen and I noticed that frost had decorated the Vinca outside my window. I took a quick photo or two, but this was the only one that came out showing the frost. I am going to watch more closely in the future, perhaps we will see some more of the work of this fierce artificer."},
{"title": "Timp Sunset", "date": "Tuesday, November 24, 2015", "text": "I am usually up in the morning when it is still pitch dark so I do get to see a lot of sunrises. Unfortunately, I am usually busy in the evenings and miss most of the sunsets. This was one of the exceptions. We were driving back home and I could see the last of the sun on the high mountains to the east. But I got home in time to pull out the camera and take a shot of the mountain from my front yard. The color faded within two or three minutes of this photo."},
{"title": "Hay Rake", "date": "Monday, November 23, 2015", "text": "This is a horse drawn hay rake. I often see old, abandoned farm equipment such as this permanently parked on the side of the road.

This particular hay rake is sometimes referred to as a horse drawn bull or  rake."},
{"title": "The Needles", "date": "Sunday, November 22, 2015", "text": "This is the visible edge of the Needles Section of Canyonlands National Park. If you want to explore this area further, you will have to walk or go by 4-wheel drive vehicle. The needles are formed by differential weathering caused by erosion due to mechanical abrasion and freezing water in cracks. These sandstone formations are constantly changing, but at a rate that is so slow, that most changes are not visible during a lifetime. It is not unusual to see rocks fall or break away, especially if you spend a lot of time in the sandstone."},
{"title": "Canyonlands: The Needles Section", "date": "Saturday, November 21, 2015", "text": "The Needles Section of Canyonlands National Park, Utah is all but inaccessible except for 4-wheel drive, high clearance vehicles. Canyonlands National Park is divided into three distinct areas by the Colorado and Green Rivers. I am most familiar with the section called the Island in the Sky which is adjacent to Dead Horse Point State Park, The other section called, the Maze, is even more remote. I have driven a thousands of miles on the back roads of Arizona and Utah. There are few places I could not get to in Arizona with my 2-wheel drive truck, but there are lots of places in Utah that really do require 4-wheel drive vehicles."},
{"title": "Canyonlands Sunrise", "date": "Friday, November 20, 2015", "text": "This is another one of those photos that needs to be viewed in a larger size to see the detail in the wood.

But you don't have to go to Arches to see fabulous landscapes."},
{"title": "Slick Rock Rocks", "date": "Thursday, November 19, 2015", "text": "Here is the big question. How did these large sandstone boulders get on top of this section of slick rock? I guess you might speculate that these particular boulders just happen to be slightly more resistant to erosion than the huge expanse of slick rock but that just raises another series of questions as to why the slick rock erodes to an almost level surface. If you are walking on this sandstone, it is not really \"slick.\" It is actually quite rough and easy to walk on. It might be slick in wet weather or if it were covered in ice, but that begs the issue."},
{"title": "The Last of the Sunset", "date": "Wednesday, November 18, 2015", "text": "The days are shorter and shorter so it seems that the sunsets are coming around faster each day. Sometimes the light is almost gone when the last of the color is still in the clouds. I liked the very pastel look of this cloud and tried to capture it before the last of the light was gone. Not only are the days getting shorter, but it is colder, so if I run outside to take a photo without a coat, I soon decide that it wasn't a very good idea.My wife and I stood outside near our home a while ago and watched a hang glider circle overhead. I realized that he or she was going to pass right over the very visible Y on the side of Y Mount and I waited to take the shot until both the glider and the Y were together. It was a beautiful clear day, but late in the afternoon and I am sure that the glider pilot was bundled up because of the cold.

Within a short time, they had all been piled up and were on their way to becoming compost. Sometimes extraordinary events are the most transitory."},
{"title": "Snowfall Out My Window", "date": "Monday, November 16, 2015", "text": "The first major snowfall of the winter of 2015-2016 finally showed up in mid-November. Snow accumulations were not very significant this early in the morning, but it was scheduled to continue all day. The little Maple tree that had such beautiful Fall leaves looks pretty cold and sad in the snow. The vinca menor never loses its bright green color, all through the winter. The trees that have yet to lose their leaves, may also lose some branches. It looks like travel will be interesting today."},
{"title": "The Fallen", "date": "Sunday, November 15, 2015", "text": "The last of the leaves are now falling to the ground outside my window. The background is vinca minor also known as Periwinkle or sometimes Myrtle. This vinca minor plant grows rapidly all over the hillside next to our house. The tree that dropped these leaves is most likely a Sugar Maple. It was probably planted here since it is not a native to the Wasatch Front."},
{"title": "The Last of the Leaves", "date": "Saturday, November 14, 2015", "text": "I have one lone tree out my window that still has Fall leaves. They won't last. The weather is changing and it was in the 20s last night. All of the leaves will soon be dropping to the ground. This is the hillside that starts about ten feet from the foundation of our house. It is the pre-historic bench or beach of the huge Lake Bonneville that filled all these Utah valleys thousands of years ago. It consists of huge pile of dirt and rocks but the trees grow very well and when the leaves fall, we can see the houses perched above us on the level part of the bench. I will miss the cheerful color of this small tree, but I will soon see new leaves in the Spring."},
{"title": "Leaf Lines", "date": "Friday, November 13, 2015", "text": "Some people have crop circles and there are strange drawings in the deserts of Arizona and Peru, but we have leaf lines.

{"title": "Snow Frosting", "date": "Thursday, November 12, 2015", "text": "This late Fall weather has been warm and sunny and cold and snowy. We keep expecting a lasting snow fall on the mountains but the days have warmed up into the 50s and 60s and all the snow disappears. The last of the leaves are just now turning yellow and red. Some have already fallen and the trees are bare. Watching the seasons change seems to make time pass more quickly. In the low desert, the changes are more subtle and the contrast is between warm and hot. We spent quite a bit of time out buying up cold weather clothes this year. It isn't certain we will need to use some of them. We keep getting record heat."},
{"title": "Mountain Snow", "date": "Wednesday, November 11, 2015", "text": "The last few days we have had rain and rain mixed with snow. For the first time this season, the mountains have been covered with snow. We even had a skiff of snow cover the lawns and some of the rooftops. The temperatures dropped to almost freezing so it was touch and go whether or not the roads would start freezing and the snow would start sticking to the roads. The clouds were so low that the mountains were hardly visible but when the weather cleared up, they were coated with snow. Then it got warm quickly and most of the snow in the lower elevations melted. The snow level stayed at about 8000 or so feet up the mountains. We live so far up the side of the mountain that it was snowing when I left the house and by the time I drove for two minutes down the hill the snow had stopped and the sky was almost clear. This morning all the snow around our house had melted except for the persistent cold area next to the mountain the is in perpetual shade this time of year."},

Almost any time it looks like this is not the time to go hiking. This is doubly true when the weather is threatening with rain. The rocks are almost an abstract. This whole landscape looks surreal.

{"title": "Ghost Hands", "date": "Saturday, November 7, 2015", "text": "These outlines of painted hands in Canyonlands National Park are a common element in rock art. This type of rock art is usually a negative image of the hand, that is, the paint shows the hand blocking the paint. These are unusual because the hands are colored and also shown in \"ghost\" images with internal details as if the hands were transparent. This type of painting has also been called x-ray painting."},
{"title": "Rock Art", "date": "Friday, November 6, 2015", "text": "Ancient rock painting is distinctive from petroglyphs. Petroglyphs are carved into the rock surface. Rock painting is far less permanent and quite rare compared to the number of preserved petroglyphs. The conditions that will preserve the very fragile painted images over hundreds and sometimes thousands of years are usually confined to caves or protected rock overhangs. You can see the moisture seeping into this overhang as is evident from the ferns and moss growing in the cracks. The paintings are faint but evident from the reddish colored substance used as paint."},

The southeast section of the Park is called the Needles District and these are the Needles. As you can see, the country is extremely rough and there are only a very few roads accessible without a dedicated 4-wheel drive vehicle with very high road clearance and a very low gear ratio. Even hiking on foot is a challenge since there are no \"direct\" routes as you can probably guess from the image above. By the way, this is wonderful playground for a bunch of older children, you just have to be very careful that no one gets lost."},
{"title": "Canyonlands", "date": "Wednesday, November 4, 2015", "text": "This image says it all. There is probably no other place on earth that has the color and variety of the Canyonlands.

{"title": "Sunrise", "date": "Tuesday, November 3, 2015", "text": "I generally get up well before sunrise. While camping in Canyonlands National Park, I wandered off into the desert until I had a good view of the horizon. As the sun came up, I was fascinated with the colors and the way the light changed from minute to minute. It is hard to get a feeling for the sun in this situation because it tends to blow out the camera's sensors. But the resulting colors for the rest of the image compensate for the part of the image that is overexposed by the sun. I could have cropped the image to remove the overexposed portion, but I thought that there needed to be a feeling for the impact the sun itself has on the image."},
{"title": "The Coming Storm", "date": "Monday, November 2, 2015", "text": "I had an unusual opportunity recently. I was waiting out in the middle of the desert for a couple of hours with nothing to do but wait. I had no Internet connection so I was not able to be absorbed in my usual activities. So, as I sat there waiting, I took a series of photos of my surroundings as the light failed and night came on. This was one of the photos. It is a radical departure from most of my landscapes because by this time of the evening, I would have already given up on the light and stopped taking photos. But with little else to do, this is what I saw."},

{"title": "Buttes and Peaks", "date": "Saturday, October 31, 2015", "text": "Every part of the Colorado Plateau could be a photograph. This shot was taken with a long telephoto lens and so the various features shown are really separated by long open spaces. I am guessing that the sharp butte you can see in the center is about three to fours miles away from where I was standing. By road, it is more like ten to fifteen miles away. Distances are deceiving. When I was very young, I took a walk towards a cliff that I considered to be only a short distance away and soon found myself a long way from where I started and no much closer to the cliff."},

We have stayed in a campground where this rock formation was visible on two occasions. The rock itself is not all that accessible. Distances in the canyons can be very deceiving. There is a large canyon between where I was standing and the Wooden Shoe and it would take a long walk and a technical climb to get to the small arch in the formation."},

{"title": "Wandering on the slickrock", "date": "Wednesday, October 28, 2015", "text": "There are places on the Colorado Plateau where you can walk for miles on nearly level sandstone. This phenomena is collectively called slickrock. There are vast areas where the rock makes an uneven paved surface and nothing grows. Mostly the slickrock is broken into huge sections and in the cracks between there are trees and other plants growing. This is a bizarre world of canyons, cliffs and rock outcroppings all made of sandstone."},
{"title": "Canyonlands National Park", "date": "Tuesday, October 27, 2015", "text": "I was talking to some neighbors the other day and mentioned that we were camping in Canyonlands National Park. I was surprised when they said they had never heard of it. I have been camping in and around Canyonlands for about 40 years and that is about the entire history of the National Park since it was created in 1964, just a few short years before my first visit. Almost any direction you point a camera you have a wonderful shot."},

{"title": "Sunset in Kodachrome Basin", "date": "Sunday, October 25, 2015", "text": "I never tire of the wealth of land forms in Utah and Arizona. Why should I travel to exotic places when some of the most remarkable and exotic are in my own backyard? Kodachrome Basin in Southern Utah is one of the most remarkable of all those locations. It is only the vagaries of politics that keeps this and many similar locations from becoming National Parks. Although, I would not be in favor of declaring all these areas as National Parks simply because to do so would attract many more visitors, most of whom would come simply because the area was declared a National Park and not for the scenery or solitude."},
{"title": "The Attraction of Waterfalls", "date": "Friday, October 23, 2015", "text": "I have hiked miles into the Grand Canyon in Arizona just to get a view of a waterfall. There are some places in the world where waterfalls are so abundant that they don't even have names. I guess the difference between those areas that are so wet and others that are so dry is what makes up most of my fascination with the outdoors. I would doubt that anyone travels miles in Alaska just to see this particular waterfall, but if this same waterfall were in Arizona, it would be one of the major tourist attractions of the state."},
{"title": "Alaskan Coast", "date": "Wednesday, October 21, 2015", "text": "Impressive mountain ranges form much of the western coast of Alaska. The mountains seem to rise right out of the ocean. From an absolute standard, they aren't very high, but they are snow-covered and rugged. I try to imagine what these mountains would look like if they were in Arizona or Utah, but all I can see in my mind is rocks and desert. Don't get me wrong. I live on the doorstep of the Wasatch Mountains right now, but the snow hasn't come and they still look like big piles of gravel with a few rocks. There are majestic views in both Arizona and Utah where winter snows make the mountains look impressive, but this photo was taken in the middle of the summer, when snow in both Utah and Arizona is merely a dream."},
{"title": "Canyonlands Near Sunset", "date": "Tuesday, October 20, 2015", "text": "I climbed up to the top of one the lower rock outcroppings and spent some time taking photos of the rocks as the sun began to set.

I could see that the sun was just beginning to rise but the only light I could see was on the high clouds overhead.

{"title": "Blue and Red Hills of the Painted Desert", "date": "Wednesday, October 14, 2015", "text": "If I were going to choose one photo that most characterized what I think of when I think of \"home,\" this would be a likely candidate. Although I am very happy to be living next to a mountain, I still retain an affinity with the nearly flat, wide open, Colorado Plateau. This part of the Plateau is commonly called the Painted Desert. When I was young, we lived near some of these bentonite hills and we called them the \"Blue Hills\" because they really were blue. This section has more red than blue. I would not hesitate at all to walk out into this countryside and carefully study the ground for pieces of petrified wood and other treasures. Of course, this photo was taken inside what is now the Petrified Forest National Park and I wouldn't be picking up any such treasures. But, the Park in only a small part of the huge Plateau and I can still find areas to search."},

The building is obviously a replica and not the original. I was interested in the split log technique used by those who built the replica. This particular replica is located south of Montrose in Lee County along the Mississippi River.

It is still over 80 degrees during the day, and I am beginning to believe in Global Warming, but I guess the trees are starting to turn out of habit rather than Fall weather. I usually look at the weather reports ten days in advance but I don't see a dramatic change coming for a while. I just might get in a few more flower photos before the snow flies."},

You just have to wait around for a while with butterflies. They are less predictable than birds and other animals, but all of them are a lot harder to photograph than plants.Geese are some of the few birds that do not become alarmed until you get quite close. It helps to have a telephoto lens, but some interesting images can be taken by just walking up very slowly and standing still to take a photo. You have to wonder why these birds were so intent off into the distance, with me standing right there taking photos."},

{"title": "Early Morning Reflections", "date": "Tuesday, September 29, 2015", "text": "I guess it is time to travel back to the desert and take a few photos that don't look like lakes and mountains. You might notice that there are a lot of dead trees in these photos. This is due to a huge infestation of bark beetles killing off the pine and fir trees. The die-off is very bad in Colorado and parts of Arizona. Some of the hillsides in the Uintas have more than half of the trees dead. The infection is due to the stress caused by higher temperatures and drought. There are new trees growing, but it will take a while (if ever) before the forest looks more alive.The late evening sun was slanting across the carpet of fallen leaves and I was impressed by both the color and the contrast. The trees have yet to turn completely, but they are already losing their leaves and Winter is just around the corner."},

These leaves almost made it to red, but they are still mostly yellow. None of the temperatures have been low enough to make the leaves change except in the higher slopes of the mountains. I have enjoyed to beautiful summer weather but I am ready for Fall and the colorful leaves.Big Spring is a Provo City Park up the South Fork Canyon just east of the city in the Wasatch Mountains. It is a lovely picnic area and the site of our now annual Fall picnic. After the sun went down behind the mountains, the temperature dropped and it was the first time we needed sweaters since the weather warmed up in the Spring. The weather has been quite warm and the children were still wading in the creek, but that warm weather will likely come to an end very soon."},
{"title": "Unusual Flowers", "date": "Sunday, September 27, 2015", "text": "Continued warm weather here in Utah Valley means that we still have flowers. I noticed that the ground crew at Brigham Young University was pulling out the summer flowers and planting the cold hardy varieties. They were also planting next spring's tulip bulbs. We're supposed to have warm weather into October and I suppose that 90° weather is considered warm. I do not believe I have seen the flowers in this photo before. Any ideas? Coleus has leaves that rival some types of flowers. Abundant coleus plants are almost the exact opposite to vegetation. Although I did see a few shaded plantings in the low desert, the plants are much more popular in the more temperate climate. The extreme heat and sun in Mesa make it difficult to grow plants like these. Of course, all these plants will be removed from their decorative plantings or they will freeze solid."},

It was mostly gone by the time the clouds cleared and completely gone by the next day. It seems like Fall is a little slower coming this year. We went up the Provo Canyon to Big Spring for a cookout and had to put on some sweaters for the first time this season. I guess the weather will start to change sometime.One time, while visiting Yellowstone National Park, we saw more than a dozen geysers erupt in a single day. This is the Echinus Geyser and many years ago, we saw a very dramatic eruption of this geyser. But not this time. The main difference between a hot spring and a geyser is the explosive nature of the geyser spring. Some of the geysers erupt almost constantly, others only very rarely. The pattern changes over time depending on earthquakes and other changes in the underlying rocks. I don't ever get to spend enough time in Yellowstone National Park. Now, that I live a lot closer, maybe that will change."},

This summer's highlight was the trip to Canada and the Northern Rockies. I am sure all the waterfalls we saw had names, but there were too many to keep up with. I am sad that many of the areas we visited ended up with huge wildfires. Here in Utah Valley, we got the second-hand smoke from these fires during the latter part of the summer. I am now watching the leaves on the trees outside my window turn yellow, almost one at a time. There is a little more yellow each day since Fall is officially here. It is still strange to have changes agree roughly with the seasons, instead of living in the desert where the leaves are still turning colors in January, just before the new leaves appear."},

One of the \"tourists\" stopped my wife to ask if \"the lake was all that there was to see or do?\" She said, \"Well, yes, we are in a wilderness area.\" He then asked if there was a bar nearby where he could get a drink. She responded with, \"You are in the wrong place in the wrong state.\" I am not sure why some people end up in the mountains. On two of our last trips, we have been stopped by serious accidents. In one case it was a bike rider who fell and in other, it was a climber who was killed in a fall. This seems like a pattern."},

{"title": "Chili Peppers", "date": "Thursday, September 17, 2015", "text": "Eating chili either raw or cooked or even added to a dish, is an acquired taste. When I was very young, my father rented some of our land to some local Spanish-speaking farmers. They planted chili. The plants grew and soon had beautiful chili peppers. I think I was about six or seven years old and had no idea what they were. I asked my father and he said pick one and take a bite. I remember that experience well to this day. But the experience did not give me an incentive to eat anything with chili for a long time. Later, when I was a Boy Scout, our troop stopped off for lunch at a small, Mexican restaurant. This was my first encounter with real \"Mexican\" food. I looked at the menu and decided that only thing I recognized was a tamale. I found out why they call them \"hot tamales.\" It took me a many more years before I would agree to eat anything labeled Mexican. Now, I have acquired a taste for chilis in whatever form. For a long time, we grew chili plants and I ate them raw in salads."},
{"title": "Fall Leaves in the Wasatch", "date": "Wednesday, September 16, 2015", "text": "With the dramatic changes in elevation and therefore temperature and other climate conditions, the Wasatch Mountains of Utah demonstrate seasonal changes in various stages at the same time. Here we have green leaves, dried grass and brightly colored leaves on the hillside. The colored leaves are on the north facing slopes and show more color than those slopes facing in other directions. At the same time, you can see the effect of a small change in elevation. The vegetation at the bottom of the canyon are still in late Summer mode, while the ridges are moving well into Fall. The colored leaves on the hills will be gone about the time the lower trees are just turning."},
{"title": "Tent Caterpillars", "date": "Tuesday, September 15, 2015", "text": "I have always been fascinated by tent caterpillars. When I was very young, I could not understand why there were masses of silken spiderwebs in the trees. At some point, I finally realized that the webs were spun by masses of caterpillars. Since they eat the leaves of the trees, their webs appear only in certain trees. The caterpillars themselves are of the genus Malacosoma  and the moth family Lasiocampidae. The Lasiocampidae have over 2000 species and are not all discovered or classified. Those who arrived early in America had few choices for fence construction. They could use rocks or wood. Fortunately, there were lots of both. One of the most common early fence construction methods was the split rail. A farmer could clear his land of trees and build a fence the same time. This particular fences in North Carolina but there are similar fences built in Arizona and Utah."},

You can read about it on this link. We took a hike up Grove Creek Canyon near Pleasant Grove, Utah to view the flag.Fall in the Wasatch Mountains is far different than the brilliant displays of color in the North East or other mountain areas. The colors are more pastel and the mountains are very hazy due to a lot of wildfires. It is still quite warm and so the trees in the bottom of the canyon have yet to turn. I hope to show the progression of colors as the season advances."},
{"title": "Fall Thistles", "date": "Sunday, September 13, 2015", "text": "These thistles sometimes end up in decorative flower arrangements. I have been interested to see them growing in fields and along the roads in Northern Utah. They have impressive shapes when they dry out in the Fall. This plant is known as Canada Thistle (Cirsium Arvense) and it is another example of an \"invasive plant\" originating in Europe and Asia. It is interesting that the roots and stalks are both edible (of course before they dry out in the Fall). So here we have a beautiful, edible plant that is considered a noxious, invasive weed. Interesting."},

Similar landscapes are often referred to as \"Bad Lands\" but they are anything but bad, they are just not suited for agriculture; the main and sometimes only criteria by which the early settlers viewed the value of this country. Now great stretches of the painted desert are \"preserved\" in National Parks and Monuments. The land is rich in ancient fossils and the color and form of the land is remarkable. It is desert, but it is far from bad or useless."},

I am glad someone takes the time to do the work and that there are those who would pay them to do it. This image falls into the category of background images. Most computer-based devices have a way to incorporate a photo as a background image for the operating system.

Because of its association with a pernicious weed, the ornamental variety of Morning Glory is very seldom planted. Morning Glory is not a common weed in the lower deserts but here in Utah it is very common and is usually referred to by the name \"binder weed.\"  I have to admit that I have pulled incipient morning glory out of the flowerbeds. It must say something, when two of my favorite flowers, morning glory and dandelions, are considered to be weeds.I have been told, that when I was very young I called these insects \"hopper grasses\" instead of grasshoppers. From this family story, I would assume that grasshoppers have been part of my life even before my memory of them. I am aware that both grasshoppers and ants re: this food. Although I can say that I am not a habit of doing so. I am not sure if these grasshoppers were merely sitting on the yellow flower or actually eating it, but I did notice them. Many photographers prefer a \"macro\" lens for this type of close-up work, but if you are walking around taking photos, you may not have either the time or the availability of a lens to change. In this case, before was taken with a telephoto lens setting.I only catch hummingbirds with my camera once and while. Most of the images are so blurred as to be unrecognizable. This was an exception. But the flower was so white, that the detail was lost. Oh well, not all photos are the perfect ones you see highly manipulated online. Even on a bright, sunny day, the camera speed was not enough to stop the movement of the hummingbird's wings."},

Cactus are one kind of very specialized plant. The general category of plants that are adapted to harsh, dry conditions are succulents, that is, plants that store some of their water in their leaves or other modified plant parts. I found these particularly interesting succulents at the Thanksgiving Point Garden, far from a traditional desert looking setting. Not all succulents are suited for hot, dry climates. Some require much cooler weather. There are about 60 different plant families that contain succulents. Here are some resources for finding out about these amazing plants:  Andersohn, Günter.

It is also right at the edge of the city and so it sort-of reminds me of Papago Park in Phoenix. Of course, it is not desert, but mountains.

{"title": "Water Strider", "date": "Friday, September 4, 2015", "text": "Some of my early memories are of water striders on the water in the irrigation ditches. It always seemed amazing that these creatures could walk on the surface of the water. This particular water strider is joined by some tiny flies, although they might be mosquitoes. This particular insect is a member of the Gerridae family. There are over 1,700 species of gerrids and 10% of those are marine and 90% are fresh water bugs. They are true bugs in the Hemiptera order. Water striders use the high surface tension of water and long, hydrophobic legs to help them stay above water. See Wikipedia: Gerridae.

This impressive mountain ranges most popularly known as the \"Wasatch Front\" because the majority of the population of Utah lives along its western flank in a series of valleys. Since I presently live about 200 yards from the steep mountain face of the Wasatch Front, it is pretty much part of my daily life. In fact, as I look out my window I am looking at the steep hillside of the Lake Bonneville shoreline. In less than half an hour, I can be driving on the Alpine Loop with use like that one shown in today's photo."},

These are about the last of the blooms. Many of the roses have already stopped blooming and are covered with \"rose hips,\" or the fruit of the rose bush. I have not tried to eat one, but I know they are edible. They are very high in Vitamin A. I used to grow quite a few roses, but now we live in a condo and the landscaping is all provided by the association.

Living in the low desert, we had seasons and I did realize that the cactus bloomed in March and April and some on into June, but for the most part, annual flowers were in the background. Here in Utah, we have definite flower seasons. There are flowers that are actually planted in the middle of the winter and others that bloom in the spring, summer and into the fall. Sunflowers appear in August. I guess I had associated to change of the seasons with Fall leaves rather than flowers."},
{"title": "Chile Peppers", "date": "Saturday, August 29, 2015", "text": "I have acquired a taste for chile peppers over the years. They are rated according to the \"Scoville\" scale of hotness. A mild chile pepper might rate below 500 on Scoville scale. But a hot pepper can reach to the stratosphere of hotness with the Bhut Jolokia pepper at over a million. The latest world record holder for the hottest chile is the Carolina Reaper. I thought it might be interesting to see what Wikipedia had to say about this chile:The Carolina Reaper, originally named the HP22BNH7, is a cultivar of chili pepper of theCapsicum chinense species. Bred in a Rock Hill, South Carolina greenhouse by Ed Currie, who runs the PuckerButt Pepper Company in Fort Mill, South Carolina, it has been rated as the world's hottest chili pepper by Guinness World Records since August 7, 2013.[1][2] The original crossbreed was between a ghost pepper (a former world record holder) and a red habanero.[3] It averages a 1,569,300 on the Scoville scale with peak levels of over 2,200,000 Scoville Heat Units (SHU). Recently, there has been some debate over whether the Carolina Reaper is genetically distinct from the Trinidad 7-Pot Primo strain, another hybrid species of Caribbean chile which is very similar in heat level and appearance. There are YouTube challenges about eating these.[4] At the 2nd Annual New York City Hot Sauce Expo on 30 March 2014, Ed Currie was presented with his world record by Guinness World Records and an eating competition was held in which the fastest time to consume three Carolina Reapers was determined for a new Guinness World Records at 12.23 seconds by Russel Todd.[5][6]I left in all the links in case you want to try some of this type of pepper yourself."},

From my perspective, the water didn't look all that inviting, but if I ate bugs for a living, I suppose that the quality of the water would not be an important consideration. I am not sure that the frog's passive hunting tactic was getting him anywhere, since I did not see him so much as blink an eye while I took his photo. No, I did not get a model release from him so I suppose he could come back and sue me."},
{"title": "Zinnias ", "date": "Thursday, August 27, 2015", "text": "When I think of flowers, I usually do not think of zinnias. They are colorful and have lovely shapes, but they seem to me to be planted merely for the purpose of having a spot of color. If they were not so common, they would be spectacular. But they are usually planted in large beds that hide the individual flowers in a swatch of color. It is interesting that those who sell seeds, classify zinnias for the \"beginning gardner.\" Of course, the implication is that any experienced gardner would not spend his or her time planting zinnias. Why is this the case? I would be glad if anything I planted grew. I have spent a long time gardening. I was once considered an \"expert\" and taught classes around the community on gardening, but I would still plant zinnias.I began wondering about the seasons. Since most of my adult life has been spent living in the low desert of Arizona, we only had two real seasons; hot and warm. Snow was a novelty and almost completely unknown except on very rare occasions. Last year, I was surprised to see this snow on Mount Timpanogos in August. This year has been warmer without the cold snap that gave us snow on the mountains. But I can see that that weather predictions indicate that the temperatures are dropping and Autumn is just around the corner. I will try not to get so busy this year that I miss the changes as they come."},

I speculated that they must have been planted, but there they were.I spent a greater part of my life living in and around Phoenix, Arizona. This photo has two Arizona icons, a shaded view of a saguaro cactus and the outline of the famous Camelback Mountain. We used to climb the cliffs that make up the head of the camel. We had to get up about 4:00 am and get to the cliffs in the dark. We would climb until about 10:00 am or so, when the rocks reached about 150 degrees and you had to wear gloves to climb because the rocks would burn your hands. When I lived in Mesa, I really couldn't see the mountain, but whenever I drove into Phoenix, which was frequently, there it was, looming on the edge of the city. I guess now, you would consider Camelback to be right in the middle of the city."},

We usually calculate the route by looking at the milage and the possibility of road construction. One option is to drive through Page, Arizona and cross the Colorado River at the Glen Canyon Dam. This last trip, I took several shots of the lake and this one, showing the Wahweap Marina in the background. The distances and light conditions make this a difficult shot. On the way down to Mesa, the air was full of smoke from the fires in the Northwest. On this day, it was relatively clear, but there was still a hint of haze."},

{"title": "A Typical Hanging Glacier", "date": "Sunday, August 23, 2015", "text": "Where I now live in Provo, Utah, I can see the effects of the glaciers on the mountains. When we recently went around to the backside of Mount Timpanogos, we could see the huge glacial cirque that created the summit ridge. Years ago, there was a permanent snow field in that huge cirque. Some argued that it was the most southern of the glaciers in Utah, but glacier or not, it is almost entirely gone due to the change in the climate. In ancient times, the back and front of Timpanogos probably looked a lot like this Alaskan glacier. Last year, we had very little snow in Utah Valley and they are predicting that this year there might be even less. I guess all the comments we endured about moving to the north and snow will not come true for at least another year or so or never."},

Lichen is a composite organism that arises from algae or cyanobacteria (or both) living among filaments of a fungus in a symbiotic relationship. See Wikipedia: Lichen. Lichen is not a plant. There are over 20,000 known species of lichen, but I suspect that there are many more yet to be classified or even discovered. I always notice the lichen.

My recent trip to Canada reminded me of the ocean even though we spent all of our time in the mountains. This is my kind of beach. It has character and not just sand and water. I realize that the ideal beach is usually portrayed with white sand and sun, but I like the overcast skies, with a stiff breeze blowing off the water and a lot of drift wood and rocks to walk on and look at. In short, this beach is very close to my ideal."},
{"title": "Mountain Majesty", "date": "Wednesday, August 19, 2015", "text": "When I was young, I used to dream about climbing high mountains, preferably covered with ice and snow. I still dream, but the dreams are tempered with the reality of climbing in ice and snow since I have climbed my share of the mountains of the western part of the United States. On of my grandsons just climbed the highest peak in Utah. I still feel like I could do that, but feeling and doing are two different things. We were going to climb Mount Timpanogos in the Wasatch Mountains recently, but we got rained out. I can still remember the first time I climbed to the top of rather prominent hill in Eastern Arizona called Cinder Knoll. It was a windy day in the summer when I was just about eight years old. When I got to the top, I felt like I could see forever. There were a few clouds on the horizon and my father, who had let me run up the hill alone, was climbing the hill calling to me to come down. He was afraid I would be struck by lightning. He was probably correct, but the feeling of being on the top of the world gave me a lifetime of climbing mountains, both real and figurative."},

This is from a high ridge in Glacier National Park. Right now, this view might be hard to get with all the smoke from the fires that are burning. I like this little island. It is not quite large enough to think about living on, but one can always dream."},
{"title": "A Mountain Pool", "date": "Monday, August 17, 2015", "text": "You might have to look closely at this image and perhaps click on it to enlarge it on your screen to see that the water is practically coated with tiny insects. With the right light, the air here in the mountains was practically saturated with bugs. Most of them were so small, I really could not tell if they were mosquitos or flies, but they did not bite fortunately, so I didn't look too closely at them. They were so small, that I imagine I ingested a few in walking around in the cloud.A 2000th of a second may seem very fast, but it is just barely fast enough to stop the action of water cascading down a hillside in the Wasatch Mountains. The interesting thing about this image is that even a split second later the whole image would have changed to something similar but completely different. The speed of the camera lets us see into the nearly invisible world that is all around us. We seldom see any detail at all in a stream or waterfall. We get the impression that there is movement but the complexity of that movement is completely lost by our own eyes. It takes the high speed shutter of the camera to freeze that movement in a way we can appreciate what is going on."},

There are several very active fossil quarries, including several commercial ones open to the public. It also has Dinosaur National Monument on the eastern border of the state with Colorado. I once considered becoming a paleontologist, but moved on to linguistics and ultimately law. That doesn't stop me from having an active interest in geology and other earth sciences. I monitor the geology blogs for both Arizona and Utah. This particular dinosaur skeleton is in the Thanksgiving Point Museum of Ancient Life, one of the best in the entire country in my opinion.I realize that this image is not one of my landscapes or animal photos, but I could not resist the color and texture of these freshly canned peaches. These bottles come from the efforts of one of my daughters. I love peaches and it is always a treat to have canned peaches when they are out of season. Somehow, home canned peaches taste so much better than those that come in cans. My wife's family was very much involved in canning all sorts of fruits and vegetables. Of course, my own involvement has been limited to a support function, if that, but I do enjoy eating the fruits of their labors. Depending on their circumstances, my sons and daughters and their families have carried on the tradition of canning and preserving. It is nice to know that some of these basic survival skills are still being passed along to a few of those in our highly commercialized world."},

Rising thousands of feet from the valley floor, this is one of the more dramatic mountain views in Utah. Getting a perspective of the mountain comes when you drive to the east and look back at the mountain from the eastern part of the state. The tops of the mountains you can see on the right side of this image is the summit ridge of Mount Timpanogos. This vies gives an entirely different perspective on the mountain and its relation to the rest of the mountains in the Wasatch Range.

We are not excitable folks and I just asked her to stand up and look at the snake. She immediately got out her iPhone and started sending Instagrams to her children. A typical family reaction to a surprising situation. I checked the following source:Pack, Herbert J., \"Bulletin No. 221 - Snakes of Utah\" (1930). UAES Bulletins. Paper 182.http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/uaes_bulletins/182 and quickly identified the snake as a Utah gopher snake, Pituophis catenifer stejnegeri. There was a large group of people coming down the trail, including a number of small children, and for the snake's protection and theirs, we encouraged the snake to move off of the log and out into the grass."},

I can look out almost any window and see them rising precipitously to the east. The dramatic view of the mountains from the valleys is often referred to as the Wasatch Front that includes all of the cities and towns from Mount Nebo on the south, north to the Idaho border. The advantage of living so close to the mountains is that when I have a free afternoon, we can take a bike ride up Provo Canyon or drive into the mountains on the Alpine Loop. There are a number of remarkable areas including a huge natural spring area called Cascade Spring. There is a distinct contrast between driving out into the desert (especially in the Summer) and driving out into the mountains. I miss the desert, but I welcome the change to the high mountains."},

When I got back to camp, I did get to eat because the rest of the family got up a lot later and got breakfast. It is a remarkable experience to see the way that the light changes during the day. As I sit and review my photos on my computer at home, I can look out the window and see a thick forest of trees. There are plum trees, maples, box elders, oaks and some I am still meaning to look up and identify. But what is impressive is the way that the light changes on the leaves during the day. Since I live right next to a steep hill and in the shadow of the mountains, the sun does not \"rise\" until late in the morning. But I do get the last rays of light in the evening. Here in this photo, I was standing across the lake from the campfire. At first, I thought that the smoke was a fog or haze, but after I looked at the photo, I realized it was a campfire. I liked the way the trees and the smoke were reflected in the lake. I hope you can imagine being there."},

{"title": "Glacier National Park, Montana", "date": "Monday, August 10, 2015", "text": "In our, now not so recent, visit to Glacier National Park, the scenery was magnificent as usual. The challenge was that the park has only two access roads. The recent fires in the Park have highlighted the challenge that visitors face: lack of access and lack of adequate parking. There is a Park shuttle service, but the parking for the shuttle is inadequate and the service is not nearly enough to make a dent in all the people visiting the Park and trying to park their cars in the very limited space available. This is the same challenge faced by Yosemite National Park. Both Parks are essentially traffic jams on a busy day during the summer. Zion National Park and the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park have solved the problem by excluding cars altogether from the Parks. The shuttle system at both Zion and the Grand Canyon work wonderfully. The Parks are much safer and more orderly than the mob scenes at Glacier and Yosemite. Even though our last visit to Zion was marked by a huge crowd in the Narrows, the visit was not marred by traffic jams. In Glacier, there should be a much greater effort to provide shuttle service that matches the need. There should also be a much higher fee for parking in the Park outside of the shuttle areas. Since the main road, like the one in Zion, is used for crossing the Park, there should be a crossing permit that does not allow parking, either free or at a reduced rate. Right now, Glacier and Yosemite are on my list as the worst run Parks in America."},

The summit of Bald Mountain is 11,943 feet above sea level and is considered to be one of the easiest mountains in Utah to summit.

You would never know that U-shaped valleys were once very controversial. There was a time, not too long ago, when even scientists were skeptical of the fact that these broad U-shaped features originated with glaciers. The first scientific studies connecting these unique landforms to glaciers occurred in the early 1800s. A natural scientist named Jean de Charpentier, and a Scandinavian scientist named Jens Esmark, elaborated theories that certain types of landforms, including these distinctive U-shaped valleys, originated with huge sheets of ice. After overcoming his original disbelief, the theory was much expanded by Louis Agassiz, a famous Swiss Zoologist. Agassiz's theorized that most of the Northern Hemisphere had once been covered with vast sheets of ice. Agassiz's theory was only confirmed when Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian, and five others, finally crossed the Greenland ice field and confirmed Agassiz's predictions.

The glacier part of the Park is now an anomaly. All of the glaciers are rapidly melting and are estimated to be gone in the next several decades. Back in 1850, it is estimated that there were approximately 150 glaciers, by 2010, the number had dropped to 25 glaciers larger than 25 acres. See the U.S. Geologic Survey, \"Retreat of Glaciers in Glacier National Park\" Quoting from the USGS article:While the glaciers that carved GNP’s majestic peaks were part of a glaciation that ended about 12,000 years ago, current glaciers are considered geologically new, having formed about ~7,000 thousand years ago. These glaciers grew substantially during the Little Ice Age (LIA) that began around 1400 A.D and reached their maximum size at the end of the LIA around A.D.1850. Their maximum sizes can be inferred from the mounds of rock and soil left behind by glaciers, known as moraines (Key, 2002), which provide a scientific baseline for comparison to current glacial extent.It would be simplistic to blame the loss of the glaciers on \"global warming\" but there is no doubt from the climate records that the average temperature in the area of the glaciers is rising. This is a highly politicized and controversial topic, but whether or not you believe in global warming, you only have to go to Glacier National Park to the see the effects on one small area of the world."},

I have seen the same type of herds at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon also.The Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park is one of its most famous attractions. Unfortunately, the Springs have changed considerably since I first saw them as a child. the formations are made of calcium carbonate deposited by the thermal springs with water originating in the Norris Geyser Basin. The water emerges at a temperature of about 170 degrees Fahrenheit or 80 degrees Centigrade. The changes occur steadily with huge amounts of calcium carbonate being deposited every day. Here is a link to Yellowstone Science with photos showing the changes in the Springs over time and indicating that they are not drying up, but are constantly changing."},

The first image is not necessarily an accurate reproduction of what your eye might see if you were looking at the mountains, because you brain would compensate for any seemingly false colors and substitute what it expected to see. The camera cannot make those kinds of value judgments and just ends up reporting what it sees. Since the image is now not the \"reality\" of the actual scene, our eyes do not compensate for the differences in color and we see what the camera saw.I guess when I moved from the low desert to the mountains that I ultimately decided that my life would not be centered around the ocean.

This image is in the middle of the Waterpocket Fold, a huge geologic formation that runs for over a hundred miles down through Central and Southern Utah. The theory is that that this complex formation began as a wrinkle in the rock as North America moved over the Pacific Ocean Plate. This formed a giant monocline, a structure with one steep side and one that is more gradual. If you we took look at these rocks from up in space, they would look like part of a fold with the smooth side to the east and the steep, folded side to the west. These canyons and rock formations formed after the initial uplift.No rock formations in the vast deserts of sandstone are more intriguing than these. I seems almost impossible that erosion alone could have created such delicate and interesting structures. Technically, these are known as \"tafoni.\" They are most commonly found on Entrada and Navajo sandstone, but can be occasionally seen in other types of rocks. Sandstone is porous and as water moves through the rock is dissolves the calcite (Calcium Carbonate or CaCO3) in the rocks. The patterns of the little arches reflect the difference in hardness between the parts of the rock. This is probably a good theory, but it doesn't account for the beauty of the structures."},

Geologists, or more specifically stratigraphers, study the deposition history of the rocks and try to reconstruct how and when the rocks were deposited. They rely on the law of superposition, that non-deformed geologic strata are deposited in a sequence where the older material is deposited on the bottom of the sequence and the the younger material on top. They also assume that the rocks were originally deposited horizontally aka the principle of original horizontality."},

{"title": "Differential Erosion", "date": "Sunday, June 28, 2015", "text": "Erosion can form some of the most remarkable formations. Utah and Arizona both have a complex geologic history. In the more humid areas of the world, much of structure of the rocks and hills is covered with thick vegetation. In the Southwestern part of the United States and on the Colorado Plateau particularly, all of the results of erosion are remarkably evident. These rocks are considered to be part of the Entrada Sandstone of the San Rafael Group and were formed during the Middle Jurassic Epoch, 166 to 174 million years ago. See Wikipedia: Devil's Garden (Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument). The process of differential erosion is described by the Wikipedia article as follows:Daily extreme temperature variations create fractures by repeated expansion and contraction of the rock in a process called thermal stress weathering. The thermal stresses can cause deep cracks that split the rock into separate pieces in an erosional process called thermal exfoliation. Precipitation causes dissolution of the fine crystalline grains that bind the larger particles together, which is known as chemical weathering. Freezing water expands in fractures making them wider and deeper in a process called frost weathering. Gravity exerts a constant downward force that creates new fractures and separates the formations along existing fractures in a process called stress relief exfoliation. High speed winds remove any loose grains from the formations and wind-borne particulates sandblast the surfaces making them smoother.That is why there is a rounded rock sitting in a space between two larger and overhanging rocks."},

In the case of Zion National Park, the icons are the Great White Throne and the Narrows. In this and other views of Zion, I find that the Canyon itself is a great enough attraction. There is no need to resort to standard views. In fact, it is likely that some of the people who have been to Zion over many years may not remember seeing this view."},
{"title": "The Blooming of the Lilies", "date": "Friday, June 26, 2015", "text": "We are being constantly surprised at what is growing around our house in Provo, Utah. The house is surrounded by a nearly solid mass of plants and as the seasons progress, we are finding out that many of the plants have beautiful flowers. We have noticed the lilies blooming around the neighborhood and finally those next to our house began to bloom. We live very close to the side of the prehistoric Lake Bonneville Shoreline, commonly referred to as a \"bench.\" That and the fact that we are right next to the mountains, puts us in the shade until mid-morning, even in the Summer. The snow takes its time melting and the flowers take their time blooming. These red lilies are spectacular. For quite a few years now, I have used three different cameras; my iPhone, a lower cost point-and-shoot and my Canon DSLR. You would have quite a time telling which one I used for which photos since at the resolution of the photos online, it is very difficult to tell the difference. Which camera took this shot? You guess. The iPhone? The Canon? or the new Sony HX400V?"},

I don't think that I got the essential message of the book until many years later when I read it again in English. The author wrote, \"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\" I used to grow roses in Mesa, Arizona and some of them were beautiful. But none of them approached the importance of the Rose in The Little Prince. Over the years, roses became less important to me due mainly to competition from other flowers. I still love roses, but I also love cactus flowers and other Spring flowers. From time to time, I take a photograph of a rose."},

The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss.\" Birds have learned to throw themselves at the ground and miss. I have not yet learned this valuable skill. When I throw myself at the ground, the ground always wins. However, Henry David Thoreau wrote, \"Thank God men cannot fly, and lay waste the sky as well as the earth.\" I do not share his sentiment. Little did  he realize that men would someday fly and miss the entire earth and go into space."},
{"title": "The Promise of Spring", "date": "Tuesday, June 23, 2015", "text": "Although Spring is now gone for this year, we can still retain its promise in our hearts. It may be hard to remember Spring when the temperatures soar and the air loses its clarity. But as is quoted from Lilly Pulitzer the fashion designer, \"Despite the forecast, live like it's spring.\" I just thought it would be nice to remember the flowers. This year with the rain and cool weather, the flowers were exceptionally beautiful. We are making up for the good weather with a warm summer, but we are finding that living in the mountains has its advantages when it comes to hot weather since it always cools off in the evening.Water seeping through the permeable sandstone rocks will sometimes reach a hard, impermeable layer. As the the water flows along the barrier of the harder rock, it may reach the edge of the rock and flow out in a spring or seep. The softer sandstone under the harder rock ledge erodes away and creates an alcove. The presence of the water creates a strong pattern of minerals and algae. In the protected alcoves, miniature jungles of water-loving plants grow in hanging gardens. These hanging gardens are common along the canyon walls in Zion National Park and other concentrated sandstone areas of the Southwest and particularly, the Colorado Plateau. This image dramatically illustrates the effect of the movement of the water along the harder cap of rock and the effect when the water reaches the surface."},
{"title": "Zion Cliffs", "date": "Monday, June 22, 2015", "text": "Zion National Park is a wonderland of cliffs and canyons. It was first designated as Mukuntuweap National Monument in 1909 and later, designated as Zion National Park in 1919. Additional areas were added to the original park in 1937 and 1956. The Park consists of 146,597 acres and ranges in elevation from 3666 feet to 8726 feet above sea level (1117 to 2660 meters). The main rock formations in the Canyon include the predominant Navajo Sandstone formation (most of what you can see in the photo above) and the two foundation layers of Kayenta and Moenave formations. Some of the strata at the very top of the formations belongs to the Sinawava member of the Temple Cap Formation. Lowers portions of the Canyon, such as at the west entrance, extend downward into the Chinle and Moenkopi formations. This image was taken from the pathway up to Weeping Rock."},

Later in the day, the clouds rolled in and it looked like rain, but except for a few sprinkles here in the Canyon, we escaped rain and ended up with nothing but wind. The vast scale of the Park belies its over-crowded nature. Nearly all of the tourists to the National Park end up along one main road. Some time ago, the Park instituted a shuttle system and closed most of the Park to private vehicles. This has probably saved the Park from gridlock. The one major highway that crosses the park is one huge traffic jam during the busy summer season. Interestingly, all of these visitors may detract from the \"wilderness\" aspect of the Canyon, but all you have to do is step off the main trails into the back country and you are instantly transported away from the hustle and bustle of civilization."},

One reason flash floods are so prevalent is that any substantial rain just runs off and is not sink into the hard rock surfaces. This view of the sandstone wilderness is just east of Escalante, Utah off of Highway 12, one of the most scenic routes in the United States. The road passes over or near to, at least, seven national, state and local parks. It is steep and winding, but worth the drive, except, watch out for bad weather."},

Some of the features that are unnamed on maps or guides have local names that are only used by those who frequent the area. Many of those names turn out to be similarly applied throughout the Plateau, so you will often encounter features with the same or very similar names."},

It seems incredible that such a plant would grow commonly out in the wild, but every time I think this, I find that there are thousands of these plants somewhere in America. It has been interesting to wander about here in Utah and say hello to some of our cactus friends. Oh, by the way, this plant is growing in Arizona and probably came from somewhere else."},
{"title": "A Fuzzy Top", "date": "Tuesday, June 9, 2015", "text": "Some cactus seem to be stuck in the 1960s. Actually, one theory is that these excessive spines act to shade the growing tip of the cactus and at the same time protect the softer portions of the plant from animals that might enjoy a snack. If you are tempted to touch these spines to see if they are soft or hard, I suggest that you try very carefully because soft or hard, they are very sharp."},
{"title": "A Field of Spines", "date": "Monday, June 8, 2015", "text": "I always wonder how plants with so many spines can grow so close together. When people become prickly, we usually keep our distance. These cactus seem to thrive by being jammed together like they were on a Japanese subway. Of course, this kind of crowding provides each individual plant with protection. But my question is protection from what? Would you eat a cactus? Actually, people do eat cactus all the time. Not this particular species, but there are edible cactus. I also see cactus that get eaten by all sorts of desert animals. Maybe there is protection and strength in numbers."},

The final displays occur well into the hot summer months with the larger cactus blooms coming on in June. In the mountains, the flower progression starts in April and continues into June, but the flowers bloom at different times. At one point this Spring, the poppies were all blooming at once. We took a walk up the nearby Rock Canyon yesterday and all the wildflowers were blooming."},

This is the kind of photo that can be best viewed at a larger size, so click on the image to see it in a larger format.When geologists explain about the origin of rock layers and other natural phenomena, they assume a basic philosophy called uniformitarianism, or the assumption that the same natural laws and processes that operate in the universe now have always operated in the universe. There are several theories about the origin of the pipe rock formations in Kodachrome Basin State Park in Utah. None of the theories seem to account for all of the observed conditions. The large free-standing pipe-like rock formations are almost unique to this one small area of the Colorado Plateau. Any of the current explanations for their existence would seem to require that these types of formations would be more common. My opinion is that we can only rely on our past experiences and observations to the extent that we understand them."},

Technically an arch is a naturally created hole completely through the surrounding rock leaving an intact frame. Natural bridges are distinguished from arches by virtue of the fact that they span a watercourse. Natural windows are a subset of arches that appear in flat slabs of rock or lack the drama of a free-standing arch. Technically, this particular arch would be classified as a bridge. Many arches and bridges have become the major natural attraction in a particular area. There are a number of national, state and local level parks and monuments dedicated to an unusual arch or collection of arches. However, we keep finding large and small arches that are unnamed and relatively unknown. This arch is off the Hole-in-the-Rock road in southern Utah in an area known as the Devil's Playground."},

This image was taken from the Escalante River overlook. You can't see the river down at the bottom of this canyon primarily because it is a very small river, but also because of the cliffs and the angle of view. The rock formations in this area seem almost impossible. This area is so rugged that traveling in almost any direction would be very difficult. The only option is to follow the water courses.

This reminded me of a day at the Grand Canyon when the clouds and fog made the Canyon into a wonderland of light and dark. The views were not those of the standard tourist photo of the Canyon, but as the fog lifted and we could see the views, the views were spectacular. Now, almost every day, I can see the clouds on the mountain tops and watch the rain and snow showers move across the valley.Some of the more interesting experiences we have had in both Arizona and Utah is when we stop at places we have passed dozens, if not hundreds, of times and take a look around. This is one of those places. Technically, this is part of Bryce Canyon National Park, but it is located on a pull-out along the side of the road and is well outside of the regular tourist area of the Park. We found a lovely trail along a river with a waterfall and all the gorgeous Bryce Canyon spires. What was different was we were looking at them from the bottom of the canyon not the top."},

We were carefully watching the weather when we out with the long lens taking this photo and others. We could see the rain coming across the lake and just made it to the car in time to avoid getting a soaking.There is an interesting phenomenon in the western United States of putting large letters on hillsides. These letters usually represent a school located in a nearby community. Here in Provo, Utah, I can see a view of the Y on the mountain to east of the Brigham Young University campus nearly every day. Because there is another hill, or the edge of the \"Bench\" between our home and the mountain, I really can't see any part of Y Mount from our house except the very top of the mountain. The Y is very visible from most other parts of the valley. As you drive along the Wasatch Front you will also see various other letters such as the giant U above the University of Utah.

{"title": "Petrified Wood", "date": "Sunday, May 24, 2015", "text": "I have been around chunks of petrified wood almost all my life. I commonly have had a piece or two or more sitting in my front yard. Petrified wood is commonly found throughout the Colorado Plateau and even today. Here are the current regulations from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management:Petrified wood can be collected too for personal use — up to 25 pounds each day, plus one piece, but no more than 250 pounds in any calendar year (43 CFR 3622). These materials must be for your personal collection and cannot be sold or traded.Any commercial gathering of petrified wood, unless on private property, must be done pursuant to a permit from the government. Of course, you cannot collect any samples in any protected areas such as state of national parks or monuments. My main experience in viewing large quantities of petrified wood came from visits to the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. But recently, we visited Utah's Escalante Petrified Forest State Park near Escalante, Utah. I was almost overwhelmed at the quantity and beauty of the petrified wood in this park. Access to see the rocks is much more difficult than the National Park. In Utah, you have to hike over a mountain on a very steep trail. In Arizona, you can drive to see most of the wood."},

In fact, this whole canyon was a vast wonderland of rock formations. The canyon is way off the main roads, but the road, at this point at least, is paved. But the road begins in a remote small town in Central Utah called Boulder and ends many miles of dirt roads later. This type of formation has many names: fretting, cavernous weathering, alveoli or alveolar weathering, stone lattice, stone lace or tafoni. I like the name \"tafoni\" best because there is such a variety, the descriptive names fall short of the reality."},

There do not seem to be any discernible pathways through the maze of rock. One of the rules of walking in an area like this is simple. It is much easier to go up the rock than it is to come down. It is not usual to find yourself sitting down and trying to keep from slipping off of a steep pitch that you just easily walked up. It is a temptation to walk along the ridges, only to find out that there are deep canyons blocking your way. All this time, you need to remember not to slip. Now that I think about it, everything about the sandstone is a lot like life itself."},

But it is seldom that we see one that this close to becoming unbalanced. I am not quite sure what is keeping this massive rock suspended and balanced on the side of base rock. It is hard to visualize the size of this rock but it is about 15 feet high and probably weighs several tons. This is probably one of the most persuasive arguments that there is very little seismic activity in this area."},

Even in areas that seem almost empty with views that stretch vast distances, you can go over a hill or around a bend in the road and see marvelous wonders carved by wind, water and sand. It is a pity that most of the main, paved roads avoid these areas and it is necessary to take side trips and hikes to see most of these wonders. This area is down the famous Hole in the Rock Road, but you have to turn off of the road and drive and then hike to see this beautiful area called Devil's Garden, an unfortunate name for a beautiful place."},

They are obviously formed by water running in paths down the sides of the hills, but the mystery is how they remain as paths with raised sides. There are other nearby places there the water simply cuts into the sand or mud and makes a miniature gully or wash, but these seem to be stuck on the surface of the sand or clay. Here is another close up of the mud slide. I cannot find any reference to these strange formations online. Perhaps I do not know what to call them."},

We packed up and were driving back to our home, when an increase in the elevation of the road, took us into the evidence of a heavy snow storm. We decided that it would be impressive to see Bryce Canyon in the snow, so we drove directly to the National Park. We were surprised that all the snow we had driven through at lower elevations had almost entirely missed Bryce. At over 8000 feet above sea level, we assumed that there would be even more snow than what we had already seen, but as you can see in this image, all the snow is on the distant mountains and there is almost none on the beautiful spires of Bryce Canyon. For someone who is used to seeing it rain on one side of the street and not on the other, I was not very surprised at the lack of snow."},

You can see through the image out into the sky, but the composition is dominated by the shapes of the sandstone walls of this small slot canyon. Ideally, the sand in the entrance to the canyon, would have been smooth and unmarked, but the footprints add a measure of interest to the image. What is behind me, as I take this photo? When I was taking painting and drawing at the University of Utah as an Art Major, they used a projector to put an image on a screen so blurry that you could only see the dark and light spaces. We practiced in drawing only the parts of the image that were light and dark. They instructor would then sharpen the image slightly to increase the detail as we added the detail to our image. The idea was to highlight the contrasting areas of light and shadow. I guess that concept became part of the way I view the world."},

Every time I looked at it, it stopped moving. When I took my eyes away, it had moved slightly closer to covering up these grave markers. It was a very tall creature and all I could get into this photo, before I ran away, was the bottom part of its legs and its tentacles which, by the way, were disguised as roots.Seeing a cactus is not that unusual for me. I took several photos of cactus plants this past week. But this photo from Hawaii looks unbelievably foreign to me. Taken on the island of Oahu, I can certainly say that I am not used to cactus plants that grow this tall or look quite so healthy. This photo is even more interesting because there are no native species of cactus that grow in Hawaii. In fact, cactus only grow naturally on the American continents. There is one species of cactus that migrated across the ocean to the African coast, but otherwise if you see a plant that looks like a cactus outside of the Americas, it is either imported or not a cactus."},
{"title": "Landforms in Southern Utah", "date": "Monday, May 11, 2015", "text": "I find it to be fascinating to contemplate the vast geologic forces that created the landforms in Southern Utah and Northern Arizona. This is a series of five photos. You can see all five photos by clicking on the main photo shown here. These images come from the Kodachrome Basin State Park near Cannonville, Utah. The Park contains 67 monolithic stone spires called sedimentary pipes. The origin of these nearly unique geologic structures have yet to be adequately explained. We hiked along the Angels Palace trail and looked down from the 200 foot cliffs into the \"basin.\" This is one of my favorite campgrounds and, in my opinion, one of the most scenic locations in the Southwest.The main red sandstone layer of the park is the Entrada Sandstone of the San Rafael Group. This on the Colorado Plateau and this particular formation was deposited during the Jurassic period sometime between 180 and 140 million years ago in tidal mudflats, beaches and sand dunes. See Entrada Sandstone.  This layer of sandstone is also visible in the Arches National Park, the Capital Reef National Park and Goblin Valley State Park.The lighter colored sandstone above the Entrada is the Curtis Formation.Here is one of the mysterious sandstone pipes."},

There are five photos in this post. Click on the photo of me to see the rest.This next photo is at the Kodachrome Basin State Park. The tall pipe-line stone formations are a mystery. There are several theories about their formation, but none of them are very persuasive.The high desert land is full of contrasts. Utah is undergoing a severe drought and will probably persist in a drought condition for the foreseeable future. This image reminds me that life in the desert is harsh and insecure.This is the Shakespeare Arch. There are hundreds of rock arches, bridges and windows throughout the high Plateau (mostly over 5000 feet above sea level).The land formations are a wonder and amazing.

This was a great experience. Everything about the Open House was well organized and the Temple was very impressive. We were scheduled at 10:00 am on a school day (week day) but the parking lot was almost full and there were long lines of people waiting for the tour. We moved right along and did not have to wait very long for a tour. The Payson Temple is one of the largest built recently and the seemed very large compared to our recent tour of the Phoenix, Arizona Temple. The interior has an apple blossom theme and the windows and other elements combine into a remarkably beautiful experience. I could immediately feel the spirit of the Temple even though there were lots of people on the tours.There is a dichotomy between being out in the desert because of the beauty and solitude and the reality of thunderstorms moving in and making the road you just traveled impassible. Shortly after this photo was taken, it began to rain rather heavily and the washes began to fill. We drove as quickly as you can through mud and slippery roads to see if we could beat a flash flood that would strand us for hours or days. This time we made it. Actually, there are three roads out of this area of Southern Utah and it was unlikely that all three dirt roads would be closed at the same time. We do drive an all wheel drive Subaru and that helps when things get rough. We hope to camp more regularly and that will mean more photos.What value can you place on this beauty? Think of the expense, the time and the effort to create these hybrid flowers and then plant and display them. It is certainly true that the best things in life are free. At least, here on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah and in the block to the east that has the Church Office Building and the Joseph Smith Memorial Building among others. These flowers are provided simply for the enjoyment of the the millions of visitors a year that come to this hallowed ground."},

I will be taking advantage of some excursions into different parts of Southern Utah this spring and summer. I may even make it into some the Northern Utah wonders.

I went through my first slot canyon when I was a young teenager and that set the pattern for a lot of my hiking since then. The longest hike involved the Pariah Canyon in Southern Utah across the border into Northern Arizona, but only portions of that canyon could really be considered a slot canyon. Most of the canyons are dangerous during rainstorms and some, may become flooded even though the rain is miles away. Every so often, people get killed hiking in slot canyons from the floods. If you want to see what it is like to get caught in a flash flood in a slot canyon see https://youtu.be/wj7WnkgjhM0Poppies have always been one of my favorite flowers. I have seen them a few times in the Phoenix area, but because of the high temperatures, the flowers generally lasted on a few days. These robust plants are here in Utah. These are very controversial plants and the status of the law in the United States regarding their cultivation is unsettled. Notwithstanding the legal issues, they seem to be quite commonly grown around the valleys of Utah.Fancy tulips of this type are usually classified as \"fringed.\" Even these outstanding blossoms tend to blend in with the huge plantings here along the Wasatch Front. The two most notable areas are located at the Thanksgiving Point Garden in Lehi, Utah and around Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake City, Utah. There are quite a few beautiful gardens on the campus of Brigham Young University also. The plants begin flowering in early April and are mostly finished flowering by the first week of May. This has been an extraordinary year for flowers, or so we have been told."},

The Lion House is also used as a reception center. It was built in 1856 and was the family home of Brigham Young, the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the first governor of Utah.We seldom see the detail in the world around us. Our brains process information in batches and assign detail to the batch through experience.

It is mound, about 15 or 20 feet high of selenite or gypsum crystals of unusually large size. Quoting from Wikipedia, \"Gypsum was deposited as sea water evaporated 165 million years ago and then buried under other sediments. The gypsum migrated upwards through fractures in the sediments forming layers and, very rarely, domes like the Glass Mountain.\" There is another deposit a short distance away, outside of the National Park, that has been reduced to ground level by collectors. This is one of the most persuasive arguments for protecting natural wonders in parks and monuments. The plant is a species of Sphaeralcea or globe mallow. There are up to 60 different species of globe mallow and I do not have the resources to tell them all apart."},

I hope you like tulips because I have a zillion photos of them and I am enamored with so many of the photos, I am likely to put them all on line.These are the first Iris I have seen this Spring. They were growing on a south facing slope in full sun. The ones we have in our front yard are just barely starting to grow and are still quite a ways away from blooming. I am reminded of the wild irises that grow in the mountains of Arizona. They are small and delicate.This is definitely not your stylized concept of a tulip. I guess this is my first year with tulips that didn't come from a florist or Costco. For me, it is a new experience to see acres and acres of tulips. What I see is color so intense that it almost hurts your eyes. This is one of the more unusual ones I have seen the last few days."},

There is a painting by Vincent Van Gogh called Imperial Crown Fritillaria in a Copper Vase. The original is in the Musée d'Orsay, Paris , Bequest of Count Isaac de Camondo 1911. This particular one is growing in Pleasant Grove, Utah in my daughter's front yard. I don't think these grow so well in Mesa, Arizona, so I am not very familiar with the flower. One of the first paintings my wife and I first purchased was a canvas reproduction of the Van Gogh's Sunflowers. Just a few years ago, probably 40 years after we purchased the painting which had been hanging in our house all that time, I saw a photograph of me as a little child, maybe one or two years old with my parents. Behind us on the wall was a reproduction of the Van Gogh Sunflower painting. Apparently, I had subconsciously remembered the painting and when I got older was attracted to it. This story appeared in the Coconino Sun from Flagstaff, Arizona on Friday, September 29, 1972. I have edited the content from the original to remove some of the graphic details. My interest in the story is the account of the remarkable tracking skills of the man who found my unfortunate cousin's body. Here is a link to the StoryPress recording."},

My biggest challenge was keeping the camera mostly dry so it would not short out. Taking photos in the rain has its positive effects. The colors are so saturated and it is sometimes hard to believe that they are real. I have probably taken a photo or two of this water feature before, but this time with flowers it looks quite different than previous views.Contrary to my other photos of owls recently, this one is very much alive. In fact, it has its dinner sitting on the rock behind its tail. I realize it is always disturbing to find out that animals eat other animals, but this is pretty graphic. This was probably the least expected photo I have taken recently since I was really looking at flowers and not thinking about birds, dead or alive. At first, I thought it was dead, until it opened its eyes and looked at me. Its feathers are gorgeous but do they make up for the fact that it is a predator? It seems that a lot of very attractive things turn out to be predators. I sometimes think that about people as well as animals."},

They certainly break out of the common mould of what we think about when we think about tulips. They are really called Fancy Frills Fringed Tulips. One of the things we learned when we moved here at the mouth of a large canyon and right across the street from the National Forest is that deer love to eat tulips. We had a large number in our yard and they all got eaten except for one yellow one that grew in a prickly bush. The deer don't seem to like daffodils, so we will concentrate on them. My hillside, out my window, where I work is all green now. The last holdout bare trees have finally gotten leaves and some of them have new flowers. Yesterday, the wind was blowing and seeds were blowing off of the trees. I guess they winter over and fall off in the Spring when they have a chance to grow new trees."},

Many of the most important events of my life have been centered around the Temple and in particular, this Temple.Pansies, as I learned over the Winter, are planted in the coldest part of the year. They may find themselves buried in snow, but they seem to survive the cold and look healthy and happy in the Spring. I always thought pansies were purple, but there seem to be a myriad of hybrids in different colors. I have never decided whether their little faces are happy or cross but they are a welcome sight in the Spring."},
{"title": "Early Pioneers Cross the Colorado River from Utah to Arizona ", "date": "Thursday, April 23, 2015", "text": "As a young couple, my great-grandfather, Henry Martin Tanner, and his wife Eliza Parkinson Tanner, traveled by wagon in southern Utah to settle along the Little Colorado River in northern Arizona. Henry and his wife were married in 1877, he was 24 and she was 19. Shortly after they were married, along with many others, they were called as missionaries by Brigham Young, to settle in the wilderness of northern Arizona. At the time, they lived in Beaver, Utah and the trip to Arizona would be close to 500 miles. There was no direct route between southern Utah and Northern Arizona. As a matter of fact, practically the same conditions exist today. There are only a few places to cross the Colorado River especially in the canyon country that stretches across the northeast corner of Arizona. At the time, there was a crossing at Lee’s Ferry, however, the pioneers had been asked to explore the crossing of the Colorado River at Pearce’s Ferry below the Grand Canyon. The ferry across the river had only been established a year before. The location of the ferry is now submerged under Lake Mead. One of the party of the pioneers wrote \"this road was very bad, dugways for miles, very hilly and water scarce. This is a new road from St. George to Pearce ferry.” When the pioneers arrived at Pearce’s Ferry, it took two days to get the wagons and livestock across the river. The wagons were ferried across in short order, but the livestock refused to swim the river and there was no other way to get them to the other side. My great-grandfather Henry was an excellent horseman and was used to handling stock. It was his job to get the livestock across the river. After many attempts, the party was about ready to despair of ever crossing the river. On the second day after many failures an old Indian came into the camp asking for food. While he was being fed, the Indian noticed the men trying to get the livestock to cross the river. One of the women noticed that the Indian was very interested in the operation. It came to her that this Indian had had experience in crossing the river with animals and she mentioned the fact one of the men. By the use of sign language, the men ask him if he was experienced in getting livestock across the river. He said he was and that he would help but he wanted to be paid. After negotiating, he was given a small sack of flour which he tied to the saddle of his horse. He then went down to the river and motioned to the man to drive all the cattle to the edge of the water. When all of the animals were up to their bellies in the water, the Indian took off his clothes until he was covered only by a blanket. He seized the corners of the blanket and began flapping the blanket and letting out large whoops. The animals were now more afraid of the Indian than they were of water and they immediately headed for the other side of the river. The last animal to get into the water was an old mule, once the mule got to his depth in the water, the Indian threw his blanket to one of the men, jumped into the river, grabbed hold of the tail of the mule and let the mule pulled him across the river. As the Indian cross the river he took mouthfuls of water and blew it at the frightened animals and then let out another whoop. The pioneers experienced some difficulty in rounding up all of the animals when they reach the other side of the river. As a note, a dugway is a road cut into the side of a steep hill. The place where is this pioneer band settled is now called Joseph City, Arizona. As I look back on all of the experience that I've had in traveling around Arizona and Utah, the one fact that stands out most prominently is that the country is very rugged. Of course there are wide valleys, but the valleys all seem to end abruptly been very steep and rocky mountains. All I have to do to feel at home is to step out onto the sand or rocks on the Colorado Plateau or in central Utah. These particular rocks are across a deep canyon from the Water Pocket Fold. The steep uplift of the Water Pocket Fold is mirrored in these sharp pointed rocks. When traveling out in the desert, the weather is always a great factor. In this case, the temperature was lovely in the bright sunshine was almost overpowering. Just the day before, we had had very strong winds and nearly freezing temperatures."},

We lived in the house my grandfather Leroy Parkinson Tanner had built. The house was very nice but had a few limitations at that time. The main limitation was that the house had no central heating and all the heat came from a fireplace in the front room. During the winter it can get well below zero in Saint Johns and we had to keep the fire going almost all the time.Sometimes my father would cut wood from the cedar (juniper) trees that surround Saint Johns. Other times he would get a load of wood from the box factory. At that time there were a number of saw mills for making lumber to the south of Saint Johns in the White Mountains. Out by the fairgrounds, in Saint Johns, there was a mill for making boxes, like were used for shipping fruit and other things. When they cut the wood there was always a huge pile of scrap lumber, all pine, which they burned in a big incinerator. There was a conveyor belt that carried the lumber up to the top of the incinerator to be burned.They would allow anyone to burn that much wood today. Today the wood would be sold to a paper mill for making paper.We could stand next to the conveyor belt and pull off pieces of wood to fill up a pickup or trailer. My father would borrow a truck and we would go out to the factory and get a huge load of wood. We would then dump the wood in our yard to burn during the winter.When we first got to Saint Johns we even had a wood stove to cook on. So not only did we need the wood to keep warm but we needed the wood to cook.One day after I had learned to count. I was sitting outside on the wood pile, which was much taller than I was, and I decided to count the pieces. I got a pencil and began numbering all the pieces of wood. Unfortunately, I don’t now remember exactly how many pieces there were, but I finally, after many hours, got through numbering every single piece.Now why did I do that? Who knows. But I suppose that it was a curiosity about how high the numbers would actually go before I ran out. Fortunately, I ran out of wood before I ran out of numbers or I might still be counting.This is a very accessible slot canyon located along the Burr Trail in Central Utah. It is called Singing Canyon and is a side canyon to Long Canyon. There are no signs or other indications of its existence, which is the case with many of the area's slot canyons, but it is well known in the area. I had to wait around to take a photo without any people and there were a steady stream there at the time. It is only about 50 yards long and ends abruptly, but it is worth the very small side trip if you happen to be driving the Burr Trail and happen to notice the canyon."},

It is very difficult to get a sense of how large these hills and mountains really are. The mountains way in the distance are easily over 10,000 feet high. The view probably shows the mountains that are at least, twenty or thirty miles away, but probably more like fifty or sixty.

This small arch is in the Superstition Wilderness Area east of the vast Salt River Valley. If you weren't looking just at the right time, you would miss seeing this arch altogether."},
{"title": "Hyacinths", "date": "Friday, April 10, 2015", "text": "One of the earliest flowers of the Spring season, hyacinths are a joy to behold. Their rich purple or blue color is a welcome addition after a covering of snow. They are not as showy as some flowers and do not get the attention they deserve. They gladden the heart."},
{"title": "Early Tulips", "date": "Thursday, April 9, 2015", "text": "When you move from perpetual summer into a place where there are seasons, you learn a lot you had either never known or forgotten. One of those interesting facts is that the flowers bloom over a season and not all at once. In the low desert, we were used to seeing annual flowers bloom in January and be gone by February. Here on the side of the Wasatch Mountains at about 4,000 to 5,000 feet above sea level, the flowers only begin to bloom in March and are not completely bloomed out until the end of April or later. These are early tulips. They seem to bloom in stages depending on the variety."},
{"title": "Barn Owl", "date": "Wednesday, April 8, 2015", "text": "I have only seen a very few Barn Owls in the wild. They are mostly nocturnal and this photo is of a real owl but both the mouse and the owl are dead. The owl is stuffed and in the Monte L. Bean Life Science Museum in Provo, Utah on the campus of Brigham Young University. My wife was interested to find out while doing some family research that she is distantly related to Monte L. Bean who married one of her ancestors. Although not very extensive, the Bean Museum is really interesting and worth a visit if you are in the Provo area."},
{"title": "Great Horned Owl", "date": "Tuesday, April 7, 2015", "text": "My experience with Great Horned Owls dates back to when I was in the third grade. One day during school at the Rose Park Elementary School in Rose Park, a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah, a student's mother brought an injured Great Horned Owl to show the students. I distinctly remember seeing the owl outside by the schoolroom. Years later, my wife and I were comparing notes and we realized that it was her mother that had brought the owl to the school. We were in the same third grade class. I was only in the class for a short while and then moved to Arizona. We kept in touch because our parents were friends and when my wife graduated from the university, we got married.OK, now this is really a \"fake\" picture. Not in the sense that the butterfly isn't a real butterfly, but in the sense that I took the picture in a museum not out in the wild. This points out an important aspect of modern photography; very little of what you see in photos is real. I can guarantee that not only have the images themselves been highly altered in Photoshop or a similar program, but the images themselves have been \"staged.\" That is the reality. If you want to see how staging works, you can watch any number of videos on YouTube.com, especially those about home staging by real estate agents."},
{"title": "Following the Spring Sun", "date": "Monday, April 6, 2015", "text": "It is interesting to note that fields of flowers all point in the same general direction. They naturally grow towards the sun. I have been made more aware of the sun due to my moving north rather than the traditional retirement direction to the south. One of the things we have experienced for the first time in many years is the addition of Daylight Savings Time. Arizona is one of the few places in the United States blessed to be exempt from this outmoded adjustment. Even after a few weeks, I still am not quite adjusted to the time change and by the clock, I am still waking up about an hour earlier than my normal time."},
{"title": "Little Cottonwood Canyon -- I fall off a cliff", "date": "Sunday, April 5, 2015", "text": "With this post, I am beginning the evolution of WalkingArizona. I have been interested, for some time, in telling and recording stories. For the past few months, I have been interviewing people in my Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and helping them record an oral history. Most of them have asked me if I was going to record my oral history. Then I got a suggestion with an offer from a website called StoryPress.com to put blog post and stories on their website. So I decided to do so. Surprisingly, my readers on Genealogy's Star, were apparently interested in listening to me read my blog posts. I decided it might be a good idea to put my stories here on WalkingArizona along with my photos. So, from time to time, there will be stories, not just my stories, but stories about my ancestors also. Here is the first story entitled, \"I fall off a cliff\" and the link to the recorded story on StoryPress.com.When I was much younger, about 14 years old, I started to become very interested in rock climbing. At that time rock climbing was not the popular and even competitive sport it is today. We had only the most basic equipment and had to teach ourselves. Later, when I moved to Utah to attend the University of Utah, I became much more involved. I was the adviser for an Explorer Post in the Boy Scouts of America. We decided to become mountain climbers.At the time of this story we were very experienced climbers. We had a lot of equipment and had spent a lot of time learning how to use ropes, pitons, carabiners and the other things that went with climbing. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that we were safe or anything like that. It was still a very risky business (like the time I got caught in the avalanche, which is another story). We used to go climbing on the granite in Big Cottonwood Canyon just east of Salt Lake City, Utah. Right at the entrance to the Canyon there is a lot of really nice granite. In fact, it is the same granite they used to build the Salt Lake Temple. It is near the Granite Archives where they keep all of the genealogical information. The cliffs are almost perfect for rock climbing.This day we had all gone out to practice direct aid climbing. That is where you climb as much as you can and then use pitons pounded into the rocks to go higher. It is very difficult and strenuous. It also takes a long time to go very far. The boys were climbing up a crack in a corner of about a fifty foot cliff. I got tired of watching them and decided to climb another cliff about 50 yards away. It wasn’t that steep and I was climbing without a rope or anything else except my hands and feet to keep me on the rock.Earlier that day, I had walked under a big rock with a hole in it and one of the climbers had knocked off a rock that hit me in the head. It hurt quite a bit and I was still thinking about my hurt head.You are never supposed to climb alone but technically, I wasn’t alone. I had all of my friends over on the other cliff. I started climbing up the rock through the trees until I was well above the tops of the tall pine trees. I could see out over the entire canyon. It was a warm day and the rock was still cool. There were beautiful cracks to hold onto and shortly I was probably 25 or 30 feet above the tops of the pine trees.I kept moving up the cliff. I think I could see a ledge about another twenty-five or thirty feet up that I would use to move across the cliff and come down through a chimney on my left. I kept moving up the cliff, not thinking very much about the climb when I suddenly peeled off the cliff. I can remember thinking, that I did not want to hit the cliff or I might start to tumble, so just as I fell, I pushed off the cliff with my boots out into space. I was about 150 feet up on the cliff. When I pushed off the cliff, I twisted my body around so I was facing away from the cliff, falling feet first. I didn’t have much choice but I was falling directly towards a pine tree.I aimed for some branches and twisted so that my feet were straight down. I crashed into the top of the tree and the branch slowed me down. I broke several branches and crashed down through the tree until I finally stopped. I was completely unhurt. The tree saved my life. If I had hit the rocks, I would have, at least, broken a leg or something more serious. I climbed down the tree and told my friends what had happened. Nobody was impressed.Upon reflection on this and many other experiences in my life, I have come to the conclusion that nothing in life happens by chance. There is a plan for each of us. We can accept the plan or reject it, but if we reject it, we will not achieve our full potential. I am thankful I was saved from serious injury or death on that cliff that day. I just hope I have lived up to whatever purpose our Heavenly Father had for me in this life."},
{"title": "Peacock Feathers", "date": "Saturday, April 4, 2015", "text": "When I was much younger, our house was near the northern edge of Phoenix. Of course now, Phoenix goes for miles and miles past where our house was located. We were surrounded by orange orchards and farms. One of the farms just south of our house raised peacocks. I loved their colorful plumage, but I soon learned that they have a very loud and squawking cry. They also fly very well and would come and perch on the roof of our house. Even though I still admire their lovely feathers, I always remember how loud they can be. I would not be interested in having them around. They are fine on farms and in zoos, but not where I live now. I have enough diversion here with the deer and other animals."},
{"title": "Popping in the Sun", "date": "Friday, April 3, 2015", "text": "Poppies are some of the brightest of the early Spring flowers. But they are also some of the most delicate and the blooms only last a short time. Here in Provo, where I live, we have to worry about which types of flowers are part of the local deer populations' food supply. Tulips don't last long enough to bloom, but they don't like daffodils at all. I don't know where poppies fall into the food chain, but I did like this one very much."},
{"title": "Swirling Waters", "date": "Thursday, April 2, 2015", "text": "Much of what we see around us we really don't \"see.\" Our brains store stock images that we use instead of looking at what is really there, we substitute a stock image of the subject and move on to the next impression. This is especially true of fast moving subjects. The camera takes an instant in the movement of the water and magnifies the forms. If you were standing there looking at this small waterfall, you would not see anything more than your brain's interpretation of the movement into a blurred sense. It is this quality of photography that fascinates me the most. The ability to create an image that reveals something fundamental about our world that cannot be seen without the instantaneous ability of the camera to stop the moving world and focus in on the parts that are not moving. In this regard, I am not a fan of the new way of showing motion in water, where the image is blurred. It may be more \"realistic\" in one sense, but it loses the essence of the image experience."},
{"title": "A Dusting of Pollen", "date": "Wednesday, April 1, 2015", "text": "I went out yesterday into the warm Spring air and realized that it was thick with pollen. I don't think flowers like this one were the culprits, more likely were the other flowering plants and trees. It is ironic that I never knew I had hay fever when I was a child, I thought itchy eyes and a stuffy head were normal. I realized how different things could be and what everyone had been complaining about all those years when I lived in Panama. Surprisingly, where there were the most plants, in the jungle, I had no allergies and my nose and eyes cleared up for the first time in my life. There were many other reasons for not staying in Panama, so I came home to the dry, pollen-filled desert air. I did not escape the pollen here in Utah, I just got a different round of the same thing only in different months."},
{"title": "Spring Progress", "date": "Tuesday, March 31, 2015", "text": "Spring is progressing rapidly. Some of the trees are still waiting for their Summer cloak of leaves, but many are well along. There are two or three bare tree right out my window, but I see the first indications of buds and they too will soon be green and leafy. The flower trees are getting leaves and the flowers are disappearing into the green of the leaves. I understand there are more than a hundred varieties of narcissus flowers including daffodils. I might just take a few an put them on my blog."},
{"title": "A World of Flowers", "date": "Sunday, March 29, 2015", "text": "When we began moving to Utah, it was the middle of the Summer and so we have now seen all four of the seasons. I can say that the Fall leaves are impressive but the Spring is spectacular. This is my first season change experience in many years. I do miss the cactus but the colors here are a lot of competition for the understated colors of the desert. You can hardly believe that only a few short weeks ago, these same trees were covered in snow."},
{"title": "The Flowers of Spring", "date": "Saturday, March 28, 2015", "text": "With temperatures in the 70s, Spring has come to Utah Valley. I can look out my window at new green leaves and flowering trees. We had a gorgeous walk around the opening day of the Garden at Thanksgiving Point. I still miss the cactus, but the Narcissus and Tulips are a good substitute.Echinus Geyser is named for the hardly visible spiny formations that grow around the edge of this hot spring. In the image, they are not visible. This pool is highly acidic, almost as acidic as vinegar. It now erupts only rarely. Visiting Yellowstone National Park is extremely interesting, but unless you have the time and patience to sit for a long period of time, there are many of the geysers you will not see erupting. We happened to be there during a very active time and saw many more than I had ever seen before, but not Echinus."},
{"title": "Out my Window -- Deer on the Wall", "date": "Friday, March 27, 2015", "text": "I guess I would have to say that moving from the low desert of Arizona to Utah makes me take a few adjustments to my perspective. This is a common sight now out any one of the windows of our house. I had to take this photo through the glass because if I moved too much or opened the door, the deer would take off in a flash and run up the hill. It doesn't seem to matter as to the time of day or the weather, they come and go as they please and eat any of the bushes or flowers or whatever they find tasty. Right at the moment, they look sleek and fat and seem to have survived the winter in good health. The other day, we found a dead deer laying next to one of the houses in the neighborhood. My guess is that it was hit by a car on the street outside of our tiny subdivision. There is always something to keep us interested. By they way, the deer love to eat tulips but leave daffodils alone."},
{"title": "A Snake on the Trail", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2015", "text": "We spotted this snake crossing the Murdock Canal Trail on the east edge of Utah Valley. The trail is for bikes and walking so that is why it is paved. I was afraid the snake might get run over by the hoards of bicycles on the trail so I gently nudged it along its way into the brush.It was a cloudy day in the early Spring with intermittent rain, but I had to stop and take this photo of the Brigham Young University Bell Tower. This is a very familiar landmark on the campus and most students become used to the carillon concerts on the hour and during mid-day. I walk by this view many times a week on my trips back and forth to the BYU Family History Library in the center of the campus in the Harold B. Lee Library. I thought about taking this photo over when the skies were bright blue, but I really liked the idea of clouds and the rain."},
{"title": "Winter and Spring", "date": "Wednesday, March 25, 2015", "text": "The new leaves and flowers of Spring contrast with the snow covered slopes of Winter. Although the mountain snows are melting rapidly, it still looks cold and snowy on the mountain tops. The weather has been in the 70s down in the valley and the snow is long gone from the hillside out my window, but there is still a little bit of a chill in the air in the early morning and evening. Green leaves have almost covered the hill where there was snow just a few short weeks ago. I am ready for Summer and warm weather, but I will miss the beauty of the snow."},
{"title": "Today's Color is Yellow", "date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2015", "text": "This is the first year in many years, that I have been able to enjoy the bright yellow forsythia blossoms. When I was very young we had a forsythia bush next to our house in Phoenix. For some reason, people stopped planting forsythia bushes in the Salt River Valley. There are trends in landscape plants just as in everything else. Some of the other plants that have disappeared from new plantings include eucalyptus trees and banana trees."},
{"title": "Another Study in Red", "date": "Monday, March 23, 2015", "text": "The large bromeliad is outside the common green or yellow of most of our common plant world.  Many flowers are red and some plants' leaves turn red in the Fall, but a plant that grows naturally with dark red leaves is not so common. This plant only flowers once but the blossoms may last for years."},
{"title": "A Study in Red", "date": "Sunday, March 22, 2015", "text": "My earliest attempts at photography were all in black and white.

{"title": "Petroglyphs Revisited", "date": "Saturday, March 21, 2015", "text": "From time to time, I find myself gazing at the evidence of history. This is not uncommon for someone who spends most of their life searching records in libraries, but it does impact me at odd times out in my wanderings in the deserts of the American Southwest. I was reminded of this fact when I took a train ride from Provo to Salt Lake and saw the graffiti painted on the sides of the railway cars on side rails along the way. People have a desire to be remembered and recognized. This desire is not new. It has existed since ancient times. I suggest that petroglyphs are only an historic manifestation of this same urge for immortality."},

It turned out to be a series of repairs that took most of one day to finish. Because I like to find out how things work, I watched the very skilled and efficient repairman do his job. I was amazed at the number of specialized tools that the repairs required, including replacing the pedal shaft and the rear derailleur and the chain. You can probably tell why I have so many screwdrivers."},

See Types of Quartz.  Quartz is made up of fused sand or silicon dioxide, SiO2. Quartz rates 7 on the Mohs Scale of hardness where diamond is rated as 10."},
{"title": "Leafy Spurge", "date": "Wednesday, March 18, 2015", "text": "This is Leafy Spurge or Euphorbia esula. We call this plant gopher weed, but apparently, gopher weed is another kind of plant. We have been noticing this plant growing around the neighborhood and then up into the nearby canyons. I assumed that it had been planted on purpose as an ornamental. But it turns out that it is an invasive species introduced in the 1800s from Eurasia. There are several closely related species of this particular plant. We had this growing in our backyard in Mesa, so we noticed it as a familiar plant."},
{"title": "An Impossible Photo", "date": "Monday, March 16, 2015", "text": "This is an impossible photo but the reason may not be obvious. The reason also has nothing to do with where I was standing when I took this photo. Also, the things that are impossible about this photo did not come from Photoshop. I did make some Photoshop-like edits, but the photo itself is what I actually saw through the eyepiece of the camera. Just think about it. The answer will come."},
{"title": "Fog Floating up the Canyon", "date": "Sunday, March 15, 2015", "text": "When I thought about what life would be like when I moved to Utah recently. I imagined walks up the nearby canyons. Reality was that I did not take advantage of that opportunity as much as I thought I would for some time. But then things began to change. Now I am starting to get out and walk a lot more and as I walk, I think. Most of the time, I also have a camera handy and take advantage of what I see. Maybe you don't see the same things I do, but maybe you would if you looked around. When you look you need to really see what is around you."},
{"title": "A Rocky Cliff", "date": "Saturday, March 14, 2015", "text": "Every time I look at a rocky cliff, I start to plan a climbing route up the cracks. I could see several routes on this rock face, but the rock looks really crumbly and it would likely be dangerous to climb. I think most of the climbers in this area stay to the smoother rock faces. Age and the many experiences I had falling off of cliffs, have probably seasoned both my judgment and my resolve. I now settle for looking at the cliffs and spend my time trying to walk without running into the same rocks I am look at."},
{"title": "A Window on the Sea", "date": "Friday, March 13, 2015", "text": "A window creates a view. In this case, the window is a natural arch, carved by wave action. The view is such a contrast to the dark rocks that it looks fake, but I can assure you I was standing there in the wind taking this photo. In fact this arch is somewhat famous, sitting as it does, right off the coast of Laie, Hawaii. This tranquil scene was a contrast to the bus loads of tourists who were being hustled about by overly aggressive tour directors who were less than polite. Fortunately, I have assiduously avoided that type of tour and we could walk around and look at the scenery without someone telling us to hurry or worse yet, explaining what we were seeing."},

{"title": "Beauty among the spines", "date": "Wednesday, March 11, 2015", "text": "March is the month to go to the desert and see the beginning of the cactus flower season. The flowers come on according to the altitude of the plants. Those in the low desert start to bloom and then the blooming progresses up into the higher country until mid-summer. There is also a season for each type of flower. Exotic cactus from different parts of the world bloom when their season comes and that may be almost anytime. But the Arizona-Sonora Desert has a predictable blooming pattern. This year, high in the mountains, I am looking forward to tulips, daffodils and crocuses. I feel very sad at missing the cactus flowers."},
{"title": "The Beauty of Petrified Wood", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2015", "text": "Petrified wood has always been a fascination of mine. Most of the wood looks like ordinary rock when out in the wilds of the deserts or mountains, but when it is cut and polished it becomes extraordinary. I think there is an analogy here to life in general sometimes we have to take a few cuts and get some major polishing done to show our talents and abilities. From another standpoint, I find that most people have a story to tell and some of the most ordinary looking people have the most extraordinary lives."},
{"title": "See What Erosion Can Do!", "date": "Monday, March 9, 2015", "text": "These rocks have been there for quite a while. But it does seem highly unlikely that they were the results of erosional forces. You need to look at the right hand side of the big brown rock at the smaller balanced rocks in the background. All of these formations were caused by the almost imperceptible work of wind, water and ice. Even though I have seen hundreds of balanced rocks in walking and driving around the country, I am still amazed at the fact that they can even exist. This is the Toadstool formations of Southern Utah, almost on the border with Arizona."},
{"title": "The Last of the Snow", "date": "Sunday, March 8, 2015", "text": "Intermittent snow storms have produced additional snow cover in the mountains, but down here in Utah Valley, the new snow has been melting as fast as it falls. The first evidence of flowers and new Summer growth is beginning to show in warmer spots on the mountainside and lower in the valley. This image shows the last few spots of snow in the shade of the plants and rocks. With temperatures expected to be in the 60s this next week, we suspect there will be no snow in the valleys at all. We took a walk up the hill and saw one or two daffodils blooming and a few crocuses. We had some of those flowers before in the Arizona-Sonora Desert, but they bloomed in January, not March."},
{"title": "Early Morning Mountain Glow", "date": "Friday, March 6, 2015", "text": "If I watch carefully, I can see this out my front window and run outside and take some photos in the freezing cold of a winter's morning. In Utah Valley, the mountains are all around but the high Wasatch Mountains are to the East. So when the sun comes up, we are in the \"shadow of the everlasting hills\" as they say here in Utah. It also helps that our house is built on one of the highest levels above the valley floor. We do have houses looking down on us, but they are less than 100 feet higher on the mountain. My working window looks out on the side of the hill, but the front window, just to my right, looks out over the valley and if I move a few feet I can see the mountains to the north. I guess I am satisfied to trade spectacular views for warmer temperatures."},
{"title": "Rock Canyon Clouds", "date": "Thursday, March 5, 2015", "text": "Walking in Rock Canyon is an interesting experience. The wilderness is just a few steps away from my door, but it is worlds away from the busy streets of Provo, Utah. This was a day of blustery rain and some snow, but the warm winds had quickly melted all the snow and left the clouds down into the Canyon to keep me company. Someone suggested that I will have to change the name of my blog from WalkingArizona to WalkingUtah, but that will never happen. I am still WalkingArizona even though I might live in Utah. Where I walk isn't the issue, it is who I am that matters."},
{"title": "Good Evening from BYU", "date": "Wednesday, March 4, 2015", "text": "There are few universities in the United States with a more dramatic setting than Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. We live right at the mouth of Rock Canyon, in the middle of the above image. I can walk into the Canyon within five minutes of my home and we are only five minutes by car from this spot in front of the BYU Art Museum. It snowed the last two days, but a little bit of sun and some warm air quickly melted all the new snow except on the high mountain in the background. I am captivated by the scenery. Waves crashing against the shore hold multiple levels of fascination for me. Having lived most of my life in the desert, water is a novelty. This is especially true of water that is in some sort of violent motion. I could probably sit for hours and simply stare at the waves on the seashore. But I am relegated to living in an area that is practically, for all intents and purposes, a desert. However, I could look out my window and see the effects of eons of wave action. Looking at the side of the hill that was formed by the action of the waves on ancient Lake Bonneville. This huge lake filled most of what is now northern Utah and extended into other states. The geological features called \"benches\" around the valleys are in fact the ancient shoreline of this lake."},
{"title": "Orchids", "date": "Monday, March 2, 2015", "text": "I don't think that orchids have the appeal they once had. Not that they are any less spectacular, but now you see them, both real and artificial, in so many locations. They are even sold at Costco and other large stores. When I was much younger, the must give gift on Mother's Day and for high school proms, was an orchid. I still see flowers, but now, not so many are orchids. I think part of what is going on is an awareness of beauty of many types. Roses are still very popular and so are tulips. But not so much orchids."},
{"title": "Hawaiian Hibiscus", "date": "Sunday, March 1, 2015", "text": "As I sit looking out the window at snow flakes turning the scene all white, it is comforting to remember that there are places that never see snow. Too bad. They don't know what they are missing. I have always loved to watch the rain but I love snow even more. It is so amazing that tiny flakes of ice can so quickly cover the ground and make piles and drifts. But we also have the visual reality of the fact that there are places where snow never falls and flowers bloom at all times of the year. Which do I love best? Mountains? Desert or the Jungle? I like all three. Perhaps you can tell I love all kinds of places from my photos."},

A trip to Yellowstone National Park puts you in hot pool overload. You can walk by a dozen of them in a matter of a few minutes. It is sort of like being in an art museum. One or two catch your eye but the rest fade into the numbers in the background. It is only when you take a photo and later look at each photo that you can begin to appreciate what you saw at the time. This particular pool probably has a name but did not merit a sign."},

I can assure you, you would not like to run your fingers through this cactus' mass of spines. Not only do the spines protect the growing tip from mammals, birds and insects, but they provide valuable shade in areas where there is no other plant cover. This type of growth is associated mainly with columnar cactus that grow to be 20 to 30 feet high. This type of spinal growth is commonly seen on Senita cactus."},

This yellow type of fruit stays on the cactus for an extended period of time and is not usually eaten because it is bitter tasting and quite dry. Also, larger barrel cactus with clusters of fruit are not that common in the Southwest deserts."},

Roses have prickles, even though people typically call them thorns. The Fragrant Mimosa above also has prickles. Think of prickles as hairs. Sharp, pointy, painful hairs. See Sharp Points mean ProtectionScientists have come up with a lot of theories as to why cactus and other plants have sharp spines, thorns or prickles. Some of the theories explain spines as a protection against those animals that would eat the plant. Other theories include the fact that the spines shade the plant. Maybe it is a little of both.

Weaver's Needle is mostly famous because of its association with the fabled Lost Dutchman Goldmine. When I was still in high school, along with two friends, I climbed the Needle and walked around on top for a while. Getting down was another matter, but I did manage to live through the experience to talk about it. Hiking from where I am standing, over to the base of the Needle is actually more difficult than climbing the Needle itself. You might notice the lone pine tree on the ridge.

Thanks.Turtles are not known for their intense activity. In fact, just the opposite is true. However, as Winter approaches here in the Frozen North, there is a lot that can be said about basking in the warm Summer sun and taking it easy.

The reference to two harnesses containing heddles refers to the number of sets of looped wires or cords in a loom available to raise or lower the warp so the shuttle or shuttles carrying the weft threads can pass through the warp to make the cloth. From the look of this loom it is quite old, but newer looms of the same type will have essentially the same design."},

In some places, they are called \"badlands\" primarily because of the lack of vegetation. I think of them as the bare skin and bones of the world, where you can actually see the direct effects of water and wind-borne sand. I also enjoy the colors. In one of my many recent trips between Mesa, Arizona and Provo, Utah, I was reflecting on the concept of \"home.\" A sense of home can be experienced on many levels. Home is usually associated with family and friends. Memories create a sense of home. As I drove by these clay hills, as I have hundreds of times in the past, I realized that, apart from family and friend associations, I identify most completely with the desert hills of the Colorado Plateau. This is likely due to the fact that some of my earliest memories are associated with views like this one. I also reflected on the the fact that when I am asked, where are you from? I invariably answer with a place on the Plateau and not with the place where I was living at the time. I also reflected on how this was strange since I was not born in Arizona. I was born in Utah and I was not born on the Colorado Plateau. I was born next to and lived for many years next to the Wasatch Mountains. I guess the real question is and will always be where is my home?"},

One large grove of aspens in Utah is described as follows on Wikipedia:Pando (Latin for \"I spread\"), also known as The Trembling Giant,[1][2] is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers[3] and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kg (6,600 short tons),[4] making it the heaviest known organism.[5] The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.[6][7]I left in all the footnote links to help give context to this rare natural phenomena."},

However, these rocks symbolize all of the reasons I am attracted to the high desert. They are iconic in their own way. They illustrate the capricious nature of the erosional process and the fantastic and unbelievable forms created by wind, water and ice. What is also evident is the efficiency of the process in cleaning up the debris left by erosion."},

We saw this at the Gold Creek Salmon Bake, which had an all-you-can-eat salmon bake for our lunch that day.It was a gray and windy day with lots of rain and we spent most of the morning moving around in a very fast boat looking for whales. This is about as much as you get see of the whales in the Alaskan waters. We found out that they \"breach\" or come out of the water more frequently in warmer waters such as those around Hawaii. Here, near Juneau, Alaska, they are too busy eating to jump out of the water much, although it does happen. Taking this type of photo is very difficult. The boat is pitching.

I wonder if the snow on these lower mountains ever melts? The mountains are only a few thousand feet from the sea level where I am standing to their tops.I am not sure how I thought glaciers ended, but I think I imagined a wall of ice. In some parts of this terminus of the glacier, there are cliffs of ice. Here along this edge of the glacier, the people are standing on the ablation moraine, which is mostly still ice from the glacier. The pile of debris along the side is a lateral moraine composed of glacial till. The water coming from the left in the photo is a subglacial stream.

As the glacier carves its way down a mountainside, it picks up huge quantities of rock gouged off of the sides of the glacial valley. It carries this load of rocks and silt like a giant conveyor belt and dumps it at the mouth of the glacier. This particular glacier is retreating rapidly and as it melts, it leaves more and more of the dirt and rocks it is carrying. In the not-to-distant past, this glacier ended in the large lake, but now it has retreated up the mountainside. Soon the area at the base of the glacier will begin to be colonized with trees and other plants."},

But here, in Qualicum Beach, B.C. the tidal change was as much as 4.5 meters (about 14 or 15 feet). With such a huge change between high and low tides, there was usually a very large expanse of beach exposed. In this case the local seagull population seemed to enjoy the low tide. Another interesting thing about this photo is the fact that it was cloudy. Yes, it rained every single day we were on Vancouver Island.

I am sure if you lived there, you would soon find the \"real\" Skagway where the reality of living out the winters can be a decisive factor."},
{"title": "Lilacs Blooming in Alaskan Mountains", "date": "Wednesday, July 2, 2014", "text": "I found this beautiful blooming lilac bush in Skagway, Alaska. It was the first of June and in most of the part of the U.S. where I am a frequent visitor, the lilacs had already bloomed months before. It was a pleasant surprise to see lilacs in June. Of course, lilacs do not normally grow in the desert where I have been living for many years. If you do see a bush now and then, the flowers come on in January. Now that I live on the side of a mountain at the mouth of a canyon at over 5000 feet above sea level, I am looking forward to seeing more lilacs blooming."},
{"title": "A Sea Lion Rookery", "date": "Tuesday, July 1, 2014", "text": "Large congregations of animals is one of the hallmarks of the wilderness. Except for animals such a pigeons and other birds, we seldom see this number of wild animals in a civilized, developed setting. These are Stellar sea lions or Eumetopias jubatus. They live in large rookeries and they are an endangered species. We saw this rookery on the shore of the Chilkoot Inlet near Skagway, Alaska. It was a challenge to get photos in focus since we were on a small boat that was bouncing on the waves. You might want to click on the photo to see the detail."},
{"title": "An Early Morning Ray in Alaska", "date": "Monday, June 30, 2014", "text": "This far north, almost to Anchorage, the sun was coming up about 4:00 am. This was one of the most unusual early morning sunrises I have seen and I have seen a lot. This phenomenon was visible for about ten minutes. But it slowly dimmed and then went away. I am guessing that the ray was visible because of the moisture in the air. Even though there did not appear to be any fog, the clouds were low enough to have this much moisture in the air but only visible with the bright morning sunlight."},
{"title": "the Very Edge of the Glacier", "date": "Sunday, June 29, 2014", "text": "Many of the glaciers in Alaska are retreating. Whether due to normal cycles of hot and cold temperatures or to global warming is a much discussed controversy. This particular glacier used to end in a lake, but it has, for the time being, retreated up the valley leaving piles of fine glacier flower and sand in the form of a complex of glacial moraines. It was interesting to find out that the ice from the glacier was still under the piles of sediment. We got to walk right up to the ice and I will have further photos in this particular series in the future."},
{"title": "Honolulu, View from Diamond Head", "date": "Saturday, June 28, 2014", "text": "I never realized that you could hike to the top of Diamond Head on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. I had always thought of it as a backdrop to standard photos of Honolulu. It turns out to be a very popular hike. So popular that finding parking to make the hike is difficult. The view of the city is very impressive. It seems that many cities in the world have built up with skyscrapers rather than out like Phoenix and Los Angeles. In Phoenix there are very few tall buildings. But here, in Honolulu, where land is at a premium, the best way to utilize the land is go up. You can also see the famous Waikiki Beach, visible as a curved beach at the edge of the ocean. This is the dry side of the island and the grass and trees are not lush and green as in many other places. In fact, on the hike up to the top of the Diamond Head, it looked a lot like the desert around Mesa and Phoenix."},

This is my country. Beautiful in its own way but extremely different than the forests and tundra of the North. I really enjoy seeing the beautiful glaciers and mountains of Alaska but there is a difference when I am in Northern Arizona and Southern Utah, that is home to me and home is always beautiful. I love the rock formations and the clay hills. I am glad I do not have to trade one for the other because there would be no decision at all to make. I would choose the desert over the mountains of Alaska. I now live on the side of a mountain. But it is a mountain in the desert and that makes it my home."},

The airport in Anchorage has a parallel lake to be used by seaplanes for landing and taking off. I realize that they wouldn't be much use in Arizona, but any map view of Alaska shows that they have over a million lakes and almost as many rivers. With the lack of developed runways, landing on lakes and rivers is routine. The stories of the pilots and the adventures of flying in the wilderness are legendary. While riding on a riverboat, we got a demonstration of this pilot taking off and landing right next to the riverboat. Here is another photo of him on the water."},
{"title": "Above the Tree Line", "date": "Thursday, June 19, 2014", "text": "In Arizona, the tree line is just above 11,000 feet. There are only a handful of peaks that reach that elevation in the entire state. As you go north, the tree line drops until in this photograph, the tree line is about 3,000 feet and it is about the same as the snow line. Further north, out on the tundra, the tree line drops to sea level and no trees can grow. We don't have any mountains in Arizona that look remotely like these in Alaska.This is a classic example of a hanging glacier. A hanging glacier is one that is perched on the top or on the side of a mountain and does not reach to the bottom of the cliff or slope. It can be very precarious to stay below such a feature because there is always the possibility of movement in the ice that can trigger a large ice fall. This is another example of the fabulous Alaskan glaciers along the coast in the fjords. These are very complex structures and evolve over time. If this glacier were to expand, it would likely splint into two separate arms coming down the mountain on the left and right in this photo. The distances and sizes in these photos are misleading and it is hard to get any perspective, but this glacier is probably a couple of miles across."},
{"title": "Tidewater Glacier", "date": "Wednesday, June 18, 2014", "text": "Fed by mountain snows, a tidewater glacier descends down its self-made canyon until it reaches the ocean. Historically, many glaciers extended miles into ocean, but many glaciers are retreating. This Alaskan glacier is calving with the rise and fall of the tides. This far north, the tides change as much as 25 feet every six hours. The steep part of the glacier is called an ice fall and results in the jumbled and chaotic nature of the ice near the waterline. The dark bands in the ice are rocks and dirt scoured by the glacier in its relentless move to the ocean like a huge frozen slow-motion river."},
{"title": "Butchart Gardens Boat Landing", "date": "Tuesday, June 17, 2014", "text": "One of the many gems of Vancouver Island is the Butchart Gardens, just north of Victoria on Brentwood Bay. This masterpiece of horticulture is one of the biggest attractions in Western Canada. This is the second time I have been at the Gardens and it was much more beautiful this second time than it was the first. This remarkable photo was taken between rain storms. After getting soaked earlier in the day, we dried off eating lunch and then finished our tour.I am not sure that eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) recognize international boundaries, this one happened to live on the shore of the Pacific Ocean on Vancouver Island just outside of the Pacific Rim National Park near Ucluelet. We saw dozens of eagles in Canada and Alaska. They appear to be about as common as the Turkey Vulture (Cathartes aura) in Arizona. Seeing them and taking photos are two different things. Fortunately, like vultures, they seem to sit around a lot so photos are possible. This one was quite a distance away and I took several photos of the same bird."},

{"title": "A Wild Rose in the Rain", "date": "Sunday, June 15, 2014", "text": "There are two things I will always remember about British Columbia and Alaska; the rain and the wild roses. When I was very little, we had a rose bush with roses like these at the front of our lot. It wasn't a pruned, civilized rose, it was a huge rambling mass of rose bush and flowers. When I saw the roses at the edges of the forests, they looked just the way I remembered them from my childhood. I decided long ago, that was the way I liked the whole world, sort of wild and unpruned. The rain was another story. Being from the desert, I don't seem to ever get tired of rain, but trying to take photographs in the rain is a real challenge. Fortunately, even though the camera was getting wet, I remembered to point the lens downward until I got the photo. You learn to take photos quickly when it is raining."},

Here, just below the city of Victoria, there is a steep shoreline with an equally short beach of small rounded stones. These photos were a challenge because it was raining the entire time I was trying to take photos and I had to keep cleaning the camera lens and drying off the camera. The rocks on the shore were amazing and had we not had a weight limit for flying home, I am sure we would have come home with a suitcase full of rocks."},
{"title": "Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay", "date": "Friday, June 13, 2014", "text": "This photo was taken on the Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay Ferry between Vancouver, B. C. and Vancouver Island. We soon learned that rainfall levels on Vancouver Island can exceed 130 inches a year in some locations. We were about to find out what that meant when we arrived on the Island. However, years of living in Panama had inured us to rainfall and we plugged along gamely and endured the rain. Actually, being from the desert it was quite a treat to have rain fall out of the sky like it was something that happened every day."},

It is a typical example of the a \"braided river\" where the river channel migrates back and forth depending on the amount of water and gradient. This is also a typical glacier-fed river with a high concentration of glacial silt. The distant mountains are part of the Denali National Park and are the Alaskan Range. Because of the clouds, you cannot see the higher peaks, such as Mount McKinley, the highest mountain in North America. The land on either side is tundra, permanently frozen ground down only a few feet."},

Some people make the distinction based on whether or not the animal is domesticated with reindeer being the domesticated variety. However, they are essentially the same animal with two different names. Caribou are fairly common in Alaska and we saw several both free ranging and domesticated, during our recent trip to Denali National Park. For more information see the Wikipedia article on Caribou. The Native American population relied on the caribou for many of life's necessities. All parts of the animal were used for food, clothing, or other uses. This caribou's antlers are in the velvet stage and will soon lose its covering and become hard bone."},
{"title": "The Vast Pacific Ocean", "date": "Saturday, May 31, 2014", "text": "One of the most impressive sites on the West Coast of Canada is the vastness of the Pacific Ocean and the knowledge that there is nothing out there but water until you get to Asia. If you look carefully at the photographs of the beaches you will always see huge logs, some in impressive piles. This makes you wonder about the power of the waves from that very pleasant looking ocean and what it would take to throw an entire tree trunk many yards up onto a beach. It is much more pleasant to walk around in the bright sunlight and look at the pretty views."},

It is not uncommon for sea gulls to become famous. Some of my readers may be old enough to remember Jonathan Livingston Seagull. See Bach, Richard, and Russell Munson. Jonathan Livingston Seagull. [New York]: Macmillan, 1970. On the other hand, it is not always convenient to be double-billed. We have to watch this all the time on our own bills to make sure they aren't double billed and double paid. But then again, this seagull isn't likely to worry about his credit cards or being double-billed.This tiny gem of a beach is tucked away in a very small Provincial Park on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. It is called Beachcomber Regional Park and it is located at the end of a small peninsula on the east coast of the Island. It was essentially deserted on the day we visited, as we found many of the beaches to be. I is high tide and the beach is probably somewhat larger at low tide, but this is not a place people would come to surf or swim. It was also a clear day, one of the very few times during our visit to Canada that we didn't have rain."},

I am sure the picture would have been different in the sunshine, but we hadn't seen much of that on our visit at this point.

It is amazing to see how the tide comes in and out and leaves such a huge expanse of sand. I have seen the same thing in Panama, but there the sand was not a firm and nice to walk on.I didn't know that James P. Sullivan (Sully) lived in Victoria, British Columbia.

In those days, the city was so much smaller and had so much less traffic, that the sounds of the desert were always around us. Now that we are sealed up in our air conditioning, I only hear the call of the doves when I happen to be outside.

These cactus bloom several times during the year, unlike most of the other cactus in the surrounding desert. A very old barrel cactus can be 8 to 10 feet high, but you hardly ever see one that large. A few years ago, I wrote several blog posts about the myth that you could get enough water to survive in the desert from cutting open a barrel cactus and drinking the contents. This myth is totally false. The pulp inside is very bitter and could cause you to throw up and lose even more liquid. Only the Ferocactus wislizeni is edible, the rest of the barrel-like cactus are toxic. In addition, all cactus in Arizona are protected by law. So don't try this out or you may incur a sizable fine."},

I have reconsidered the need to always carry around 45 pounds of camera equipment and decided to try one of the newer cameras. In this case, the camera is a Nikon Coolpix L830. The camera has an effective optical zoom level of 34x, making its lens the equivalent of a lens with a focal length of from 22.5 mm to 765 mm. With digital zooming added, the camera lens becomes the equivalent of over a 1700 mm lens. Now, the challenge is keeping the camera steady enough to take a photograph at such extremes. I do notice a small amount of lens aberration at this point in a ring of red around the image of the moon. All in all, this opens up some interesting issues about the future of digital cameras and expensive lenses. I am not ready to trade in my Canon D5 Mark II yet however."},

As you visit the USS Arizona Memorial out in the harbor, you can still see the trapped oil bubbling its way to the surface. It is a very visually remembrance of the catastrophe of that day more than 70 years ago when the Japanese fleet executed a planned air attack on the ships in the harbor. During the attack, a 1,700 pound Japanese bomb detonated the ammunition stored on the ship and ignited the 4,000 tons of fuel stored on the ship.

The USS Arizona was sunk on 7 December 1941 with the loss of 1,177 of her crewmen. Many of those lost still remain entombed in the sunken ship.

One of the prominent background features is Rock Canyon a steep V shaped valley. Both sides of the Canyon are covered in rocks. I has been a popular recreation place for years, but has been under the shadow of private development. The rock outcropping on the right in the image is that part of the canyon in private hands. There were plans to start mining the rock out of the canyon, but fortunately, the City has purchased the property to preserve it from development. I am particularly happy about that purchase since I am moving about a block and a half from the mouth of the Canyon."},

The two, long dormant, volcanoes have been eroded into thin ridges. These mountains shown in the photo, belong to the Waianae Range. They are about 3000 or so feet high. The ridges run right down to the edge of the island and form a mostly rocky beach area. The climate on the West Coast is very different than the interior and other coasts of the island. It is semi-arid and looks more like Southern California than what most people would think of Hawai'i from the promotional ads. There are highways almost all the way around the island, but here on the West Coast the highway ends about where this photo was taken. The variety of O'ahu makes it a very interesting place to visit."},
{"title": "Central Mountain Ridge of O'ahu, Hawai'i", "date": "Saturday, April 26, 2014", "text": "The island of O'ahu has a ridge of volcanic mountains that run roughly north and south along the east coast. There are three main highways that cross the mountains and in each case, there is a major tunnel cutting through the ridge. The ridge creates its own weather. Every time we crossed the ridge it was raining on the mountain and dry on both sides. The west side of the ridge is much drier than the eastern side. Most of the population and the larger cities, including Honolulu, are on the western side. Of course, the whole island chain has a volcanic origin and the steep, highly eroded mountains are evidence of creation of the island. 80% of the population of Hawai'i live on O'ahu and I think they are all on the roads driving all the time. The island has some of the worse traffic congestion outside of New York City and Philadelphia."},

The beaches are spectacular, not much sand, but beautiful waves and rock formations. The highway hugs the coast and ends just where you can see the mountain in the distance. The sandy beaches are confined to the coves where rivers or streams empty into the ocean. I would guess that these size waves are typical. Not much room for swimming or surfing however. The day was slightly overcast, but that was the same as it was almost every day during this season. Not much of Hawaii on the island of Oahu looks like the travel photos and brochures."},

It dates from the very earliest time of Hohokam settlement in the Salt River Valley and at one time was one of the largest and most impressive ruins in the valley. Unfortunately, much of the ruin was excavated and then allowed to wash away in the infrequent rain storms.

But the fences haven't changed. They will be there eternally. Keeping us out. Or in?Theoretically, a tumbleweed (Russian thistle) could keep rolling across the Plateau unimpeded. But there is a reality in fences and other obstructions that prevents an eternal journey. In this case the trip was cut short by a barbed wire fence. We all seem to come up against barriers sooner or later. I think it is interesting that tumbleweeds live their live as green plants but only become nomads in their old age. As humans, we talk about settling down, but I think that really can't happen.As the plants grow in the wet spring, the blowing wind piles the sand as it slows in the plant's branches. The plant, in this case Russian thistle or tumbleweed, grows more to stay above the sand. As the years pass and the plant or its descendants, grows it starts to build a hill out of the sand.

When my daughters were growing up, ear piercing was not nearly as prevalent as it is today and it was quite an issue when they got their ears pierced.One of the things that are right most interested in showing in my photographs is the interplay of form and color. Although my preference is to use natural outdoor examples, I am also impressed by architectural details and in this case by the color and contrast of jewelry. I have mentioned before, the eye do not wear any type of jewelry, but I certainly recognize that wearing jewelry is a cultural phenomena. If you attend a conference such as the Tucson Gem and Mineral Show held every year in February, you will instantly recognize the jewelry is a huge part of our culture.Quoting from a website entitled Russian Crafts:The principle of making dolls remains unchanged until the present time, keeping all the tricks of turning skill of Russian craftsmen. Usually a turner uses such wooden materials as lime and birch. Timber that is intended for the manufacture of dolls, usually is cut down in early spring, purified from the bark, leaving in some places of the log rings of bark to prevent during drying cracking of the wood. Prepared in this way the logs are stacked in piles, between them there is a gap for air flow. Usually timber is kept in the open air for several years to bring it up to a certain condition, avoiding not proper drying. Only an experienced master can determine the readiness of the material. Ready to process the logs are sawn into billets for future dolls. The doll blank overcomes though up to 15 operations in the hands of a turner before becoming a finished doll.If you look closely you will see some of the dolls do not have \"Russian\" themes."},

This is a typical display at one of the larger gem and mineral shows. One year, you will see tables of this type of mineral and the next year they will have all vanished. What happens, is that in mind somewhere in the world will find a deposit of a particular type of crystal which will go on to the market and be bought up by wholesalers. So the entire deposit shows up at one year's gem and mineral show and by the next year they have all been sold or have become so uncommon as to be unnoticeable. We've noticed over the years that it is a really good idea to buy up the minerals that appear to be abundantly available. In subsequent years, we have seen prices skyrocket for the same mineral specimens. One of the interesting things about gem and mineral shows, is the abundance of small and carved stone animals and other figures. Most of these come from places where handiwork is less expensive. I've never been quite sure what the market for these carvings is but it seems like there always a number of vendors selling items such as the one shown in the above photograph. I thought that the photograph was interesting because of the patterns in the colors rather than the subject matter per se.These are commonly called Russian Dolls. The name in Russian is Matryoshka doll.  they are known as a set of nesting dolls made of wood containing identical or differently painted smaller dolls in decreasing sizes. The first Russian nested doll set was carved in 1890 by Vasily Zvyozdochkin from a design by Sergey Malyutin, who was a folk crafts painter at Abramtsevo. See Wikipedia: Matryoshka doll."},

You might notice that, depending on the light, the yellow color of the building changes from almost gray to brighter yellow. Again, this is in Tucson, right downtown in the oldest section.Here I thought the contrast was the key issue. The blue of the yucca contrasting with the yellow wall is a commentary on the natural color vs. the more complex yellow paint.

I don't remember anything about the trip from the airport to the mission home, but I do remember waking up in the mission home very early, while the others were all asleep, and looking out a small window in the door of the place we were staying and seeing a palm tree right in front of the window. With this so familiar a sight, I felt perfectly at home and never had one minute of homesickness for the next two years.This saguaro is not all that unusual. But it is rather large and does have a lot of arms. We have two saguaros growing in our front yard that we have grown from the time they were about six to eight inches high. That was nearly 45 years ago and now they are almost six feet high. But I doubt I will live long enough to see either one with an arm, much less more than one.Ever since Alice stepped through the looking glass into wonderland, I have been looking for wonderland in mirrors of all kinds.

But this one likely came from South America and is commonly called the Old Man of the Andes or Oreocereus celsianus. This American Coot or Fulica americana is not a duck or goose at all. It is more closely related to the Sandhill Crane than any of the other common waterfowl.Most people would not associate pine cones with the desert, but I sit each day writing and looking out my window at three huge pine trees with lots of pine cones. They are well adapted to the 100 degree plus temperatures and do just fine."},

I guess there are those who would probably justify the this nonconformity simply because of the fact that it is possible. But if you look closely at the photo, you might realize that the cactus had to have a reason for growing sideways. Don't get me wrong, I am not anthropomorphizing the cactus, it really can think. Once you get started with somethings, it is hard to know where to stop. Why did the ancient inhabitants of this desert decided to decorate the boulders of this isolated rock outcrop? Especially when there was no water nearby or much of anything else to eat. Maybe that was the reason. They decided the place needed a little livening up and hey, the people who came later would probably lose sleep trying to figure out what it all means.You can spend a lifetime speculating about the meaning of the petroglyphs and I am sure there have been many university research papers and journal articles written on the subject. But I am just as sure that the ancients who inherited this from those who were even more ancient had about the same impression I do on the subject."},

These Claret Cup cactus are fairly rare out in the desert but fortunately the Garden has a substantial number of these plants. The first one that I saw flowering in the wild was by Woods Canyon Lake. Since then I have seen quite a few, but it is always nice to see these beautiful flowers at the Garden. These are some of the earliest flowers to bloom in the desert. We always look forward to seeing the cactus flowers every year. Because so many of the cactus are imported from other parts of the American continents, we do get cactus that bloom at odd times during the year. But these are native Arizona cactus and they usually start blooming in March.I noticed that even though it is still January, the temperature here in Mesa is about to climb over 80°. For us, Spring is just around the corner. So, I thought it was about time to start putting up pictures of flowers in anticipation of the warm weather that will come all too soon."},

If you were to look really close at this photo, you would see some people right at the bottom of the cliff and you could get some idea of the scale. We used to use this rock regularly for rappelling classes and the place to tie in is located about halfway up this rock on top of the big rock just left of the center. The rappel was about 160 feet.It is sometimes easy to forget that the sandstone cliffs of Sedona, Arizona are directly related to the rest of the sandstone of the Colorado Plateau.

It takes more than just happenstance to create a balanced life or even a balanced rock. Here you would never have seen the two balanced rocks were it not for the cloud in the background. The two rocks would blend in so perfectly that they would be invisible.

It wasn't until more than fifty years later that I really became focused on the beauty and grandeur of this special place. From time to time I think about how my life would have been different had I never started my journey of Walking Arizona. The Grand Canyon plays a big part in the Arizona part of my life.There was a time when trapping animals in the areas now contained in the National Parks was legal and encouraged. Back in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt created the Grand Canyon Game Preserve. At the time, the definition of game did not include predators such as bears, mountain lions and bobcats. As a result, in order to protect the game, these animals were hunted almost to extinction. The most obvious result was an explosion of the local deer population that created a huge problem of starving deer. Finally, all hunting was banned after the Grand Canyon was made a National Park in 1919."},

I think this one is even more fearsome because it is so large and scary. On a day when there was a lot of fog and the Canyon was filled with clouds, it was only in the late afternoon that the sun broke through the overcast and began to highlight the colors in the Grand Canyon. In the background, you can still see a bank of clouds that are snaking through the Canyon, but mostly the air has cleared and the clouds are breaking up to show the sky.The lovely cactus wren or Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus is a common visitor in our desert Southwest.

Living in the desert you get out of the habit of carrying coats and raingear and the other necessities of living where it is cold and wet. As I am writing this, it is the middle of December and will be about 70° today with clear skies and soft breezes. I'm sure that this location in the mountains would look considerably different right now with huge piles of snow everywhere. I am not certain which is better. Once you get to a certain altitude in the mountains the entire landscape begins to change. It becomes a different kind of desert. Not a desert lacking in water, but a desert created by the extreme temperatures and abundance of winter snow. This photograph was taken just below the tree line in the Rocky Mountains National Park in Colorado. In this photo, the treeline is very distinct. In Arizona, the tree line is about 11,600 feet and there are only a handful of peaks that extend higher.Many times, the views that appear in a photograph created an abstraction of reality. This is one of those photographs. It was taken looking down into a deep canyon with a very fast mountain stream crashing over the rocks. Without the perspective of the canyon walls and the surrounding hills, the water turns into an abstract pattern.

This was entirely possible since many fossils have been unearthed just few hundreds of yards from my summer home. One notable fossil was taken from a gravel quarry just a about a half mile south of my house. They took out a complete mammoth skeleton. I used to walk by there all the time, not knowing that the fossil find was buried just a few steps away. Mammoths are OK, but I was really wanting to find a dinosaur. I thought I found one and hauled the rocks to show the State Geologist, but he couldn't tell what they were either. Some dreams fade away with old age. The magic of rushing water cannot be equaled. This is especially true for a dyed-in-the-wool desert dweller. I just can't imagine all that water just running down a mountainside and not doing something. Most of my interaction with water has been in the form of irrigation and sprinklers. We either have no water or too much, there are seldom times when there are pleasant interludes with just enough. Watching a mountain stream roar past makes me doubt all that I know to be true about the scarcity of water. It reminds me of the old Colorado Plateau farmer who was rescued after being stranded by a flood. All he could say was \"It is a pity it won't last.\"With the cactus and the purple reeds, you might overlook the large glass balls that are scattered around the Chihuly Exhibit at the Desert Botanical Garden. If you look really carefully, you will likely see my reflection in the glass.This is a collection of shots I took at the Desert Botanical Garden's Chihuly Exhibit in 2013. There are some very interesting and colorful glass sculptures that challenge the eye and the imagination. The colors change throughout the day, so you might want to visit at different times during the time the Exhibit is available.Evening is one of the most beautiful times in the desert.

I think I would have liked graham crackers and milk and nap in graduate school which also didn't prepare me much for the real world.Along with the algae, there are a lot of things that have blown in on the wind in this shallow pond. I don't think anything there looks too appetizing but you never know. I might think differently if I were a bird or some such.It takes some time for logs (and people) to acquire some character.

The bits of white on the water are seeds from Desert Broom plants.Looking at this cactus into the sun, I was interested in the shine on the spines. As a result, I also got a lot of sun spots on the lens, but rather than take them out with Photoshop, I decided to leave them in since they were all in the dark shade of the plants.I have taken the bait and I am determined to photograph hummingbirds. They usually choose a shady branch to rest for a while, so I was lucking to catch this one out on the feeder. I did this with a handheld 500 mm lens at some distance so as not to scare them away.When I get a chance, I like to take photos around wetland areas of Arizona. Wetlands are one of the few environments where you can see large numbers of birds and other animals without spending time in the remote desert camped out on a rock. I can usually find these Mallard ducks at any time of the year."},

Fall is interesting in the desert simply because it goes on until mid-January and sometimes February. Many of our plants in the cities are imports and live on a different schedule than the native plants. Some trees lose their leaves as early as October and others are just finishing losing their leaves when the new leaves arrive in February or March.One of the major attractions for birds in the Fall are these beautiful red fruits of the Chinese Pistachio or Pistacia chinensis. These are fairly large trees that can grow to more than 60 feet tall. I have learned by experience that trees with fruit, nuts or other similar items that can fall on the ground are not the most desirable landscape plants.

It seems to be the rule in the desert that any plant that is vaguely edible has spines or thorns.Even though these Golden Barrel cactus look formidable, they are really quite benign. I cannot remember anyone I knew who ever got stuck by a barrel cactus. They are pretty easy to avoid and the spines, although very sharp, are not positioned to cause much damage unless you happened to run into one directly.Lichen creates a contrast to the dull colored rocks of the low Arizona Sonora Desert.

This sign was about 50+ miles from the nearest paved road and the one we were on soon disappeared into a maze of rocks.The pattern on this rock is very unusual. It looks like it was in an area of high rainfall which contradicts its present location. It is also very unlikely that this boulder came from the sandstone cliffs visible in the background. I was wondering where it might have come from.That part of Arizona that is north of the Grand Canyon is called the Arizona Strip. There are few roads and access to rest of Arizona is very limited. Most of the towns in the Strip are closer to cities in Utah and Nevada than they are to towns in Arizona. I have estimated that some of the residents would have to drive over 300 miles to visit the county seat in Kingman. This photo gives you a good idea of what the Arizona Strip is all about."},

There are always clusters of people watching the sun as it sets and the changing colors of the Canyon. I am running around trying to get good shots and making comments about how lovely it all is.Many of the standard tourist shots of the Grand Canyon would lead you to believe that there was always beautiful weather and the sun was always shining. In fact, the Grand Canyon Rims are at a very high altitude. The average elevation of the South Rim is about 6800 feet or 2,072 meters. The North Rim is much higher at over 8000 feet or 2438 meters.

It is hard for me to imagine the work involved in finding these minerals and mining them from the solid rock where they are located. I am certain that the miners involved in this process receive very, very little of the profit made from these extremely valuable minerals.The fluorite minerals have a wide variety of colors and forms.

This particular variety of prickly pear is critically imperiled in the wild. One thing I've noticed recently is that due to the extreme drought in the Southwest many of the prickly pear plants are collapsing from lack of water. It is strange to see a cactus die because it is too dry. The brick structure in the background is a shade structure to protect sensitive cactus from the hot Arizona sun. The Chihuly reeds highlight the differences between the natural cactus and the glass. The color of the reeds highlights the difference in color but not in form.These are red reeds.

I rarely get the opportunity to see the interaction between water sky and the Fall leaves because we live in the desert and none of these things happen in any kind of order.If you don't know what this photo shows right off the bat, you probably will not be able to figure it out.

In many cases, the abundant spines on the sides of the cactus aren't effective protection against predators. There are of course bird predators so the spines are not a complete protection against danger. The Saguaro cactus Is not only an icon of the entire Southwest but has become intimately associated with the state of Arizona. However, saguaro cactus are more than an icon. They are a complex ecological community.

This long spined specimen looks comfortable in its surroundings.Sometimes I plan to get pictures of animals including insects and sometimes they show up uninvited. I can't remember if I saw this fly in the photo be for I took it or not. If I did, I did a good  job of getting a difficult shot on focus."},

These are in clusters on a stem so they are more prominent, but the tiny flowers are barely visible. I would love to have someone who knew all the flowers walk around with me to point them out. For this reason, we have gone to the Boyce Thompson Arboretum for bird walks, tree walks and lizard walks.I haven't been able to identify these seed pods or the tree. I have a long list of what they are not. But what they are seems to elude me. Maybe, someone out there can help?This is the Painted Lady Butterfly or Vanessa cardui. It is a very common but strikingly beautiful butterfly. I was surprised to see this one in Missouri since I had just seen one in Arizona. There are some variations in the patterning of the wings between individual butterflies.The Common Buckeye Butterfly or Junonia coenia, is found throughout the Mid-west. Its coloration and the design of its wings are anything but common. I took this photo in the Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge, just north of St. Louis."},

I have a hard time reconciling with cold weather. I never seem to take enough coats or whatever to the cold country when it is still over 90 degrees in the desert."},
{"title": "A Fall Carpet", "date": "Thursday, October 24, 2013", "text": "I guess I am attracted to carpets of fallen leaves because they are so rare in the desert. In Mesa, the trees lose their leaves in stages, with some only turning yellow and falling off just as the new leaves appear in January and February. Unless it is unusually cold, very few of the trees have colored leaves. I liked this walk in a deciduous forest. This is the Woolly Bear or the caterpillar form of the Isabella Tiger Moth, Pyrrharctia isabella. This little insect overwinters in this form and survives when it is literally frozen solid. It survives being frozen by producing acryoprotectant in its tissues. In the spring it thaws out and emerges to pupate. Once it emerges from its pupa as a moth it has only days to find a mate. See Wikipedia: Pyrrharctia isabella."},

This is the Clarence Cannon National Wildlife Refuge, right along the banks of the Mississippi River in Pike County, Missouri. It was a cool and windy day, too warm for a coat but too cool for comfort. It was early Fall and the grass had turned yellow and the leaves on the trees were turning but had not dropped.This beautiful old tree had the darkest shade of brown bark I have seen. It was almost black. I love the patterns in the bark and the subtle shades of color.I don't think this is what I had in mind when I heard about levies on the banks of the Mississippi River. I had more in mind huge piles of dirt or cement barricades. The River is just beyond the trees and the levy curves away to the right. From the looks of the surrounding land, it doesn't appear that this levy makes much of a difference in floods.Hollow trees are fascinating in their form and structure. In this case, the tree is very much alive and is recovering from a burn scar. You can tell by looking at the edge of the hollow. The rounded edge of the living wood, shows that the tree will sometime cover up this cavity completely, leaving a hollow core."},

There is no greater contrast than between the riparian zones along the streams and rivers and the very quick transition to the desert. Here that transition is dramatically illustrated along the Queen Creek south of Superior, Arizona.This is a pipevine swallowtail or Battus philenor. It usually appears all dark blue, but the light here made it look brown to black with the blue only showing in the tail area. Until I started taking photos of the butterflies, I really didn't realize how many different species there were here in Arizona."},

See if you can figure out where they are.Sometimes the rays of the sun are almost palpable. These saguaros, ocotillos and a couple of small barrel cactus look as though they were purposefully planted to create an effect. Maybe they were and I just didn't know it.I don't know which is more unusual; the plant or the name. I cannot imagine how this grassy plant got to be called a grass tree or Xanthorrhoea quadrangulata. It looks sort-of similar to a yucca but comes from Australia and so it is not a yucca. It is not a great photo, but the subject is really strange."},

It is a red alert threatened species.This is the paper wasp Polistes flavus. This large yellow wasp frequents the same part of Arizona as the Saguaro Cactus. They are usually found around water because they need water to manufacture their saliva to mix with chewed wood to create the paper of their nests. They are not aggressive and if you leave them alone, they will leave you alone."},

You can click on the photo to enlarge it in most browsers. Just a reminder, euphorbia are not cacti.This is the Curved-billed Thrasher or Toxostoma curvirostre. It is a relatively common bird in South-central Arizona and its range extends deep into Mexico. I am finding taking pictures of birds to be an interesting challenge. You have to be able to see them before you can take a picture of them. I have gone to setting my camera at 2000th of a second and trying to get the bird in focus before snapping the shutter.

Sometimes you can only speculate how these plants got their names. Powis Castle (Welsh: Castell Powis) is a medieval castle, fortress and grand country mansion located near the town of Welshpool, in Powys, Mid Wales. I suppose the plant became associated with the place.This striking flower is Mexican bush sage or Salvia leucantha. I don't think we normally associate spectacular flowers with sage, but they seem to have some notable exceptions to the rule. This is not the sage as in sagebrush, but the sage as in the kind you might eat. As you walk around and look at plants, your world will expand and you will notice even more remarkable things."},

In this photo all you have to do is look at the tree near the bottom middle of the photo. This will give you some idea of the size of these formations.Juniper trees seem to grow in some of the most difficult places on earth. Their wood is very hard and prized as fire wood. In some places in the Southwest, the juniper trees were considered an invasive plant (weed). To try to eliminate so many juniper trees, the ranchers used long chains dragged between two Caterpillar bulldozers. The practice created a lot of dead wood, but over time failed to have much effect on the juniper trees."},

It has been used by the native people of the Southwest since antiquity. Most commonly it is one of several plants used to make distilled alcoholic beverages. The tough fibers have also been used for weaving sandals and other useful objects.One lesson I have learned from walking in Arizona and the desert is that until you learn about something, you do not see it. I have walked by this type of rock and never seen it. What I mean by that is that I didn't know what it was and it was just another rock. When I found out that this was calcium carbonate that had formed little bubbles in the molten basalt, I finally \"saw\" the rock."},

This pattern of geologic uplift and down drop is broken by the huge uplift we call the Colorado Plateau. But even though the geology changes, the sagebrush still grows.Sandstone almost acts like a plastic material. It looks as though it could flow and shape itself to any form.

I have to be careful because I have been around this kind of rock formations all my life and so I see this as normal.

Within a few seconds the light had faded and the scene went too dark to take pictures.Even though the top of the Grand Canyon walls and the Colorado Plateau are both even and almost form a straight line, the cliffs below the Rim are convoluted and bent by the tremendous tectonic forces that raised the North Rim to over 8000 feet in some places. Just as the sun was going down, I walked by this overlook into the Canyon and saw the curved walls of stone off into the distance. It is a wonderful sight.One of the best times to view the Grand Canyon is right during the sunset. The majesty of the Canyon is slowly obscured by the fading light and the colors go from vibrant to subdued.

If you look closely, you will see that it has just eaten a rather large meal, probably a mouse.This is a flowering sagebrush of the Atemisia family. But there are about 39 different species of sagebrush. It is flowering next to a yucca plant. Most of the sagebrush out in the desert does not have such large purple blossoms. I would assume this is not a common variety.This is an Edible Date Palm or Phoenix dactylifera. Not all palm trees bear fruit. Some have hard seeds instead of the soft date fruit.

I used to wonder how people could think that the desert was barren. I think the desert is filled with life, in fact, sometimes too much life. Like when we are fighting the Scorpion Wars with the not so cute desert scorpions. But the desert does have it beautiful places even if you could point to some of it as barren.There are very few places in the desert where there are sizable bodies of water in a natural setting. This is not one of them. But regardless of the fact that this is a man-made reservoir, it has a sizable natural habitat for birds and other animals.

Some plants are quite rare and I would assume this is one of the rare ones.Some plants are grown for the patterns of their leaves and not just for flowers. I like cactus, but I am always impressed with the variety and patterns of the leaves of the plants in the jungles of the world. We have a few plants that grow down here in the low desert that also have variegated leaf patterns but these are particularly striking. There are so many varieties of orchids, some are different species, but others are hybrids and only have color or shape variations. There are between 21,950 and 26,049 currently accepted species, found in 880 genera. See Wikipedia: Orchidaceae. All of them are not a colorful and showy as this pair, but all are really interesting in their own way."},

I wonder if this is where they got the idea for the design? I really doubt it. but it is certainly a striking flower and appears to be hovering.This was a wall decoration at the Denver Botanical Gardens in Colorado. It is one of the most impressive gardens I have ever visited and we would go back in a heartbeat if it wasn't so far away. I know what we will stop to see anytime we end up near Denver.These little orchid ballerinas were dancing in the breeze and I caught them as the twirled. I am pleasantly amazed at the varied forms of flowers in the world and can probably find new ones to photograph for the rest of my life."},

I suppose it would help if we lived somewhere with some humidity, since they seem to need more than we have in the desert. I like them even if they are hard to grow."},
{"title": "Storm over Colorado Springs", "date": "Sunday, September 8, 2013", "text": "The day we decided to drive up onto Cheyenne Mountain there was a storm moving across Colorado Springs. Later that same week, there was a huge flood down the canyon in Manitou Springs. We missed the flood but had an exciting time with the lightning from the storm.This is another in my series of window pictures. This one was taken from near the top of the Will Rogers Shrine of the Sun. This is a stone tower on Cheyenne Mountain and view is of Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is made entirely of stone without the use of wood or nails. It is named for the American humorist who died in a plane crash in Alaska in 1935.This mountain high pile of sand is located in Central Colorado in the Great Sand Dunes National Park. The dunes are piles of wind blown sand agains the high Rocky Mountains and are the tallest dunes in North America at 750 feet. The National Park was created in 1932 and expanded in the 1990s. The Sand Dunes are located at over 8200 feet above sea level."},
{"title": "Proud as a Peacock", "date": "Saturday, September 7, 2013", "text": "A peacock is a really just a turkey with bright feathers. They are domesticated birds in the U.S. and wander around in parks and zoos. If they don't have their wings clipped, they will inhabit quite a large area. This is probably an Indian Peacock or Pavo cristatus. The scientific name would translate to crowned or crested turkey. They come from Africa or India and are found all around the world.Desert birds, as a rule, are not usually noted for their brilliant plumage. I guess this is the reason I am so attracted to brightly colored birds. This is either an Orange Bishop or Euplectes franciscanus or a Southern Red Bishop or Euplectes orix. Birds with brilliant feathers are more easily identified than those that are gray or brown.Supposedly, we have moose in Arizona, but I have never seen one. The biggest animals we have are elk. I have seen moose in the wild, but not too many. I am not usually around areas where there is a lot of water and moose love water. This one appears to be quite content to sit in the shade."},

This mountain sheep cannot be comfortable in the hot summer sun. It looks pretty ragged but it will soon drop off and be replaced in the Winter with another heavy coat of wool.If you closely at any plant or animal you will find surprising shapes and structures. This is the hide of a hippopotamus. In this case the animal was swimming in a large pool and surfaced just long enough for me to get a photo of the reflections of the wet hide. Look carefully and you will see what I mean.This is definitely a photo that you have to click on to see the detail. Feathers are one of the truly amazing things in this world. I have always loved the detail and texture. I find feathers on the ground from time to time and cannot resist picking them up and looking at the marvelous structure."},
{"title": "Cattle Egret", "date": "Thursday, September 5, 2013", "text": "This bird, the cattle egret or Bubulcus ibis is a native of Southern Spain and Portugal but became established in Surinam and Guiana and has relatively quickly spread all across North America and much of South America and all around the world. I have seen them up on the Colorado Plateau at over 5000 feet above sea level. They are incredibly hardy birds and are very attractive with their white plumage. The males get the ruddy feathers during mating season.These giant tortoises live on tropical islands and can weigh up to 600 pounds. I am really impressed with the spikes on this tortoise's front legs. You may have to click on the photo to see them clearly but they are really scary. It is a good thing that they can't move very fast or they would be dangerous.This is another African bird. It seems to be popular in zoos, but I don't know how popular it is in the wilds of Africa. It is a Grey Crowned Crane or Balearica regulorum of the crane family Gruidae. The Crowned Crane was one of the few animals I remember seeing when I was a lot younger than I am now and that was before weird hairdoes came into fashion."},

Gorillas are always one of the most popular attractions at any zoo that has them. Our level of concern and care for all animals is a measure of our own humanity and civilization. I have mixed feelings about zoos."},
{"title": "Hippo", "date": "Wednesday, September 4, 2013", "text": "Stories about hippopotamuses seem to indicate that they are one of the most dangerous animals on earth. This is hard to reconcile with the benign looking floating animals you see in zoos. They are very large and lovely in a weird sort of way. We don't have any of them running around in the deserts of Arizona, so no matter how dangerous they are, I am not too worried about being attacked.This dragon looks less than fierce. I would assume that it cannot breathe out fire or fly. It is a very large lizard, but like all lizards, has little facial expression to tell us whether it is dangerous or not. Actually, it is a Komodo dragon or Varanus komodoensis. They are the largest known living lizards and give us a rare glimpse as to what it must have been like during the times when there were ones a lot larger living on the earth."},
{"title": "See Through Bill", "date": "Tuesday, September 3, 2013", "text": "I didn't know if this bird's name was bill or not, but I thought it should have been if it wasn't. Usually, I like to show the main subject of a photo in some kind of context, but I was taking photos with a very long 500mm lens and this was a photo I couldn't pass up. See Through Bill is a Red Headed Egret.I have always been fascinated by peacocks. We used to have some that lived on our neighborhood. If you haven't been around peacocks, you might not know that they are extremely loud and have a cry like the alarms that go off when you open the wrong door. They would often perch on the top our roof and wake us all up in the morning. Their home was a large orange grove, just to the south of our house. Phoenix probably doesn't have a peacock population any more, since all the groves are now houses or businesses.A knight anole or Anolis equestris is a species of lizard in the Polychrotidae family, and the largest species of anole. Being green is probably a result of living in Cuba where everything is green. Our local lizards are usually brown or gray and have markings that make them nearly invisible in the desert."},
{"title": "On Beyond Zebra", "date": "Monday, September 2, 2013", "text": "Patterns and light and shade, that is what makes up a good composition. There are a lot of copies of zebra hide out there in the world, but none of them is as random or well composed as an original zebra. I liked the way the sun reflected off the top of this animal's back. It gives you an idea that the zebra hide might be a lot more complicated than it seems at first look.Alligators all around. They are the most inert animals I have ever seen. We came back by this group hours later and not one of them had moved. I do know they can run very fast and attack savagely, but they are mostly like looking at highly decorated logs."},

{"title": "Floating in Space and Time", "date": "Sunday, September 1, 2013", "text": "When I take a photo such as this one, I am thinking more of composition than the relationship of the objects to space and time. But when I look at the photos, I immediately see the optical illusions that are created by the reflections and the lack of perspective. It looks like the two floating plant collections are suspended in space and that the edge of the water is really the air.You don't usually see animals resting the way that we would, back against a wall and sitting almost cross legged. It was a hot and humid day and there was a threat of rain. I can't begin to imagine what this particular kangaroo was thinking about, but I am sure I felt about the same way with the heat and humidity.If you look through my photographs, you will see that I am fascinated by color and texture. This image is no exception. It is the side of an elephant showing the texture and color of its hide. It is almost geographic in its form, with the creases that look like canyons and hills on a map."},
{"title": "Well, Hello!", "date": "Saturday, August 31, 2013", "text": "I haven't spent a lot of time around African animals and birds, so my first hand knowledge is pretty sparse. But I have a lot of interest in them and so my book knowledge is pretty broad. I do like giraffes however, more than most animals. They are sort of like camels when you get really close to them, but they would make inconvenient farm or house animals.TV and movie appearances have made these little guys immensely popular. I would imagine that if they invaded someone's cattle ranch or farm, they would probably cease to be so appealing. It is easy to consider foreign pests as cute as long as you don't have to deal with them. We have some pretty cute little creatures here in Arizona, but none of them are international stars except the roadrunners and the coyotes.This is a kori bustard or Ardeotis kori. Native to East and South Africa. Unless you live in Africa, you are probably not going to see this on your local birding tour. It is considered scarce which would explain why I have seen so few of them, also the fact that I haven't been to Africa. This one in in the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo in Colorado Springs, Colorado."},
{"title": "Zebra Rock", "date": "Friday, August 30, 2013", "text": "Every so often, as you drive across the endless expanses of the Colorado Plateau Region, you will see something at looks extremely unusual. Most commonly, the most unusual things are rock formations. But in this case, it was the coloring of the rocks themselves. I have no idea how these unusual rocks were formed, but it cheered me up immensely to see the pattern in the rocks along side the road.This wooden post marks the course of the pioneer wagons as they crossed the vast distances of the Colorado Plateau on their way to cross the Colorado River at Hole-in-the-Rock. The place where they crossed the Colorado River is now under water, but the vast distances can now be traversed with high clearance vehicles on the Hole-in-the-Rock Trail. Can you imagine crossing this country in a wagon?Parts of the Colorado Plateau are floored with sandstone and have huge expanses of sand and sandstone with a line of hills in the distance. If you discount the wind and, in this case, the heat, it is very interesting to walk across the rocks. Almost at every step there is another magical world of color and form interspersed with the hardy desert plants that survive in this arid land. I think I have sandstone in my heart."},
{"title": "Talking Rocks", "date": "Thursday, August 29, 2013", "text": "If rocks could talk, these would be the first. As it is, the center rock has a designer contrail for a hat. Also notice the tree on the ridge line. There is a lot to look at in this photo. The more I look at it, the more I like it.Deere and Company was founded in 1868 by blacksmith John Deere. The iconic road and farm equipment have been part of my life since I can remember. This is a later model tractor with a front loader and a scrape, probably manufactured about 1970 or so. I have not had much time driving a tractor, but I have had some time riding on one when I was a lot smaller and younger.The surprise in this picture is the pillar of rock in the center, attracting your attention away from the oncoming storm and the river of rock running down into the deep of the Grand Canyon. The light changes so suddenly, that you could stand in the same spot and take pictures all day. But with the wind and the coming rain, it was time to move on and return to camp for a night in the rain.When you come to a puddle like this, you have to stop and decide how deep it is before you try to cross it. There seem to be a lot of these puddles in my life. I am always stopping for something and trying to figure out if I am going to sink or make it to the other side. In this case, discretion got the better part of valor and we walked around."},
{"title": "Dirt Roads", "date": "Wednesday, August 28, 2013", "text": "The roads in Arizona and Utah vary from huge freeways to dirt tracks that are passable only with specialized 4-wheel-drive vehicles. This isn't the worst road I have ever driven, but it is a good idea of what they mean when they say, \"Primative Road, 4 Wheel Drive Recommended.\" I could not have made it up this hill in my 2 wheel drive truck, maybe. But it would have been a close call. Here the problem is the mixture of loose sand and large rocks in the road.Not all of the Rim of the Grand Canyon is flat and easy to approach. You could get the impression, if you only visited the developed portions of the Rim, that the Canyon was something you can walk over to easily and look at. In some places, it is rugged and extremely dangerous to approach the edge. It seems that people who go to these places know this and respect the Canyon. Most of the falls into the Canyon seem to come from people in the developed areas.The Colorado River, where it runs through the Grand Canyon, runs from an generally northeastern direction towards the west. This view of the Gorge is looking east, upriver. There are very few places where you can actually see the river except in short glimpses from the Rim. This where you can see more of the Colorado River than in many other locations. There is a large amount of serious geological interest in the issues about how the Colorado could have cut the Canyon in the first place, since the stream would have had to run uphill to do so. Every few years, the theory changes."},
{"title": "Tuweep Metropolitan Area", "date": "Tuesday, August 27, 2013", "text": "Tuweep is the name for the primitive area on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon that is only accessible by those willing to negotiate difficult roadways. The area where you can look down into the Canyon is usually called Toroweap. This is what the National Park Service has to say about the whole area:A visit to Tuweep, a road accessible primitive area, can be very rewarding; however, access is challenging and demands skill at negotiating difficult roadways. The National Park Service preserves the area for its uncrowded, rustic, and remote experience. This experience is dominated by nature and solitude. The number of visitors is limited at peak times of the year. Improvements are minimal and services are non-existent. There is no water, gas, lodging, or food. There is NO telephone or cell coverage at Tuweep/Toroweap.As I am driving along a dirt road out on the Colorado Plateau north of the Grand Canyon, I tend to stop suddenly when I see something of interest. I suppose you could classify this rock as an arch, but that would be a stretch. It is definitely not going to attract tourists.The last rays of the sun hit the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Taken from the North Rim it looks as though the cliffs are small in comparison to the distances of the Grand Canyon. In reality the cliffs are hundreds of feet high. This same distortion of distances in the Canyon led early explorers to try and find a way across the huge gulf."},

{"title": "Close up of Angel's Window", "date": "Monday, August 26, 2013", "text": "Some time ago, I posted a photo of Angel's Window on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon showing the surrounding area. The \"Window\" in the other photo is hardly visible. In this photo, you can clearly see the window and if you look closely you can see the railing on the top of the cliff and someone standing there with their arms in the air. We walked out onto the rock and it is interesting to see how far down the bottom of the Canyon really is.The Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde National Park is a remarkably preserved cliff dwelling. It is the largest cliff dwelling in North America. It was occupied between 1190 AD to 1260 AD. Only a part of the huge building is visible in this photo taken from across the canyon. The trip to visit the cliff dwelling is interesting involving climbing a number of ladders and a steep trail.Bright Angel Canyon is surrounded by the brilliantly colored Redwall Limestone. There are few more dramatic sights in the world than looking down over 5000 feet into the depths of the Grand Canyon. It is confusing, but the Bright Angel Canyon and Bright Angel Creek run into the Colorado River from north to south. The trail that follows the Canyon is the North Kaibab Trail. The Bright Angel Trail is on the South Rim not in Bright Angel Canyon. The North Kaibab Trail descends 14 miles where it joins the South Kaibab Trail. Surprisingly, the Trail is extremely steep as it comes off the Rim but most of the milage is on almost level terrain.You have to look closely to see the cliff dwelling in this image. The building blends in so well with its surroundings that you can hardly make it out. I think modern day architects could take a lesson from the ancient inhabitants of our land to see what can be done in harmony with the rocks and cliffs."},

This is now either a cliff dwelling or the abandoned home of the Ancestral Puebloans. I didn't realize I was offending the Ancestral Pueloans all these years by calling their homes Indian ruins. I guess there goes another perfectly good word.This is a Sonoran Bumblebee or Bombus sonorus. Queen Bumblebees are the largest native bees in the United States. This species is placed in the subgenus Thoracobombus and was named in 1837 by Thomas Say. It is one of our most common and widespread bumblebees. For a lot more information see Celebrating Wildflowers of the U.S. Forest Service.I always wonder if the plants can talk to each other. I would guess that there isn't much to talk about and the conversations probably lag. But in some cases I am forced to think that they have quiet chats about the weather, their surroundings and how they are feeling that day. Sometimes, if I listen really carefully and stay still for a long time, I can almost hear them."},
{"title": "Spines", "date": "Saturday, August 24, 2013", "text": "Cactus spines are often cited as a protection to the plants. In cactus, the spines occur in clusters in the axil of microscopic leaves called glochids. It is clear that many plants have spines but why do some desert plants have spines and others do not? If the development of spines confers an evolutionary advantage, why don't all desert plants have spines?The River Red Gum tree or Eucalyptus camaldulensis is native to Australia. Very early in the development of the Arizona desert, eucalyptus trees were planted in large numbers. But they have now gone out of favor because of their size and the tendency to break off limbs in storms. They are also considered to be untidy but current landscapers and hardly ever used in new plantings. Slowly, the older trees are starting to disappear.Petrified wood is common on the Colorado Plateau. I know of many locations where I can stop along side the road and find pieces of petrified wood in few minutes of searching. I have had large logs around my house and yard all my life. These beautiful rocks come about as a result of minerals replacing the structure of wood over geologic time frames. The most beautiful specimens contain quartz minerals such as jasper. Large areas of the Colorado Plateau are now protected in National Monuments and Parks, where it is against the law to remove any kind of rocks or minerals."},

I can't think of a more appealing combination of colors than the wings of this Queen Butterfly or Danaus gilippus thersippus. There are always those who argue that nature is random, but this kind of color combination argues to the contrary.This is Chinese Pistachio or Pistacia chinensis in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae. I has brilliant red leaves in the Fall (whatever that is?).  This tree is used as a street tree in many locations around the United States. It is rare here in the desert Southwest, likely because it needs water. In China, the oil from the seeds is used for biodiesel production. The wood is used for production of furniture and yields a yellow dye. See Wikipedia: Pistacia chinensis.Sometimes we feel that we are on the stage all alone. Even with this single flower, this feeling of being alone in an illusion. We are never really alone. I am sure if this flower could speak, it would think it was the only flower in world, but it was actually in the middle of a huge garden of flowers and trees and cactus. I never feel alone in the desert."},

When they are dry, they are rivers and creeks. When they have water, they are a flood. There are very few rivers or creeks that have water all year round. This is the dry bed of the Queen Creek.

If they sit still, they are hard to spot. But when they move, you can see them plainly. This cottontail rabbit is fairly large as cottentails go. This is probably the Desert Cottontail or Sylvilagus audubonii. It is found throughout the desert Southwest from Montana south to Mexico. I found this rabbit on the side of the Queen Creek wash.If you were traveling in the eastern part of the United States, one tree would not be noteworthy, unless it were very large or otherwise distinctive. In the desert, a cottonwood tree is like a vision of green in a background of brown and gray. I was particularly impressed with the light on the bright green leaves of this cottonwood tree growing in a dry wash called the Queen Creek.The fishhook barrel cactus or Ferocactus wislizenii is fairly common throughout the desert parts of the Southwestern United States including Arizona. The flowers are either yellow or bright red. It is also a common landscape plant in the desert. An individual cactus can live for around 100 years and can grow up to ten feet tall. We have one of these growing in our front yard in Mesa. Most of the plants lean towards the southwest, due to the amount of sun from that direction. Although, I think it is easier just to look at the position of the sun if you are lost and need directions in the desert."},

In this case, you can really see how many spines there are on this particular cactus plant. What you lose in the detail of the cactus plants, you over compensate for with the detail in the spines.There are a lot of twin buttes that I could use as an example, but I decided that these two reminded me of sisters; not much alike but basically similar. Both of them have faces if you look carefully. The one on the right is tall and thin. The one on the left is shorter and not so thin as her sister.There are several large flowers that are common to the Salt River Valley that are called Mexican Bird of Paradise or Caesalpinia pulcherrima. This is one plant with a plethora of common names including: Poinciana, Peacock Flower, Red Bird of Paradise, Dwarf Poinciana, Pride of Barbados, and flamboyan-de-jardin. The Mexican Bird of Paradise (called the Red Bird of Paradise) is the national flower of Barbados. We have a huge colorful bush of these flowers growing every summer in our backyard.These prickly pear fruits are a tasty treat. But there are some cautions. If you look closely, you will see that they have rather a lot of long spines sticking out. What you cannot see in a photograph, without a microscope, is that there are small spines called glochids surround each larger spine. It is relatively easy to remove all of the spines, all you have to do is have a fire with a flame and pass the fruit through the flame. The spines will then all burn off and the fruit can be carefully eaten. You do not want to get glochids in your skin. They are like tiny pieces of glass and are really bothersome and somewhat painful."},

It is drinking from a lantana flower. We have huge lantana bushes in our front yard that need to be trimmed back all the time, but this butterfly was at the Boyce Thompson Arboretum.If you watch butterflies for a while, you realize that they are pretty picky about which flowers they visit. It was about 95 degrees outside and in the early morning when I spotted this one on a sunflower. This is likely a Queen Butterfly or Danaus gilippus thersippus. This is an appropriate name.Butterflies are an endless joy to watch but these very active ones were difficult to photograph. I took a lot of images out of focus before I caught this one just at the right time. Identifying butterflies is quite a challenge and it is harder when they don't stand still like the pictures in the guides. It is a Pipevine Swallowtail unless I am wrong."},

See Wikipedia: Picketpost Mountain.I must have shot ten or fifteen images before capturing one with four birds at the same hummingbird feeder. It was a very hot day in the late summer and they all needed a quick drink. I could have stayed all day and taken photos but it was getting hot and it was time to move on.This is one of the most beautiful examples of the agave I have seen.

We use a steam juicer to reduce the fruit to a deep red juice that can then be bottled with pectin to make a jelly. They are delicious and have although the process of making the jelly is hot and sweaty since it is still extremely hot in the desert on Labor Day, we have enjoyed the fruit over the years.This type of cactus is commonly called an Old Man Cactus because of the white furry modified spines. There are a number of species and varieties that fall into this category and most of them are from Guanajuato and Hildalgo States in Mexico. the scientific name is Cephalocereus senillis.  We have a very large specimen growing in our front yard."},

This is one of the most remote areas of the United States, with few paved roads and many inaccessible canyons. The State Park is located in a flat, sandy valley surrounded by the magnificent rock formations. It is an almost perfect place to camp and enjoy the beauty of the rocks and canyons.This slender spire of conglomerate is a very unusual formation located in the Kodachrome Basin State Park in south-central Utah. Named in 1949 by members of a National Geographic Association expedition for its spectacular colored rocks and spires. There are no more unusual formations in all of the wonderful rocks of the Colorado Plateau. There are 67 large pipes, such as this one, that scientist believe were made from solidified geyser vents that filled with rubble. It is a marvelous place to camp, hike and explore.Zion National Park is a magnificent show of the layers of sandstone making up the vast Colorado Plateau. The Navajo sandstone cliffs in the background are believed to be the tallest sandstone cliffs in the world. The bottom-most layer visible in this picture is the Moenkopi Formation that composes the rocky slopes The lower red cliffs are the Moenave Formation, deposited in streams and ponds. There is a narrow Kayenta Formation just below the vast smooth cliffs of the Navajo sandstone. The National Park Service describes the forces that made Zion as it looks today as follows:Zion was a relatively flat basin near sea level 240 million years ago. As sands, gravels, and muds eroded from surrounding mountains, streams carried these materials into the basin and deposited them in layers. The sheer weight of these accumulated layers caused the basin to sink, so that the top surface always remained near sea level. As the land rose and fell and as the climate changed, the depositional environment fluctuated from shallow seas to coastal plains to a desert of massive windblown sand. This process of sedimentation continued until over 10,000 feet of material accumulated.The J.

The lines on the rock are where previously driven vehicles have scrapped on the rock. The rock is not going to move anywhere but the metal on the bottom of your car might be left here on this rock. Usually, when I see something like this I am critical of the driving ability of those who went before me. Most of the time, I can avoid hitting a rock like this. In this case, we got out and walked the rest of the way to our objective on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon."},
{"title": "The Old Caterpillar Road Grader", "date": "Friday, August 16, 2013", "text": "This old road grader was left on a dirt road on the way to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. It may be an old Caterpillar pull type grader from the early 1900s, likely a Caterpillar No. 4, Hi-Way Patrol model built from 1932 to 1942. When I was very young, we used to play on a very similar grader and imagine that we were on a ship traveling around the world. Much of our history is locked up in rusting equipment abandoned by the side of the road. It would be interesting to see who claims to own this wonderful machine.Highway 12 in Southern Utah likely has some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. This is the main route to reach Bryce Canyon National Park, but even before you reach Bryce, you drive through some fantastic rock formations in an appropriately named Red Canyon. These formations are similar to those in Bryce, but simply not included in the National Park. The area is part of the Dixie National Forest and has its own visitors center. The Canyon is approximately 7 miles from Panguitch,Utah. Reach the Canyon on Highway 89, turn east onto Highway 12. From the junction it is approximately 3.5 miles to the Visitor Center, which is located near the Red Canyon Campground. Bryce Canyon National Park is a 13 miles away."},
{"title": "Cattle Guard", "date": "Thursday, August 15, 2013", "text": "The theory here that the cows will not cross the guard because they cannot see firm ground to walk on. It must work because there are probably a million of these scattered all over the west. We used to pick up our feet in car when we drove over a cattle guard to keep from getting out toes caught in the bars. We don't seem to worry about that as much anymore.Many of you who view these photos may not know that you can subscribe to this blog by clicking on the link in the sidebar. The sidebar is only visible if you move your mouse to the right side of the screen. Just a note to explain how the site works.Without the fence line, it would be impossible to get a sense of the distances involved in traveling across the vast reaches of the Colorado Plateau. As you drive, it almost feels as if you are standing still. But every so often, you pass a fence line with a cattle guard and you can tell you are moving across the valleys towards the distant mountains. It is interesting in this photo that there are several tumbleweeds blown against the fence. Although intimately associated with the old West, the Russian Thistle or Tumbleweed is a recent foreign addition. None of the original pioneers would have ever seen a tumbleweed.It is easy to tell that the huge cliff wall in the foreground is much nearer to the spot where the photograph was taken than the wall in the background and also much nearer than the mountain on the horizon. It is this sense of depth that gives the Grand Canyon most of its majesty. The distances involved in this photo are very large. it is likely more than fifty miles in a direct line to the mountain on the horizon. Of course, the distance by road is considerably more, about 200 miles. As you stand on the Rim of the Grand Canyon, you gain an entirely new perspective of distance and time. Not only can you see great distances, you can also look way back into time.There is a difference between arches, bridges and windows. A bridge is considered to be a natural stone arch that spans an eroded canyon or valley. See USGS.gov, Geological Survey Bulletin 1393, The Geologic Story of Arches National Park. When a similar rock structure does not span a eroded canyon or valley, it is called an \"arch.\" The term \"window\" is somewhat arbitrary. In this case, the Angel's Window on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, is somewhat overwhelmed by the size of the cliffs and the surrounding canyon. It is barely visible near the top of the jutting ridge. Usually, shots of Angel's Window give the impression that it a huge structure. It is large, but not so large as to be very visible unless you are right next to it. Sometimes the designation \"window\" is used when the arch is more like a hole in the rock face than an actual arching structure. There are lots of unnamed windows in rocks around Arizona."},
{"title": "Perched on the Rim", "date": "Wednesday, August 14, 2013", "text": "This is the Grand Canyon Lodge on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987, it was built in 1927 and 1928 and rebuilt in 1936 after being destroyed in a fire. The Grand Canyon Lodge is a complex consisting of a main lodge building, 23 deluxe cabins, and 91 standard cabins on Bright Angel Point. Here is a description of the construction of the lodge from the National Park Service Website:The main lodge is U-shaped in plan and is constructed of Kaibab limestone, ponderosa logs, and log-slab siding on wood frame construction. The multiple roofs primarily are intersecting gables with broken pitches that are further broken up by shed and gable dormers. All of the roofs are finished with wood shingles. Log outlookers project beyond the rooflines from the gable ends. The stonework is random rubble masonry bonded with cement mortar. Portions of wall between the stone piers and the stone wall sections are filled with dark-stained log siding with cement chinking, and large expanses of plate glass particularly on the south elevation facing the canyon.Imagine the violent forces of wind, rain, snow and ice that this lonely juniper tree have endured. It is hanging right on to the edge of a huge cliff on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and balanced on a rock. But I do think it suffers more from tourists that it does from the elements.The exposure of the cliffs on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon are truly awe inspiring. At this point, the Canyon is more than a mile deep and the cliffs drop off by the thousands of feet. It is truly amazing with all the visitors to the Canyon, that more people don't fall. I often wonder what it would take to explore the entire Canyon. But then I have read the exploits of Harvey Butchart who hiked over 12,000 miles inside the Canyon and I know I have already chosen not to do all that."},

This one was running around on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon and decided to pose for a photograph. But when I tried to get even one foot closer, he took off and disappeared in an instant. You may have to click on the photo to see the detail of his eye.When we visited this old fire ring on the Kaibab Plateau, my wife remembered having campfires with marshmellows here almost 50 years before this picture was taken. Very little seems to change out in the forests and deserts of Arizona. Except us.The Grand Canyon is a place of precipitous cliffs. It is not a comfortable place for those with vertigo or fear of heights. But I have noticed that most of the people who come to the Park do not have an appreciation for the exposure of the cliffs. Without going down into the Canyon, you cannot appreciate the vast distances and the huge heights of the walls of the Canyon. So I see people dancing on the edges and it explains why they occasionally fall into the Canyon."},
{"title": "Last Light", "date": "Monday, August 12, 2013", "text": "The sun sets beneath the clouds and gives one last flash of sunlight. Not enough to illuminate the landscape, but enough to add color and depth to the Canyon. The North Rim is a good place to watch the Summer sun set."},
{"title": "The Fallen Fence", "date": "Monday, August 12, 2013", "text": "Wood fences do not last forever. Eventually the ravages of time rot away the posts and the fence comes down. On the Colorado Plateau, metal seems to last forever, but even the metal will turn to rust and disappear. We should all live so long!It is harder to get interesting photos from the North Rim of the Grand Canyon than it is from the South Rim. The viewpoints and the light don't seem to mix quite as well, but when the light and the view come together, you can get outstanding photos. Sunny days seem to wash out the colors so you get a lot more saturation with clouds. Don't always wish for sunny days if you like to take photos."},
{"title": "Summer Storm over the Grand Canyon", "date": "Sunday, August 11, 2013", "text": "The good news is that there is a storm. The bad news is that there is a storm. Sitting on the Rim of the Grand Canyon is not the best place to be in the middle of a thunderstorm with lightning striking all around. A recent news article talked about a honeymooning couple from Thailand who were recently killed by a lightning strike. I have my own experiences with lightning and am pretty wary of the danger.Rocks talk to me. I realize they aren't supposed to have much to say, but we have been carrying on a conversation for years. The irony of the situation is that I spend almost all my time indoors in front of a computer, when I am only really alive when I am out in the wilderness talking to rocks. By the way, they have a lot to say. These roots looked like they were trying to escape from the clutches of the rocks. You can certainly see how the roots of plants break apart the rocks and help to cause them to ultimately be reduced to dirt or sand. This is on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon in the limestone layer that lies just below the Rim known as the Kaibab limestone."},
{"title": "Corral at Billy Sink", "date": "Saturday, August 10, 2013", "text": "There are a lot of places in Arizona that are not so well known and rarely visited. Billy Sink gets its share of visitors, but mostly only during hunting season. During the long hot days of summer, the Sink is almost always deserted.Buckskin Mountain is the old name of the present-day Kaibab Plateau. I never see new fences made this way, there are way too labor intensive. This old fence is showing its age and some of the rungs of the fence are falling out of their holes in the uprights."},
{"title": "The Old Road on the Kaibab", "date": "Saturday, August 10, 2013", "text": "I always seem to find an old road to travel. Freeways have their place, but I would rather travel the back roads of Arizona and Utah any day over driving at 75 mph on a freeway. I found a lot of the back roads in the Eastern United States to be paved, which I think is a shame. Travel needs to have at least a modicum of connection to the earth and dirt is definitely connected."},
{"title": "A Well", "date": "Friday, August 9, 2013", "text": "I am a desert dweller. I go in for anything having to do with water. Most of our wells are mechanical pumps and not picturesque at all. I was attracted by both the stone texture and the shape of this traditional Japanese well.This beautiful pond and garden is in the Denver Botanical Garden. It takes years of patient gardening to achieve this kind of view, or a lot of money.Gardening can be a highly civilized and civilizing activity. No where is this more evident than in formal Japanese gardens. Everywhere you look, you see evidence of patience and beauty. There is definitely a discussion here about the whether a cultivated tree is natural and whether nature itself has a monopoly on its own beauty, but there is something appealing about the formality of a garden that argues well for itself."},

It was as if someone had specifically planned to put them in this particular shape. It is interesting how the color changes from pad to pad. I have quite a few images to upload of the water lilies.Yes, this is the same Brugmansia x cubensis flower I already uploaded, but it is a different bush. I love both the color and the shape of these flowers. I doubt anyone will be growing these in their yard very soon or ever.Yes, this is Brugmansia x cubensis and I had to take a photo of this really unusual flower. This particular plant was growing in the Denver Botanical Gardens in Colorado. They sort of look like inverted squash blossoms but they are growing on a tree-like bush, not a vine."},
{"title": "Orchids in a row", "date": "Wednesday, August 7, 2013", "text": "The Orchidaceae is a diverse and widespread family of flowering plants. About 6% to 11% of all of the plants in the world are in this huge plant family. See Wikipedia: Orchidaceae. We usually think of this type of flower when we think of orchids, but there are many related plant species with far less prominent flowers.There seem to be an infinite variety of color and form in the plant world. This bromeliad is an example of a plant that is usually quite inconspicuous. In this case, there is no question that the plant wants to help the pollinator to find the small inconspicuous flowers in the center of the leaves.This is a real photograph of a real scene. It has not been modified or blurred by Photoshop. You might want to try and guess what it is.It is interesting to speculate as to why some flowers are more \"popular\" than others. Some differences, such as color and size, are obvious reasons. But I suspect that most of what we value in flowers is based on our overall cultural background. If we are taught that such-and-such flower is more desirable than others, we assume that value system. These orchids would be considered valuable and beautiful in some cultures and not so much in others."},
{"title": "Spring Poppies", "date": "Tuesday, August 6, 2013", "text": "I love poppies. But they don't last very long in the desert. These are not the common desert variety that we see sometimes in the Spring, depending on the rainfall levels in October through the end of the year, but a more civilized, garden-type flower. If you can get them to bloom in the desert, the flowers last only a few days and then are gone for another year.I don't think this will make the scary list for Halloween, but standing saguaro skeletons are not that common. Most of the time, the plant falls over long before the more fleshy parts of the cactus disappear. Most of the time, if there is a standing skeleton, it has been propped up artificially. This one seems to be natural. Pretty strange.I am really amazed at the number of varieties of daffodils there are in the world. Apparently, this is one type of flower that can have a lot of hybrids. All of them are in the genus of narcissus in the Amaryllis family. Depending on your source, there are as many as 60 species of narcissus, all of which I would probably call daffodils. Other common names are jonquil and, of course, narcissus."},
{"title": "Not all a flower", "date": "Saturday, August 3, 2013", "text": "These flowers are deceptive. The large white portion is really a leaf in disguise. I think it is interesting how the one modified leaf turns into a flower stalk.If you climb above 12,000 feet in elevation in the lower 48 states, you enter a completely different world. It is just as if you had traveled north to the tundra. It takes some time to become acclimated to this altitude. It is like entering a different world. I get the same feeling entering into the depths of the Grand Canyon, although you don't get the far view of snow and glaciers. These tiny flowers are enhanced by the carmine colored leaves of the this monocot bromeliad. I like the contrast of these plants that grow in the tropic jungles. Unfortunately, they don't thrive in the dry desert heat of Arizona without special care and enhanced growing conditions. Their most common relative is the pineapple."},
{"title": "The Hollows", "date": "Friday, August 2, 2013", "text": "These sandstone formations almost look like skulls. They are extreme examples of the differential amount of weathering in the softer rock layers. If the the weathering continues over some huge period of time, these rocks might eventually be a series of arches.Orchids are one of the most common types of flowers around the world. Orchids have 21,950 and 26,049 currently accepted species, found in 880 genera. This kind of flower does not grow well in the desert without extreme measures and then only if you provide enough moisture for humidity and a constant temperature. I have not been successful in growing orchids.Some of us are not afraid to stand out in a crowd. Being and individualist can have its positive features, but it can also be highly negative if the choices we make are consistent with our own well being and interests. There can be very individualistic criminals as well as contributors to any society. This tree probably did not choose to grow where it did. But it made the most of the situation.Bananas grow in bunches on banana trees. The trees aren't really trees, but huge green plants. The flowers are varied, some are not as colorful as these. I used to lie on my back on the lawn when I was a child and watch the banana trees grow. They grew fast enough during the hot summer, that you could actually see the process."},

I have been watching one small wash in a similar clay but in Arizona for over 50 years and there has been a significant change in this one small piece of the world. But most of the hills appear timeless and eternal.There are always those who like to be different. Not because they are different than anyone else when you get right down to it, but because they like to do things that surprise those around them. This tree is a good example of individualism. It is growing right at the top of this sandstone rock.I guess I am surprised that these clay hills have not disappeared long ago. It would seem that one or two good rainfalls would wash away this pile of mud and leave nothing but the imbedded rocks behind. What is the case, however, is that the clay is extremely resistant to erosion because of overlaying much harder rocks. So you can see these clay hills even in areas that seem to get a substantial amount of rain."},

I guess I would rather spend my life in the desert Southwest than travel the world looking at other's wonders. I know from experience that there are lovely places all over the world, but I guess my heart is really made of sandstone.Arches just happen to be in some of the most inaccessible places in the world. Grosvenor Arch is no exception. Although there is a fairly good dirt road out to the arch, it is really obscure and the road is anything but well marked. It is also not a place you want to be caught in a rain storm because that same dirt road has a tendency to turn to slippery mud. It is dramatic however and a lovely place."},

{"title": "Sandstone Towers", "date": "Saturday, July 27, 2013", "text": "You would begin to think that these tower formations were common. In fact, they are exceedingly rare, but there are small areas where they appear more frequently. They are very large, even though because of the scope of the photograph, they appear to be small. The cliff in the background, for example, is probably over 1000 feet high. This is part of the Devil's Garden on the Hole-in-the-Rock Road.The huge solitary sandstone and conglomerate pinnacles that are scattered over the Colorado Plateau are so unusual as to appear nearly impossible. The theory on this particular monument is that there were cracks in the original sandstone that filled with a harder mixture of sandstone blocks and other types of material that resisted erosion more than the surrounding rocks. Whatever the explanation, the reality exceeds belief. It is hard to get a perspective of the size of these huge rocks. Either they appear to be small due to the vastness of their surroundings or very large when you finally get close to one."},

The color and forms change every minute with the light and shade from clouds and the time of day. There are few areas in the Southwest with as many diverse geologic formations in such a small area.You can tell how old some of these pictographs are by the the changes to the rock surface. If you look closely, you can see that there is a stain and some erosion on the rock that covers part of the big horn sheep. This kind of change can take hundreds or even thousands of years. I am also fascinated by the shape of the bear. It is identical to Hopi fetish designs currently being made by artists."},

The Canyon is so vast that it feels like the walls of the Canyon are rising and that you are not really entering the Canyon.

The Colorado Plateau is level and the Canyon is cut down from the level surface of the Rim or Plateau which lies at about 8000 feet. The best time to take photos in in the evening or early morning when the colors are most vibrant and the light is at an angle making shadows that show the highlights of the cliffs.Looking like a huge circus or special event tent, this Navajo sandstone dome is a prominent feature of Capitol Reef National Park. Navajo sandstone is one of the most prominent layers of sandstone throughout the Colorado Plateau. Its distinctive yellow-white color makes it easy to identify.There are millions of these rocks scattered throughout the Colorado Plateau. What is interesting about these particular rocks is that they are on the main road into the Capitol Reef National Park and there is a turnout and a sign. So, tourists, such as I am, feel compelled to turn out and take a picture of these particular rocks although we blithely ignore millions of their cousins scattered in other, unmarked areas of the desert. I guess we all need some one to tell us to look at stuff.This cute little White Tailed Antelope Squirrel was on the lookout. These small creatures are often called \"chipmunks\" but that term is not used in there proper names or classification. This mammal is found throughout Utah and Arizona. This one was found in Capitol Reef National Park in central Utah.This is another in my series of window photos. Most of the photos are from older houses, but I have recently taken some windows in modern buildings. The symbolism of the window is very pronounced in this photo. The idea is that we look out on the world from the comfort of our own home, but at the same time, those outside can see in. Both views are restricted to the frame or the limits we place on allowing ourselves to see the world or allowing others into our own world."},

It has a large stone weight on the end of the top rail that acts as a counter weight to the gate. If you remove the small rod holding the gate in position, it will swing freely upward and open. To close the gate, you pull down and if it is balanced correctly, with a small effort you can replace the locking rod. This is not a very common solution to a common problem."},

Sometimes these newer model stoves are mixed in with very much older antiques simply because they burn wood. They are better in most ways than cooking over an open fire.The West is littered with remnants of the old wagons. This one looks a little larger than usual and was likely used for freight. Since the wagons had such a high clearance, the old wagon roads are not suitable for vehicular traffic except for very high 4-wheel drive vehicles.Some people think that these old machines did as good as or better job than the new ones. In talking to people who sew, I find a nostalgia for the old machines but a firm acknowledgement that the newer computerized sewing machines are better in many ways.

It is only worth the trip in retrospect. While driving the dirt road, the goal becomes less and less relevant, especially when it is threatening rain and the road was already muddy in some places.

These photos always remind me that part of the world is not desert, but the most interesting parts are.I am always amused by the so-called Scenic Byways (or equivalent) signs on roads around the country. It is as if someone feels compelled to tell you that what you are driving through is scenery. I doubt this road got the attention of the tourist bureau of Utah. But I consider this to be a Scenic Byway, at least it is for me.Most of the photos you see of the Southwest are promotional in nature and they (whoever) don't want you to know that the weather is not always sunny and bright. Sometimes it is rather horrible. By and large, I have learned to ignore the weather except in those mostly rare circumstances when it gets really bad and I am in danger of my life. Then I usually pay attention to what is going on around me.Dealing with barbed wire fences is a fact of life for anyone traveling in the off paved road world of the West. This is a relatively recent and well-maintained fence line. You can tell from the age of the metal posts and the fact that the fence looks repaired.

What is lost and what is gained from creating this kind of flower? These are questions that address most of what we call progress in our world today.Flowers, like people, appear differently in a group than they do individually. When you see this many flowers together, you do not often focus on the individual flowers, but look at them as a splash of color.

{"title": "Varieties", "date": "Friday, July 12, 2013", "text": "Tulips are a major industry originating back in the 1500s when they began to be imported from Turkey. The first tulips were long-stemmed, red-flowered cultivars. They were illustrated by the German naturalist Konrad Gesner in 1559, and have since borne his name in the species gesneriana. See Origins of the Dutch Bulb Industry. Quoting from that article:One other interesting bit of history, which occurred  in the early 1600s, was \"tulip mania.\" This sprang from the tendency of tulips to be infected with a virus, resulting in odd yet often attractive colored streaking in the flowers. These variants, called \"broken\" tulips, became prized, sought widely, and worth many guilders (money). This led to widespread trading, speculation, and then as most such fads sudden market collapse in 1637. These lovely tulips have remained to this day, however, depicted in the art of the Dutch masters. For this reason, similar ones today with such streaking of various colors yet without any virus are called “Rembrandt” tulips.For years we tried to grow ranunculus in our front yard. We never had much luck with the blooms and keeping the plants alive through hot summers was also not easy. We had to dig up the roots and store them in a cool, dry place every year so they would grow the next year when planted. I really appreciate these flowers.We have a few dramatic flowering trees that are common in Arizona, but this one happens to be on Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. I like these types of photos when it is well over 100 degrees in the summer to remind me that not everyone lives where the temperature goes up to 119 or higher."},

The older the window, the smaller the panes and the muntins, grilles, grid or windowpane dividers. All of the terms are used for the parts of the window dividing up the glass.The striking sun and shadows of these sandstone hills are common in the Winter months when the sum is low and to the south. The hazy quality is likely because this photo was taken almost in the middle of Sedona, Arizona, a very busy metropolitan area.Early wall construction was pretty simple but also complicated. If you have ever tried to build a wall out of stone, you know what I mean. But to plaster the wall, the ancients used the most available material: mud. You can still see hand prints in the mud applied to this rock wall at Tuzigoot. This is one of the bridges spanning the canyon over Oak Creek. The flare in the center of the photo is a reflection of the sun on the lens of the camera. If you become aware of these lens flares, you will see them all the time in both professional and amateur photos.

Copper minerals are very showy and obvious in some cases.The dry desert air acts like an archive of all of the old machinery that is abandoned and laying around on the gravel and dirt.

This particular locomotive was put into use between 1905 and 1908 in the mines near Jerome, Arizona. This locomotive was left in the underground mine for over 50 years before it was dragged out onto Main Street to rust in the Arizona sun.Quoting from the sign, \"this piece of equipment was the first successful mining device to replace human labor in removing the rubble from from underground hard-rock blasting. The Model 12B, which weighs 4,200 pounds and requires 60 to 125 pounds-per-square-inch air pressure, was first introduced in 1938.\" Like many such things in Arizona (and elsewhere) this equipment is rusting along side the road."},

If you look closely, you will see why I think this rather large rock formation is ready to fall over.It is particularly strange weather when two very distinct cloud banks cover the Grand Canyon.

There are benefits of standing in the rain taking pictures with an umbrella. If you come to the desert from places where there are trees and green plants growing you get the impression of dry, open spaces. But in reality, the desert is a place of contrasts. There is water and when the water is available, the plants grow luxurious and green. The difference ends where the water ends.

Always hope there is bad weather at the Grand Canyon if you want to really see it.Maurits Cornelis Escher could have taken a lesson from the Hopi potters. They were already well into repetitive, infinitely recurring designs long before he was born in Leeuwarden, Netherlands in 1898. If you look carefully at this excellent example of the potter's art, you will notice that the designs are not exactly reproduced. It is this lack of precision that makes the art of the pot.Some of the canyons in Arizona are spectacularly large, such as the Grand Canyon, some are so short as to be ignored and lost on maps without a name. This short canyon in the Rimrock of the Colorado Plateau is likely in the second category. It is no more than a crack in a huge cliff face, but it is worth the photo none-the-less."},

Anyway, it would take a hundred years or more for the saguaros to grow to this size.The cholla is the most fiercely protected cactus and apparently puts so much energy into spines that it has little left over for flowers. Cholla flowers are small and sometimes overlooked because the rest of the plant is so formidable.This huge saguaro is not nearly the largest one in Arizona, but it is a really good example of how big and high these marvelous desert plants can grow. If you look closely, you will also see some ocotillo blooming and the last blooms of the brittle bush.We always called these small lizards, horny toads, but scientists and others don't listen much to children.

Fishhook barrel cactus are not too common and have relatively little fruit on each plant. This particular one is an exception. Pink is an unusual color for cactus flowers.

Well, the key is that it is not so hot in the Winter and it is also not so dry as it is portrayed. There is always enough water for the plants that have adapted. Some years there are more and some less, but there are always flowers."},

They are common enough to be familiar but uncommon enough to be remarkable.When I was studying art at the University of Utah, we were taught to distinguish between areas of light and dark and see things as patterns rather than as objects. I think some of this carried over into my photography. I tend to see things in terms of patterns of light and dark, rather than as objects. I also love the texture of tree trunks.I have been around windmills all my life. I am always amused when I read about solar and wind power being modern innovations. The windmill did its job of pumping water, day and night, for years upon end without needing more than occasional maintenance. There is a lesson to be learned from this for modern society."},

It is commonly called Jimson weed (which we call jipsom weed) and Loco weed. It is highly toxic and a few people and a few cows die now and again from ingesting too much of the plant. It is one of the most prominently showy flowers in the desert that is not a cactus. Out in the desert, spiders pretty much rule the ground. Someone was commenting recently about killing off a bunch of undesirable house spiders, but there really isn't anyone with poison out there where they live naturally. Fortunately. I don't mind spiders so much, especially compared to scorpions."},

I am sure it is the first time I have seen one that I knew about and identified. I have heard about coolibah trees from the song Waltzing Matilda almost all my life. Now, I have finally seen one in person.I guess I can't resist the unusual. We often think of butterflies as brightly colored. But in the desert, they can blend right into their surroundings just like many other animals and some plants. This little butterfly was sitting in the middle of the path and if I hadn't seen it land, I would not have seen it at all.These beautiful backlit yucca blooms were mixed in with a thick area of other vegetation. Usually, they are sitting out on a hillside, prominently displayed. This is one of those photos where you need to click on the photo to see the detail.

There is nothing common about the color of their feathers, although they are a common sight on Arizona ponds and lakes.Herons often appear to be statues. They hold still for so long you think they must have gone to sleep, but they are merely waiting for a meal to swim into view and can move quickly when they see something interesting. This one was strolling gracefully across the pond looking for a meal.We were walking along the bank of large pond, when this black necked tern decided we had invaded his territory and began to put on a dramatic display of feathers and ruffles. Because of his coloration, he blends in well with the ground so you have to look closely to see him."},

There is nothing wrong with this bird that a leaving the area wouldn't cure. This little dove is sitting pretty in her secure home in the saguaro.

But sometimes you can get a hint of the size looking at this type of photo.Being able to see is a blessing. Sometimes not being able to see is a blessing. In this case, I could see this cliff and the rocks with faces and trees growing in the crack in the rock. With a total view of the Canyon, these things would not be noticed.Indian ruins hold a fascination for me. I like to see how and why the people lived where they did. The walls only give a suggestion of what was there originally. Some ruins are vast and impressive. Others are more quiet and intimate. I like both.My favorite time to visit the Grand Canyon is in the Winter. The main reason is the weather and the colors, but it is also a benefit that there are far fewer people. You can have the whole Canyon to yourself. But be ready for cold, wind, fog and snow."},

These artifacts are considered some of the oldest to be found in the desert Southwest. They date back thousands of years. Sometimes simple things are really the most complex.Commonly called arrowheads, this type of point could have been used on a variety of projectiles. When I was young, I was always looking to find an arrowhead. But today, it is against the law to even think about finding one.The Kiva was a round, ceremonial room, usually below the level of the ground. Its structure was derived from ancestral Pueblo pithouses. Many kivas are still in use today by the descendants of these ancient inhabitants. All we usually see is the evidence of the walls and the distinctive round or slightly oval construction.When the temperature drops in the desert, it is likely that some of the plants in our neighborhood will suffer frost damage. Sometimes this damage is extensive. It is always reassuring to know that some plants and animals adapt to their surroundings and survive extreme cold and heat. Survival is sort-of my goal right now."},

I am happy to be able just to know that someone could make something so perfect.Most of the photos you see of the Grand Canyon are predictable.

Yes, children, I am old enough to remember PacMan.Mesquite is a desert tree that is classified as a legume, just like lentils and beans. These abundant flowers turn into long edible pods and beans. Unfortunately, all this natural food goes to waste in most urban plantings of the trees where the pods and beans are considered a nuisance rather than a food source. That is the case with a lot of food plants in the Southwest."},

But it is interesting how they can stand up so straight on their short hind-legs and survey their surroundings.It is the contrast between the profusion of spines and the flowers that make the cactus plants attractive. Normally, you would want to pick or smell one of the lovely flowers, but the nature of the plant makes both these activities highly questionable. I have very little sense of smell and so I can't tell you if the cactus flowers have any perfume, but I doubt it."},

Even though they have stickers, these aren't cactus. The jagged hooks are really quite innocuous compared to other plants, especially most of the cacti.These aloe plants are not cactus but are considered to be a succulent. They grow very well in the dry desert and will survive with very little water. But if you want them to spread and grow in huge clumps, all you have to do is give them a little bit of water. We have always had aloe growing somewhere around our house for many, many years.The flowers on the prickly pear (opuntia) always form on the edge of the pads. The buds start as small fuzzy spots and grow into the fruit-shaped buds that blossom and then ripen into the dark red fruit.

It dramatically illustrated why the desert varnish (mostly minerals such as manganese dissolved in the water) is formed from rain water.These agave stalks were seen all over the desert valleys all blooming at about the same time. Once these plants bloom, the main plant dies. So there are likely a lot of landscape gardeners out there looking for replacement plants. In the natural setting, the agaves propagate by sending out shoots that grow into new plants after the main plant dies.We all seem to think that pleasant, sunny days are preferable over the stormy ones. It is that way in life also; we think that the placid times are preferable to the turbulent ones. But when it comes right down to it, storms are what makes life interesting and worth living. It is the same with photographs."},

Life is made up of the details but remembered in the generalities. You might miss a flower, such as this one, if you are in too much of a hurry. It was hiding among the bushes.I think it is interesting how the blooms are sort-of randomly scattered around the cactus plant. There doesn't seem to be any particular reason for where the flower stalks grow. Maybe someone has done a study on the placement?I often wonder why these small animals seem to have such thick coats of fur when they live in the hot desert. Maybe the fur helps to keep them cool as well as warm? They do not come out during the hot part of the day, but if you look around in the early morning or just as the sun is going down, you can see quite a variety of animals in the desert. This is a round-tailed ground squirrel, in case you were wondering."},

Sometimes, I can catch these sentinels with my camera. Water is the most important element in the Arizona landscape. Seldom is there enough.

This is true even of the majestic saguaro cactus, the icon of the Arizona-Sonora Desert. This is a much younger saguaro than you might usually see in photos, but it is still likely almost fifty or so years old. It can take up to a hundred years for the saguaro's arms to appear.

The ruined nature of this old structure reflects the reality of the changes in travel in the area. Now, we can easily drive hundreds of miles without stopping for gas or food or water. In the old days, there were service stations and way stations every few miles and the did a booming business in catering to travelers. Many of these old stopping places have disappeared, most are in ruins.The spidery structure of the New Navajo Bridge contrasts with the more massive structure of the old bridge.

Now, in my old age, I guess, I don't feel compelled to try and preserve everything I experience.My Great-grandmother had a similar organ in her home that I remember from when I was very young.

It is sometimes hard to get photos without power lines and roads in the picture. Contrary to my usual landscape photos, I included a few houses so you could get the idea of the rural/wilderness location.The area surrounding Sedona, Arizona is known as the Red Rock Country. It is the southern limit and edge of the Colorado Plateau and has some of the same types of sandstone formations you see in other parts of the Plateau. The main difference is the rainfall that gives more vegetation cover than other areas.Tuzigoot National Monument preserves a hilltop ruin dating from around 1000 A.D.

In our world of easily obtainable aircraft flights, we tend to forget that seeing the clouds from above used to be a rare phenomena.The South Rim of the Grand Canyon can become a dark and mysterious place when the clouds move in and the fog covers the ground. It is particularly challenging to capture images when the light is fading due to the heavy cloud cover and the wind and rain make everything about cameras more interesting.Elk are not particularly rare in Northern Arizona. In fact, in some places, they are quite common and especially in National Parks, are quite tame. Nonetheless, they are imposingly large animals and can be quite dangerous.

I am not sure I have seen this species of duck before.Green algae is likely descended from some of the earliest life forms on earth. Although not very appealing, it is a vital link in any ecosystem. In this instance, it is also quite beautiful.After spending the day foraging for food, this cormorant is drying its wings in the setting sun. Its avocet companion is still busy looking for tasty morsels in the mud.Herons and egrets spend a great deal of time just standing still and waiting for a possible meal to swim into view.

If you live in a foggy place you probably think I am crazy.If you have a fireplace or use wood for fuel, you have a woodpile. When we had no heating other than a fireplace, we had a huge woodpile, Our pile was not as neat or picturesque as this one, it was just a huge pile of scrap lumber from a sawmill. But I still and will always remember the woodpile. One day, I decided to count how many pieces of wood there were in the pile, so I sat down with a pencil and numbered each one. Childhood is great for doing things that make no sense.Every thing in life has a story and Hopi paintings are no exception.

But I am sure it does have a name, so I look online. Sure enough, it is called Wilson Arch and there is a nearby retirement community with that same name.This is some of most ancient rock art (as opposed to petroglyphs) that I have encountered. The paintings are supposed to date back thousands of years. You can imagine that rock art, where the figures are painted on the rock using vegetable based paints, do not last as long or as frequently as petroglyphs where the figures are carved or pounded into the rock's covering.This prickly pear has put forth a gallant effort to have a whole set of blossoms. You can see that the earlier blooming ones are quite a bit larger than the newly opened ones. Maybe the poor little plant got tired of making all those beautiful flowers?This is a fairly modern ruin. Although the original builders borrowed techniques from the ancient inhabitants of the land, they added a few modern touches. It is interesting to note that the modern improvements have almost disappeared while the ancient building practices could still be used today."},

Lichen is composed of a fungus and photosynthetic partner, either a green ala or cyanobacterium.

These are some of the earliest I found this year. Most of the saguaros bloom later in May or even June, but these had started in April. I was fortunate to stop one of the bees coming to the flowers in mid-flight especially since this cluster of flowers is about twenty feet or so away from my camera lens.The colors of the prickly pear flowers are so saturated but at the same time, some of the varieties are so thin that they are translucent. No photograph can really do justice to looking at the original flowers.

The flowers bloom for a just two or three days, closing every evening as the sun goes down and then re-opening in the morning sun. Once they are pollenated, they dry up and drop off the fruit. Some cactus bloom in profusion and others have a single flower. This cactus makes up for lack of quantity with quality; one single gorgeous white blossom. There is no rhyme or reason to where the prickly pear flowers bloom.

In reality, there are places where the sandstone is almost obscured by trees and plant growth. Sometimes we need to take a new perspective in life and realize that everything does not conform to our preconceived notions.Time rests heavily on the Canyon Country. You can see so much of it at once. Every layer in this rock represents hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of years of deposits and then additional millions of years of erosion. Time, indeed, rests heavily."},

These roads are mostly unpaved, dirt roads. This one may as well have been paved, it was a dirt road superhighway. But I mostly crop out the roads in my photos so I thought it was time to show where I was going and what I was driving on at the time.Sunsets are instantly attractive, but terribly difficult to capture. Film cameras seemed to do a better job of catching the color and spirit of a sunset than digital cameras do. This is one of the very few shots I have tried that show the real drama of a the clouds and colors of a sunset. Perhaps this is because this is taken looking east and not towards the setting sun.St. George, Utah sits in a spectacularly scenic area surrounded by natural wonders. One of the advantages of the city is that there are roads going up the surrounding hills that give you a panoramic view of the area. If I had gotten to know a little more about St. George earlier in my life, I might have been tempted to move there."},

You never know what you will find at the most unlikely places.These little guys would run in an out as the waves came in, just barely missing getting their feet wet in the foam. They are looking for an evening meal but seem to be in such a hurry that I am sure they are missing most of their opportunities. I relate to them, most of the time, I am too busy to eat. Tulips are definitely not a desert plant. They usually require a certain number of cold/freezing days in their winter dormancy to properly bloom. These aren't the type of tulips that have the iconic tulip shape but they are impressive none-the-less. For living in the desert, it seems like I am frequently taking photographs in adverse weather conditions. I wonder why that is? These were taken during a cold rainstorm with wind."},

Weather is neither bad nor good, despite our tendency to refer to it as such, it is just weather and any weather is good for photographs, but \"bad weather\" is better.Why do I love doors and windows? I guess there is always something inviting and at times, even mysterious about a door. Most doors lack character, so I make a point of photographing those that depart from the normal experience. Windows are an entirely different matter. They are like the eyes of the world.This mule deer does not appear particularly happy. The poor thing is standing in the cold and wet rain and just starting to get some food after a long winter.

Even though they are cactus, they can't survive the intense heat and sun of the Sonora Desert and so are planted in the shade. If you try to grow them in full sun, they will wither and die. This is good for the plant, but bad for photography.One of the fascinating things about flowers is the intricate and detailed inner workings of the flower. Every species has a slightly and sometimes dramatically different way of attracting pollinators. It is sometimes difficult to see beyond the color into the inner part of the flower. It is the same way with people. There are not words to describe these flowers and the photos do not do them justice. I have two images here so you can see the size of these blooms. All I can say is that they are much more impressive in person and overwhelming in color. This one small plant, among many, was going unnoticed by most of the visitors to the Desert Botanical Garden that day because it was tucked away in a corner. I can only say, as we have had on our walls for years, bloom where you are planted."},

Once pollinated, the flowers wilt and die and the fruit pods at the base of the flowers begin to grow with luscious prickly pear fruit.First of all this photograph is actually in color. Secondly, it is almost impossible to duplicate the conditions that allowed this photo to be taken and last, it highlights the incredible forms of the cactus.

The rain and/or snow is a challenge to keep the camera lenses from fogging or getting rain splattered. But the photographs are worth the challenge of the elements. This is in Zion National Park in Utah during a heavy rain storm.The pattern caused by the erosion of this hillside was fascinating. The layers are deposited by rainfall in this dry region and then the erosion shows the thin layer deposited on the iron-red layers of eroded material underneath. I love the color. We came across this spectacular blooming cactus in a median on a busy road in the rain. I had to dodge cars and stand in the rain to take the photo. We had to dry off the camera after taking the picture after returning to the car. It was worth the effort."},

One of my most vivid memories from my youth, was driving out along the Bush Highway to Saguaro Lake and seeing a sea of yellow palo verde blossoms stretching out towards Four Peaks. I have never seen anything like that since and fires and development have not added to the possibility that I will see it again.I find that taking pictures depends heavily on chance and opportunity. So many of the landscape photos you see in publications such as Arizona Highways and others, depended on the photographer being the right place at the right time. The challenge is taking photos under a variety of lighting and weather conditions. Unless you have the means and time to sit around waiting for pictures to occur, you have to take what you get and make the most of it.Boojum trees are very unusual plants found in the Baja Peninsula of Mexico. They grow reasonably well in the Sonora Desert but are rare and usually confined to specialized plantings.

This was really taken in the Desert Botanical Garden and normally, all of these species of cactus and agave would not be in the same place at the same time.This little guy was sitting there waiting for me to take his picture. Usually, they are running around in the rocks and gravel on the desert floor and never hold still for more that a second or two. But this time, this quail decided he wanted his photo taken and he stood there from ten seconds, long enough for me to get him in focus and take the picture.Sometimes the cactus flowers are so unusual that I think they look like something created in Photoshop. But I can assure you that this little cactus produced that strangely colored blossom. Finding these cactus is a real treasure. They are extremely rare out in the wilds of the Colorado Plateau, but fortunately I captured this one at the Desert Botanical Garden.Hedgehog cactus are virtually invisible most of the year and then in the Spring, they come alive with large purple flowers.

It is a remarkable experience to hike through a dry and rocky desert and come upon such a display of color. It is helpful that the flowers bloom in the Spring before the desert heats up to the point where walking around is impractical and can be dangerous.I was struck by the almost perfect form of this wind-blown grass. The stems are so delicate and look almost like hair. I don't think I would have appreciated this type of plant and the beauty of it when I was younger. There is something about this image that appeals to a much older and experienced mind.It is hard to compare flowers, they are all so beautiful. But cactus flowers are unique in their form and color.

This window creates an optical illusion that the rock in the distance is floating in front of the window inside the structure. You have to stare at it for a minute to get the effect.Although this is a popular tourist stop, this structure suffers from benign neglect. There is not question that the house will fall some day, there are huge cracks in all the walls. But the the stone blocks of which it is made, are heavy and withstand the elements by shear weight.

You have to be aware of the time of the year and keep your eyes open to the subtile changes in the weather, otherwise you might miss Spring altogether. But when you figure out the right time, you get the benefit of the short-lived cactus performance.

I spent quite a bit of time clicking away at the flowers. I hope you enjoy them over the next few days and weeks.These rocks illustrate the process of erosion that creates the balanced rock. The rock on the left is on the ground. The one in the middle is on a base where the surrounding softer rocks and sand have been eroded. The one on the right is almost ready to start the process over again. Kind of makes you cautious about standing next to them, doesn't it?One of the remarkable things about the rocks on the Colorado Plateau, such as these visible from Navajo Bridge, is the fact that they are mostly horizontal. Most mountain building forces in the earth seem to bend and tip the rocks, but here they are almost perfectly flat and about 5000 to 6000 feet above sea level. Since most scientists believe these sandstone rocks were made from inland seas or sand dunes, it is interesting that they are so high yet still level."},

I am fascinated by the views people choose for themselves out the windows of their homes, especially very old homes. Most of the time, when they could choose almost anywhere to live, people choose to live where it is convenient and only the very rich or the very particular worry about the view. For a change, I decided to show a photo looking into an old rock house. This is not an Indian ruin.The Vermillion Cliffs are made up of hard and soft layers of rock. When the softer layers erode, they leave the harder rocks to fall down the cliff.

It was probably better than standing out in the wind and snow.Perspective in the Colorado Plateau Country is really strange. It looks like I am standing a few feet above the river, not more than 467 feet above the river. I noticed how the steel girders of the newer Navajo Bridge are like a window and I am always taking pictures of windows.You will definitely need to click on this photo and perhaps zoom in. This shows Highway 89 as it goes up the steep hill where the landslide occurred. The slide is visible but hard to see.

You would think that the slightest breeze would blow them over, but they are relatively common in the rocks of the Southwestern United States.People associate cactus with dry and hot climates, so it is unusual to see one snowbound. Actually, cactus grow all the way north to Canada and are also found high in the mountains. This one is growing at about 7000 feet above sea level. I can relate to this cactus, it was a cold and windy day.It may not seem to be an opportune time to visit the sites in Arizona, but if you don't mind a little wind and cold, Winter is a lovely time to have the entire place to yourself.

But it is interesting how really rare this type of sandstone formations really are. Don't think of just Arizona and Utah, but think of the entire world.Agathla Peak is a landmark in Northern Arizona. This eroded volcanic core is visible for many miles in all directions. It is located right off Highway 191 about seven miles from Kayenta.

I guess my photo mirrors my feelings about the place.The whole Monument Valley is an icon because of motion pictures and its association with the West. It is claimed mostly by Arizona but the monuments are mostly in Utah. It is pretty well populated by people and not nearly as wild and wooly as is depicted. You have to maneuver to take photos unless you want houses and other buildings in the photos. It is sort of hard to see the Mexican Hat rock in this photo, but that is consistent with seeing it in real life.

There is no mossy covering to conceal the bones of the mountains. They are stark in their form and beauty. I could take a thousand or ten thousand photos and never tire of the colors and the form.I have always heard these trees referred to as \"cedar trees.\" It was only as I became more aware of plants in general that I learned that they are really juniper trees. They are examples of persistence and survivorship and are found growing in some of the most unlikely places. This one is struggling for existence in the sands of Southern Utah.If you live where there are seasons, you likely watch for the first crocuses of Spring. These are usually the first flowers you see on a cold, stormy Spring day when you aren't sure that Winter is really on the way out.

I also noticed the incredible markings on the underside of the boulder, testifying as to the antiquity of the fall.I have often noted that I see faces and figures in patterns all around me. I understand that it is a natural phenomena, but interesting nonetheless. The petroglyphs were near this huge rock and I wonder if the ancients who made the rock art and petroglyphs saw the face in the rock like I did.These petroglyphs are aptly named the TV sheep. I am not at all sure why these sheep have square bodies, but it is one of the wonders of the Southwest that there are such things to find.

It was too early in the year to think about driving up into the mountains, but we may have the opportunity some day to do that again. This photo was taken from Dead Horse Point, looking east towards the mountains.If you look closely at the center of the three figures, you will see why this particular rock art is called \"Intestine Man.\" The location is not marked on a highway, consistent with the idea that too many people will destroy these priceless treasures of ancient rock art. In contrast to petroglyphs which are made by chipping away at the rock coatings, these are painted on the rock using a variety of natural substances.

I am not sure I see a face in this wood, but I do see a space monster.This is a photo of the creeping devil cactus, the long one in front of the other cactus. This particular cactus was the very first one planted at the Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix. It grows along the ground and the older parts of the cactus die off as the plant grows.

{"title": "Aloe to You", "date": "Monday, March 18, 2013", "text": "Since I am usually walking around taking photographs, my images seem to follow a pattern if they are viewed sequentially. In my posts, I try to vary the themes by selecting photos from different trips, but sometimes I select similar photos to follow some theme or another. This was a particularly striking example of an aloe plant in full bloom. The Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona has one of the largest, if not the largest, collections of aloe varieties in the world.The contrast in the color of the plant and the flower is amazing. This is an aloe and the flowers bloom at various times throughout the year, but this plant has a particularly vibrant flower stalk.This cactus sundial accurately tells time. It is located in the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona and has recently been replanted with a new selection of cactus. I like sundials because they remind me that time is a natural phenomena and has a stately, regular procession every day."},
{"title": "A Small Fortune", "date": "Sunday, March 17, 2013", "text": "The idea of a small fortune seems contradictory; by definition a fortune should be large. But here is proof of the possibility. A flower that is worth a fortune in a small package. How would you ever know that a 2 inch cactus could produce such an effusion of color.It makes you wonder why cactus grow in impenetrable clumps? What is the reason for such huge masses of spines? My guess is that they derive some advantage in extra protection from the accumulation of spines, giving them an edge in survival. But perhaps it is just a fluke and like large cities, a reaction to a whole multitude of forces, both seen and unseen. There is no mistaking the identity of this iconic type of dome. It is set up to house a telescope. This one happens to be a short distance from my home in Mesa, not an ideal location for viewing the stars, but adequate. This is at the Gilbert Riparian Preserve, next to the branch Maricopa County Library."},
{"title": "Waiting on a perch", "date": "Saturday, March 16, 2013", "text": "Birds don't normally sit around and wait for you to take their picture. You have to be both patient and quick to get anything at all. I think this little fellow was just standing there posing for me and waiting to have his picture taken.I can't seem to get over the fact that ducks float. Not only do they float, but they float upright and almost completely out of the water. I don't float.Not all small brown birds are sparrows, but sparrows get the rap anyway. I enjoy watching birds and sparrows fall into that category. I think some people who watch birds are really looking for something unusual, but I look for anything that flies and eats them also."},
{"title": "Seagull on a post", "date": "Thursday, March 14, 2013", "text": "Some photos are iconic. This is one of them. There is nothing so typical of the ocean than a seagull sitting on a post sticking out of the water. But I like the photo anyway.Since this is the afternoon sun, this must be the Atlantic Ocean. Can you recognize me?It is sad to see such beautiful creatures stranded after a high tide. I love to watch jellyfish swim through the ocean but I am always very aware of the pain that can be caused by touching one of the filaments they use to catch their food. They are sort-of like cactus of the oceans, pretty but don't touch."},

It is an imposing and beautiful structure and will be even more so when the grounds are completely landscaped. We have enjoyed watching the Temple be built over the past few months and look forward to the Open House and Dedication either later this year or next year."},
{"title": "Read the Sign. Please!!!", "date": "Wednesday, March 13, 2013", "text": "I have absolutely no theories about this unique sign. I don't want to imagine the circumstances that went into the need for its posting. I think this is one of the imponderables of modern society and should be left for quiet contemplation. Leave well enough alone, is what I always say. Just don't go there. Oh, the sign is hard to read so you will have to click on the photo to enlarge it. If you recognize this sign you will realize my wife took this photograph.From time to time, I hear stories with the theme of traveling the world over looking for happiness and then returning to realize you had it at home all along. The same thing could be said for beauty. I have seen pictures of some amazingly beautiful places and I have often wondered what it would be like to travel the world, but when I think about it, people come from all over the world to see my \"backyard\" so to speak, so I have content to see my own part of the beautiful world and not have to travel so far.This was a really spooky experience. How many times do you meet a ghost chipmunk? Fortunately, he had no feet so he couldn't move too fast and we outran him easily."},
{"title": "Morning Fog", "date": "Tuesday, March 12, 2013", "text": "The scale of the Grand Canyon is so large, you can't really get a proper perspective without something like these clouds to give you and idea how far down into the earth it really goes. This view changed while I stood on the Rim taking pictures. Every few minutes the light changed and the colors changed.Sometimes the Canyon walls play hide-and-seek with the clouds. When the cloud windows open, you can see details that are usually lost in the vistas of the huge Canyon. This is one reason to go to the Grand Canyon when the weather is poor and it is cold and snowing.I love the vast distances in the views from the Rim of the Grand Canyon in contrast to most of the views in the Eastern part of the United States. You have to get on a really high building or go out along the ocean coast to see vast distances. There are a few mountains in the East with spectacular views, but nothing like the Canyon rim."},

{"title": "Ancient Symbolism ", "date": "Monday, March 11, 2013", "text": "Modern anthropologists and cultural historians tend to put a religious and symbolic spin on every ancient mark on stone or wall. I have always wondered why this is the case? It is entirely possible that some of the designs had no deep meaning but were purely decorative. Both of these symbols date back into antiquity and can be found as petroglyphs on rocks throughout the Southwest.Instead of the Man in the Moon, some cultures around the world and especially in the American Southwest, see a rabbit in the moon. This is a charming original Hopi drawing of the Rabbit in the Moon. The story of the rabbit is variously told and it is difficult to determine an \"authentic\" story from those elaborated by more modern elements. I spent years translating Shoshone stories into English."},
{"title": "A Sandstone Alcove", "date": "Sunday, March 10, 2013", "text": "Some of the most interesting features of the sandstone rocks in Arizona and Utah are these alcoves created by the action of water seeping through cracks in the rocks. It is as if the water is painting an abstract picture on the walls of rock. They are very special places.This is the Pelican Island of its namesake Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge. Here is a list of the types of birds that nest on this tiny island:Brown pelicanWood storkGreat egretSnowy egretReddish egretCattle egretGreat blue heronLittle blue heronTricolored heronGreen-backed heronBlack-crowned night heronDouble-crested cormorant (resident)AnhingaWhite ibisAmerican oystercatcherCommon moorhenQuoting from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service website: \"The Pelican Island rookery provides critical nesting habitat for the endangered wood stork. Other refuge areas provide critical habitat for several other threatened and endangered species, including manatees, loggerhead and green sea turtles and southeastern beach mice.\"This is approximately what some of the State of Florida looked like at and before the time of the arrival of the Europeans. This is in the Pelican Island National Wildlife Refuge and they have made an effort to eliminate all imported plants to restore the original vegetation. You have to ignore the horizon where it shows some development. There aren't really any huge tracts of natural vegetation left in Central and Northern Florida."},
{"title": "A Rock Solid Meal", "date": "Saturday, March 9, 2013", "text": "This plate of food is actually solid rocks. It is a novelty in the mining districts of the world to make up plates of rocks that look like common food items. This is one of the better ones I have seen. They always used to have a display of rock food at the Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum while it was located at the State Fair Grounds in Phoenix. This is actually something to be taken seriously because Jerome, Arizona was built on the side of a steep hill and anything thrown out could be a hazard to people down below. This is however symptomatic of the type of sign common in Arizona."},
{"title": "Jerome, Arizona", "date": "Saturday, March 9, 2013", "text": "The old almost-ghost town of Jerome, Arizona sits on the side of Mingus Mountain facing the Verde Valley. It is a picturesque town with a thriving tourist business. With an economy entirely based on mining, it has gone through a boom-and-bust cycle more than once and survived. Its population in 2010 was 444. The road up to the town is very steep but has some spectacular views or a lot of cliffs depending on your viewpoint."},
{"title": "Tuzigoot", "date": "Friday, March 8, 2013", "text": "If you just had time to visit one ancient pueblo in Arizona, I would suggest Tuzigoot. It has a striking location atop a hill in the Verde Valley and has one of the best small museums in the Southwest. This is view of the ruin looking up to the highest point. Unfortunately, most of the construction you see today, has be reconstructed from the original, but it does give a good idea of what the village looked like originally.This is a type of ancient Pueblo/Hopi pottery known as Jeddito Black-on-Yellow. It dates back to, at least, 1350 A.D. and is associated with the Pueblo IV to Historic periods. The Black paint is composed of iron-manganese with iron-oxide pigments. The skill in executing this type of pottery was extremely high. This type of design seems to resonate with my spirit, maybe because it is to familiar to me.I am always amazed to find an ancient ruin still standing. This one dates back hundreds, perhaps almost a thousand, years and yet it is still standing. I can't imagine any of our modern homes lasting that long in our disposable society. Maybe we shouldn't be calling these ancient people primitive? Maybe they knew something that we have lost?"},
{"title": "Hermit's Rest", "date": "Thursday, March 7, 2013", "text": "Hermit's Rest is a building on the west end of the Hermit Road on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. It is presently the end of the shuttlebus route from the Grand Canyon Village. There is a trail that descends into the Canyon from this point. The building was designed by Mary Jane Coulter and is on the National Register of Historic Places and is also a National Historic Landmark. The building was built for the Fred Harvey Company in 1914. The Fred Harvey Company operated restaurants and hotels in the National Parks as a concessionaire in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The building is presently a tourist information site and store. The canyons within the Grand Canyon are at such a large scale, they can have their own weather systems. The canyon in the distance has a river of clouds when the rest of the canyon is clear. This gives the viewer some idea of the scale of the Canyon. It is truly immense.The entire Grand Canyon experience does not consist of standing on the Rim and looking down into the Canyon, but also includes being able to see the layers of sandstone and the visual layers of the cliffs in the distance. The view is very three dimensional. But to see the contrast between the buttes and cliffs, you have to have some sort of visual reference. In this case that reference is provided by the clouds."},
{"title": "Western Saddle", "date": "Wednesday, March 6, 2013", "text": "There are a number of different styles of saddles. This is type of western saddle that I grew up using to ride horses. For a long time, I thought all saddles looked like this one, but now I am acquainted with other types. For a city boy, I spent a considerable amount of time riding horses, sometimes for long periods of time. Every single part of this saddle has its own use and name.I have always been fascinated with model trains. All of my life, I have wanted my own model train set, but for many different reasons, never got around to having more than a train, a few cars and some random pieces of track. I admire those who make elaborate model train layouts such as this one in Cottonwood's Clemenceau Heritage Museum.Many of us old folks attended school in a traditional classroom setting, such as this typical one in Cottonwood's Clemenceau Heritage Museum, in Cottonwood, Arizona. Despite the obvious technological limitations, we seemed to learn how to read, write, obey rules and love our teachers and our country just fine, thank you."},
{"title": "Erosion", "date": "Tuesday, March 5, 2013", "text": "You have to look closely at this photograph to see the patterns created in miniature by the erosion of the sand in this hillside. If you do, you will see that the forms are exactly those of the Southwest, only on a small scale. The same forces that created the huge sandstone monuments of the area are mimicked at this scale. It is doubtful that Frank Lloyd Wright was personally familiar with ancient Indian ruins when he coined the term \"organic architecture\" but it is certain that what the ancients built was a more closely aligned with that concept than the buildings constructed in the 1900s.Indian ruins in Arizona and the Southwest are just that, ruins. Many of the sites were heavily vandalized in the years before people became aware of the need for historical preservation. When you visit a site, you are really seeing what was left behind by the hordes of early pot hunters and amateur archeologists. It is sometimes incredible what got preserved and not destroyed."},
{"title": "Mountain Fastness", "date": "Monday, March 4, 2013", "text": "This view suggests that it would be extremely difficult to approach the top of this mountain and it would be a correct deduction. But in almost every case, the mountain that appears unapproachable is really quite easy to climb. They sometimes put up a good defense, but ultimately, time and erosion have created a pathway to the top."},
{"title": "Sea Foam", "date": "Monday, March 4, 2013", "text": "I imagine that there is some scientific explanation for sea foam. It is probably caused by the action of the waves and the salt and mineral content of the water, but rather than spend some time looking up the answer, I prefer to leave it as one of the small unknown mysteries of my life. So each time I go to the beach I can wonder about it, instead of knowing the answer and dismissing it from my mind. Sometimes not knowing is helpful to my wellbeing.The idea of footsteps in sand is regularly used as a metaphor for the transient nature of life itself. I guess I am going to join the crowd on this one. When I see a beach without any footprints, it feels like I am the first person to ever walk there. But that is an illusion, just as the transient nature of footprints is really an illusion. Life itself will not end with the incoming tide. Change is inevitable, but life, even life after death, persists."},
{"title": "A Pit House Excavation", "date": "Sunday, March 3, 2013", "text": "The Montezuma's Castle National Monument has several ruins besides the main castle. The ruins date from several thousand years ago until quite recent. This is a Pit House excavation. I took a picture of the explanation so you could see what it looked like when people were living there. There are thousands of these remnant houses in the desert Southwest. Most are still unexcavated.We think of people living in a cave as \"primitive\" when it was just smart. You had most of your construction ready made by the walls of the cave and the temperature was relatively warm in the Winter and cooler in the Summer without paying utility bills. These cave dwellers had a dependable supply of water in the Montezuma's Well and fields for growing crops and all the native plants and animals for food. Sounds like a pretty good deal to me.It would seem to be unusual to put so much emphasis on a small pond, but when you live in the desert a dependable water supply is vital to survival. The ancient inhabitants, of what is now Arizona, appreciated the dependability of the sinkhole we call Montezuma's Well. The interior of the sinkhole has several very old Indian ruins. In addition, the location is a beautiful place. In the Winter, without leaves on the plants and trees, you can see more of the walls of the sinkhole."},
{"title": "On the Beach", "date": "Saturday, March 2, 2013", "text": "Yes, my title to this post does intentionally refer to the popular science fiction book by Neville Shute and subsequent movie of the same name. There is something interesting about this beach shot that you may not notice at first, the edge of the vegetation is being built up artificially with sand. In other words, this is hardly a pristine ocean beach, it is a construct. It is still pretty and iconic.There is a mountain in Eastern Arizona called \"Escudilla.\" This was the first time outside of Arizona that I had seen any reference to that word. In Spanish the word \"escudo\" used as noun means shield. The diminutive form of \"escudo\" would be \"escudillo\" meaning a small shield. The word \"escuda\" is the third person singular of the word \"escudar\" or to shield. Escudillar is a verb meaning either to pour into a bowl or to lord or domineer. So did the bowl shaped mountain get its name from the Spanish word for bowl as is commonly believed? Or is it really a reference to a small shield with an English induced gender change? In English, unaccented final syllables go the schwa sound, such as \"uh.\""},
{"title": "The Thicket", "date": "Saturday, March 2, 2013", "text": "In the movies you always see the explorers using machetes or similar cutting tools to make their way through the jungle. Well, out here in the desert that seems a little excessive. But once you get a look at really thick vegetation, you can begin to understand why cutting your way through might be necessary."},
{"title": "Spanish Silver Coins", "date": "Friday, March 1, 2013", "text": "I have often enjoyed reading about searching for treasure. This is some real Spanish treasure, brought up from a ship wreck on the bottom of the ocean. No, its not mine, but I can always imagine finding such a trove in my reflective hours. I guess the lure of treasure has never gotten to me to the extent that I actually went out and looked, however.Standing on the Rim of the Grand Canyon is a unique opportunity to observe how the changes in light and shadow, especially from minute to minute, can affect what you see. I could have stood here and taken a picture every minute throughout the day and gotten a different view each time. I think we need to realize that this is how our lives are. Every minute is a unique new experience.Sometimes the images I see are extraordinarily subtle. This image of dried grass sticking up out of the snow is an example. Not all beautiful things are ostentatious and in-your-face. Some of life's most sublime experiences are highly transitory and can go by unnoticed unless you are looking for them."},
{"title": "Yucca in the Snow", "date": "Thursday, February 28, 2013", "text": "We usually associate succulents, such as the yucca, with warm climates, but they are quite common high in the mountains of Arizona where the temperatures are well below freezing and snow is not an infrequent visitor. I was captivated by the contrast of the spiky desert plant and the subtle texture of the snow.This is a roof structure in the Desert View Watchtower on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. It was constructed under the direction of the architect, Mary Colter, who copied similar structures in the roofs of the Kivas of the Pueblo Indians. The Kiva is a Pueblo Indian ceremonial structure that is usually round and partly underground. I like the design of the roof beams and the contrast in the texture of the wood.It is difficult to conceptualize the arrangement of these drawings since the building's structure is so unconventional. The drawings are hard to distinguish unless you click on the image and enlarge it. As I have said in past posts, these are authentic American Indian drawings done by famous artists. They are not copied reproductions. This photo is an interior view, looking upward, in the Desert Watchtower on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon in Arizona."},
{"title": "Hunting", "date": "Wednesday, February 27, 2013", "text": "I'm back to the drawings and paintings in the Desert Watchtower on the Rim of the Grand Canyon. These are not copies of drawings, but actual drawings made by the original Indian artists. Some of them, like this hunting scene, are likely overlooked by the casual visitor. They are rather hard to see as you can guess from the way the photo has picked up the image.The reason mangrove swamps are such a good protection for the beaches lies in this mass of roots. When the trees grow next to each other, there is a solid mass of these shoots that break up the action of the waves and keep the beach from eroding. We have similar plant structures in Arizona, but not as thick and obvious as these roots.These leaves are fascinating. They have distinct outlines in dark red. These outlines and the highlights from the reflections are remarkable. I did not recall ever having seen this type of plant before. It was growing within ten feet of a salt water bay on the Coast of Florida."},
{"title": "A Sun Dog", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2013", "text": "The faint rainbow effect vertically in the clouds is a Sun Dog. This is an atmospheric effect of the sun's angle on high, usually ice, clouds. They are really quite common, but I don't always have a camera ready when I see one. I am usually driving a car and don't take time to stop. You could go your whole life without seeing one unless someone points one out to you. They often appear in pairs on either side of a setting sun.I found this lovely statue outside of a public library. If you know me at all, you realize that this is likely where I would end up even on a casual visit. I like the colors and the form of this statue. But at the same time, I am concerned that the original turtle might not have survived all this paint.This is one of the many pictures I have taken of doors. This one also happens to be a window so it fits in both my door and window categories. I would contrast this with many of the more rustic photos I have taken of doors, including those in Indian ruims and old farm houses. This doorway is decidedly on the other end of the spectrum of door photos.Sometimes when I am walking through a building, I notice the patterns created by the architecture. This was a particularly striking pattern in an airport. I like the repetition of the motifs from side to side and the strong angles. Like many of my photos, it takes on the abstract."},
{"title": "A Majestic Palm", "date": "Monday, February 25, 2013", "text": "Palm trees are extremely common in the desert Southwest, but they are limited to three or four varieties. There seem to be dozens of different varieties in Florida where this lovely tree is growing. This tree is similar to our desert Washington Palms but close examination shows dramatic differences.The wind coming off the ocean is so strong and consistent that the plants grow markedly showing the direction of the wind. The plants right on the beach grow in an incline reflecting the prevailing wind patterns. I was struck by how obviously these grasses had adapted to the wind.On the Florida Barrier Islands, the inlets and bays are mostly all salt water. By definition they are estuaries where they originate in a river. This is a small inlet on the Barrier Island and it is debatable whether or not this a real estuary of merely an inlet in the bay. This particular inlet is lined with mangrove trees."},
{"title": "Facing the Ocean", "date": "Sunday, February 24, 2013", "text": "Notice the color change in the water as you look into the distance. The ocean is an interesting place for an old desert dweller. Contemplating all the water in one place gives rise to a lot of speculation about efficient distribution systems and how deserts are a good example of how they don't work for water. Because of the salt content, oceans are not quite so attractive as other water sources.Vines and other climbing plants use any post or tree to climb into the sunlight. This unusual specimen had brilliant red leaves. The palm tree is a variety unknown in Arizona which is logical since it is growing in Florida.Whatever your conception of Florida, this is probably not what you are thinking about. This is the Pelican Island Wildlife Preserve, the oldest Wildlife Preserve in the United States. This is very likely what the interior of the barrier islands looked like before they built all the fast food restaurants, resorts and condos. Although the palm trees look similar to ours in Arizona, up close they are quite different."},
{"title": "A Distant View", "date": "Saturday, February 23, 2013", "text": "Most of the photos of the Grand Canyon are from vantage points looking across the Canyon. But as you follow the South Rim in its twists and turns you find places that give you a perspective up or down the Canyon and therefore provide a much longer look into the Canyon. This is one of those places where you are looking down the river to the west. The clouds add to the dramatic appeal of the view."},
{"title": "Dwelling in the Rock", "date": "Friday, February 22, 2013", "text": "I guess these ancient dwellings could be considered the antithesis of modern tract housing. They blend into the landscape and use available rocks for part of the structure. The contrast with rows of stucco covered homes is dramatic. The color of these rocks is so uniform that the image appears to be in black and white but it is in color.This photo shows the Hance rapids of the Colorado River from one of the few places on the Rim where  the river is clearly visible. This placid looking photo give no idea of the roar of the river or speed of the water but it does show how the rapids originate. If you look closely, you will see that a side canyon comes into the main channel and the rapid is formed around the mouth of the rocks carried down the side canyon.In Arizona, the presence of snow is strictly a function of altitude. It is not unusual to have snow above 4000 feet above sea level, but it is uncommon in the lower deserts. At lower levels snow accumulations are usually extremely light and the snow melts almost immediately. I have seen it snow in Mesa a few times and have even seen it cover grass but melt immediately on any cement or asphalt surface. So, when I see snow in desert locations, it is always fascinating."},
{"title": "Ancient Sinaguan Pot", "date": "Thursday, February 21, 2013", "text": "This remarkable example of Sinaguan pottery is in the small museum at the Tuzigoot National Monument. Tuzigoot is one of those out-of-the-way places in Arizona that does not get the crowds associated with the more popular archeological sites.You could take a picture almost anywhere in Arizona and use it for a textbook on geomorphology. This is a classic example of erosional forms in the Grand Canyon. This image also shows the strata of the sandstone rocks of the Colorado Plateau, notable for their horizontal configuration. It is also a strikingly beautiful photograph.As the light changes at the Grand Canyon, the colors of the rocks and sky change dramatically. You can stand there and watch the colors change as the clouds move and the sun is hidden or shines. In the heat of the summer, the Canyon's colors are bight but flat. As the seasons change so does the light and the colors become more vibrant and the Canyon takes on depth and form."},
{"title": "Topped with Clouds", "date": "Tuesday, February 19, 2013", "text": "Because of the cloud bank, you can see how far the buttes are separated from the Canyon Rim. Normally, they all blend together and look like the same cliff systems. The vast nature of the Grand Canyon usually does not lend itself to vignettes of a portion of the Canyon. Most of the shots you see are wide angle and show a lot of territory. This is a more intimate view of the Canyon."},
{"title": "A Window on the Rim", "date": "Tuesday, February 19, 2013", "text": "I took this shot looking out of the window in the Bright Angel Lodge restaurant at the Grand Canyon. The day was overcast and very cold and raining, but I like to take pictures of windows because of the framing effect. It is interesting what people can really see out their windows, especially in really old buildings.We found this rather prickly specimen of cactus growing on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. The temperature was close to or below freezing. I think people associate cactus with warm and sunny climates, but the real issue is rain fall. They are arid or semi-arid plants for the most part. But to add to the confusion, they also grow in the jungle where it rains profusely."},
{"title": "Stabilizing the Beach ", "date": "Monday, February 18, 2013", "text": "This would seem to be the antithesis of an attractive beach; no waves or stretches of sand. But the mangrove roots that form huge clumps protect the barrier islands from erosion from the wave action. In some places these tangles of roots and shoots extend for miles. They have a tremendous impact on the wildlife and the fish and mammals in the area. Destruction of this habitat is a great concern.There were several seagulls riding and strong wind coming off of the ocean and closely watching some people who were eating lunch on the beach. I tried to get shots of the gulls as they swooped down to take scraps of food, but the wind was blowing so hard it was difficult to get the pictures. This is the one shot of the fast moving birds that came out of that hand-held photo series.Rock climbers are attracted by challenging cliffs. In the Grand Canyon, there are endless and totally inaccessible opportunities to climb. Usually however, those hiking in the Grand Canyon have a big enough challenge just following the trails and trying to avoid the endless cliffs. These isolated buttes are everywhere in the Canyon and many have likely never been climbed."},
{"title": "View of the Inner Gorge of the Grand Canyon", "date": "Sunday, February 17, 2013", "text": "Peering down into the Grand Canyon, you can barely see the Colorado River cutting its way through the Inner Gorge made of what is called the Vishnu Basement Rocks or Granite Gorge, named by the explorer John Wesley Powell. These rocks date from the Precambrian and early Proterozoic ages of the Earth's history. They are made up of very old granite and pegmatite metamorphic rocks; primarily Vishnu schist, Brahma schist, Rama schist, Orthoamphibole-bearing gneiss and Elves Chasm pluton or quartz diorite.This dead branch is dangling into the salt water of the Atlantic Ocean just in the tidal zone. It is entirely covered with living organisms. The algae and the barnacles are the most evident, but if you were to examine it closely, you would see a whole world of animals and plants living on this one branch."},
{"title": "Mangrove Roots", "date": "Sunday, February 17, 2013", "text": "You can see from this photo why the mangrove swamps help to prevent erosion of the sea shore, especially during hurricanes and other lesser storms. Every one of those root tops can develop into a tree. If you look closely, you will see that some of them have already sprouted leaves. Imagine this mass of roots spreading unbroken along the shore. Now image what happens to the shore when the mangrove trees are removed for development."},
{"title": "Floating in the Clouds", "date": "Saturday, February 16, 2013", "text": "There is just a hint of the depth of the Canyon at the bottom of this photograph. But it does show the contrast between the cliffs and the clouds and gives a sense of depth.

{"title": "Through the clouds darkly", "date": "Friday, February 15, 2013", "text": "If you stand on the Rim of the Grand Canyon during a storm, the light and view changes constantly. One minute the Canyon will be visible and the next, the clouds will move in and the Canyon will vanish from view. Watching the drama of the weather is compounded by the weather itself; it is cold and windy and wet.This monster is looking for vengeance. There is a drama going on in this drawing that is evident from the action of the figure trying to hide or get away. This is a painting in the Desert View Watchtower on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.These are obviously mudheads, but so stylized and reduced to their essential features as to be almost a cartoon. Nonetheless, these are authentic Hopi drawings, not copies or reproductions. If you don't know what a mudhead is, click here.These mangrove roots and the driftwood make up an interesting contrast in color and form. This image intimidates with its complexity.

In Arizona, we usually strip all of the cut branches off of the trunk. On some palm species, this happens naturally, so you see the classic smooth palm tree trunk. But here the stubs of the branches have been left to give a wonderful pattern."},
{"title": "A Palm Beach", "date": "Thursday, February 14, 2013", "text": "I could not resist this classically iconic image of a sandy beach with palm trees. This is especially true because of the exotic nature of the image for someone who lives in the dry desert Southwest. The wind was blowing but not enough to overly ripple the water and it was a brilliantly sunny day in Florida when this photo was taken.In photographs of the Grand Canyon, there is usually no perspective. It is impossible to tell how large the Canyon really is. When there are clouds and mist, the Canyon takes on its real size. You can stand on the Rim and look down at clouds and begin to imagine the vast distances involved in the cliffs and canyons. This photo may give you some idea of size of the Canyon. You may need to click on the photo to see the detail."},

This old tree stump would likely be ignored by most, but it attracted me because of the juxtaposition between the ocean water, the land and the plants that survive or don't survive in the costal environment. Mangroves are various types of trees up to medium height and shrubs that grow in saline coastal sediment habitats in the tropics andsubtropics – mainly between latitudes 25° N and 25° S. See Wikipedia: Mangrove. I am fascinated by these trees because they are so foreign to my desert upbringing. This tree is on Cape Canaveral Island off the Coast of Florida.Another exceptional view of the Grand Canyon in the middle of a huge storm. The sky cleared briefly and showed the layers of clouds spilling down into the Canyon. These are the rare sights that you can only capture if you want to brave below freezing temperatures and sometimes high winds."},

There are several Indian ruins in the walls of the sinkhole. It is a perennially flowing spring used by the early inhabitants for irrigation and as a source of water. The white object floating in the lake is a turtle trap to catch non-native turtles that were introduced by careless people over the years.The Florida coast is protected from the ravages of the ocean by a series of barrier islands. Unfortunately, for those of us driving along the coast, there are sand dunes covered with plants between the road and the ocean, so mostly while driving, in between the houses and the high rise condos, this is about all you see of the ocean. But it is interesting. Who says there are no straight lines in nature?"},

There is one thing about pictures of the ruin. They make the building look much larger and more impressive than it is in person standing there on the ground.Rain on the snow in the mountains caused an early melt that translated into a flood down the creeks and rivers in central Arizona. We missed the highest water but normally this is a small clear stream. This might happen once or twice a year or even skip a few years in drought. We always like to see running water in the desert.You have to look closely to see the structure since it blends in with the cliff. I don't think the ancient inhabitants of Arizona lived in these small constructs, they were more likely used for storage or similar uses. They are presently almost completely inaccessible, but appear on cliffs all over the state."},

There really isn't a door here but it is the essentially the same thing in an ancient Sinaguan ruin on a cliff along the Wet Beaver Creek in the Verde Valley of Arizona. I could be any of thousands of other small cliff dwellings or storage rooms left by the ancient inhabitants of Arizona. I guess you might say, they were some of the earliest uses of organic architecture.Along the Wet Beaver Creek of the Verde Valley, there are lovely limestone cliffs. These are perfect for colonies of cliff swallows to build their rounded mud constructed swallow nests. I was fortunate to have my long lens to take this photo when the nests were way up on the cliff."},

As I was photographing this, a small boy who was visiting the site with his mother asked what this was. She promptly told him it was a basin for water. I chimed in and explained that it was used for grinding corn. It just happened to be filled with water from a recent rain storm. I always wonder what all the tourists think when they visit Indian ruins."},

You can tell by the feathers on the wings.If you look at this picture for a while, you might be able to figure out what it is and the direction you are looking. It is the top floor of the Desert View Watchtower, looking up from the floor below.

We were surprised to find out these large pots were used as lighting fixtures. I wouldn't recommend this today given the value of this pottery. An authentic large pot such as this one would sell for thousands of dollars today.They say that no two snowflakes are the same. Well, the same thing can be said about the rocks of the Colorado Plateau. The colors and forms are endless and never repeat themselves. The terrain is challenging to the casual visitor but it is home to me.One of the things that draws attention to the rock forms caused by erosion of sandstone are the free standing monuments. The reason is simple. They are unusual and uncommon. The variety and forms of the rocks mean you can take a photograph and turn slightly and get an entirely different view; each one as interesting and outstanding as the one before."},

The drawings and paintings are authentic and were produced by Native American artists employed in the construction and decoration of this historical landmark.I suppose if you live by the sea shore, fog is pretty much a common occurrence. But here in the desert Southwest, fog is really unusual. I am fascinated how the colors and perspective changes when there is a heavy fog. I still remember walking to school in the fog because it was so unusual. This is the Desert View Watchtower, which doesn't have much more than a view of the fog on this day.Where the Colorado Plateau drops off into the deserts of Arizona, we usually call that the \"Rim.\" This is in central Arizona where the sandstone of the Plateau are visible. The Rim in this area is usually referred to by the name of a town and a creek: the Sedona or Oak Creek area. But, it is really a huge expanse of sandstone extending almost all the way across Arizona and into Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. The area around is Sedona is particularly accessible and well known."},

These same designs and figures can be found on ancient pottery that can be seen in museums around the world. The same motifs are used today by Hopi potters and painters. This is another of the paintings made by Fred Kabotie in the Desert View Watchtower on the Rim of the Grand Canyon.When you think of the wide open spaces of Arizona, you might tend to forget that there are a lot of people and some sizable cities scattered across the state. This idyllic picture of the red rocks near Oak Creek Canyon shows considerable haze. Guess what? Behind those trees are thousands of people in the town of Sedona. All driving their cars at breakneck speed on highways. Hence, the haze.Yes, there is water in Arizona. This is the Bubbling Ponds Fish Hatchery, a series of large pools along the Oak Creek below Oak Creek Canyon. I visit places like this in my wandering around Arizona. Anyplace that looks interesting either from its name or location is a candidate for a visit. It is hard to see in the photo but the ponds are covered by very wild birds. As we walked around the ponds, the birds kept flying or moving away. Very unlike domesticated ducks in city."},

It is also the story of the first man to navigate the Colorado River.The Desert View Tower at the Grand Canyon was constructed during a different time in our history, with different sensibilities. Here we can see a large rock, covered with petroglyphs, incorporated into the construction. This would be highly illegal today and would not be allowed by the Park Service or any other government agency. But that was another day and another time. Notice the change in the rocks to make a frame for the petroglyphs."},
{"title": "Between Storms at the Grand Canyon", "date": "Saturday, February 2, 2013", "text": "You probably will want to click on this image to see it at a larger size. We were at the Grand Canyon on a marvelous day for photography. There was part of one day where the sky cleared by the storm was still moving up the Canyon. We scrambled around to get to the view sites before the storm moved on and the next one moved in. This is part of the results of our scramble.I found this camera in a museum in Cottonwood, Arizona. It is unidentified. Investigation on the Internet indicates it is likely a variation of the Kodak Model D Camera or it could be a Kodak Bulls-eye No. 2 Box Camera. It is likely a Kodak No. 2 Bulls-Eye Model D. It seems to be missing the strap on the top. Any ideas?We frequently see tourists at the Grand Canyon nonchalantly taking pictures just a few feet from a 1000 foot drop off. They have no appreciation for the size or height of the cliffs. They treat the Canyon as if it were a painted backdrop. That appreciation comes from hiking down into the Canyon and hiking in other canyons in the Colorado Plateau. But when conditions are right, you can start to get some perspective of the distances in the Canyon. Hopi pottery is extraordinary. Recently, we saw a pot on sale for over $4000 and it is entirely worth the price and probably undervalued. There are, of course, lots of \"Indian Pottery\" on the market for low prices, but the genuine Hopi pots are never inexpensive. We view these as masterpieces of great artistic worth."},

{"title": "Sycamore Giant in Winter", "date": "Friday, February 1, 2013", "text": "Along the waterways of Arizona there used to be these massive trees. In the case of the more northern waterways, they were sycamores, down in the lower deserts, they were cottonwoods. Sometimes in between they grow in the same areas. These trees still exists in protected areas and grow to over 200 feet tall with trunks 25 feet or more in diameter. They are amazing trees.Some of the Arizona place names don't seem to make much sense. Wet Beaver Creek is one of those names. It might help to know that there is also a Dry Beaver Creek, but maybe not. I don't think this has anything to do with either wet or dry beavers, it has to do with the creeks. But if Dry Beaver Creek is dry then how can it have beavers? So why is there a Wet Beaver Creek? Because it has water in it all year round. I think you can see my point."},

There is a lot of speculation about where the people went after the  disappeared from the Verde Valley. I have been visiting these ruins the past week and will have a lot more posts on ruins in the future.This is really a sycamore, but I have always called them puzzle trees from the way you can peel off pieces of bark like a puzzle. They are some of Arizona's largest trees and I can remember camping under them as a Scout.It is not a castle and it has nothing to do with Montezuma, but it is a cliff dwelling dated to between 1100 and 1400 A.D. It is one of the best known cliff dwellings in the United States and has been a National Monument for many years."},

Hurray for ravens.Whenever I see a ruin or an old building it reminds me of the passage of time and how the past moves off into the mists. This day of misty weather highlighted the sense of time's passing with this ruin-looking wall on the edge of the Grand Canyon.Sometimes we see things as they are but most of the time we see things as we expect them to be. It takes a great deal of effort to break out of the habit of seeing things we expect and really see the world as it is. Images of the Grand Canyon and its surroundings have become so stylized that they are iconic. But there are a lot of things at the Grand Canyon, although iconic, are not as they seem judged from the promotional materials. I love the Canyon for the way it changes my perspective."},
{"title": "Mysterious Stairway", "date": "Monday, January 28, 2013", "text": "This stairway leads to the interior of one of the most interesting structures in the Southwest, the Desert View Watchtower on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. This building was designed by Mary Colter who was working, at the time, for Fred Harvey. This is a gorgeous building with many historical authentic Indian design features and paintings. It is worth the trip to the Canyon just to see this building, but of course, there is the Grand Canyon also.The Desert View Watchtower is an architectural masterpiece located right on the edge of the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. The Tower is modeled after ancient ancestral Puebloans watchtowers found in the Four Corners region and was designed by Architect Mary Colter. It is a strikingly beautiful structure and this photo, in the fog, lends it an aura of mystery.In exposed areas such as the Rim of the Grand Canyon, the trees have a tendency to grow away from the direction of the prevailing winds. In this case on the South Rim, this tree is leaning decidedly to the East. You can't see the canyon because of the fog but without the fog you would never notice the tree."},

On my recent trip to northern Arizona, I spent a lot of time trying to take pictures under an umbrella. But when the rain is blowing sideways it doesn't work too well. Have you ever wondered why there are so few photos of storms?The promoters of Arizona tourism would like everyone to believe that Arizona is the land of perpetual sunshine and good weather. Unfortunately this view is highly inaccurate. Winter in Arizona's high country can be treacherous with temperatures well below zero. This is the Rim of the Grand Canyon on a day when the Canyon was taking a vacation from the ordinary tourist. I went to the Canyon specifically because the weather was bad.Arizona has extensive mountain ranges that hardly ever get mentioned in the publicity about the state. The Bradshaw Mountains run roughly north and south between the Agua Fria watershed on the east and the Hassayampa watershed on the west. Historically, they have been one of the most highly mineralized areas of Arizona and the location of many gold mines. They are highly visible traveling north from Phoenix to Flagstaff but mostly inaccessible by road."},

It is still floating.I found this rock floating over the Grand Canyon. Really. You can see the dark smaller rock floating over the shelf behind the fat person holding a plant. The reason this hasn't been discovered previously is because there was a fog bank behind the rocks. When the air is clear you get a perspective and the rock is firmly attached to the ground."},
{"title": "Arizona Sunrise", "date": "Thursday, January 24, 2013", "text": "There are millions of photographs of sunsets but not that many of the sunrise. I guess the reason is pretty obvious, it is harder to get out of bed in the early morning before the sun comes up and get ready to take pictures that might not happen.

{"title": "Snowstorm Perspective", "date": "Thursday, January 24, 2013", "text": "In most lighting conditions at the Grand Canyon, the distant cliffs look like paper cutouts. But when there is weather with clouds and rain or snow, the whole aspect of the Grand Canyon changes and becomes a world of shadows and light. You seldom see this side of the Canyon when you look at the normal touristy promotional shots of the Canyon, they don't want you to know that it is 17 degrees outside with snow.Most of the images you see of the Grand Canyon are iconic in their uniformity. They are taken either when lighting conditions are optimal or when there is some dramatic lighting event. Most of your experiences when you visit the Canyon are entirely different. It is the subtle change of light that can change from minute to minute that is impressive. The colors, rather than being dramatic, are muted and soft. The best time to see the Canyon is when you are able to do so.When you visit the Grand Canyon, the contrast is between the approach which is through relatively flat land and the sudden edge or rim of the Canyon with it breathtaking vistas. But the Canyon is so large that first visitors do not appreciate the scale of what they are looking at. You see people dancing on the edge of thousand foot cliffs who have probably never stood next to a cliff before in their life. It is only after you hike to the bottom of the Canyon that you begin to appreciate the scale of what you see."},

Of course, this isn't the only view I have of the Colorado. I have spent quite a bit of time on the river in boats, swimming, and standing and hiking along its bank. It is at once approachable and inaccessible.Piñon Pine cones make piñon nuts or pine nuts, one of my favorite things. The nuts have been used for food by the native inhabitants of the Southwest for thousands of years and are a staple for squirrels and other small animals. As trees go, most piñons are rather small, but they are very common throughout the high country of Arizona.I was attracted to this cliff ledge in the Grand Canyon with its skiff of snow. You can see how some of the markings on the cliffs originate from the pattern of the water running down the cliff from the melting snow. Like many of my images, this one is almost abstract in its form. I am on my way back to the Canyon and hope to have a few more photos to share."},
{"title": "The Inner Gorge", "date": "Tuesday, January 22, 2013", "text": "There are only a few places on the Rim where you can see clear down into the bottom of the Grand Canyon. Once and a while you catch a glimpse of a portion of the Colorado River, but mostly, all you can see is the top of the Inner Gorge of the Canyon. It makes the game of hide and seek played by the River all that more interesting."},
{"title": "Winter Storm Moving In", "date": "Tuesday, January 22, 2013", "text": "You are not usually surprised by storms and weather up on the Colorado Plateau. You can usually see for almost a hundred miles and impending storms are pretty obvious. Here the sky was already overcast, but you can see the bank of clouds moving over the North Rim. There is still a little bit of snow on the cliffs but it looks like there is more to come.The South Rim of the Grand Canyon is over 7000 feet above sea level and the North Rim is over 1000 feet higher. In Arizona, that means that the winters are severe with very low temperatures, snow and ice. For me, this is the best time to be at the Canyon. The storms change the light and provide a more pastel and mysterious atmosphere to the Canyon. I think the bare trees go well with the huge expanse of rocks."},
{"title": "Into the depths", "date": "Sunday, January 20, 2013", "text": "I like the pastel colors of the Canyon when there is a storm. This photo was taken when it was almost snowing. Within a few minutes, the snow blew in and we had to stop taking pictures. It was freezing cold, but this is the best time to take pictures at the Grand Canyon. I always hope for bad weather when I go.The first thing you learn about oleanders when you grow up in Phoenix is that they are poisonous. I used to think a lot about this when I was sent out to cut the huge oleander hedge that we had around our yard. I always wondered if I was going to die. Well, yes they are poisonous but only if you eat the plants. These are very resilient plants and can survive almost anywhere in the desert Southwest. They are also very invasive and have roots that can clog pipes. They are pretty when in bloom.The Salt River Valley seems to have a lot of plants imported from elsewhere. These bushes from Australia are a good example. Over the years, I have noticed that there is a definite shift in plant preferences. When I was young, Eucalyptus trees were all the rage and thousands (millions) were planted. Now they are definitely out of favor and all the now older trees are being removed. These small red-flowered bushes showed up about 8 years ago in plantings, but problems with keeping them alive in the summer heat has now slowed their use and they also will eventually disappear."},

They only seem to develop when the cactus is mature. Maybe they are a sign of old age? I love the shape and color of cactus even if they don't have any flowers. I guess that is a good thing since I live in the desert.The house across the street had some beautiful big cactus plants until recently. New owners bought the house and didn't like all the cactus so over the past few months they have been paying to have them hauled away. I decided to take a few pictures of the plants before they were consigned to whatever fate is in store for retired cactus. We always look for quartz rocks. Quartz is a mineral and in its pure form is as clear as glass. But usually, it comes in veins and sometimes outcrops and has a whitish color. Colored forms of quartz like agate, garnet, amethyst and turquoise can be very valuable. We have two fairly large chunks of quartz sitting in front of our house that were retrieved from the desert years ago. This is one of the pieces."},

I am sure in more temperate climates this would hardly go noticed. But here in the low desert is was a novelty. Within a couple of days the temperatures had returned to normal and were pushing 80 degrees Fahrenheit.Cactus look as though they had been designed. They are very visual. I admire their sociability. Some varieties grow in huge clumps. Unfortunately, prickly pear cactus grow rapidly and spread wide, sort of like weeds. They are hard to control in a landscape setting, unless you simply give up and turn you yard into a giant social club for prickly pear."},

We are supposedly sitting in the middle of the Arizona Sonora Desert and yet the Valley has hundreds of water features. Some people decry their existence as wasteful and extravagant, but they fail to realize that that the original condition of the Valley had a huge \"water feature\" in the Salt River and some of the Riparian areas are merely a reflection of that reality.If you click on this image and look closely, you can see that our little penguin pool float really is icebound. There was a sheet of ice on pool today also and I will likely post more ice pictures. Ice is big news in the Salt River Valley unlike other places."},

It melted rather quickly but it was fun while it lasted.If you click on this image and look closely, you will see that this wild looking lake is right in the middle of a huge city. Just a few hundred yards away is a busy six lane major municipal artery. I thought about using Photoshop to take out the cell phone towers but then decided that the image needed to be presented in context as a city shot not out in the country.These little birds were so busy eating, they were almost ignoring me. But when I took one step closer, they all decided it was time to return to work. Lunchtime was over.The riparian foliage in the desert turns golden in the late afternoon Winter sun.

One of things I like about the building is the design but more than that I like the fact that the County has resisted the standard Arizona landscape around the building of gravel and cactus or green grass and trees. There are plants, but they are mostly what would be growing there anyway.This is not a spectacularly beautiful building, in fact, it is almost invisible, which is good by the way. I appreciate architecture that blends into its surroundings in a way that makes the structure a part of the landscape. This is the Maricopa County Public Library Branch in Gilbert, Arizona. It is right next to the Gilbert Water Ranch Riparian Preserve and so I see this building frequently.I love the form of feathers. They have fascinated me since I was whole lot younger than I am now. I used to try to draw them but now I am satisfied with taking photographs. I seem to see a lot more white feathers than other colors and I wonder what happens to the colored feathers?"},
{"title": "Violets", "date": "Thursday, January 10, 2013", "text": "I think this is the first time I have ever taken a photograph of violets. This is likely the case because they do not grow anywhere near Arizona. These were cultivated indoors. In fact, I cannot ever remember seeing violets growing outdoors.Tulips are known for their symmetrical form and bright colors. But there is a whole different world down inside those lovely blossoms. A different type of symmetry and color, with forms seldom associated with tulips."},

Now, I do not know for sure that these flowers fall into the category, but I am reasonably sure that is the case. They are beautiful, but not in the same way as a cactus flower or other wildflower. I think I like my flowers a little less cultivated."},
{"title": "A Yellow Blaze ", "date": "Wednesday, January 9, 2013", "text": "I seem to be looking at a lot of yellow flowers lately. I must be attracted to yellow right now for some reason. These flowers are usually bright red, but on this bush, they came out with yellow highlights. I don't think most people associate the desert with flowers, but I do.Nothing transforms the desert quite as much as a bountiful carpet of Spring wildflowers. Normally, grey and brown, the ground is transformed into a display of yellow so bright and cheerful. If you were going to try to see this kind of flower show, you would have to be quite persistent in reading the news and driving out into the desert where the flowers might be hiding. This display usually only lasts a week or so before it is gone.Where and how a plant grows determines to a large extent whether it is considered a wildflower or a weed. Globe mallow (Sphaeralcea ambigua) is a good example of the the weed vs. wildflower dilemma. It has beautiful apricot colored blossoms and grows in profusion in some of the driest and hottest parts of the desert. But it also grows in profusion in gardens and fields planted with crops. In my experience, it isn't one of the weeds I find hard to eliminate and I do enjoy the blossoms, even when they show up in my garden. I would put it in the wildflower category."},
{"title": "Small but beautiful", "date": "Tuesday, January 8, 2013", "text": "Sometimes we have a tendency to equate beauty with extravagance. We seem to appreciate a field of flowers more than the beauty of a single bloom. These tiny yellow flowers would go unnoticed but I was fascinated, not only with the color, but the form of the flower stalks. Remember to look at the details.These lovely flower seeds, similar to dandelions, were just waiting there for a gentle breeze to come along and scatter them to the countryside. I am glad they waited until I got their picture.One of the things missing from desert scenes is the wildlife. There are photographers who can catch some of the wildlife and do a good job of it. But most desert animals are nocturnal for a good reason; the heat. This little caterpillar came along just as I was taking pictures of flowers, so I thought I would include him/her in a photograph."},
{"title": "Open to the Sun ", "date": "Monday, January 7, 2013", "text": "For a brief time each year, the desert wildflowers brighten the valleys and hillsides of the desert. You often have to drive for miles just to see a few flowers, but when you find them, they make the whole time searching worthwhile. The seeds from these flowers may lie dormant for years before the right conditions occur again so they can bloom.Rather than being ostentatious and showy, desert wildflowers are usually subtle but gemlike in their quality. If you are easily impressed with the more temperate abundance of flowers, you might overlook these remarkable shows. If you look closely at this picture, you will see that the ground around the flowers is dry and barren. The flowers grow, even when there is little moisture to sustain them. They brighten my day."},
{"title": "Hedge Hog in the Wild", "date": "Sunday, January 6, 2013", "text": "This is a lovely Hedge Hog cactus growing in the Superstition Mountains east of the Salt River Valley. This plant is often used in landscape plantings in the Valley, but it is not too uncommon out in the wild either. The amount of vegetation evident is also not uncommon, despite your idea of what grows in a desert.This photo will give you a little bit of an idea of the famous Apache Trail between Apache Junction and Roosevelt Dam. This dirt road was built during the construction of the dam to carry freight and materials for the dam construction. It is maintained in its nearly original dirt road state on purpose. It is passible in a regular car if you don't mind bouncing all over with the ruts and washboard and if you don't mind a one-lane road up steep cliffs with huge drop-offs. In our family we have differing opinions about driving this road."},

All of the traffic across this section of Arizona used to drive over the top of the Dam, but since 1990 traffic is routed over this graceful bridge. It is surprising how many times I seem to drive across this bridge while traveling in Arizona.Spring wildflowers are dependent on the rains in the Fall and early Winter. If Arizona gets a good drenching in October, we will have an abundant display of wildflowers. If not, they wait for another wetter year. Some years the displays are spectacular. This is one of those years. All we can do is wait through the Winter to see what the Spring brings."},
{"title": "Lantana ", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2013", "text": "Lantana is a weed disguised as an ornamental plant. It is commonly used as a landscape plant in the low desert. Although it has a tendency to freeze in the winter, it invariably grows back in warmer weather.  We tolerate it because it has cheerful red, yellow or purple blossoms most of the year. It can grow as large as a tree and so if you want to see your house, you have to keep chopping it down. It also smells awful when crushed or bruised. Hmm. All in all, it is tolerable."},
{"title": "Lemon Grass Seeds ", "date": "Friday, January 4, 2013", "text": "Lemon grass is an herb with a lemony taste but is not at all related to lemons. The seeds are similar to carrots and other vegetables. We inherited a clump of lemon grass from the previous owners of our house and it has weathered the summers and winters for many years and keeps growing. We enjoy it on baked potatoes and as a seasoning.Lemon trees are exceedingly prolific. One tree can have thousands of large, yellow, plump fruit. Our lemon tree used to break limbs from the huge number of lemons. One tree is enough to supply an entire neighborhood with lemons. Unfortunately, most people's tolerance for lemonade and lemon juice is very low compared to the number of lemons from one mature tree. I am afraid hundreds of them go to waste every year."},
{"title": "Winter Lawn", "date": "Thursday, January 3, 2013", "text": "Here you go again with an image of absolutely nothing. But wait! This is Winter Lawn. It may not mean much to those of you with ice and snow, but here in the low desert, people actually spend a lot of time and money planting a Winter lawn for green and soft grass for a few months of the year. They power rake the old Bermuda grass and over-seed Rye grass topped with manure. After fighting off the birds who gorge themselves on the seeds, the happy homeowner ends up with a whole Winter's worth of lawn mowing. When the heat returns in April, this lawn dies and the old Bermuda grass starts to grow and the cycle continues. We don't plant a Winter lawn.Just passing by, you would remark about this yellow rose. But if you look carefully, you will see that it is not quite yellow. It has a tinge of pink and other colors. We have a tendency to characterize individuals by one perceived trait rather than look at their individuality and complexity."},
{"title": "Winter Skeleton", "date": "Wednesday, January 2, 2013", "text": "As you can see from the background, not too many of the trees and bushes in the desert lose their leaves in the winter. Although it is now after the New Year and technically Winter, most of the trees still have their leaves. Unless it gets unusually cold, the old leaves usually fall off about the time the new ones start to come on. So seeing a tree without leaves, while not unusual, is not as common as it might be elsewhere.There is the old saying about a bird in the hand being worth more than a bird in a bush, but I disagree. Birds in the hand are pretty messy and I enjoy them in bushes a lot more than holding them.It has been a while since I tried doing any videos. Since I got this clip of the ducks at the Gilbert Water Ranch, I thought I would try it out."},
{"title": "Reaching for the sky", "date": "Tuesday, January 1, 2013", "text": "It is not uncommon for cactus to be used as fences and for security. You can probably guess that if you were confronted by this mass of cactus, you would not likely try to get through it. There is one problem with cactus fences however, many of the varieties are edible so they are not much of a deterrent to cattle. The only cactus in this photo is the prickly pear with the flowers, the rest of the plants with thorns and stickers are not cactus. The large thin-leaved plant on the left is a sotol. The other plants are agaves. It would not be too unusual to see all of these plants growing together, especially if the place where they were growing had a little more than average water source."},
{"title": "Mesquite Blossoms", "date": "Monday, December 31, 2012", "text": "In the Spring, mesquite trees become clouds of yellow puff balls. When they fall, they turn the ground yellow underneath the trees. Mesquite seems best known as a source of charcoal for Barbecue fires. But the wood is hard and beautiful for woodworking also. Unfortunately, because there is so much of a demand for charcoal, the huge Mesquite Bosques (forests) have been decimated and most of the old trees cut down. If they were Redwoods, they might get a National Park, but because they are just old scruffy mesquite trees, no one cares.There are a huge variety of desert adapted plants and not all of them are cactus. Yucca and Agave have similar long pointed leaves with spines on the end, but they are not cactus. We have grown varieties of these plants since some of my earliest memories and the sight of a blooming yucca is inexorably entwined with my memories of the desert.Usually, the colors of a sunset are in the clouds, but here, the color of the sunset is in the sandstone rocks. As the year draws to a close, we need to look forward, not backward, to a brighter and more promising sunrise tomorrow in the new year."},
{"title": "Red and White Salute ", "date": "Sunday, December 30, 2012", "text": "For years and years I grew roses. Now, except for one rose bush, I enjoy looking at the work of others. The low desert is a particularly difficult place to have lovely roses, if the weather is too hot, the flowers burn up a very short time after blooming. But I do love the variety of colors and shapes of roses.We are well into Winter in the Northern Hemisphere, but in the low desert that means we get all the flowers that burn out from the heat of summer. We especially get beautiful roses. Now, in the interests of full disclosure, I have to admit that this flower was photographed in the Summer, but it is indicative what I am seeing around the neighborhood recently."},

But they are still my favorites regardless of theI must be out of the loop for this cultural icon. I see cow statues around the country and haven't a clue as to why they are there.

I realize that it grows like a weed, but some weeds are my favorite plants also. I haven't ever lived anywhere with room enough to grow bamboo, but maybe it will happen some day.One of the mysteries that I often ponder is why the farmers in the Eastern United States would leave places like this and move into the desert? The motivations must have been compelling because many of them left their farms and moved west to find new farms. You might be able to find something similar to this in Arizona, but I doubt it."},
{"title": "Waiting for the Family", "date": "Wednesday, December 26, 2012", "text": "I don't recall ever locking a door to the house until I was quite old. In fact, I don't remember locking my car until long after I was married. Some of the cars I drove had no way to lock the car because windows did not work or were missing. I certainly do not live in that type of world today. We cannot leave anything unlocked or unguarded for even a minute.When I was very young, we lived in a house with no central heating. All of the heat came from a wood stove and a fireplace. In the Winter, we spend a great deal of time trying to keep warm around the fireplace. If we went outside to play in the snow, we had to come back in when our feet were frozen and our clothes wet and frozen, to dry out in front of the fire. The world moved at a much slower pace when you had to depend on the heat from an open fire to keep warm.OK, I realize that this isn't the most dramatic or beautiful photo in my collection. But this is Walking Arizona and part of what we have in Arizona is weird lawns. Some people grow what most people around the country have for lawns in the winter, but during most of the year we rely on Bermuda Grass or some of the alternatives. The so-called Winter lawns die off in the early spring from the heat.This is dichondra. A smallish plant with round leaves that grows like a weed in our lawns. If there is enough water and shade, the dichondra will take over the entire lawn. It is nice and green, but has a tendency to die almost instantly if it runs out of a constant water supply in the summer. Bermuda grass is an invasive weed but will grow almost anywhere, under almost any conditions. But it will die out if it is shaded. Dichondra, with its tiny little round leaves, provides just enough shade to kill out the Bermuda grass once the dichondra is established. Hmm. There is probably a lesson there somewhere."},

Golden Barrel cactus seem to get larger the older they get. Is there any upper limit to how large they can grow? Also, if you are in to such things as the Golden Mean, you should recognize the classic pattern of the top of this cactus as a perfect representation.Another bonus of our hot desert Christmas season is the ripening of all our citrus fruit. We have Grapefruit, Arizona Sweet Oranges, Navel Oranges, Tangelos, and Tangerines. It is time to start picking our lovely crop for another year. We usually eat or juice all of our oranges and tangerines, but end up giving away almost all of our grapefruit. There are groups of people who volunteer every year to go around for the Food Banks and gather in the citrus crop.This is another of our Christmas flowers. Bougainvillea is a sub-tropical to tropical plant with which I have long had a love/hate relationship. The flowers are the little yellow-white spots and the red or magenta are actually leaves and not part of the flowers. It is a beautiful landscape plant but has huge and very sharp spines that will go through the sole of a shoe if you step on them the wrong way. Keeping these plants trimmed is not fun. There are dozens of varieties in Central America, but in the arid Southwest, we get about two or three. This variety is called Barbara Karst."},

We have a huge one in our front yard.This is an Old Man cactus originally from the Andes region of South America. The spines are not sharp and prickly, but soft and silky. This one is about three and half feet tall and grows a couple of inches a year. They can get twenty to thirty feet tall. We have had this cactus for many years and dug it up and replanted it when we moved. Fortunately, it seems to like the place it is now planted and is doing quite well."},

It is now, about thirty years later, almost 5 feet tall. It doesn't appear that we will live long enough to see this one get arms or branches."},

Down in the canyons, it is similar to being in a cave without a roof. Everywhere you look you see rock walls, except almost straight up. The colors are gorgeous, but sometimes it is nice to get up to the top of the walls and see the open country again.I may have mentioned that the dead of Winter is my favorite time to visit National Parks and Monuments. The key here is color, the possibility of snow, and the absence of people in general. Its not that I don't like people, it just makes for a more contemplative time. You can focus on the canyons and the mountains and not have to wait until the tour group leaves the area.In thinking about this picture, I realized that the contrast between the light and dark and the form of the sand and clouds was what this picture was all about.

There is a lot of sand in the desert, most of it just doesn't happen to pile up like this.I really do enjoy the grand view. I like to be able to see where I am going and where I have been.

Most people would not recognize the common food plants growing in a garden. There is too much of a disassociation between the plants sold in the store and what grows in a dirt garden. This is especially true when a vegetable, such as cabbage, is used as an ornamental plant.Cultivated flowers always seem so spectacular, until you see the originals in the wild.

There are a lot of flowers out there in the world and I love them all, even if I cannot figure out what they are called.Sometimes we are looking for the rare and amazing when what we need is right there in front of us all the time. Chrysanthemums are relatively common, but at the same time, very uncommon.

Enough time to appreciate the work that goes into making a work of art on a vertical rug loom, such as this one. If I were going to try to weave a rug, I would first position the loom so I did not have to sit on the floor to weave. But that is probably why I am not a famous weaver.San Felipe de Neri is one of the earliest of the SouthWestern Mission Churches in what is now the State of New Mexico.

The distances are so great, that the shadows race up the cliffs and the light changes constantly. It is one of the great dramatic views of all the world.When I go to the Grand Canyon, it is mandatory to get to the Rim before sunrise and stay all day until it is completely dark. If you don't do this, you miss the changing light that makes the Canyon such an attraction. I am acutely aware of the quality of the light. It takes only a few seconds for the light to fade into darkness and those few seconds must be used to their fullest potential. It is kind of like life in general, using every second to its fullest potential.This photo highlights the grandeur and mystery of the Grand Canyon.

I am usually just crossing it going east or west. But I did get to ride a river boat once and I have had the opportunity to walk along the bank and take a few pictures.

{"title": "Mystery Flower", "date": "Sunday, December 2, 2012", "text": "I can usually identify a flower or a bird or a butterfly without too much trouble. Some of them turn out to be a complete mystery. Usually, because they are found completely out of context. I don't recall ever seeing this flower before or since. Anyone got one of these growing in your yard?Who is there whose heart is not gladdened by seeing a butterfly? There are so many things negative in the world today, we need to remember that some things are just joyful and butterflies are one of those things. It is amazing how they can fly and even more amazing how they do it gracefully and with fabulous colors."},

I have always been fascinated by their uneven and darting flight. Photographs do not do justice to the light on its wings.This color is not fake. There are few flowers as remarkable as the iris. The colors and markings make for a gorgeous combination. We used to have a beautiful iris garden on the westside of Phoenix, in Glendale, but the owners got too old and sold out. It is sad sometimes to see change but I love flowers despite the fact that they last such a short time.Sometimes there are magical moments when the light hits objects and makes them glow and seem to dance in the sunlight. This is one of those magic moments. The setting sun gave an unreal glow to the Spanish Moss hanging from the trees. I have several of these memories that I will always cherish.I love the color and variety of plants and animals in a swamp, but I cannot truthfully say that I am a swamp fan. I guess I contrast the difficulty of moving around and the number of things in a swamp that want to bite or eat you, with the open world of the desert. Oh yeah, there are still things that want to eat you and bite you in the desert, but they aren't quite as prevalent or obvious as they are in a swamp.I couldn't resist another photo of an alligator. I like the contrast between active predators, like scorpions, and these lie-around-and-wait types like Black Widow spiders. I know that alligators can have tremendous bursts of activity, but I have seen hundreds, perhaps thousands, of them and mostly, they have looked pretty inert. You might have to click on the photo to see this well hidden alligator."},

But it is an epiphyte that absorbs its nutrients from the water and the air. This is another plant that we seldom see out here in the desert Southwest.The line between cute and pest is very vague. I like grasshoppers in general although I know they can be destructive. I guess since I am not a farmer, I don't have to think about it. But there are pests I do have to think about. I guess everyone has their own brand of pests.While most of the Northern Hemisphere is getting ready for Winter, we are just getting into the cooler season when the desert is more accessible. Despite the drought, we will likely have a few Spring flowers. Perhaps not the super abundant displays of some wetter years, but nice, none the less. But right now, we are enjoying the cooler weather.One of the most fantastic places on earth is the Superstition Wilderness Area and the surrounding mountains and canyons. This photo is typical of the landscape of this rugged and inaccessible area. I do not spend enough time hiking this area, but now that the temperatures have dropped, it is calling to me again."},

I wouldn't mind a little snow now and again, but then I live in the desert and we don't have to contend with all the fuss and mess of snow. But I still enjoy the colors and forms of the snowflakes. Maybe I will get some snow pictures this year.This is another of those contrasts between the desert and the rest of the country. This old chimney is all that is left standing from an previous house or building. If this were in my part of the country, most of the structure would still be there and there wouldn't be all those trees!Some people have an innate artistic ability.

For an old Arizona desert dweller, it was a very cold and windy day when we were in Atlanta.In my last post, I talked about weaving. This is an old two-harness loom. The harnesses hang from the upright part called the castle. The levers at the bottom are used to alternately raise and lower the harnesses which pull different sets of warp threads allowing the weft to make a pattern in the cloth and to interlace the weft and the warp to make the cloth.For quite a long time, I was very involved in weaving. Spinning and weaving are both very technical crafts. They both require a deep knowledge of the materials and an idea of what the final product will look like. I admire anyone who can learn to weave and even more, I admire those who can spin."},

The Bermuda grass is remarkable, because it continues to grow in cracks in the cement on the upper level of a huge interchange, far from the ground and with no apparent water supply. It also reminded me of our neighbors who are in the process of removing two huge pine trees from there front yard. The trees have completely ruined a low patio wall. Life is persistent and will continue to grow despite adversity."},
{"title": "The End of the Millrace", "date": "Monday, November 26, 2012", "text": "The millrace is the canal or stream from a ditch that supplies water to the water wheel. The millrace was usually constructed by putting a wier or diversion dam on the stream and digging a canal alongside the stream or river until the drop was sufficient to build a mill. The mill wheel was constructed to have scoops or buckets that would fill with water and force the wheel to turn, thus supplying power to the wheel shaft that could be used to power a grinder with a millstone.The use of direct water power for milling operations has almost disappeared from the United States. There are very few mills still operating. The water-powered mill has now passed into folklore. In any farming community, the mill was one of the central places for gathering and communicating. Today, they are all but forgotten.These types of photos can be taken with a macro-lens or, in this case, with a long telephoto lens.

There is nothing in a Walmart, that I am aware of, that is worth fighting over. I wonder if those people thought that the few dollars they saved were worth the fight and the police involvement?

New York is an interesting place to visit if you are young and resilient. Those who love it, really love it, but I can't imagine living there.Usually, after searching for a while, I can identify almost any bird. This is an exception. It is apparently a non-native to the United States and doesn't come up on any of the common bird lists. One thing I do know, that you can always find someone who knows almost everything on the Internet. So how about some help? Please leave a comment if you know what this is.Later: Commentators responded: it is a Black-necked Swan, Cygnus melanocoryphus from South America. Not a local bird.When I was young, we had a clump of banana plants growing on the side of out house. In those days, we didn't have air conditioning, only evaporative coolers, we called swamp coolers. There was no way to recirculate the water in the cooler, so there would be a steady drip line with water running day and night. That drip line went into the clump of banana plants and they would grow spectacularly. I could lay on the grass and watch them grow. The plants would try to produce bananas, but Phoenix was hot enough in the summer but too cool in the winter. We never did get any bananas, just the flowers."},

We thought it was quite an accomplishment and took pictures with all of us standing on the bridge. I think we lacked the concept of a bridge.

This is a working water driven mill, one of the few still in commercial operation. Although I love landscapes and wildlife photos, I am also fascinated with the interplay of light and shadow in this obviously industrial type of environment. You can see the movement of the machinery and the texture of the stone wall of the mill.Black Hawk was the manufacturer of a number of models of grinding equipment. A corn sheller was used to mechanically remove the corn kernels from the corn cob. OK, I usually do this with my teeth when I eat corn-on-the-cob, but if I had to do this for a whole field of corn, I would probably try to find a mechanical way to do this.There are a lot of references to millstones, even in the Scriptures, but I would guess that not too many people these days have actually seen one. Here is a millstone. They are most of all made of stone, usually a hard variety and very heavy. This one is about four feet across and just over one foot thick. References to millstones are all very appropriate."},
{"title": "More Colors of Fall ", "date": "Tuesday, November 20, 2012", "text": "This tree has all the colors, from green to red. I think that Fall exists to give Winter a rousing send off. We need time to get ready and the trees and bushes give us fair warning that cold days are ahead (unless, of course, you happen to live somewhere like Mesa, Arizona). One of the things I missed about living in the mountains was the Fall colors, but not enough to actually move somewhere else.My feeling for Fall are contradictory because we don't really have a \"Fall Season\" as such in the desert. Our Fall consists of lower daytime temperatures. Some tree's leaves do change but not all at the same time. Most of the trees are green all year around and so they just drop leaves at random through out the year. It is almost Thanksgiving and as I look out the window, I don't see even a hint of color or any leaves falling."},

You would just have to keep traveling from the North Pole to the South Pole all the time, spending time in each place where the Fall leaves were turning. But maybe that wouldn't work.

Us old folks grew up with these. But I venture to say that most of the younger generation has never seen a real one, outside of pictures and oblique references.There is a tradition I have never understood of mounting the skulls of dead cows and other animals.

I was always fascinated with the machinery. Now that I am old, I am more interested than ever, but I am determined to identify what it is and how it was used. This is a mechanical hay loader. There are rakes on the front to pick up the mown hay and then there was a conveyor mechanism that moved the hay up and over onto the hay wagon."},

Here, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston met with Union General William T. Sherman to draft and sign the surrender papers for Southern armies in the Carolinas. I have always been fascinated by the Civil War and have read dozens of books on the War.

Well, you would be wrong. Composition is important. Something in the picture has to give a sense of size and depth, otherwise the picture looks \"fake.\" You can take a hundred pictures and only a small handful will really tell the story about the Canyon. Is this one of them?It is no wonder that there is a constant background of news stories in Arizona and Utah about lost or stranded hikers. Some of the places in both states are so rugged and inaccesible that they can overcome even the most seasoned hiker or outdoor person. This is one of those places.

This is one of the few spots from the Rim looking into the Grand Canyon that you can easily reach where the River is visible for a considerable number of miles. It is just about a mile straight down from the Rim to the River and many more miles by trail. Because of the contrast between the River and the cliffs, when you are standing on the river bank at the bottom of the Canyon, you get this feeling of the immensity of the power of the moving water. It can be awe inspiring.I have had my share of ice and snow and cold. We have camped for days in sub-zero weather, buried in ten feet or more of snow. You might suggest that, like many snow birds, that is why I live in the dessert. You would be wrong. I like snow, ice and cold. But there are always trade offs.

I still have some beautiful pictures of Fall leaves to share, but I needed to get back home first.This old disk harrow is something you might see parked out in front of an old farm, rusting away to oblivion. The disk harrow was used to break up the clods of dirt created when the field was plowed. This one is designed to be pulled either by a team of horses or oxen or by a mechanical tractor. These three photos are not great photos as such. They are intended to show huge lily pads and give an idea of the structure of these huge pads. Sometimes my photos are mainly to record something that I have learned while walking.These colorful lily pads are a distinctive red color rather than the traditional green. I always considered myself a radical non-conformist. I guess being a non-conformist came with being raised in the 60s, but my non-conformity took a radically different turn from most of the protestors, I went on a mission for my Church and joined the U.S. Army, two things that weren't on the agenda of the usual flower child of my era."},

The combination of form and color will always be beautiful.There are all sorts of unusual and colorful things both natural and manmade. I tend towards the natural, but whenever there is any lovely or of good report, I seek after these things. Walking is a wonderful method of discovery. I see so many people walking out of habit or with purpose. Chugging along like taking bad tasting medicine. Every walk should be a time for reflection and discovery.I guess I don't understand the idea of boredom. I am never bored. There is always never enough time to think about all the fantastic things there are in the world and all the things I have going on and plan new things to do.

Hence, the flower with the missing petal.The ideal of old age is having time to \"enjoy\" life. I translate that into sitting around a lot with nothing to do. I am the antithesis of having nothing to do. But I do not advocate working 10 to 12 hours a day every day, no matter what your age. I am really in a race with old age and unfortunately, old age is winning. But I am not ready for sitting in the sun and doing nothing.Raleigh, North Carolina has quite a few of these colorful cow statues scattered around the city.

In fact, I don't remember seeing this plant until became a popular ornamental. Well it does come from South America but it is considered an invasive weed in some countries outside of Brazil and Argentina. Plants have an infinite number of variations on a theme. Every one is unique and grows in its own particular way. Perhaps we need to recognize this same principle in people. Each is unique and each grows in his or her own way. We cannot force a bud to grow and neither can we force people to conform to our preconceived conditions we set for them. We all love the beautiful Fall colors. We don't all love what follows. Therefore, we have a huge number of people that come to my home town, Mesa, Arizona whenever the leaves start to turn and leave Mesa for their own hometowns once the leaves have returned. We call these people snow birds and as genealogists, we love them. They come to the classes and they come to the Mesa FamilySearch Library.I am used to seeing small lizards almost everywhere I go. You might have to click on this photo to see this little guy better. When we lived in Panama, we had geckos inside our house. They were always welcome because they ate insects.

But sometimes you just have to be in the right place at the right time with a camera.You should always think about composing pictures to fit in a frame. Sometimes the frame creates its own frame and so on. This is not a Photoshoped image. If you would like to take photographs instead of snapshots, you spend a lot of time looking at light, shade, shadows, patterns and other interesting things you would otherwise ignore.This is an example of those travel websites with the mystery place. If you guess the location, you sometimes get a T-shirt or something. In this case the mystery location is pretty well known in some parts of the country.

There aren't many colorful announcements.Well, it may be dangerous for those of us in our dotage, but while we are walking around, we should look up occasionally. This very large bush was covered with tiny white flowers. It looks suspiciously like Desert Broom, but since the picture was taken on the East Coast, I doubt that the plant would survive the cold and damp. I liked the pattern it made with the clouds in the background. Not all photos have to be of spectacular things. Ordinary things can be beautiful. It just depends on how you see not how you look.When I was a lot younger, snow was a big deal. Since we lived in the desert, many people who had lived all their lives in the Salt River Valley had never \"seen\" snow. So we would travel many miles to the north on \"snow trips\" just so those who had never seen snow could experience it for a while. Sometimes our expectations exceeded our actual experience. We would arrive in the mountains, only to find that the snow had evaporated. In the desert mountains, it doesn't melt so much as it evaporates.

I am not advocating any change. Many areas presently in National Parks would have been destroyed were it not for some level of protection. Let's just not automatically make a public park out of every wild spot left in the country.

Unless, of course, I find some more sometime. There are a lot of places in the world where there are accessible sand dunes. Arizona is not one of them. The most accessible dunes from the Phoenix area are actually in California across from Yuma, Arizona. There are a few other areas of Sand Dunes but nothing like the ones in Utah, California and Nevada. There are stretches of dunes in Northern Arizona in the Navajo Nation, but most are inaccessible except by 4 wheel drive vehicles if at all.  I am fascinated with these wind patterns drawn by plants in the sand. They are so delicate that a slight increase in the wind speed will erase them and a decrease in the speed will not move the plants. These are found in the winter in the Coral Pink Sand Dunes of Southern Utah. I haven't noticed them in other sand dune locations, but that might be a function of the time of year or the weather patterns. I will probably have another of these photos."},

You miss the crowds but you get the ice and snow. If you are prepared for the cold, it makes for really good photos.Early settlers of the West were subject to hyperbole in their naming of landmarks. Referring to a large rock monolith as a throne was more common than you might think. However, in this case, the name fits the rock. We like to go to national parks in the winter or late fall because we usually have the place to ourselves or almost anyway. The light in Winter is far distant than it is in Summer. You get an interesting variety to the pictures.I would guess that I have spent at least as much time wading and swimming in the Virgin River as any other river other than our own Salt River. If you grew up where there are rivers, this might not be something you would remember, but being raised in the desert, rivers are something special. The Virgin River is not that big, as rivers run. In some places it would not even be classified a large stream, but it runs through some of the most spectacular scenery in the world."},

Sandstone is a porous rock and some layers more so than others. When the water reaches the edge of the rock, it forms hanging gardens. These can be as large as a giant amphitheater or smaller and more intimate. They are all distinctively colored. One thing the Colorado Plateau is famous for is the abundance of slot canyons. These are usually very narrow canyons either with or without a running stream. In the case of the Zion Narrows of the Virgin River, the canyon closes in to about twenty feet wide in some places, with the rapidly flowing and very cold water of the Virgin River. The walls of the canyon can be hundreds, if not thousands of feet on each side. Hiking into these canyons is challenge and should never be lightly undertaken. Regularly, people are killed by encountering flash floods while attempting to navigate these narrow canyons.Tracks of ancient creatures are not all that uncommon in the sandstone of the Colorado Plateau but I was fully grown, with a family, before I saw my first set outside of Moab, Utah along the Colorado River. Since then, many, many more sites have been discovered. These tracks appear in reverse, they stick up instead of down into the former mud. These are the kinds of things I am always looking for when I go out into the canyons and hills of the Plateau."},

I look for both patterns and color and sometimes one or the other wins out. In this case they are both important.

The more you look, the more you see.One of the overriding impressions I have of the Eastern United States is that of lots and lots of trees. Sometime it is hard to see large cities because of the trees. Since my area of most emphasis is the West and particularly Arizona and sometimes Utah, I am more at home standing where I can see fifty miles or more than I am when I can see fifty feet.

If the wind blew any harder, the patterns would be instantly erased. It has to blow just exactly right for the exact time it takes to make the pattern and then you have to come along at that precise time to capture the pattern with your camera.This is the classic example of cross-bedding, that is sandstone composed of seashore ripples and sand dunes. The direction of the beds dipping indicates paleocurrents. See Wikipedia:Cross-bedding. These formations are prevalent in the Zion Canyon area of Souther Utah, one of my favorite places in the world. I love the patterns and the colors. You can't miss this hill if you drive from Mt. Carmel Junction to Zion.Most of the ranchers and farmers in the West used local wood sources to build their gates and stock pens. As time passed, farming and ranching either became mechanized or slowly deteriorated. It is very unusual to see new fences and new gates. Most of the time the old ones are simply patched and made do. If maintenance lags, the fences begin their inevitable decline. Sort of like old age."},

When you see pictures of the Old West, with tumbleweeds blowing, they are definitely fake. Although the date is uncertain, the plant was imported from Russia in about 1870 and spread across the country. One day we were stopped by a 10 foot wall of tumbleweeds that had blown across the road. I haven't seen anyplace where the weed doesn't grow here in the desert.I understand that you can lose weight by running. I'm afraid I am past that stage.

Even though we see these ducks frequently, I never get tired of their bight iridescent green neck feathers. These ducks were eating something in the Bermuda grass that seemed mighty tasty. They were eating to fast and furious, you would think is was the best meal they had ever found. We watched them for about ten minutes and they didn't stop, even when we walked right up to them. Too bad we don't know what it was, we could franchise it.OK, it is one thing to take pictures of birds, it is entirely another thing to figure out what bird is in the picture. I can generally recognize the most common birds, but then everything goes into the category of ducks and geese after that. This is an American Coot.You would think that ducks would be the easiest of birds to photograph. But you would be wrong, that category is filled by pigeons and doves. Since I am not a pigeon fan, for a lot of reasons we won't go into here, and doves generally don't do a lot of interesting things other than make a mess in my backyard, I am sort-of stuck with ducks and geese.

I am not sure if this is all one plant or a large number of plants, but like grass it probably doesn't matter, the effect is the same. Some desert plants, like creosote bushes for example, like their space and send out poison from their roots to kill other plants.

Some of these smaller cactus are so small, they are easily overlooked growing under a bush or in the shade of a tree.Some cactus are very sociable. The grow in clumps and all flower at the same time.

Where cactus are blooming you don't need to post signs that say, \"Please do not pick the flowers.\"Sometimes we are fooled by what we see. We base our perceptions on our limited experience and what we see we interpret incorrectly. Photos add another dimension of misperception through the process of representing only a small portion of the overall scene and the selection of the view by the photographer.

Most of the year it looks like a bundle of dried sticks, but whenever it gets enough water, it will be covered with small green leaves. The leaves fall off as the ground dries and then the plant flowers. In some places ocotillo grows all over the hillsides like huge clumps of grass. If you cut off one of the branches and stick in the ground and water it, it will start growing."},

Maybe I am still trying.Herons are some of the largest birds we see in the desert Southwest. I occasionally see them flying over our neighborhood, but usually they are associated with water. Phoenix has a large, mostly dry, river running through it, but in spots there are ponds and lakes. Because of the urban development, there are also many smaller lakes and water features that have contributed to the spread of these wonderful birds.

This time of year, the mesquite trees provide their own version of decorations. Many times the beans fall off the tree, but in this case they dried in place providing a beautiful display.Arizona is not usually associated with wetlands in the popular press, but this beautiful scene is only minutes from my home. We have started taking walks here regularly. Its not that we don't like our neighborhood, but this is much prettier. In a recent picture, I showed some geese swimming in a line.

On the other hand, he doesn't have to put up with Medicare, doctors, insurance forms and retirement accounts. If his days are over, they are simply over. Mine are far less simple. This lovely vine reminds me of some people I know. They are lovely, wonderful people but they go virtually unnoticed because they are neither flamboyant nor are the intrusive. This small vine does not have any showy flowers and it is not trying to take over the world, but it worth the time to stop and admire. Think what you are missing if you fail to recognize beauty in both plants and people. We first got interested in the aloes because of the medicinal qualities of the juice from the thick leaves of the plant. It is good for burns and especially sunburns. But it smells awful. For a while, adding aloe juice to things, including food, was all the rage. I haven't noticed that so much lately. The plants are relatively frost tolerant but burn out in direct sun in Mesa. They also grow like weeds and one plant can take over an entire flower bed if left to grow. These particular flowers are quite unusual."},

The second photo is what they look like before they open. I am not sure if this can be characterized as a flower or not. By the way, these are not native to Arizona. They come from Africa. These are very unusual flowers. They are called fairy dusters. Usually, they are a bright red, but they can also be almost entirely white. Most of the unusual things are really small and unnoticeable in the desert. That is why walking in important.  Most wildflowers have unusual names. I haven't figured out what the relationship is between this beautiful purple flower and owls, but there is the name, none the less. You will have to walk around for quite a while to see this kind of wildflower display in the desert and you will have to be lucky enough to find a field of owl's clover.

I am always impressed with pictures of fields of flowers, usually from places like the Netherlands or France. This abundance of color is dramatic but the desert is different. If there are flowers, they are usually small and hard to see. The individual flowers can be extraordinary, but together they only give a hint of color to the landscape.

It illustrates the two extremes of our existence: joy and sorrow. Not that the cactus isn't beautiful in its own way, but the contrast here is more than apparent. Perhaps we wouldn't be so wrapped up in ourselves if we realized how disparate our nature can be. You don't usually associate moss and cool water with the desert, but in real life, the desert is full of surprises. We found this little tiny spring with just enough water to keep this spot of moss growing and green. There isn't enough water to wade in. Obviously. But it nice none the less. These are what Fall leaves look like most of the time around here. They still have a remarkable texture, but we don't get much color. Most of the traditional activities and images associated with the seasons in North America are simply totally missing in the desert.

Especially when they are already off of the tree and into wind-made piles on the ground. This is what you might find a little further north than our desert since, as I look out the window, all of the trees are still green and have their leaves. Recent rains in October sometimes portend a bounteous crop of wildflowers in the Spring. If it rains enough in October, there will be flowers, if not, no flowers (or very few). The flowers only appear in great numbers every few years and their appearance is entirely unpredictable. I fear that the amount of rain we have gotten this year is not going to turn into flowers in the Spring."},

The rock is actually a memorial to the landing enclosed in a covering right on the beach in Plymouth, Massachusetts. There are no contemporary accounts of a rock and the first reference dates more than 100 years after the original landing. When I am walking around on a beach, it seems like I mostly look at the sand and search for shells and other things. I don't seem to have any handy oceans around here in the desert, but every once and while, we visit one coast or the other and spend time on the beach. Over the years sand and salt water have lost their allure to some extent. But the beach is still a fascinating place for color and forms. Some places are more interesting in theory than in reality. Cape Cod is one of those places. You would think that following a narrow piece of land out into the Atlantic would be an experience. It is. But a different experience than you might imagine. Notice all the footprints on this beach, this is not like walking Arizona. The only reason there is solitude here is because it was late, chilly and windy.

But not being in that position, I am always seeing the blooms right after they have faded or right before they bloom. In this case, the cactus will bloom in the next day or so and although I missed the actual bloom, I got the lovely flower bud. It seems that the columnar cactus are the ones that most commonly have night blooms. They are generally large and light colored. This is likely because of the night pollinators, such as bats. They make an easy to see and echo-locate target. I also note that the flowers seem to grow from almost random spots on the cactus plant's stems.

In our rush to modern technology, sometimes it is refreshing to return to the past and think about life when the \"modern\" communication consisted of carving your message on a stone wall."},

The developer, who started the town, purchased the Bridge. Took it apart piece by piece and re-assembled it in Arizona. You can see some really strange things walking Arizona. Sometimes you just have to dance in the wind. If I had taken this photo when the grass was young and still green, it would not have been remarkable. But when the grass is old and dried up with age, it dances in the wind and creates strange patterns and colors. Upon reflection, it seems like old and dried up may not be as bad as it may seem."},

The lone butte or monument is nearly an icon of the desert along with saguaro cactus and road runners. The interesting thing is all three exist and are quite common in Arizona, but not so much elsewhere. Usually, these individual rock formations are caused by having a core of harder rock than that surrounding the formation. Sometimes they are created when there is a cap of harder rock allowing the softer material to be eroded. Although they are quite common, they are dramatic. We read a lot into what we see. Walking through the desert, I noticed this saguaro that seems to be saying OK. But, of course, it is my perception of the scene that imposes a meaning to the random growth of the plant. Just keep telling yourself that. But it is a lot more interesting to see messages in the world around us."},

In my opinion, Lincoln was the most brilliant writer in the English language; a master of words and phrases. He was also a great President, but not too popular with some at the time. This is about as far away from Arizona as you can get in the United States. The Atlantic Ocean, along the East Coast, is much warmer than the much closer to me, Pacific Ocean. But the drive makes it a lot less convenient. In Arizona, anyone who lives east of St. Johns, Safford and Show Low is said to live \"back East.\" So, by our definition Texas is not the West, but very much a part of the East. California is in a completely different category, the West Coast. It is not really the West, but is always referred to as the West Coast. For us, Arizona defines the \"West.\" Everyone else lives back East, up North, down South or on the Coast"},

Sometimes it is hard to imagine snow in the desert until you wake up camping and find your tent and camp carpeted in snow. These are memorable occasions. The Very Large Array Telescope in New Mexico is the \"star\" of many science and science fiction oriented movies. The most famous is probably the film Contact staring Jodi Foster. You will have to click on the top picture to see the some of the telescopes. I took the picture because the huge radio telescopes are so prominent in the movies and most pictures, but in real life, they are an insignificant part of the huge plateau where they are located. The distances and views are so vast, that the telescopes, although huge by human standards are small in a natural setting. Many things are like that in the natural world.  We are quickly coming to the 150th Anniversary of this terrible and great battle of the U.S. Civil War called the Battle of Gettysburg.

We would buy the wheat in 50 lb. buckets or bags and store it in 40 lb. containers. I think we still have quite a bit of wheat in cans for storage, come to think of it. Things that naturally appear orange or close to orange are fairly rare. These delightful flowers are tiger lilies. They used to be seen in the Salt River Valley but now are quite rare. It is interesting how tastes in plants change just like tastes in clothes and other things. At one time they planted thousands of eucalyptus trees around the Phoenix area. Now, they are so \"out-of-fashion\" and the only eucalyptus trees left are old and dying. May tiger lilies will come back? The Peter Wentz Farm in rural Pennsylvania shows classic farm home architecture and construction methods. Everything about the farm is very \"foreign\" to the desert Southwest where I live. But upon reflection, I don't think I would trade. I often wonder why people would leave Pennsylvania and walk across the country to settle in the desert, but after walking Arizona for so many years, I really think I understand why."},

I am always impressed by the contrast in farms across the U.S. Out here in Arizona, the farm is likely to resemble a junk yard, with old discarded cars and trucks, broken farm equipment and etc. scattered over the property. The contrast in places like Pennsylvania is dramatic. That is why I took the picture. One of the most important things we can accomplish as individuals, as families and as a society is to take care of our children. This photo symbolizes how youth can benefit from age. It is too bad that more of the youth of our very mobile country do not have the benefit of directly knowing their grandparents.  We are surrounded by imitations of nature on every hand. Every office and restaurant has its fake plants and flowers. Many of our homes are decorated with fake plants. But even expensive fake plants have a hard time competing with reality even when the colors of the plants are outrageous. These plants are real and growing.

I realize that these are technically called Pronghorns and that they are not really antelope, but that is still the common name for them throughout the country. They are one of the large animals of the Southwest that I see most frequently, along with deer and elk. They are usually very elusive and I have never been able to get near one, except in a zoo. Why are these flowers called Black Eyed Susans? If you think about it, the Black Eye part probably comes from the prominent carpel or pistel. But the Susan part?

Early morning and just as the sun goes down are both really good times to be out taking pictures. The morning light always adds a huge dimension to photos. The evening is more problematic because you have to decide when it is too dark to take any more pictures. In both cases the optimal time is quite short, no more than a half hour or less. Most of my photos are handheld so fading light really makes it difficult to get a shot without camera movement. It also means walking back to the starting point in the quickly descending gloom of night. Maybe I'll start toting a tripod and get serious about the evening shots?Yep, this is another abstract. You really should click on the photo to see the detail however. I could have spent days painting something like this and by walking around I can find the same thing in nature at a much reduced price.

This is one of those places. Do you want to know where it is? Why would I tell you?Walking through the desert without getting stuck by cactus is an acquired ability.

Usually when I see a spectacular sunset, I either don't have a camera or don't have an open view. I just happened to be walking around a lake and found this sky just as it got dark. This is always a good reason to live in Arizona. Some of the most brilliantly colored flowers in the world are from Euphorbia plants rather than cactus. Cactus is native to the American continents and there is only one species, probably a transport, that is native to Africa. On the other hand, Africa has a huge variety of Euphorbias, none of which are native to the Americas. Both have spines and both have gorgeous flowers. Some cactus are more spines than they are cactus. Just like some people are more prickly than others. Just like me, you probably know someone that this cactus reminds you of. I guess the best way to handle that situation is to stay outside of the reach of the spines. Why do some cactus have serious spines and others hardly any at all? The argument is that spines evolve to protect the plant, but then the animals that eat the plant either evolve to eat the spines also or somehow avoid the spines. Another theory is that the spines shade the plant from the hot summer sun. If that is the case, then why do some cactus have huge spines like this one and others smaller spines that hardly provide shade? I think we need to look elsewhere for a reason and avoid ad hoc reasoning."},

I am not talking about huge fields of tulips or mountain wildflowers, I am talking about usually small and insignificant flowers but ones that are spectacular in their own way. There is a moral there somewhere. There are two things about this photo, first there is evidence of a very recent rain storm. In the desert that small puddle on the rock will evaporate in a matter of hours at the most. Second, there is a face on the rock. I see faces all the time in patterns on the floor, on rocks, on trees on nearly everything. This is called pareidolia and is a common phenomena. It is the same reason you see shapes in clouds.

Never underestimate the detail that there is in commonly seen objects and scenes; color, texture, light and dark, all conspire to make a dazzling picture. Few trees in the desert provide as much as the mesquite. The trees grow in areas known as mesquite bosques or forests. The wood is very hard and used for building fine furniture and other items and is commonly burned for charcoal or for barbeques. The demand for mesquite wood for fires has decimated the tree in some areas. The Indians used mequite beans or seeds and pods to make a flour-like paste that was highly nutritious. The trees are relatively fast growing, but an older one, like the one in the photo can be relatively rare. This is one case where a food product, mesquite beans, goes to waste due mainly to ignorance of its value."},
{"title": "Barrel Cactus Flowers and Fruit", "date": "Sunday, September 16, 2012", "text": "Barrel cactus are pretty strange. They have both flowers and ripe fruit (the yellow colored pods) at the same time. The flowers bloom in the middle of the plant and then the fruit develops from the seed pod and as they ripen, they progressively move to the outside of the ring and eventually fall off or are eaten by animals. You see a lot of strange things in the desert if you are around for a while. Shore birds are an anomaly in Arizona. We have very little \"shore\" for them to wade on. I guess scarcity is the attraction. Where we do have shore, we have lots of birds. I don't remember so many birds from when I was young, and then again how many would I have noticed? I do remember the first Great Blue Heron I saw in Arizona. It was at Saguaro Lake about forty years ago. Now, they are quite common and I have even seen them flying in our neighborhood. Prickley Pear cactus have the most delicious fruit imaginable. After the beautiful flowers have faded, the seed pods mature over the hot summer months and by Labor Day, they are red and ripe and ready to pick. Picking the fruit is a challenge given the spines and glochids, the tiny hair-like spines at the base of each spine cluster. We used to pick the fruit with long tongs and then try to burn off the spines in an open flame. Later, we found out that burning the spines was not necessary, as long as you were very careful not to touch any part of the plant with your skin. We then would put the ripe fruit in a steam juicer with a cloth liner to catch the spines, and juice the pods. From a bucket of fruit, easily picked in a few minutes in the desert, we could get quarts of dark red juice to use for jelly and syrup."},

Aptly named, these mysterious creatures fly without apparent effort. They are my friends because they eat flies and mosquitoes. They are also my friends because they are such accomplished flyers. They are hard to photograph because they do not hold still for long and just when you get them in focus, they fly away. Some time ago, I took these shots of a huge section of petrified wood. Since I was talking about abstract impressionism, I thought I would include these photos. It is hard to conceive how these rocks could have been formed. One of my basic questions is why? If there is no conscious order to the universe, then why would a huge stone log contain such beauty?"},

To find this kind of photograph, you have to be intensely aware of the light in your surroundings and be prepared to take photos. You may need to click on this image to see the detail. This is Goblin Valley in central Utah and the Henry Mountains in the background. This reminds me of the George McDonald book, The Princess and Curdie. I guess it is the juxtaposition of mountains and goblins. SeeMacDonald, George. The Princess and Curdie.

{"title": "Confusion", "date": "Tuesday, September 11, 2012", "text": "Sometimes we look at something and it is so strange that our eyes cannot sort out what we are looking at. At these times, we either stop looking or try to apply some previous experience to explain what we see. This image is one of those unrecognizable images. I would guess that most people, nearly all, will something besides what is really here. Likely, they will see horsetail rushes, an aquatic plant. But this is cactus, an unfamiliar variety, but cactus none the less. Ruins of ancient people hold a fascination of the unknown. Even though archeologists have spent lifetimes trying to unravel the mysteries, they have little more than piles of data and speculation. Who lived here? Why did they choose this spot to build their houses? Where did they go and why did they leave? The more you dig, figuratively, into the past, the more you find is really unknown. I love to walk in the ruins and once again appreciate how much there is to learn. There is no romance associated with the Lincoln Highway like there is for Route 66. No television shows. No signposts advertising backwater communities. But the Lincoln Highway was the first successful, all-weather, coast-to-coast, automobile highway. Parts of the highway were paved in bricks and this photo is part of the original highway in central Nebraska. Other than the now, unusual brick paving, this stretch of highway is mainly ignored. The road has taken on the decided common sounding name of Highway 30, but even then, the traffic has moved slightly south to a newer cement road. When I walk, I walk through history."},

Although this one is broken, many of the original pumps, from the 1800s are still serviceable and in daily use. There is something elegant about the form. It is one of the most organic designs imaginable. Form following function with nothing extraneous to mar the design. This one was found in Nebraska, but I have seen and used similar ones in Arizona."},

I am even more fascinated by real rivers. The variety of forms is amazing. It is too bad that I don't have hours to sit and watch how the forms evolve as the currents change. This is the North Platte River in Nebraska. Historically, there were 20 to 30 million of these animals in North America. Often called buffalo, they are really American Bison. You might think they are like large, shaggy cows, but a full-grown bison can weigh over 2000 pounds. One late evening in Yellowstone National Park, we were driving back to our camp, when we encountered a herd of bison walking down the road. We were stopped by the bison as they slowly walked past our truck. I had my window down and as they came by, inches from the truck, I rolled it up and we sat there petrified, hoping that none of these huge creatures took a mind to pushing us over."},
{"title": "As a field of grass", "date": "Sunday, September 9, 2012", "text": "Early descriptions of Arizona comment on the abundance of grass. The natural state of the desert is still one of grass and forage that supported a huge variety of wildlife. All that changed when cattle were introduced to the state. Overgrazing replaced the native grass species with foreign weeds and other inedible plants. Today, it is extremely rare to see the desert as it looked before cattle. This is an example of what the native grass looked like over much of Arizona."},

The manufacturers of fine automobiles often advertise how their cars have wood paneling and leather accents.

If you want to be surrounded by luxury get outdoors and look around you, luxury is free and entirely visible to anyone who wishes to look."},

{"title": "Understated Beauty", "date": "Thursday, September 6, 2012", "text": "Most people think beauty needs to be overwhelming to have any significance. Our consumer driven society deals in beautiful people and beautiful surroundings in every production. Everyone appearing in an advertisement is either young or beautiful or both.

{"title": "Evanescent Beauty", "date": "Tuesday, September 4, 2012", "text": "These flowers bloom at night and last only until mid-day, one or two days a year. If you catch them while they are blooming they are spectacular, but if not, all you see is small rounded and unimpressive cactus. Some people are like that, unless you see them when they are performing their work or doing what they do best, you may never guess the talent that lies hidden. Many of the slot canyons of the Southwest are hardly visible until you get right to the edge of the canyon. White Canyon in Southern Utah is no exception. It is a deep steep sided canyon. But its very nature is also its attraction. I am fascinated by the form and color of these deep canyons in sandstone. We visit them for their beauty, anciently, they were home to the inhabitants of the Colorado Plateau."},

But we can always imagine what it would be like to have cool running streams with fall leaves sprinkling the surface of the water. You might want to click on the above photo to see the detail. You know, I have to admit that this picture did not come from Arizona. There is moss in Arizona, but it is dry most of the year and only turns green after a period of wet weather. There are a few springs and creeks where you can find moss covered rocks, but nothing as extensive as the varieties of moss in the picture. I guess when you live in the desert, there is some fascination with cool and green. But in my case, you soon get over it and get back to dry, hot, reality."},
{"title": "Age", "date": "Saturday, September 1, 2012", "text": "Faces and rocks show the effects of age. Both become more attractive and appealing as they assume the creases and cracks that come with time and experience. I don't think I will every get as old looking as this rock in a stream bed, but who knows, I might live long enough to give the rock some competition in the wrinkle department. Sometimes you cannot understand what is going on around you without seeing the \"big picture.\" But other times life is in the details. It is the small things that make life worth living, not so much the big events. Every day there is something you can see or do that will make you aware of the beauty and serenity that surrounds you. We need to get away from the noise and clutter of the world and look at what is truly important."},
{"title": "A perfection of form and function ", "date": "Friday, August 31, 2012", "text": "Cactus exhibit perfection in both form and function. It is hard to imagine anything you could design that is adapted so perfectly to its environment than a cactus and at the same time has such a perfection of form and beauty. Frank Lloyd Wright implemented a movement called Organic Architecture. This is defined as a philosophy of architecture which promotes harmony between human habitation and the natural world through design approaches so sympathetic and well integrated with its site that buildings, furnishings, and surroundings become part of a unified, interrelated composition. See Wikipedia:Organic Architecture. If you apply this definition to this prickly pear cactus, you can see why I think they are perfect examples."},

Here is a shot of some really unusual flowers; two colors on one plant. Both these flowers are growing on the same pad. The desert is always full of surprises. We are rapidly coming up on the time when Prickly Pear fruit will be ripe and ready for picking. Labor Day is our traditional time to go out into the desert with buckets and pick the fruit. We then cook it down in a steam juicer to extract all the juice and use that to make syrup and jelly. I must say that the jelly is delicious and the most beautiful color."},
{"title": "Love", "date": "Wednesday, August 29, 2012", "text": "I found this iconic statue in downtown Scottsdale, Arizona standing on a raised cement platform in the middle of a Bermuda grass lawn. No shade. No lovely flower border. It gave me pause to think about what our society considers to be love. Millions of miles of barbed wire fence exist throughout the United States. Eventually, without maintenance the fence lines fall and the wire becomes a trap for unwary hikers and even for animals. I see a relationship here between the fence lines and our lives. Unless we maintain safe boundaries in our lives, keeping us from those things that will harm us, the very barriers that we create can become a snare for us and those around us. We cannot let our fences fall and we cannot lose our standards."},
{"title": "Fading into the Past", "date": "Tuesday, August 28, 2012", "text": "The destructive power of a forest fire can be one of the most terrifying of the natural phenomena. But equally as impressive is the ability of the forest to renew itself and regenerate from the ashes. This burnt log is now only a shadow of the destruction that is now but a fading memory. The effects may last for some time yet, but part of nature is quickly hiding the evidence. We often form stylized images of the world around us and when we find something that does not conform to our internal image, we conveniently forget it exists. If I asked fifty people to draw a cactus, I would likely get a huge majority of saguaros. It is very unlikely anyone would draw this cactus. Why is that the case? Even those people who have never seen a cactus in their life have formed a concept of cactus that is equal to saguaro and nothing else. I think this is sad."},
{"title": "Seeing Double ", "date": "Monday, August 27, 2012", "text": "I couldn't resist these twin cactus flowers. Who would suspect that such a small cactus could have such large and beautiful blooms? Many things in life are a surprise and we often misjudge by appearances only. Cactus only bloom once or twice a year, so seeing the blooms is always a treat and a double treat to get a photo."},

I still think they are one of the most beautiful of all the flowers and I never tire of their colors and the variety of their forms. Of all the things I would like to have done in my life, I would most of liked to have had the opportunity to be a gardener, full-time and I don't even mind pulling weeds. The vast inland sea of the Great Salt Lake creates its own atmosphere and weather. Since many of its attractions are very local, the vast sweep of its vistas are often ignored by visitors. There is a surprising amount of wildlife for such a desolate looking place. Even the highly saline water teems with life.

No bones about it, this is one of the thinnest models you will ever find. Looking through the subject however, you can see that there is little substance to this model. It might be a good idea to round out this post with another observation, life is tough and then you die. Sand can be a solid, a liquid or even, when wind blown, like a gas. This sand is fairly unique in that it is not made up of quartz grains or other hard rocks, but are shells of concentric layers of calcium carbonate                 that has precipitated around a nucleus or central core. They are found in many locations around the world, but generally on the beaches of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. From the wind and the waves, there are many unusual formations."},

There are not too many places where the fault line is so obvious. Triops, or tadpole shrimp, live in desert potholes of the Southwest.

It has even become a valuable collectors item, mounted on a board in a frame with various varieties. The idea for barbed wire dates back into the early 1800s. Sometimes it is referred to as \"bobbed\" wire. When I was young, we called it \"bob wire.\" One of the rites of passage as children was to learn to walk through a barbed wire fence without getting a scratch and without tearing your clothes. This photo shows a stretching segment, the crossed wire in the middle is tightened by twisting the sticks in the wire."},

I am always on the lookout for flowers and it is always nice to find one, have my camera and have time to take the picture. All of these factors combined to produce this fantastic photo. The Arizona high country is full of surprises, some of them on the very local level. I don't believe I had ever seen a white thistle flower before. Usually and very commonly, they are purple. The appear to be rare, especially in Arizona. It just goes to show that you may see something unusual if you know where to look and what you are looking at. I have always been fascinated by mushrooms. I can remember seeing them as a child and thinking there was something magical about the way they just appear out of the ground without any other visible plant structure. I always think that I could have been happy, just wandering the forests and deserts of the world discovering new kinds of mushrooms. But I guess I have to be content at just looking at them, when I find them."},

In the overall view of the vast mountains and hills, these tiny flowers are an almost infinitely small dot of color, but up close, they are truly marvelous. I have learned to keep my eyes open for the small as well as the large vistas in life. Last year, the Wallow Fire became the largest in Arizona recorded history. The aftermath of the fire is visible throughout the White Mountains and highly visible from some of the mountain communities. You will need to click on this photo to see the detail, but this is shows some of the most northern reaches of the fire and the land below where the fire stopped. Look closely at the mountainside to see the fire's destruction."},
{"title": "Rag Rug ", "date": "Saturday, August 18, 2012", "text": "Some of my earliest memories are associated with rag rugs. In the 1800s and early 1900s (and before that of course) rag rugs were common as a floor covering. They are made on a two or four harness loom warped with strong cord. The weft is made from strips of cloth cut from old or discarded clothes or bedding. None of the cloth was wasted. The cloth was either cut into squares for quilts or woven into rag rugs. Some of these are so durable that they are still in use in modern homes today. Rag rugs are a visible symbol of a society that had as a motto, \"Waste not, want not.\" This would be a good thing to remember today. I find this picture symbolic of our mortal lives. We live here in the present, with dark shadows and a confusion of contrasting images. There above, on the hill, is the Temple, lifting above the tangled world below and giving us a clear message of light and knowledge. Even though we live in the tangled world below, we have the promise that comes through, like this Temple on the hill, that will guide us out of the dark shadows and into the light."},

{"title": "Ruins", "date": "Wednesday, August 15, 2012", "text": "All that is left of the ancient Indian dwellings is usually a ridge of stone outlining the rooms of buildings. This ruin is called the Puerco Pueblo and it is generally thought that these people were the ancestors of the modern Indians living in the Pueblo communities across northern Arizona and New Mexico. It seems incredible that these people could survive and even thrive in such a hostile environment. But we see a land that is much drier and was heavily over-grazed in the 1800 and most of the 1900s. I often wonder what their lives were really like back then. Go outside or look out a window. How far can you see? This is a scene that is very common from my early childhood and throughout my life. Why would you trade this for what you can see right now out your own window? Maybe you wouldn't. But I would. But reality does step in and move you to the city and out of the Plateau. You do have to work and very few people have jobs that give them the opportunity to see forever."},
{"title": "The Ancient Art of Petroglyphs ", "date": "Tuesday, August 14, 2012", "text": "There is no particular rhyme or reason to the location of petroglyphs, they mostly take advantage of the type of rock surface. In the desert, some rocks very slowly become coated with manganese oxide, the black coating you can see on the rocks. Small traces of manganese are dissolved in rain water. By chipping away the black coating, the lighter color of the original rock shows through an makes a semi-permanent surface for drawing pictures. You could walk right by these petroglyphs and unless you were attuned to the desert, you would never see them. Petroglyphs give you a direct connection with the ancients who carved them into the rocks. I doubt my writing will last as long."},

Almost all of the early settlements were established along the more permanent river systems. Here in this photo, is typical Colorado Plateau River without the deep canyons usually associated with the Plateau. This view is similar to what the pioneers saw when the first stepped foot in Arizona Territory in the 1800s. There are a few exceptions, for example, tamarisk and tumbleweeds are foreign imports and would not have been seen by the pioneers. This happens to be the Rio Puerco, a tributary of the Little Colorado River."},

When the pioneers, such as my Great-grandparents\" arrived in this area, they had to drink the water from the rivers. They would pour the water into barrels and let it settle for a day and then skim off the top water to avoid having so much mud and silt in their drinking water. The women complained that all of the clothes washed in the river water turned mud red. It was a hard life. When I was young, we got all of our water from the Little Colorado River of which the Rio Puerco is a tributary. When we would freeze ice cubes, they would come out striped, clear on top, red on the bottom."},

Many Americans forget that the whole Southwestern United States was once owned by Mexico. Most of the territory was obtained through the Mexican War of 1846 to 1848. One of the ironies of the War was that some of the generals and other officers fighting for the U.S. would soon be fighting against the United States in the Civil War. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the major consequence of the war: the forced Mexican Cession of the territories of Alta California and New Mexico to the U.S. in exchange for $18 million. Arizona later obtained additional parts of Mexico through the Gadsen Purchase.This is my kind of country. Some of my earliest memories are of exploring the clay hills of the Colorado Plateau. I feel more at home in these hills than any other place on the planet. In this panorama, you will have to click on the photo to see the petrified wood. This is the so-called Jasper Forest of the Petrified Forest National Park in north central Arizona. The Park is only 45 minutes or so by automobile from where I spent all of my early summers.

The term \"Maya\" is a collective term that refers to a diverse group of people who are related linguistically and culturally but each have their own language and culture. There is no real way to distinguish whether or not a person is \"Mayan\" and any attribution to Mayan culture is tentative at best. Used in this context, it means that these extraordinary embroideries were made by indigenous residents somewhere in Central America.

{"title": "More Mayan Weaving", "date": "Saturday, August 4, 2012", "text": "The patterns for traditional weaving are handed down from generation to generation. These textiles were almost always woven on backstrap looms, that is the tension on the warp was supplied by a harness that went around the waist of the weaver. The weaver used string heddles to raise the warp so the weft could create the patterns. A good weaver would take more than a day of weaving to produce about one linear foot of cloth. I have a greater appreciation for the final weaving because I realize the effort it took to produce it. We often judge people by our first impression of them. We categorize them by their clothes, their face, their weight, their hair color or other superficial characteristics. We do the same with plants. Most plants are ordinary and inconspicuous. We hardly ever notice grass or bushes unless they have showy flowers. Coleus is a showy plant. With varieties from all over the world, the colors of its leaves are always a fascination. But they are relatively sensitive to cold and heat. We seldom see them in the desert, they just cannot survive the dry heat. In some ways they are like people. Some people may not be showy, but they are survivors."},

Like these fossilized bones, we can only see the shadows of what has past. We live so much in the present and so little understanding of the future. At one time I wanted to be a paleontologist but I never really took any steps towards achieving that goal. Now my goal is a shadow in my own past. Whenever I see a collection of ancient fossils I still remember my former interest. Mineral crystals grow in empty spaces in rocks called vugs if they are large and geodes if they are small. In the case of geodes, the crystal filled space is surrounded by a rock matrix and sometimes the rock matrix is in the form of a nodule. This collection of quartz crystals is about six feet across and came from a huge vug in a mine. Many valuable crystal vugs have probably been lost when the crystals were mined along with the ore. Occasionally, a collection of crystals is preserved."},

Below the weir, the stream is bone dry. It is neither good nor bad, it is a fact of life. Water is life and the cities would not exist without total appropriation.  No matter how many trees and plants I have seen, I still find new ones I have never seen or noticed before. This is a Smoketree Cotinus coggygria. There are many plants that I am sure I must have seen but seeing is not noticing. I am sure this tree would not be one I would notice if it were not in this stage of its yearly growth. There is always a reason to be outside and always more to really see and more importantly, notice."},

I am not sure that riding on the outside of a helicopter fighting a huge raging fire would be the safest job in the world.I have noticed that my children choose entirely different colors for the walls of their houses than either my wife or I would choose. Colors have a huge part in our emotions and feelings. The colors we have in our houses often reflect our most basic values and feelings. Just as I know that many people ignore flowers, except those sold in stores or in printed ads, so I am sure that many of the most terrible parts of our society could be ameliorated by the simple act of cultivating flowers.There is an innate human fascination with falling water. Waterfalls are a total sensory experience with sound, movement and color. They are doubly fascinating to those of us who were raised in the desert where water in any form, is at a premium. I may dream about living where water runs in the rivers and streams form waterfalls, but I always return to the desert. I guess I admire plants that can survive with little or no rain, more than those that have perpetual watering from the spray of a conveniently placed waterfall."},

Apparently, the carp all got together and hired a PR firm and after extensive research decided that they would get more traction in the U.S. if they went by the Japanese name rather than plain old carp. In ancient times, when I was a Boy Scout, I learned about carp. My Scoutmaster told me that when you went fishing for carp, if you caught one, you would gut it, spread the fish out on a pine board and cook it until it was done and then eat the board. I think this came from the feeding habits of the carp which I will not go into in a family rated blog. Stalactites are pretty remarkable. They seem to grow organically, but they are produced by individual drops of water evaporating and depositing minute layers of calcium carbonate. The colors come from minerals in the water. It is amazing to me that such beauty exists far underground and in complete darkness, until we visit this underground world and shine lights on the formations. These photos were taken with a hand-held camera with no flash.Big things come in little packages. Sugar Pines are huge trees and have huge cones, but Sequoias are the largest trees in the world and have cones that are relatively small. These are Sequoia cones and are about an inch across. The seeds are only the size of a flake of oatmeal. At any one time, a Giant Sequoia may have as many as 11,000 or more cones and can produce from 300,000 to 400,000 seeds a year. It is probably amazing that the whole world isn't covered by Giant Sequoias, but they only grow in very limited areas of California."},

After a few minutes, I finally talked myself back to calm and collected and began the very slow process of extracting myself from the crack, one inch or less at a time. When I get an MRI, they always ask me if I dislike small spaces. I always say no, I just go to sleep.Magnolias are inextricably associated with the Southern United States.

I was struck with how incongruent this particular tree was, being so far from home. Flowers speak to the eternal nature of the universe and the spiritual side of all that is human, good and beautiful. Evolution without God, can attempt to explain change, but it cannot explain beauty. Why are roses so beautiful? Do you think the pollenizers appreciate the beauty?

It is entirely possible that some petroglyphs have an underlying profound meaning.

The only method of doing this is to assume a perfect resignation to the Divine will, to consider that whatever does happen, must happen; and that by our uneasiness, we cannot prevent the blow before it does fall, but we may add to its force after it has fallen. These considerations, and others such as these, may enable us in some measure to surmount the difficulties thrown in our way; to bear up with a tolerable degree of patience under this burthen of life; and to proceed with a pious and unshaken resignation, till we arrive at our journey’s end, when we may deliver up our trust into the hands of him who gave it, and receive such reward as to him shall seem proportioned to our merit.

They do not last for long before the moment is swept up in the flurry of the day's activities.

Each flower only blooms for a day but there are so many flowers on one plant that they bloom for a couple of weeks.Next to the giant saguaro cactus, these are some of the largest cactus in the Sonoran Desert. Before the world became aware of the limited nature of the desert flora, a common desert survival technique had the thirsty hiker cutting open a barrel cactus to get the moist interior. FALSE. I tried it when I was a teenager and didn't know better. It doesn't work. The interior is very bitter and the flesh of some types of related cactus causes nausea, diarrhea, and temporary paralysis.

When I lived in the jungle, I was fascinated with the way fences of cut branches would grow by just being stuck in the ground. The same thing happens with ocotillo.

There are few things in nature more impressive than a really big storm. But the they are highly entertaining if you can stand on the sidelines and watch as the Weather Channel has discovered. I used to stand out on the Colorado Plateau with a view to the South and watch the lightning over the White Mountains. Every time there is a big rainstorm with lightning and thunder in Mesa, I run outside to stand and watch the rain. This habit got me quite a bit of ridicule in Panama where it rains every day. It is the storms that make life interesting but also difficult."},

This is one of my favorite places and I have taken a lot of pictures of the area over the years, but have not put many of them up on my blog. In going back, this was a particularly beautiful early Spring day with gorgeous flowers and a nice cool breeze. Part of me, in spirit, always lives in the mountains of Utah and the other part, the old physical body, lives in the desert of Arizona. I love the desert because it feels like home. I love the mountains because they feel like home. I guess its nice because whether I am headed for Utah or Arizona, I am always going home."},

The longest time was during under-graduate and graduate school at the University of Utah. The center attraction of downtown Salt Lake City is Temple Square and the Plaza to the south of the office buildings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This entire area has changed enormously over the years. Recently, most of the buildings south of these two city blocks was redeveloped with the addition of many new buildings. the large building on the left used to be the Hotel Utah. It is now a Church office building and the main offices of FamilySearch, the genealogical organization I spend a lot of time with. This whole area is one of the major tourist attractions in the entire United States with five million plus visitors every year even more than the Grand Canyon in Arizona. It is a vibrant and interesting place to visit and I love to take pictures there."},

The whole area is covered by these pint-sized formations. When we first went to Goblin Valley, there was a very bad dirt road and no improvements. We found the limits of the valley and had an adventurous time climbing the cliffs around the valley. Now there is a covered observation deck and a paved road with a nice parking lot. The campground has showers. But the formations persist despite the modernization of the location. In some ways when I see the encroachment of civilization I long for the days when it was like we were the first people to ever see the area."},

The media would have you believe that salt flats were devoid of vegetation, but you can see in between the salt, there are plants growing. Albeit they are not huge plants, they do grow and thrive in this impossibly toxic environment. It you haven't guessed by now, the white stuff all over the ground is crystallized salt.

Most of those monument pale before the natural monuments already existing out there in the world. Nature creates its own monuments but doesn't leave much of an explanation why. There are few places in the world that hold more fascination to me than the clay hills of the Colorado Plateau. I find the endless shapes and textures so attractive, I could wander around in them for hours or days or even weeks, discovering new vistas and seeing unusual shapes. There are some hazards however, the clay gets really sticky and can be a trap if it is wet."},

Here in Southern Utah, the lake extends hundreds of miles up the Colorado River into the canyon country. But as with all reservoirs, the level of the lake changes with the availability of water and the releases downstream. What the pictures show is a vast flood plain in the canyons. At the time of these pictures  the the river was running in its traditional channel, but all of the surrounding areas along the canyons show signs of the higher water level either in the form of a white bathtub ring type mark on the canyon walls or in the huge mud flats of sediment left high and not too dry. Almost all of the photos you see of the effect of the lake show the water marks, few focus on the upper reaches of the reservoir and the impact it has on the canyon bottoms."},
{"title": "Deception", "date": "Wednesday, March 7, 2012", "text": "There is something deceiving about this photograph. Between the sandstone hill in the near distance and where I am standing is a precipitously deep narrow slot canyon called White Canyon. Looking out across the landscape the canyon is invisible. In fact, if you know, you can see the top of the far wall of the canyon as a low ridge of yellow colored sandstone in the mid-distance. So what would seem to be a short hike to the hills, turns out to be virtually impossible. Sometimes this is like many things in life. Things are not as they appear and what seems easy is in fact, impossible, just as a short hike towards the hill will reveal."},

This is one of the better pictures I have of cryptogammic soil crust. This dark brown growth is alive and is one of the strangest of the desert phenomena. It is anassociation between algae, lichen, mosses, and fungi. See Wikipedia:Cryptobiotic soil. This soil is a good example of how much you can miss while walking anywhere unless you are educated enough to realize what you are looking at. When I was living in the jungle, I learned that it took a long time before you could see anything. When I first arrived, the jungle looked like a solid green wall. After a couple of years, it looked all different colors, browns and greys and blacks. This soil in the desert is like that. Casual visitors never know what they are missing."},

Some of the other National Monuments, like Tonto National Monument, let you get right up next to the ruins. This particular ruin is in Bridges National Monument in Utah. It is accessible if you want to take a really long around about hike down into the Canyon. Maybe I will someday. You never know where I might end up going.

None of the jungle's basidiomycota or deuteromycota, bacteria that rot the wood. While at the same time, the adaptive plants keep on living. Some of the oldest plants in the world live in the deserts. Sometimes we use deserts as examples of waste land, but it seems to me that both the living and the dead benefit from deserts."},

If I didn't tell you how big it was, you might be impressed. But if I step back a few feet and take the picture over again, you can get an idea of its true size. If this arch were, say, ten feet across, it would be a local attraction. As it is, it is right next to a campground and probably hardly ever noticed. If the arch were 100 feet across, it would be a tourist attraction and shown on many maps. The largest natural stone arch in the world is said to be Rainbow Bridge at 234 feet (as measured by laser). If it were close to that size it would be world famous. Size does matter, in some things."},

{"title": "The Hazy Canyon", "date": "Saturday, February 25, 2012", "text": "On most of my recent visits to the Grand Canyon the air quality has been bad to worse.  There are two major causes of this problem, controlled burn forest fires and coal burning generator plants up wind of the Canyon. On some days the haze is so thick, you will have difficulty seeing across the Canyon. Unfortunately, both these conditions exist during the heavy tourist season time in the summer. Not much can be done about forest fires. If the Forest Service did not conduct controlled burns, then we would have even more destructive uncontrolled burns.But there is no reason, given our present technology, to put up with smoke pouring out of 300 foot smoke stacks. Personally, I am not against industrialization at all, but a 1000 acre solar facility does not pollute the sky over the Grand Canyon. In today's world, pollution is a choice not an inevitable consequence."},

For some reason, there are relatively few photos taken down into the Grand Canyon. Almost everyone familiar with the Canyon identifies with the iconic photo showing the flat horizon and the vast extent of the Canyon's crenelated side canyons. But this is the view you get as you walk into the Canyon, right near the top. As you descend the trail, soon the walls close in and your perspective changes and you are walking inside the Canyon and enter an entirely different world. Looking down from above, you cannot see the real Canyon of soaring stone walls and the huge fast running river. Most of the desert is a study in open spaces, The Canyon is a study in confinement and limits.We don't have distinct seasons here in the desert, just warm and hot. For example, deciduous trees begin to lose their leaves in November and don't finish until the new leaves come out beginning in January. Despite the lack of anything resembling seasons in a more temperate climate, there are subtle changes during the year. Even though the temperature doesn't drop that much, some of the plants go dormant. The big event of the year occurs in April, May and June when the local cactus begin to flower. This is a prickly pear flower, one of the most spectacular."},

Even if none of the spines managed to stick through your shoes, they have a tendency to work their way through the sole or leather or whatever eventually. I speak from experience. It is interesting to talk a walk in the desert with someone who did not grow up with cactus and the desert. They seem to pick up a lot more than those with experience. It is kind-of a reverse physical and direct spiritual experience. The less you know about the desert, the more cactus you tend to pick up.

The roadways, parking structures and visitors' center give the whole area an unreal aspect. If I didn't know better, I might think this was a computer generated set for a movie. The Dam is famous for its part in the one of the latest Transformers movies. This panorama was taken looking upstream from the parking structure on the Nevada side.

There are two of them and they are reportedly the largest bronze statues in the United States at the time they were cast. Quoting from the Bureau of Reclamation website and quoting the sculptor, Oskar J. W. Hansen from Norway,The building of Hoover Dam belongs to the sagas of the daring.        The winged bronzes which guard the flag, therefore, wear the look of        eagles. To them also was given the vital upward thrust of an aspirational        gesture; to symbolize the readiness for defense of our institutions and        keeping of our spiritual eagles ever ready to be on the wing.Concerning the statues:The winged figures are 30 feet high. Their shells are 5/8-inch thick,        and contain more than 4 tons of statuary bronze. The figures were formed        from sand molds weighing 492 tons. The bronze that forms the shells was        heated to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit, and poured into the molds in one        continuous, molten stream. The figures rest on a base of black diorite, an igneous rock. In order        to place the blocks without marring their highly polished finish, they        were centered on blocks of ice, and guided precisely into place as the        ice melted. After the blocks were in place, the flagpole was dropped        through a hole in the center block into a predrilled hole in the mountain.When I visit the dam, the sculptures are overpowered by the immensity of the engineering work at the dam. The huge canyon, the huge electrical transmission towers, the huge dam itself, all tend to make the huge sculptures rather insignificant in comparison."},

I decided to show these two seals because of my earlier post about the Utah beehive and seal. Arizona's seal has the motto \"Ditat Deus\" which is supposed to be Latin for \"God Provides.\" Google Translate renders the saying as \"God Enriches.\"The images look skewed because if I took the picture directly above the seal, I would have cast a shadow, so we have to live with the skewed images."},

There used to be a huge selection of art cars. These have given way to tourists. It is still and interesting place to explore and go sight-seeing. Arizona does not have one big theme park.

{"title": "Collapsed Lava Tube", "date": "Sunday, January 22, 2012", "text": "It is difficult to understand what you are looking at in this picture. This is a collapsed lava tube near Sunset Crater in Sunset Crater/Wupatki National Monument in northern Arizona. These are dormant volcanoes. In some volcanic eruptions there are lava flows that come from a vent in the earth. The hot lava flows out over the ground and forms a lava field. Occasionally, some of the lava will harden before the vent stops pouring out lava, in that case the hot lava finds its way through the solidified rock, sometimes if the lava flow is constant enough, the lava will form channels, like streams, through the previously solidified rock. In some cases, the top of the stream of hot lava will also solidify and form a lava tube. The lava will continue to flow through the tube, slowly extending it out across the ground. When the lava stream stops, the still hot lava in the tube runs out, leaving the tube empty. This photo is one of those lava tubes where the rocks on top of the tube have fallen down into the space the lava left.If the tube is big enough and strong enough not to collapse, sometimes you can get into the lava tubes and follow them. We have been in a few lava tubes, some of which go for more than a mile under the rock. They are similar to a cave and are sometimes called lava caves."},

It is really a series of small canyons all connected by a ridge line. So, depending on your point of view, it is or is not a canyon.There is another point of view suggested by this picture. Unless you click on the image and magnify it a little, you will probably miss the long distance view of the mountains in the background. Not the hills behind the cliffs, but the mountain way over there on the horizon. You can see Navajo Mountain, most of which is in the State of Utah but some of which is in Arizona.

This photo shows something of that perspective. If I didn't tell you that this was the Grand Canyon, likely you would think this a mountain landscape. I think this is much like life, you can't really see the big picture because you are too much immersed in the valleys of life. You need to make the effort, on occasion, to climb out of the valley and look at the larger picture which gives an eternal perspective.As a note, in the background you can see a lot of smoke. This is the effect of the \"controlled burns\" on the Kaibab Plateau which makes up the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. Other haze in the Canyon comes from large coal burning power plants."},

This was probably an activity discouraged by adults but memorable to children. I have no idea if the flower's nectar was or is edible, but we didn't recognize those kinds of distinctions.

In the early morning and towards evening the light changes as the atmosphere absorbs more and more of the yellow sunlight and appears to be redish or orange. The red sunlight of the evening brings out the redish hue of the rocks and highlights the white and yellow limestone cap of rocks on the North Rim. Understanding the physics of how the light changes enhances the experience.This is a small version of a 61 MB panorama of the Colorado River as it runs by downtown Yuma, Arizona. You definitely need to click on the photo to see anything. If you read this blog at all, you probably have figured out that I really like panoramic photography. The reason is pretty simple, you get an expansive view of the landscape and most of the landscape I look at is pretty expansive in itself. This picture is interesting because a little ways down river, virtually all of the Colorado's water is diverted off into canals, leaving the river almost dry by the time it enters the Gulf of California aka Sea of Cortez."},
{"title": "The Endless Canyon", "date": "Sunday, January 15, 2012", "text": "I think most people are drawn to the Grand Canyon simply because it is famous and a \"must see\" attraction. As I may have previously related, my first memorable visit to the South Rim at Grand Canyon Village involved getting out of the car, looking at the Canyon, getting back into the car and driving onto another location. It took a few years for me to appreciate what I saw and what I would see on subsequent visits. My initial visit was highly influenced by the number of people on the South Rim. Despite the crowds, if you are willing to drive and/or walk, and if you want to find solitude, you can really get away from it all at the Grand Canyon. Particularly on the North Rim, where this picture was taken, we have spent almost an entire day and seen no more than twenty people, and most of those were driving on the dirt roads, rather than walking around.Once you drop below the Rim this whole perspective changes. There is nothing but the Canyon. On the corridor train between the North Rim and Grand Canyon Village, there is a constant stream of hikers and people on mules, but leave that heavily traveled trail and you may not see anyone in a week."},

I recently watched two old grapefruit trees we had in our front yard lose the battle. They kept putting out new growth every year, but overall they lost more than they gained and ultimately they had to be removed. As we grow older, do we constantly try to gain more than we lose? I talked to an accountant last night who is as old or older than I am, but he is still working full-time at his profession. He may be failing to make new growth faster than he is losing the old."},
{"title": "Looking Down From the North Rim", "date": "Thursday, January 12, 2012", "text": "The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is about 1000 feet higher than the South Rim, so when you are looking out across the Canyon from the north to south, you are in a real sense looking down on the Canyon. The cliffs are substantially higher and you can see over the Canyon onto the Plateau. This is evident by the faint outlines of the San Francisco Peaks on the horizon. If you hike from Rim to Rim (about 24 miles or so of trail) it is best to start on the North Rim and hike to the South Rim because you have 1000 feet less uphill trail. There are those who hike Rim to Rim to Rim and in that case you probably want to start at the South Rim because your last uphill climb would be lower. I can imagine hiking some 48 miles in one day, but it is not a pleasant thought. I will mention those who hike Rim to Rim to Rim to Rim but I don't understand them, they can get a similar experience by hiking into the Superstition Mountains on practically any of the back country trails if they just want punishment. The biggest obstacle to hiking in the Grand Canyon, in my opinion, is the temperature differential between the top and the bottom of the Canyon. The main corridor trails aren't particularly hard to travel but if you leave the main trails you have just stepped off into an entirely different world. You need a permit from the National Park Service to travel outside of the main trails on day hikes or to camp in the Canyon."},

Rather than the uniform blue sky or clouds of the most common photos of the Canyon, the sky here is a uniform gray. The reason is that periodically, the National Forest Service conducts controlled fire burns on the North Rim to protect the forest from catastrophic forest fires. As a result, the Canyon is filled with haze and smoke. You can see the layers of smoke against the far Canyon wall. The smoke appears as a white cloud in the sky. This is another of those pictures that must be clicked on to see the detail."},

In the desert you have to look at the details or you will miss the entire message. It is too easy to dismiss the desert as a brown expanse under a blue sky, but that is like dismissing some people because they don't dress the way you think they should.

The spaces in between the rocks is filled with an unconsolidated clay. The colors come from the mineralization of the iron in the clay between the rock ledges. You can see the same forces at work in a sandbox or sand pile with different layers of wet and dry sand. The slopes below the cliffs lie at the angle of repose, that is the optimal angle for particles in an unconsolidated pile. What is surprising about Bryce is the color and extent of the eroded surfaces."},
{"title": "Angel's Window", "date": "Friday, January 6, 2012", "text": "There is a difference between a window, an arch and a bridge. All of these terms are used to designate holes in cliffs and rocks. A window is a naturally forming hole through a narrow rock ridge. This picture shows a famous window on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon called Angel's Window. You might have to click on the photo to see it clearly. The window is actually quite large, but the size of the Canyon makes everything look small from a distance.An arch is a free standing window. The most famous arch is Delicate Arch in Arches National Park in Utah. A bridge is an arch that is over a watercourse. There are a large number of examples in Bridges National Monument in Utah. Whether the feature is a window, an arch or a bridge, they are fascinating natural features."},

Distinctively shaped, Mjölnir is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the most fearsome weapons, capable of leveling mountains. See Wikipedia:Mjölnir That is quite a stretch for a rock formation but it is good public relations for Bryce Canyon National Park. Many of the rock formations throughout the Southwest bear the names of mythological beings or objects because the names reflect the cultural background of the early explorers and pioneers. It is interesting that by giving a rock formation an exotic name, more people will notice it and look for it when they visit the Park."},

The Field also includes Sunset Crater, the most recently active volcano in Arizona. None of the volcanoes are presently active, but they cannot be considered dormant. We love the high peaks because they are visible from most of northern Arizona.

Here is a photo of the same River but about 200 miles upstream.How much of what I know and believe is influenced by the contrast between these two areas?

Powell Point was the location of the dedication ceremony for the establishment of the National Park in 1920. There is a memorial to Powell built in 1919.  Powell was the second director of the U.S. Geological Survey and also served as the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology at the Smithsonian Institution.

But most of the people in Philadelphia were bundled up with dark black coats. Almost no one had on anything other than black. I would guess that the temperature was between 65 and 70 degrees because otherwise I would have been uncomfortable. I didn't do too well in the cold until I lived in the snow country for a few years. I found that unless the temperature got below freezing, it did not bother me too much. Anyway, after living in Mesa for so long, I have forgotten to wear a coat and most winters I can get by without wearing a coat more than a few times all year.

Since that time, both Great Blue Herons and smaller white egrets have become relatively common throughout the state. I have seen them up on the Colorado Plateau in swampy areas and they are frequent along the Salt River lakes and where the river is still running such as the area below Stewart Mountain Dam.

Although Arizona is not know for its caves, there are still some interesting and remarkable caves to explore. Unfortunately, there is one major problem, caves are dark. You can usually only take pictures when it is light. You would wait a long time for enough light to take a picture in a cave. So you have to bring in your own light source or use a light source installed in the cave. This happens to be what is called a \"show cave\" in California. A show cave is one where trails and lights have been installed for visitors. Only a small percentage of all the caves in the world are open to the public. Most caves are known only to a very few persistent and experienced cavers (sometimes called spelunkers). I have been in both types. Every time I see a cave open to the public, I try to take a tour. Some like Carlsbad Caverns National Park are spectacular, others are pretty but not so nice. Some of the caves that are \"open\" to the public have been entirely trashed and all the formations removed by vandals. All in all it is much more difficult to explore a cave than climb a cliff. Imagine climbing a cliff when it is dark and very wet outside, that is what most caves are like."},
{"title": "On Snow", "date": "Saturday, December 24, 2011", "text": "Despite the many references to snow and cold weather associated with the Christmas season, I have lived most of my life in the desert Southwest and I have little or no association with Christmas and snow. When I lived in Argentina, Christmas came in the middle of the summer. In Panama, there is no \"winter\" or \"summer\" either for that matter. The few years I spent in colder climates do not leave me with any particular memories associating snow with Christmas. In fact, the average temperature this time of year in Bethlehem is only slightly cooler than her in Arizona (but a whole lot wetter). So the evergreen tree association just doesn't fit.Winter in the Arizona Sonora Desert is a time to be outside, hiking, camping, biking, or just taking a walk. Some days the air is clear and cool and the days are bright and sunny and you realize the heat is the summer isn't all that bad of a trade off."},
{"title": "Granite Cliffs", "date": "Friday, December 23, 2011", "text": "These cliffs in Yosemite are really not at such an angle. But when you take multiple photographs, you often get parallax errors. Your eyes automatically correct for the change in perspective, but the camera records each frame as you see it and then, when you put the frames together, you get a slightly strange looking photo. Here, the waterfall is not falling straight down. This seems to be the case because, when the picture was taken, I was standing way below the cliffs. If I had taken the picture from approximately the level of the middle of cliffs, the perspective would have been more normal looking."},
{"title": "Reflections on Space", "date": "Thursday, December 22, 2011", "text": "From time to time, I travel to the East Coast. While driving, I begin to notice a change about the middle of Texas. The land slowly transforms from its preoccupation with space to an emphasis on trees and limited horizons. There are relatively few places where you get an open view of the countryside. In the summer, you get glimpses of farms and cities. In the winter, you suddenly realize that there are houses and people on the other side of the trees. I certainly prefer the long view. I feel more at home, standing on a hill, looking out over the huge vistas of the West, than I do driving on narrow winding roads, closeted with trees. We recently climbed the highest hill in an Eastern County and guess what? Besides the radio tower and cell phone tower, you couldn't see anything but trees."},

While hiking on these extensive miles long, almost flat areas, you feel like you are surrounded by mountains and lose most of the sense of being in a canyon. Some, like the Plateau Point, have definite marked trails, others are so remote and inaccessible as to be virtually on another planet. When cliffs are the main point of attraction, it is hard to focus on the flat areas that accentuate the huge drop off into the depths of the Canyon."},

The obvious problem in taking pictures from the air into water is the reflection of the water surface. A Polaroid filter will make the water appear more transparent by eliminating the surface reflection. Eliminating reflection does not always make a good photograph, however."},

I have an extensive experience with sink holes having dropped down into a number of them. But this is an entirely different experience. First, it was raining and second it has plants and is huge. You can walk down the stairs on the wooden structure to see the sink hole but cannot get off the wood to roam around. In Arizona no one cares and few people know about the sink holes. A millhopper is in a grinding mill, a hopper from which grain is supplied to the stones. I can't imagine what kind of relationship that has to this sink hole and why the Devil has anything to do with it?"},

{"title": "A Grand Perspective", "date": "Saturday, December 17, 2011", "text": "The most visited part of the Grand Canyon is called the Corridor. It is about a twenty-mile wide strip extending across the Canyon from the North Rim to the South where most of the Park's development is concentrated. At the bottom of the Canyon are two bridges, the oldest built in 1928 is the Black Bridge or Kaibab Bridge. Previous to the construction of this bridge, the only way across the Canyon was by a cableway, that is, a cable suspended over the river with a large metal cage, large enough to carry one mule or a couple of people at a time. The Kaibab Bridge's construction posed extreme difficulties since all of the materials for the bridge had to be carried down into the Canyon either by mules or human power. The one-ton 550-foot suspension cables were carried down into the Canyon on the backs of 42 Havasupai Indians walking single file down the trail. See ASU nature, culture and history at the grand canyon.In the 1960s a second bridge, the Silver Bridge, was built across the Canyon connecting the North Kaibab Trail with the Bright Angel Trail. This second bridge is open only to foot traffic but also carries the vital water pipe line from Roaring Springs where the water is then pumped up the Canyon to the South Rim."},

Indian Garden, which is not visible in this photo, is 4.6 miles down the trail from the Rim. It is 12.4 miles from the Rim down to the river on the Bright Angel Trail. It is 2.4 miles from Indian Garden to Plateau Point, one way.

Symbols become more important than reality and reality takes a backseat to feelings and emotions. The forms of the Canyon are more than reality. The mere outlines of the cliffs and bluffs have become a symbol for the wilderness. It is ironic that a place so inhospitable to humanity, has become one of the most recognized and visited locations in the world. Sometimes we need to step away from the iconic and move to a new perspective. Some would think their visit to the Canyon wasted if they were confronted with the frequent Winter snow storms, but others, like myself, see this as an opportunity to view the Canyon from a different perspective."},

Most of the time photographers try to achieve a hyper-realism in their photos. When you go to most of the photography websites, you will often see ads for retouching software that erases lines in faces and any blemishes. We get so used to seeing altered photos, we would not recognize the people depicted if they were standing right next to us. The same thing happens with landscape and other photos. I see the photos by other photographers and I can immediately tell that they are a better Photoshop user than photographer. Any photographic depiction is suspect. All photos lie either by the choice of what to include and what to exclude or by post-production manipulation. In the above photo, I purposely included the ant. This photo is about the ant on the flower. I could have easily erased the ant from the picture and you would have never known that it was there in the first place. What else is missing from the news photos and all the other photos you see each day?Just so you can see what I mean, here is exactly the same photo, without the ant."},

Some of the most famous abstract artists of the past have tried to create art out of the chaotic interplay of colors and light. Take Jackson Pollack for an example. But with all the genius and all the effort, not one of them could match the complexity of a little bush on the side of hill in the deserts of Utah. Why did I take this particular picture? When I look at a bush, or a tree, or a flower, I instantly see the design in the underlying arrangement of the elements of the scene. When I look through the viewfinder, I can move inches one way or another and tell if there is a picture or not. It is not a random, walking through the desert, snapping pictures sort of activity. Some views turn into a picture, most do not. Sometimes there are no pictures. If I look at a snapshot made by someone else, I can instinctively tell if it is a picture or a snapshot. With hundreds, perhaps thousands of images every day, every hour,  every minute, it is wonder I do not make more pictures."},
{"title": "Death in the Arizona Desert", "date": "Sunday, December 11, 2011", "text": "Newspaper reports commonly chronicle the death of those who venture out into the Arizona deserts unprepared. This tragedy is common among illegal aliens trying to cross the border. Through July 31, 2011, 132 deaths from exposure and dehydration had been recorded in the deserts south of Tucson, almost all certainly illegal aliens. But this danger is not limited illegal aliens, anyone venturing unprepared into the desert in the summer can quickly succumb to the heat.From Wikipedia:Symptoms may include headaches similar to what is experienced during a hangover, a sudden episode of visual snow, decreased blood pressure (hypotension), and dizziness or fainting when standing up due to orthostatic hypotension. Untreated dehydration generally results in delirium, unconsciousness, swelling of the tongue and, in extreme cases, death.In the desert, symptoms can start appearing within a very short time, even a matter of an hour or less depending on the hydration of the individual.It seems like we regularly hear of a winter visitors to the low deserts who drive out into the desert, only to have some sort-of mechanical or tire failure and die from dehydration before they can be found and rescued. Headlines such as \"European tourists die of heat stroke in the desert\" are not uncommon although this particular article refers to an incident in California.The answer to the question is rather simple. Stay out of the desert in the summer (or anytime actually) unless you have adequate water, more than a gallon a day per person, and always leave your estimated time of return with a responsible person. Do not leave your car unless you have a specific destination and can physically make it that far. Never hike during the heat of the day, hike in the evening, at night or during the early morning. If you hike at night, only do so if you have a very clear idea where and what direction you are going and know how to navigate and walk at night. If you do leave your car, leave a note telling the direction you left and the time you left. Remember, a gallon of water weighs eight pounds. If you can wait and not be tired by waiting... Rudyard Kipling. Waiting is a real part of life and too many think of waiting as negative to life's positives. But waiting serves a purpose also. We can have a productive or destructive waiting time. If we think and dream, reflect and consider, waiting can be a blessing. If we fret and worry, squirm and suffer, waiting can be a torture. When I was young, I used to count the days until things would happen. At some point in my life I decided I would never count the days again. Of course we must plan, but living is waiting but we don't need to wait to live."},

The red masked parrot is not quite so common in Arizona, but it is more common in California communities. Taking pictures of birds is a challenge, due to the foliage surrounding the bird.

Waste water is treated and then pumped into these lakes to add water to the underground aquifer.  As a result, this is a wildlife sanctuary right in the middle of town, surrounded by offices, homes and shopping centers. Right next door, overlooking the lakes is the Maricopa County Library. The Preserve has miles of trails, campgrounds and bird watching blinds.This is really a plant called Desert Broom when it has gone to seed. The seeds are like cattails and cover the ground just like snow. If you happen to bump into the bush, the seeds will swirl around like dust or, if you use your imagination, like snow. The plant is a rather invasive weed and will grow anywhere there is enough water. We are always pulling out the smaller versions of this plant from flower beds and gardens.

Enduring to the end is part of perfection, as is completing your work, your purpose and the plan of your life while you are yet on the earth.  \"Wherefore, if ye shall press forward, feasting upon the word of Christ, and endure to the end, behold, thus saith the Father: Ye shall have eternal life.

I do occasionally get a nice picture of a bird or some other animal. Here is a Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo Regalis). Ferruginous means rusty colored, so the name fits. The Latin name means Royal Buteo, which creates another problem because the translation of the Buteo in English is buzzard and buzzards don't get much respect in the U.S. which is probably why it changed its name to Ferruginous. I also don't do a lot of action pictures, I am usually trying to get the speed, focus, f-stop and other things to work altogether and miss the action. This picture was a fortunate exception to the rule."},
{"title": "Great Horned Owl", "date": "Tuesday, November 22, 2011", "text": "Although I do not claim to be a wildlife photographer, if I am outdoors and have the opportunity to take a picture of a bird or other animal, I will do so. I think if you are going to be a wildlife photographer, you have to actually go outside to photograph animals. I don't believe I have ever done that so I obviously don't qualify. This is a Great Horned Owl. I have a long history with this type of owl since I saw my first live one in the third grade at school. As it turned out my future mother-in-law brought one to school to show the children."},
{"title": "The Nauvoo Temple", "date": "Monday, November 21, 2011", "text": "The second temple built by the members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was in Nauvoo, Illinois. The original temple was completed as the Saints were being driven out of Nauvoo by mobs to begin their exodus across the continent to the Salt Lake Valley. This current temple is a reconstruction of the original completed in 2002. I have visited Nauvoo, a small town on the Mississippi River in north-central Illinois, many times. Sometime I need to go there just to take pictures. Most of my pictures of Nauvoo tend to look more like snapshots. What is the difference between what I consider to be a photograph and a snapshot? It is mainly an issue of subject matter and composition. I can look at a hundred photos and maybe one or two will turn out to work as photographs. This is one of my favorite photos, taken on a hot sunny July day. Nauvoo is my favorite place in America outside of Arizona and Utah."},
{"title": "In my dreams", "date": "Sunday, November 20, 2011", "text": "All of my life I have admired craftsmanship. I love things that are well made and at the same time beautiful. If my life had been different, I would like to have been a gardener or a craftsman. I especially like things that are handmade where the character of the craftsman comes through. I have tried some woodworking and weaving, but I never got good at either. I finally realized that the one thing I could do was communicate in writing and speaking. But to keep my hand in the creative side, I started dedicating whatever extra time I had to photography. I could spend days at the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Another interesting fact, some of my relatives came from Bucks County. Maybe that's where the urge to create came from."},
{"title": "Photograph as Metaphor", "date": "Saturday, November 19, 2011", "text": "In a real sense, a photograph is a metaphor for a window into the past. Then a window into the past in a photograph is a double metaphor or a metaphor within a metaphor. Can something be a metaphor of itself? This photo of a window in the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works is a window into the past in an active and currently productive pottery and tile factory in Pennsylvania. This amazing place is home to both the oldest of crafts and the most recent of trendy designs. I will share several photos of this wonderful building and enterprise over the next few days."},
{"title": "Definitely not Arizona", "date": "Friday, November 18, 2011", "text": "This is definitely not Arizona. Our canals are not quite as picturesque. If you saw the last picture, you can guess that this is Pennsylvania near the Delaware River. It is next to the Washington Crossing Historic Park. I am always struck by the contrast between the East Coast and the desert Southwest. What made my ancestors leave this beautiful verdant country to travel to the barren deserts of Arizona? If you ever need a more graphic example of the faith of my pioneer ancestors, just look at this picture of a canal in Mesa."},
{"title": "Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania", "date": "Thursday, November 17, 2011", "text": "Every American school child hears about George Washington's dramatic crossing of the Delaware River in the middle of winter during the Revolutionary War. What is probably not so well known is that the site is a lovely park area along the river bank with a museum and other historic buildings. This photo shows the absolute contrast between the Pennsylvania countryside and my own state of Arizona. I can safely say that there is no place in the state of Arizona where a photo like this could have been taken."},
{"title": "Liberty and Justice for All", "date": "Wednesday, November 16, 2011", "text": "I have done quite a few shots of the Statue of Liberty, but it is always a good idea to reflect on the symbolism of this great American icon. A while ago I had an iconic picture of a saguaro cactus and it is amazing how closely identified the cactus symbol has come to represent the desert Southwest. Likewise, Liberty has come to mean a lot of things in the United States as whole. Unfortunately, the underlying symbolism and the original meaning of the statue has been obscured by our current wave of jingoism and nativism."},
{"title": "A window on New York", "date": "Tuesday, November 15, 2011", "text": "Most of my days are spent indoors. When I was working full time at an office, I had a window to a courtyard with no view of the sky. Sometimes I think we view the world like we are looking out a window and not really participating in the outside world. Even though I still work indoors, I now have a window that looks out to the sky and some very large pine trees. Although the view is not much better than the one from my office, I enjoy seeing the sky, when I remember to look out the window."},
{"title": "Liberty in the Storm", "date": "Monday, November 14, 2011", "text": "I decided to trek to the other side of our country for a while. This is a photo I took and in thinking about it, I think it is probably symbolic. Storm clouds are gathering and the light of liberty is becoming quite dim. Maybe we need to think about what needs to be done to preserve liberty and justice for all a little more and less about solving our financial problems on the backs of the poor huddled masses yearning to be free. As usual, you can see the picture better if you click on it. The smaller sizes shown in the blog posts usually don't do justice to the images."},
{"title": "Bryce in Panorama", "date": "Sunday, November 13, 2011", "text": "Most of the really spectacular places in the West are too large to fit into one viewfinder. Although you could make a respectable photograph in one frame, technology allows me to take multiple shots, stitch  them together and see the bigger picture. Of course, the ultimate is a 360 degree panorama, but then I have to set up the camera and take the pano and work to put it together. Sometimes what is really interesting is right in front of the camera and not behind. I do like 360s, but this photo comes out just fine as a full view of Bryce Canyon."},
{"title": "A Hoodoo Maze", "date": "Saturday, November 12, 2011", "text": "These spires at Bryce Canyon National Park are called hoodoos. A hoodoo is a tall, thin, spire of rock that protrudes from the bottom of an arid drainage basin or badland. See Wikipedia:Hoodoo (geology). These formations are rather common erosional features on the Colorado Plateau, but nowhere so abundant as in Bryce. The rocks consist of limestone, dolomite and siltstone. The softer rock erodes under a cap of harder material making the hoodoos. For the most part, the hoodoos are not carved by running water, but by the freeze/thaw cycle flaking off particles of rock. We have had several very pleasant family camps in the general area of Bryce. The summer I took this picture we were very surprised to find a nice camping spot inside the National Park without a reservation."},
{"title": "Mule Deer", "date": "Friday, November 11, 2011", "text": "I do not bill myself as a \"wildlife photographer.\" I have never had the leisure to spend the time waiting for some animal to stick its head out of its hole. But I have taken some opportunity shots over the years and this is one of them. Usually, the shots don't come out as well as this one. I attribute this shot to a good 300 mm telephoto lens that got me close enough to get a good picture without camera movement. If I ever get out into the mountains or the desert again, I will always be keeping my eyes open to the opportunity shot of the wildlife. By the way, this is a mule deer, very common in Arizona and Utah. This shot was taken in Bryce Canyon National Park."},
{"title": "Bryce Hoodoos", "date": "Thursday, November 10, 2011", "text": "Usually you see pictures of Bryce Canyon from the canyon rim looking down on the hoodoos, but they are even more impressive looking up from the bottom of the canyon. Every once and while I have to return to Zion and Bryce for a reality check. Both are so overpoweringly majestic that no memory can compare with the reality of being there. By the way, Bryce is not really a canyon at all. The hoodoos are all along the side of a very high mesa. The side of the mesa is cut into amphitheaters and small canyons but the main views of the spires and pillars are from the rim of the mesa or plateau."},
{"title": "Forest Fire in the Sierra Nevada", "date": "Wednesday, November 9, 2011", "text": "During the past few years there has been some intense controversy over the issue of forest fires, especially in Arizona. With the Wallow Fire this last summer and the previously largest fire, the Rodeo- Chediski Fire in 2002, the issues have become extremely divided. The Wallow Fire consumed 817 square miles and more than 30 structures. The damage from these two fires was entirely eclipsed by the tremendous destruction in Texas in 2011. From the beginning of the fire season to October 31, around 27,976 fires had burned 3,959,040 acres (about double the previous record), 2,862 homes (1,939 of which were destroyed over the Labor Day weekend), and over 2,700 other structures.On one hand you have the indignation and outrage from \"conservationists\" who oppose all timber cutting and forest thinning projects and on the other hand you have timber industry and those involved in forest management. The controversy is far from over and the fires will likely continue as the climate changes and the drought continues in Arizona.The above panorama shows a controlled burn in the Sequoia National Park. To see the picture, click on the image."},
{"title": "Needles in the Sierra", "date": "Tuesday, November 8, 2011", "text": "This shot taken from Moro Rock in Sequoia National Park has a huge back story. Much of of my life, for a time, was influenced by what went on hundreds of miles away in the Sierra canyons. For years I was a technical rock climber, before that became a competition sport and the in thing to do. We used pitons, carabiners and ropes to climb granite cliffs. I never did make it to California to climb but we used Lost Arrow pitons by Black Diamond. The Lost Arrow is a granite needle in the Yosemite Valley. This isn't the Lost Arrow, but the shot reminded me of many of my earlier experiences. Technically, Lost Arrow is classified as a detached pillar."},
{"title": "Yosemite Falls", "date": "Monday, November 7, 2011", "text": "I resist taking the iconic photo, simply because it is iconic. But some photos just happen regardless of preconceived prejudices. The contrast here does not appear in the picture. This was taken from the middle of a bridge with about 1000 people swimming, floating in the river, jumping off of the bridge, and simply walking around. It is a classic example of what a picture does not show. I was wishing, at the time, that we had more time to explore Yosemite, but at the same time I was anxious to get in the car and get out of the congestion and crowds in the Valley. We also had to sit in our car and wait just to get a parking place to take this picture."},
{"title": "Goblin Valley", "date": "Sunday, November 6, 2011", "text": "Here is another panorama that you will need to click on to view properly. This is one of the strangest formations in the entire world. Goblin Valley lies in the middle of Utah's eastern desert. When I first visited Goblin Valley it was at the end of an obscure dirt road. Now the road is paved, it is a Utah State Park and has a campground with showers. It is still strange."},
{"title": "Sierra Panorama -- King's Canyon", "date": "Saturday, November 5, 2011", "text": "This is one picture you will have to click on to see. Panoramas don't view so well in thumbnail views. There was a forest fire burning down-wind of the canyon. The haze is the smoke from the fire. We had to drive on a dirt road for a few miles and then hike up the side of a hill to get to this view. It was worth it. King's Canyon is between Sequoia National Park and Yosemite. Actually, the National Park is King's Canyon/Sequoia National Park."},
{"title": "The power of water", "date": "Friday, November 4, 2011", "text": "Water holds a power and a fascination for anyone who has lived most of their life in the desert. This is the classic view of the power of water to compel your view. We all know that pure water is a colorless liquid, but we know equally as well that lakes and the ocean sometimes appear blue or green. Here the water is a bright green color. But it is pure and not tainted by anything making the water green. It is the light in the water.Although sweeping vistas of mountains and canyons have their attraction, there are always overwhelmingly beautiful spots that capture you attention but are limited to one tree or one plant. One of my regrets is that I cannot be someplace every day of the year to see the succession of beauty that occurs. I am certain that if I lived in the mountains, I would find a new surprise every day of the year. Here is the Western Azalea (Rhododenron occidentale) growing beneath the canopy of the giant Sequoia forest in the Western Sierra Nevada."},
{"title": "Into the depths, the shadow of night falls...", "date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2011", "text": "What can you see? In broad daylight you would never be able to see the depths of the Canyon, not because they are not there, but because you cannot see them when there is light. I don't mean that they aren't visible. What I mean is that you do not see the depths because there is too much light. You see other details in the cliffs and rocks and cannot see the huge abyss lying at your feet. Like life, you don't appreciate the light until you have seen the darkness."},
{"title": "The North Rim", "date": "Wednesday, November 2, 2011", "text": "The North Rim of the Grand Canyon is a totally different experience than that on the South Rim. You are a thousand feet higher and there are almost no crowds of people. You can drive for hundreds of miles on dirt roads to remote overlooks and never see another person. When there aren't any forest fires burning, the air is clear and the weather noticeably cooler. It also takes a good six to eight hours to drive from the South Rim at Canyon Village to get to the North Rim. This is a typical very warm sunny summer day at the North Rim. The mountains on the horizon are the San Francisco Peaks near Flagstaff, Arizona, about two hundred miles away by road and about 50 miles away by air, straight across the Canyon."},
{"title": "Dramatic light", "date": "Tuesday, November 1, 2011", "text": "If you review a lot of landscape photography, you will quickly learn that one factor is the use of dramatic light. Most of the memorable shots come in the early morning or late in the evening when the lower sun brings out more of the reds and yellows. Midday sun usually results in harsh shadows and flat colors. Time constraints create windows of opportunity, but you need to be up early and stay late to get the best shots. As I walk along, where ever I happen to be, I automatically frame pictures in my mind. That is not to say that some of my pictures do not benefit from cropping, but I try to choose a well composed subject matter initially. Let the light draw your eye into the photo. See what is really there, not what you initially think is there."},
{"title": "The end of the day", "date": "Monday, October 31, 2011", "text": "How many pictures have you seen of the Grand Canyon at night? There are a few, but mostly the work of taking pictures ends with the light. This picture shows how the Canyon is like a mountain in reverse. I am standing in the light, looking down into where night has already started. Instead of looking at a mountain where you are standing in the shadow looking at the last touches of sunlight on the peaks. Here, at the Canyon, the peaks reach only to the absolutely flat level of the Plateau. Goodnight to another good day."},
{"title": "Death and the Grand Canyon 2011", "date": "Sunday, October 30, 2011", "text": "In the summer, temperatures can get to well over 100 degrees on most of the Grand Canyon Trails. The combination of heat and extreme altitude changes can quickly overcome even experienced desert hikers. 2011 has not been an exception for fatalities in the Canyon. In September the body of a man was recovered from Tanner Beach (yes, there is a connection) and the cause of death was ruled as hyperthermia and dehydration due to environmental exposure. Of course, the great number of people that travel to the Grand Canyon National Park has something to do with the consistent number of people that die at, in or near to the Canyon. Some, like the man who died at the North Rim's Cape Royal Trailhead, die from natural causes which means they think he would have died even if he were not at the Grand Canyon. But others die as a result of being involved with the Grand Canyon, like the woman who died in February, 2011 just below the South Rim. Earlier in the year, a kayaker died in the President Harding rapid. Some of the people who disappear into the Canyon are never recovered, like the missing plane in March of 2011. Some of the dead bodies are not recovered for days because of the inaccessible nature of the terrain. The body of a young man, who died from a fall, was discovered on April 25, 2011 but not recovered until May 6th, because of the inaccessible nature of the terrain, and extensive planning and twenty-five personnel were needed to recover the body which was located almost 700 feet below the rim. Another body was recovered in August, 2011 below the Lookout Studio. The deaths are always a tragedy, but the Canyon claims many more injuries than deaths. Even driving into the Canyon can be dangerous. Eight people were injured in a three car accident at the South Entrance Road in July, 2011. Three people died in an RV fire at the South Entrance in October, 2011 but the Park Service ruled that it was likely a murder/suicide. Two hikers were injured in a rock fall incident on the South Kaibab Trail in March, 2011.Considering the millions of visitors to the Park every year, it is not surprising that there are injuries and some deaths. The tragedy behind the tragedy of the loss is that some of these deaths were due to disregarding some simple rules of travel in the desert. Others, could think about the exposure to falls that comes from high cliffs. Once, in talking to the backcountry Ranger at the Park, he mentioned that they pull more than one distressed hiker from the Canyon every day by helicopter. This is not your backyard, this is the Grand Canyon."},
{"title": "Form over substance", "date": "Saturday, October 29, 2011", "text": "Here is the form. The trees. What is the substance? It is called negative space. There is really a lot of detail in this photograph, much more than you can see at a glance, but the real world of photo lies in what is not there, the spaces created by the branches of the trees. Surprisingly, I see butterflies and praying mantises in the spaces, but no faces. Usually, I see faces. Would you take this photograph? Suppose you were walking along and saw these trees, the grass and sky. Would you have taken the photo? The more I look at it, the happier I am with the photo as it is."},
{"title": "Icon of the desert", "date": "Friday, October 28, 2011", "text": "There is nothing so universally associated with the desert Southwest than the saguaro cactus. Here is a clip art design of the cactus for comparison with the real live cactus:http://webclipart.about.com/library/clip12/blcacti1.htmNow, what is the reality? Saguaro cactus or Carnegiea gigantea are only native to a small portion of the desert Southwest. They are generally confined by temperature zone to those areas of the state below 4000 feet and then only to areas where there is enough rainfall. For example, there are very few saguaro cactus in southern Arizona especially near Yuma in the southwest corner of the state. The cactus are also found in the Mexican state of Sonora, in a very small part of Mexican state of Baja California Norte, and in an extremely small area in the extreme east of California along the Colorado River. I promise, this is the last of the bug pictures. I guess with bugs, if they left me alone, I would leave them alone. I only get into conflict with them when they invade my space in a way that I can't continue to ignore them. Like grasshoppers for example, they are just fine living their lives out in the fields, but when they decided to invade in huge numbers they become more than a minor nuisance. I remember being in Yuma, Arizona one day when their were drifts of grasshoppers against the walls of the buildings. Every once in a while we get a huge number here in Mesa also."},
{"title": "Ladybug, Ladybug, fly away home", "date": "Thursday, October 27, 2011", "text": "One of my favorite bugs from my childhood was the cute little spotted ladybug or ladybeetle. You can catch the essence of this small creature in this rather larger sculpture. I think if the ladybugs had been as large as this sculpture, they would not have been quite so romantically popular. Ladybugs are sold in bulk in a state of semi-hibernation to eat garden pests. I have come across huge swarms of ladybugs on the Mogollon Rim that covered an entire tree. If one becomes trapped in my house or ventures into my car, I will always carefully remove it to the outside. This and the other bug sculptures are in the 2011 exhibit at the Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix, Arizona."},
{"title": "Look out for the ants", "date": "Wednesday, October 26, 2011", "text": "During the saguaro cactus migration, the weaker of the herd are picked off by the ants. Since this spectacle would be bad for tourism, the local tourists bureaus long ago agreed to keep this problem under the hat, so to speak. Fortunately, as I was taking this picture of one of the herd leaders, I caught an ant in background. So, here you have proof positive of the dangers of the annual saguaro migration. Since temperatures are predicted in the low 90s and perhaps as low as 80 degrees, the saguaro have already begun their annual migration. I am sorry I really don't have time with all my blogging to follow the migration any further. Maybe again next year?Isn't there a conceptual conflict in this sculpture? A butterfly made out of wood? A butterfly is a concept as well as the reality of a flying insect. So what is the essence of a butterfly? Light, color, random flight, short life, all of these and more. Does the sculpture capture any of those concepts? The answer is not simple. The sculpture emphasizes the \"form\" of a butterfly, not its essence. Isn't this sculpture more a commentary on our societal perceptions today than it is an attempt to capture the essence of a butterfly? Do you think the sculptor thought about any of this? Or is this just my projection of impressions?"},

You need to spend some time walking in a cactus garden or out in the desert Southwest. You will learn what self reliance means. It means that now matter how bad the conditions or how poor the spot where you are living, you always have control over your own life and your own attitude. Look to the cactus for inspiration. They thrive in conditions where most plants would die."},

They migrate into California and Mexico at two relatively small sites, where the entire population spends the Winter. If anything were to occur to either of those two sites, huge populations of Monarch butterflies would be wiped out. The Passenger Pigeons were killed when they nested for the night. At the moment, Monarchs are not in danger of extinction, but there is always that possibility."},

Do you really see the world around you? Seeing involves more than having your eyes open. It also means having your brain open and thinking about your surroundings. As William Blake said, To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower, Hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour."},

Every time I go out into the mountains or desert, no matter what time of year, I find exquisitely beautiful details in the trees, rocks, sand, plants, and animals. The most barren spot of rocky hillside has its hidden beauty. There is almost no spot on the earth where I cannot see beauty if I look for a few minutes. To borrow from often quoted Navajo poetry,In beauty, may I walk.All day long, may I walk.Through the returning seasons, may I walk.Beautifully I will possess again.Beautifully birds…Beautifully joyful birds…On the trail marked with pollen, may I walk.With grasshoppers about my feet, may I walk.With dew about my feet, may I walk.With beauty, may I walk.With beauty before me, may I walk.With beauty behind me, may I walk.With beauty above me, may I walk.With beauty all around me, may I walk.In old age, wandering on a trail of beauty,lively, may I walk.In old age, wandering on a trail of beauty,living again, may I walk.It is finished in beauty.It is finished in beauty."},

Without a soul, nature would be nothing more or less than set of instructions. With a soul, nature cannot be understood even if reduced to mathematics.

You have to click on the above image to see the caterpillars, but you can see the webs scattered in bushes and trees across the entire continental U.S. When they migrate, caterpillars may be seen by the thousands traveling overroads, streets, driveways, and sidewalks. Unlike spiders, tent caterpillars do not use their webs to catch food, they eat leaves, but for protection. The caterpillars return to the web nest each evening and leave again in the warmth of the day to forage for food. They have a very high yuck factor."},

This one seems to catch a lot more than just food, but apparently, this spider is quite healthy. We often admire things in nature simply because they are visually appealing forgetting the blue collar workers of the animal and plant world just as we ignore them in our own day to day world. Perhaps we all need to become more aware of the beauty of just doing our jobs in a way to provide for ourselves and where appropriate our family."},

But driving into and being in the Valley at the time of year of the photograph, is like the mall the day after Thanksgiving. There is almost no parking and most of the scenic points of view are so congested that you can hardly avoid stepping on the people. The contrast between the quiet and solitude of Sequoia National Park just a few hours away and the crowded roads and trails in Yosemite is dramatic. I had to wait a number of times for the crowds in Yosemite, just to take a picture. We went out to the Mariposa Grove and left without seeing anything because of the crowds. Maybe I will go back, but if I do, it will definitely be when the weather is very bad and windy and cold."},
{"title": "Reality or Perception?", "date": "Friday, October 14, 2011", "text": "This is a photo of the base of a juniper tree with a light dusting of snow. The question is, what did I see? Was this the lighting condition at the time? Is the photo \"accurate\" in that it reproduces my experience? What would I do to adjust the photo to more accurately reflect the time and place? For some purposes, the photo is fine as it is. But the real question is not what the conditions were at the time I took the picture, but what do I want this picture to become? Here is a first pass at adjusting the white balance.The top photo is dominated by a blue cast. The bottom photo adjusted for the cloudy conditions of the day, gives a richer, reddish hue, that is more faithful to my idealized image of a juniper tree. Are there any other adjustments that can be made? Of course. I could do quite a bit with the exposure, recovery, fill light, blacks, brightness, contrast, clarity, vibrance and saturation. Perhaps you are getting the idea that adjusting a photo is truly like painting with light. Here is a second try at adjusting the image using some of the tools:You can begin to see my internal concept of the tree. Which one did I see when I was standing in the snow storm? I saw the potential of a picture, not the actual picture. I liked the composition but it could be made a little tighter. Here is another try, this time with some cropping to take out a bit of the extraneous.What do you think? Am I \"done\" with adjustments? I think the final picture is just fine, thank you. But just in case, I have actually done any adjustments to the \"original\" and could go back and start over again with the same picture."},

Do you see what the camera sees? Is the picture accurate? Are the colors faithful to the scene as you would see it with your own eyes? Without a reference point, the picture can appear well done and very nice. Here are a few changes made with Adobe Camera Raw. The white balance was changed from default to cloudy. The exposure was reduced a little to add some drama to the picture. The recovery mode was moved almost to the maximum and there was some clarity, contrast and vibrancy added. Which of two pictures looks more like what you see if you were standing on the Rim? Now comes the question, which of these is closer to reality? Does that matter? When I take the picture I am not thinking about recording what is visible to me at the time, but what can become visible through my vision of the photograph as it can become rather than what it is. Believe me, they really are the same picture. Do you see why I like to go to the Canyon when there is a storm brewing?"},

No sunsets, no saguaro, no canyons, no blue sky, no mountains, no cliffs, no waterfalls, no slot canyons, no colorful Autumn leaves, nothing that would identify this as Arizona except to me. This is my Arizona. The Arizona of shapes and shades and colors and textures and details and light and shadow and more detail. When will you start to see Arizona? Probably, when you start to walk."},

Either he is losing his touch or there is something there I am not seeing. The answer is yes, you are not seeing what I am seeing. This anything but a simple photograph. If you could see it full screen like I can, you would start to see some amazing details. It is sort-of like a where's Waldo picture with hidden details that only become visible as you stare at the image. Although it appears flat, the image is really very three dimensional. There are a lot of things that you can just barely see in the background. It is also interesting how the colors blend but retain their individual nature. It is anything but a simple picture.This is a prickly pear cactus (opuntia) growing high in the White Mountains of Arizona above 8000 feet. We often associate cactus with the desert and hot temperatures, but prickly pears grow north into areas where the Winter temperatures drop to 20 degrees below zero or lower. How does a plant that is mostly water survive the low temperatures every year, year after year? If you want the technical reasons you can read, Water Relations and Low-Temperature Acclimation for Cactus Species Varying in Freezing Tolerance from Guillermo Goldstein and Park S. Nobel of the Department of Biology and Laboratory of Biomedical and Environmental Sciences, University of California, Los Angeles, California. This is one of those topics that seem to be difficult for scientists to handle. You have a problem that seems obviously impossible, a plant that is mostly water that doesn't die when it is subjected to extreme freezing temperatures. So, the scientists dismiss the problem for years until someone points out the obvious, that this cactus is growing in an area where the temperatures are well below freezing. How old is this cactus? How long to do they live? All of these questions seem like they are begging for answers. Don't you think that if you want to better understand what you think is normal, you start with what seems impossible?"},

The photo was saved as a Camera Raw image which preserves all of the information from the digital sensor but is similar to having an undeveloped film image.The sky could have been better, but it was snowing at the time. Here is what the photo looks like after a little work in Adobe's Camera Raw: Whether you like the first or second image better might be a matter or taste, but the second image is more of my vision of what the Canyon should look like. By the way, once you use Photoshop for a while, you will never trust the fidelity of an \"original\" photograph again. Both grass and lichens are tenacious. This desert rock pile would not seem a very inviting place to grow, but both have thrived. The lichen are barely visible as green patches on the rocks. Lichen is a combination of three plants, a fungus and either a green alga or a cyanobacterium. Lichens are poikilohydric, meaning they can survive on extremely low levels of water content. The grass grows in the spring when the temperature is warm enough and there is still adequate water from the Winter storms. By late Spring, the grass has dried and appears dead, but it will send up new green shoots the following year."},
{"title": "Desert pavement", "date": "Friday, October 7, 2011", "text": "This picture shows something that is called desert pavement. When conditions are right, the ground has lots of little pebbles and as the wind and water transport away the smaller particles, only those pebbles of a certain size and larger remain. This type of covering can stretch for miles or only exist in small patches depending on the weather, the terrain and the soil conditions. The color comes from mineral dissolved in the water on the ground that slowly coats the pebbles with a combination of iron oxide, manganese and other minerals. If you pick up a rock it will be a much lighter color on the bottom than on the side exposed to the elements."},

We used to call them cedar trees or mistakenly, salt cedars, when I was younger, but I long ago learned of the virtues of these hardy plants that grow where nothing else can live. Junipers are so common that they go unnoticed. Cattlemen in Arizona considered them to be weeds and spent huge sums of money running large Caterpillar tractors across the desert dragging a huge chain to knock them all down. The wood lasts so long that even though that practice was discontinued years and years ago, because it did not have the desired effect of increasing cattle yields, the dead trees are still there spread out for miles in the desert highlands. But like the forces of nature, juniper trees continue to grow and spread in areas whenever the rainfall increases slightly enough to support them. Oh, did I mention the smell of the wood and the bark? That smell becomes part of you and you then become part of the desert."},

Would the forest exist without fire? The controversy is not over the management of the forest, but over the management of ourselves and our understanding of how the forest grows and dies. The forest could get along very well without us to manage it. But when we alter the built in management system, as we most certainly do, then we do need to take steps to stop the forests' further destruction."},

How much of what we see is Photoshop and how much is reality? I can say one thing with certainty. The camera can never capture the full spectrum of the experience of seeing these places in person. I have noticed that my own eyes, right to left, see color differently. If I look out of one eye at a time and then switch eyes, not only do I get a change in perspective, I also get a marked change in color. So what is the real color of the scene? If you were standing in Antelope Canyon and taking this picture, would you see what is represented above? No. The camera does not record the same light/shadow/color combination that you would see in your eyes. Part of being a photographer is to recognize the potential of the scene and begin to see what can result from taking the picture, not what is there before your eyes."},

Part of my understanding of their motivation comes from speaking Spanish since I was a teenager. I first learned Spanish in Argentina and then later in Panama and since I graduated from the university with a degree in Spanish, I have background in Spanish literature.

One side note, the presence of limestone/marble in the Canyon invites speculation as to the presence of caves and yes, there are caves in these mountains. Just to the south, lies Timpanogos Cave National Monument. Just to the north, is Neff's Cave, which was once considered the deepest cave in North America.

{"title": "An Underground City in the Grand Canyon?", "date": "Friday, September 2, 2011", "text": "I am always amazed to find yet another huge mystery associated with the Grand Canyon or Arizona, for that matter, that I hadn't heard of previously. This time the story seems to originate from a front page story in the Phoenix Gazette of April 5, 1909 entitled \"EXPLORATIONS IN GRAND CANYON Mysteries of Immense Rich Cavern being brought to light Jordan is enthused Remarkable finds indicate ancient people migrated from Orient.\" There are dozens of online articles and blog posts about the rumored underground city. Although the article attributes the whole investigation to the Smithsonian Institute, which organization denies any involvement.Here is a quote from the Gazette article so you can get the flavor of the story:Under the direction of Prof. S. A. Jordan, the Smithsonian Institute is now prosecuting the most thorough explorations, which will be continued until the last link in the chain is forged. Nearly a mile underground, about 1480 feet below the surface, the long main passage has been delved into, to find another mammoth chamber from which radiates scores of passageways, like the spokes of a wheel. Several hundred rooms have been discovered, reached by passageways running from the main passage, one of them having been explored for 854 feet and another 634 feet. The recent finds include articles which have never been known as native to this country, and doubtless they had their origin in the orient. War weapons, copper instruments, sharp-edged and hard as steel, indicate the high state of civilization reached by these strange people. So interested have the scientists become that preparations are being made to equip the camp for extensive studies, and the force will be increased to thirty or forty persons. I am afraid that I am becoming more and more skeptical about reports of coverups and strange phenomena. The Grand Canyon is large (understatement) but it has been crawled over by hundreds of hikers, surveyors, mappers, prospectors and assorted other people for over 150 years and it would be more than remarkable if something of this magnitude had simply disappeared or covered up for all these years. As a genealogist, I picked up on the claim that the explorer, G.E. Kincaid, was supposed to be the first white child born in Idaho. If that were the case, he would have been well over 70 years old, because the first white child born in the area that is now the State of Idaho was born in 1838. See what you think.

One of our favorite things to do is say something like, \"I wonder what John Muir would have thought of this desert...\" He was Scottish and you would probably not find anyone who is a greater contrast to your average environmentalist than Muir. He loved the outdoors and his concern for the \"environment\" came from love. He had no discernible selfish motivation to protect the wilderness, he just didn't like to see beautiful things die. He said, \"God  has cared for these trees, saved them from drought, disease,  avalanches, and a thousand tempests and floods.  But he cannot save them  from fools.\" We went to Sequoia National Park, where we, as a nation, are trying to save these wonders of all wonders from fools.

One time I was driving at about 65 mph on the Plateau and saw a cactus flower.

If you try to transplant a cactus from one country to another, they do need approximately the same conditions they had originally. So they do have limited adaptability.

If you look at the full-size image, you can see the fire burn on the mountains in the background all the way around the horizon. However, a picture taken before the fire would not be much different in superficial appearance. I have a couple of 360 degree panoramas that will be published on 360Cities and Google Earth that will show the burn more graphically. The worst part of the destruction is yet to come.

Located on the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation, it is about an hour from Show Low. It is supposed to be the coldest spot in Arizona. The lowest temperature in Arizona, -40°, was recorded on January 7, 1971 at Hawley Lake. It wasn't very cold the day we went there, it was about 80 degrees. Arizona is certainly full of contrasts. The forest around Hawley Lake is some of the wettest part of the state also with ferns and lots of green.

The colored ribbon on the tree was used by the fire fighters to mark various locations or to mark the way to turn on a road. The brown trees had branches close to the ground and therefore the fire and got burned and killed. Once the fire got to this part of the forest, it was easier to stop because of the lack of fuel. In many places where the fire fighters claim \"containment\" what they really mean is the fire has run out of fuel. Many years ago, it was common to burn the ditches to clear them of weeds every spring while the plants were still brown from Winter, but they always grew back in the summer. It is unlikely that in this type of burnt area, that the fire has killed the grass."},

In the foreground, you can see how the fire moves in a chaotic fashion, some of the trees are burned and dying, others are not touched at all. The rule of thumb is that in a severe burn, about 1/3 of the trees will burn completely, 1/3 scorched like those in this picture and 1/3 untouched. From the news accounts, you would get the impression that the whole fire was like the hillside, this is not the case. Some of the trees will survive."},

In most of this area, there was little or no ground cover, so the fire only occasionally got into the tops of the trees. The trees with the brown needles are scorched and going to die. You can barely see where the fire came over the hill in the background. The fire burn looks like a line of brown trees. There are areas where the trees are completely destroyed, but not in this area. The ground cover will recover with the rains although the sagebrush takes years to grow very large. The road in the foreground is likely where the firefighters stopped the fire."},

I guess they think someone who lives here or is visiting might walk outside and forget it was hot. Every year lots of people die in Phoenix and in the southern deserts due to the heat.

Although, there were times that the water did not reach much past Mesa even in the early days, before the dams. Today, this sight of the river flowing is rare and there are no trees on the banks. In fact, the river has cut a considerably lower channel than existed in the early days.

The structure also allows the cactus to expand and contract depending on the supply of water available. All saguaros are protected by law. We planted a small 6 inch saguaro about 25 years ago. At that time, the plant was probably about 5 years old. When we moved, we took all of our cactus with us and transplanted them in our new home. Some of them died, but the saguaro thrived and is now about five feet tall. We are still waiting to see it flower.

The Salt River Valley grew into the location of a major metropolitan area only through the storage of water in huge reservoirs along the Salt River. The largest of these reservoirs is Roosevelt Lake, located at the junction of the Salt River and Tonto Creek. Roosevelt Lake was once the largest man-made lake in the world and still ranks among the largest. When it is full the lake covers 17,000 acres. Natural barriers, such as the Salt River and its canyons have always restricted travel across Arizona. When the original Roosevelt Dam was built, the only road east and west across the Tonto Valley had to go across the top of the dam. The Lake is located in Gila County and the lake and river effectively cut the county in half. Residents of Payson who wished to travel to the county seat had a two to three hour drive across the dam. Road improvements have come dramatically and the travel time is now much less partially due to the construction of this beautiful bridge bypassing the old road across the top of the dam."},

This is especially true of comment to news articles, on talk radio and responses to blog posts. In a long ago post, I made the observation that it was unwise to try to survive in the desert by using barrel cactus for a water source. A commentator to my post, obviously much more experienced in his young life than I, expressed disdain that I did not endorse barrel cactus as a source for water. Having tried they personally, I was not writing from lack of experience. However, as is the rule, the commentator, because he disagreed with my post, immediately took the position that I was ignorant of the subject. His attack was not supported by any facts or authority other than his opinion. Somehow, he is entitled to his opinion, but I am not entitled to have one because (a) I can't write and (b) I am stupid.Of course, he never got to my main objection to using cactus indiscriminately, that it damages the cactus and may kill a cactus hundreds of years old. This self-identified survivalist had no remorse about killing off cactus to illustrate his ability to \"survive\" out in the desert.

Wind, rain, summer heat, winter cold all take their toll on the walls of the San Xavier del Bac Mission. But unlike many other structures that have long passed into oblivion, San Xavier del Bac is renewed through constant renovation. To give you an idea of the passage of time, here is a photo by C.R. Savage from the late 1800s:The photo is in the form of a stereoscopic view and comes from the New York Public Library, Stephen A. Schwarzman Building / Photography Collection, Miriam and Ira D. Wallach Division of Art, Prints and Photograph. If you click on the old photo, you can that even in the 1800s the buildings were old and in need of repair. The building has survived two earthquakes and thirty years of abandonment during the 19th Century. The restoration efforts make for interesting reading. See Conservation at Mission San Xavier del Bac by Jason L. Metcalfe. Here is a quote summarizing the efforts to preserve the building taken in 1989:In 1984, a whitewash of portland cement was applied to the exterior walls and a coat of white elastomeric emulsion paint was applied to the entire roof to seal it. The paint was supposed to be impervious to water; it worked for awhile, however, with the intense southern-Arizona heat and sunlight, the acrylic eventually deteriorated. The paint film shrunk, developing small fissures which allowed rainwater to penetrate, trapping the moisture under its surface. In 1988, when Robert Vint (the architect in charge of the exterior conservation) examined the roof vaults, he \"peeled up\" a small section of the impermeable roof emulsion to reveal thriving mold growth in the dark, damp, and warm environment beneath.  In 1989, to remedy the situation, Vint had the acrylic emulsion and layers of cement removed. Once the original masonry was exposed, he employed a traditional technique learned from his mentor, Mexican architect Jorge Olvera. Two layers of lime and sand plaster (free of soluble salts), bound by mucilage extracted from the nopal or prickly pear cactus, was applied as a \"breathing\" protective coating. The mucilage was prepared by boiling pads of prickly pear cactus in large kettles and mashing them to obtain the gooey extract used to mix with the mortar. The mortar was also applied to the exterior surfaces of the mission, which were then burnished with smooth river cobbles (also a traditional technique) to compact the surface and reduce the rate of water absorption.3. In addition to the burnishing, a hydrophobic material (aluminum stearate) was added to increase the water repellence. There are problems, however, with the use of a hydrophobe on top of a plaster. Cracks that develop in the plaster as a result of thermal movement become drainage channels when the hydrophobe and gravity convey water across the damaged areas. Consequently, the use of a hydrophobe has been discontinued in the current repairs. Notwithstanding, it is now felt that, overall, the traditional method is best for the long- term benefit and structural integrity of the mission. The lime and sand combination is most compatible with the original brick; however, the finish will need frequent reburnishing and whitewashing: the key to protecting a traditional preservation system for clay bricks is maintenance."},

Substantial trees are virtually non-existent and clay is everywhere. But Adobes alone will melt in a rain, so they are usually covered with a film of cement. The San Xavier del Bac church was constructed entirely of adobe and is known as one of the finest Spanish Colonial Churches in the United States. Adobe is traditionally sun dried sand, gravel, clay, water, and often, straw or grass mixed by hand and formed in wooden molds. In adobe buildings, the building material is held together by its own weight. The walls, like this gate structure, were built with the adobe bricks and mud mortar.Adobe walls have low structural strength and tend to be massive and seldom over 2 stories.

{"title": "A look inside -- San Xavier del Bac", "date": "Friday, April 22, 2011", "text": "Different cultures and different religions have contrasting values and modes of worship. Catholic churches are built in a traditional pattern that has existed for over a thousand years. San Xavier del Bac was constructed on the common cruciform groundplan with an atrium (courtyard), narthex (vestibule), central nave with aisles, a bema for the clergy extending into a transept, and an exedra or semi-circular apse. At each side of the bema, at the transept there are two chapels at either end. Wikipedia. The Church faces south so this is the East Chapel with a representation of the Virgin Mary. In the Roman Catholic Church, candles are placed before a statue of Jesus or of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Often, in older or traditional churches, this will be before a side  altar. Candles used may vary from long, taper-type candles to tealight candles. Tealight  candles are either placed in holders or just on a platform in front of  the statue. Long candles may be placed in a special holder. Candles are lit for prayer intentions. To \"light a candle for someone\"  indicates one's intention to say a prayer for another person, and the  candle symbolizes that prayer. A donation box intended to defer candle  costs generally accompanies votive candles. In some churches, the  donation is considered a mandatory contribution in exchange for lighting  a candle. Wikipedia. A visit to San Xavier del Bac is not only a visit to a historic building, but also a visit to a living, operating Catholic Church."},
{"title": "Eusebio Francisco Kino and the Mission San Xavier del Bac", "date": "Thursday, April 21, 2011", "text": "The earliest Europeans came to what is now called Arizona in about 1528. To get a little perspective, that was 79 years before the settlement of the Jamestown Island in the Virginia Colony in 1607. The first European was probably Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, who traveled by foot from the vicinity of modern day Florida all across the southern part of the continent, ending up in Mexico City. He was followed by Fry Marcos de Niza and later by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado. However, the real exploration and settlement of the area began with the efforts of Eusebio Francisco Kino born Eusebio Francesco Chini in what is now Italy on August 10, 1645. Most of these names are very familiar to those of us who have lived in Arizona for a long time because they have been used to name the grade schools, middle schools and high schools around Mesa and Phoenix. But there are very few who know anything about this early history.Arizona is currently undergoing a huge controversy about \"illegal aliens.\" But to put some things in perspective, what is now called Arizona has had native born Spanish speaking residents since 200 years before there ever was a United States of America.Here is a short summary of some of Padre Kino's accomplishments from Wikipedia:A widely known fact about Kino now is that he fought hard for the rights  of the various indigenous Sonoran tribes and their individual members.  His conviction for his fight came from his humanitarian values and were proscribed by the Spanish Crown in the Laws of the Indies (Leyes de Indias). He opposed the slavery and compulsory hard labor in the silver mines  that the Spaniards forced on native people. This also caused great  controversy among his co-missionaries, many of whom acted according to  the laws imposed by Spain on their territory. Father Kino was also a writer, authoring books on religion, astronomy and maps. He built missions extending from present day states of Mexican Sonora - northeast for 150 miles (240 km) - into U.S. Arizona. There the Mission San Xavier del Bac near Tucson, a popular National Historic Landmark, is still functioning as a Franciscan  Catholic parish church. He constructed nineteen rancherías (villages),  which supplied cattle to new settlements. He was also instrumental in  the return of the Jesuits to Baja California in 1697."},
{"title": "San Xavier del Bac", "date": "Tuesday, April 19, 2011", "text": "The Mission San Xavier del Bac was founded in 1692 by Eusebio Francisco Kino. The original mission was destroyed in 1770 but was constructed from 1783 to 1797. In 1822, it fell under the jurisdiction of the newly independent Mexican government and the Catholic Diocese of Sonora.  In 1828, the Mexican government banned all Spanish-born priests and the  priest serving at San Xavier was sent home to Spain; San Xavier was  left vacant. From 1828-1858, the vacant church began to decay and local  Indians, concerned about their church, started preserving what they  could. In 1853, the church was brought under U.S. jurisdiction when the  surrounding territory was bought in the Gadsen Purchase.  The vacant and decaying church was re-opened, in 1859, when the  U.S.-based Santa Fe Diocese added Arizona to its jurisdiction. The  Bishop for the Santa Fe Diocese ordered repairs to be made with Diocese  money and a priest was assigned to serve at San Xavier. Wikipedia. I have visited the Church a number of times, but this is first time I have spent taking photographs. During the next few Blog posts, I will share the photos of both the exterior and interior of the Church and its surroundings.

From Wikipedia, \"A cirque (French for \"circus\") or corrie (from Scottish Gaelic coire meaning a \"kettle\") is an amphitheatre-like valley head, formed at the head of a valley glacier by erosion.  The concave amphitheatre shape is open on the downhill side  corresponding to the flatter area of the stage, while the cupped seating  section is generally steep cliff-like slopes down which ice and  glaciated debris combine and converge from the three or more higher  sides. The floor of the cirque ends up bowl shaped as it is the complex  convergence zone of combining ice flows from multiple directions and  their accompanying rock burdens, hence experiences somewhat greater  erosion forces, and is most often scooped out somewhat below the level  of cirque's low-side outlet (stage) and its down slope (backstage)  valley. If the cirque is subject to seasonal melting, the floor of the  cirque most often forms a tarn (small lake) behind the Moraine and glacial till damming the outlet.This particular area is really a series of cirques called Albion Basin. Interestingly, the word \"albion\" is the oldest known name of the island of Great Britain."},

It is ice that is at an intermediate stage between snow  and glacial ice. Firn has the appearance of wet sugar, but has a  hardness that makes it extremely resistant to shovelling. Its density  generally ranges from 550 kg/m³-830 kg/m³ and can be often found  underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a glacier.

You may be surprised to learn that diamond-backed rattlesnakes are not purple. According to the Pima County Public Library, most people who are bitten by rattlesnakes are in Pima County. Rattlesnakes seem to bite more commonly around Labor Day, probably for the same reason that the most commonly bitten individuals are drunk males with tattoos. Usually, the number of people bitten in the state runs around 180 to 200 each year. From 2002 to 2006, there were 1,912 rattlesnake bites and only four fatalities.According to the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum, rattlesnakes are among the most highly specialized organisms on the planet. Quoting from their website, \"Their venom — in fact a toxic saliva — is among the most complex  substances known: a mixture of enzymes unique to pit vipers that  destroys blood or paralyzes nerves. And the delivery system is equally  amazing — the snakes' fangs are movable hypodermic syringes.  Rattlesnakes are also among the few animal groups with dual visual  systems. In addition to their eyes, they have sensory organs in their  upper jaws which can actually “see” infrared images. They can detect the  heat from a candle flame 30 feet (9 m) away. These animals merit  admiration more than fear.\"I have seen hundreds of rattlesnakes over the years.

All of its nutrients are derived from its substrate, usually some form of rock. Lichen can live on very low levels of water and often grow where nothing else will survive.There is a saying that all things come to those who wait.

For years and years we have had two huge quartz rocks in our front yard. They don't have any gold, but they remind me of the possibility. You may not have associated North Carolina with gold, but in 1799 Conrad Reed found a 17 pound gold nugget in Little Meadow Creek. For years the family did not know what they had and used the rock for a doorstop. Once the family realized what they had, they established the nation's first gold mine, the Reed Gold Mine, now a national historic landmark, is located in Midland, North Carolina.

Although the facilities at the both sites would be considered limited, the Navajo guides are extremely friendly and helpful.By the way, it is very difficult to get good pictures because it is so dark in the canyons, even during days with bright sunshine.

Frank Lloyd Wright attempted to promote a harmony between human habitation the the natural world so that a building, its furnishings and surroundings became a part of a unified, interrelated whole. He got it backward.  Human habitation can never be in harmony with the natural world. Because the natural world is in a constant state of dynamic change. Human construction resists change, while the natural world changes with each passing day of light and dark, rain and snow, wind and storm. The natural world is always dangerous.

This was one of our favorite places to climb for two reasons, there was a turn-out parking area along the road and granite was stable. This location is just up the Canyon from the famous FamilySearch Granite Vault. By today's standards our climbing equipment would be considered objectionable. It is now the standard to use non-destructive climbing aids, but at the time pitons were the state of the art. We would climb up until it got time to turn around and then we would rappel down, load up the gear and drive down the canyon to home.I was never part of the \"climbing community\" since we did not drink or party, but we probably pioneered many of the common routes known to climbers today.

The White Mountains give the impression of a gently rolling landscape alternating between dense pine and fir forests and open grasslands. Dotting the area are several lakes, some of reasonably large size. Almost all of these \"lakes\" are really catchment basins or reservoirs. Big Lake is the largest and best known of the lakes. It is located in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest about 30 miles south of Springerville/Eager. It is also about an hour's drive from Pinetop/Lakeside. Big Lake is situated at an altitude of over 9000 feet and so the summers are short and cool and the winters are long and very cold. The lake freezes over, usually by November.If you like to fish, of which I am not overly fond, it is one of the best trout fishing lakes in Arizona. It is one of the nicest places to camp in the state with very nice campgrounds by Arizona standards that include showers and running water.

However, other sources put the elevation somewhat lower at 12,637 feet. Humphrey's Peak is one of several high peaks that surround a huge volcanic caldera. The peaks form a ridge semi-circling the caldera. The trail reaches the ridge well below the summit and the trail follows the  ridge line for a mile or so. As you climb along the ridge, you see several false summits before you finally walk far enough to see the final switchbacks up to the real one. Going down is definitely easier than climbing. The trail is supposed to be 4.7 miles, but you usually have to hike about two miles to the gate where the trail actually begins, so the round trip is closer to 12 miles than 9. Some claim that this is the \"best hike in Arizona.\" I wouldn't dispute that it is one of the best, but I would place several other hikes above this, including the North Kaibab Trail and the Bright Angel Trail."},

I remember distinctly having leaves fall off the pecan trees about Christmas time. In Arizona, the leaves turn when it gets cold, just like it does every place else, but in some years it never gets cold and  I guess they have to get together and vote on when to turn some sort of color and fall off the trees. Usually, the trees are budding out or flowering before the last of the leaves have fallen.Things change dramatically as you drive into higher elevations, on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon at over 9000 feet, the leave were not only turned by mid-October, but some trees were already bare. In less than a day, actually in a matter of a few hours, you can drive from late Fall back into summer heat of over 100 degrees. This dramatic contrast is what makes Arizona (and Utah and most of the other Western States) such an interesting place to live and visit.Ok, now I have an admission to make. The above photo was not taken in Arizona. It is really in Utah. I have seen colors like that in Arizona, but mostly the leaves on the Rim or further north are yellow Aspen trees."},

I love the progression of colors as the sun approaches the horizon and then disappears. As I have said many times before, bad weather makes good photographs. Unfortunately, good sunsets do not necessarily make good photographs. Usually, the scale of the color changes in the sky require a really wide angle lens. If you try to take a panoramic photo without an exceptionally wide angle lens, the light can change significantly by the time you take enough exposures to make a good panorama. Also, the color you get from either negative film or with the newer digital cameras is never quite like the original sunset.The standard sunset picture is a staple in almost any travel or landscape related publication. Most of my early attempts at sunset photography were a disaster. Since I did not take the photos with a tripod, they frequently were blurred and useless. The above picture is more recent. It was taken on the road from Fredonia, Arizona to Hurricane, Utah. Because of the heavy cloud cover, I was able to take a picture directly into the sun. Even so, the color in person was much more dramatic than that shown by the photo and you may have a number of other criticisms of the picture.  I took a series of sunset pictures just a short time ago and deleted almost all of them from my files. It is not easy to get a good picture."},

Here are only three examples. I am sure that there are very detailed scientific theories for how these rocks are formed, but I am also sure that I don't fully believe the theories. There is always a component of unreality in balanced rocks.  As you can probably guess, this part of northern Arizona is not seismically active. Part of the wonder is not that these rocks exist, but that there are relatively few of them compared to all of the rocks on the hillside.

We had 4 Horses on a waggon of 1,500 lb.  weight and for two rods we Could ownly gain from 4 inches to 24 with all  the power of the horses & two men rolling at the hind wheels and  going Down on the other side was still more Steep rocky and sandy which  would make it much worse than going up on the North side. The trip down  the backbone and across the river tested one's resolve to continue the  trip. As one weary traveler observed, If Mr. Lee had a backbone as bad  as that I surely pity him. It didn't seem possible for the horses to  pull the wagons up as the road was so sleep and the boulders so big, and  it was just as bad on the dugway on the other side. Everyone who ever  came over that piece of road had great cause for thankfulness they were  not killed.\"From the perspective of the above photo, the ridge seems to rise at a manageable angle. But is it hard to imagine that there was ever a way for vehicles to drive up the rugged, rocky top of the ridge.  When I visited Lee's Ferry in past years, I could never really figure out where the actual crossing was or where the pioneers went when the crossed the river. Finally, I spent the time to read the history and research the locations. The crossing is about a mile up the river from the boat dock and had I spent the time to walk, I would have found a number of National Park Service signs telling me about the various locations. The first time we went to the actual crossing site, it was about 110 degrees and it seemed like a very long hike. The second time the temperature was in the 70s and it was much more pleasant. However, there were millions of mosquitoes and other bugs. I don't know which was worse, the mosquitoes or the heat. It is a very difficult place to get good pictures due to the extreme contrast between the sun and shadows. There is no neutral setting for the camera that will show both. The picture above is taken from part way along to the river towards the ferry site, looking southwest."},

Traces of the old wagon road are clearly visible on the opposite side of the river, leading towards the slanted sandstone ridge, barely visible, in the middle of the picture, called Lee's Backbone. The water tower in the distance supplies some government offices, the boat launching platform area and Lonely Dell, the historic residence of the ferrymen and women. Lee's Ferry is presently more popularly known for three things, tours up the canyon, river raft trips down the canyon through the Grand Canyon and trout fishing. Just below the boat launch ramp, there is a small rapid, the first that boaters down the canyon confront on their whitewater rafting trips. Oh, and Lee's Ferry is the end of the trail for hikers all the way through the Pariah Canyon from White House in Utah, some 48 miles away by foot. We find it a convenient stopping place to camp on our way driving to Utah. It is pretty pricey for a campground when you also have to pay the entry fee into the Recreation Area, but with a Golden Age Passport, entry is free and the campground is half price.

The unusual color of the cliffs, even more intense than usual came about as a result of a forest fire on the Kaibab Plateau. The sun came up dark and red, barely showing through the smoke. The effect on the light was dramatic, giving the whole scene an unearthly quality. The picture is quite accurate as to how the cliffs looked from Lee's Ferry. The cliffs are a 3000 foot escarpment and are now a National Monument.  In 1969 Lake Powell was filling rapidly after the final construction of Glen Canyon Dam. We took a trip from Bull Frog Basin to the Escalante Canyon in canoes. One of the most remarkable things that occurred was a huge rock fall from the canyon wall. The first picture is just before the rock peeled away from the cliff. We noticed the rock because it looked like it was smoking. Small rocks were falling down behind the big slab as it moved slowly away from the cliff.We guessed what was happening and began to slowly drift away from the rock on down the lake. While we watched the rock fell off the cliff into the lake. Had the lake been more shallow, we would have been washed away, but because of the depth, the wave did not break and we were able to escape harm.Our friends had gone on down the lake and were about a mile away. To them it looked like the whole cliff came off and then we disappeared in the spray. They thought we were washed away. So did we. The spray went 3/4 of the way across the canyon, which was close to a mile wide at this point. It is hard to get  the perspective of the size of the fall from these small pictures, taken with a half frame film camera that had to be advanced between each shot. When the rock fell, I took this picture, stuffed the camera in a plastic bag, yelled to get out of there and put the bag in my teeth and started paddling like crazy.Here is the spot on the cliff where the rock was standing. No one would ever guess that a rock had fallen into the lake."},

Lee's Ferry is a small island of green in a huge ocean of sandstone and clay. As you view the rocks, you can only faintly imagine what the early pioneer settlers thought of the place as they precariously crossed the then untamed river. No one can visit a place like Lee's Ferry without being changed. It is not a neutral location. In the background, is the constant roar of the rapids just below the ferry site. You might compare it to the sound of a nearby freeway, but the sound never varies in intensity or volume.

Some patterns are obvious, like clouds in the sky, but others are more subtle, like the sand bar above. I find it interesting that many people see no patterns at all. To them, all nature is blur, a background to their life they never see and never experience. How long has it been since you sat and watched the sun set? I mean, watched the light and shadows change slowly as the sun sinks below the horizon? Do you really see what is around you? As a photographer, I deal in patterns.

California condors are among the largest flying birds in the world. Adults weigh approximately 10 kilograms (22 pounds) and have a wing span up to 2.9 meters (9 ½  feet).\" We drive through the House Rock Valley, below the Vermilion Cliffs quite frequently and for years we have stopped and looked for condors. We often heard reports that they were sighted at the Grand Canyon, or near Navajo Bridge. Finally, we decided to make a major effort to spot the elusive birds. For the past few times we have gone through House Rock Valley, we have stopped at the release point, which is just north of Highway 87A. We heard from the people at the tourist store at Navajo Bridge that the condors sometimes roost near the bridge. With this in mind, our trip to northern Arizona included a goal to find the condors. We spent three days looking without results and then on the last day of our trip, on the way back down to the desert, we stopped off at Navajo Bridge. At first we could not see any signs of the birds. But then I saw what I thought was a condor land on a rock some distance from the bridges. There are two bridges at Navajo Bridge, the old one is now a walkway. The newer one is for traffic. Shortly, the first bird was joined by three more. They flew back and forth under the bridges and perched on the rocks of the cliffs. It was spectacular. More later on the condors."},

Tent caterpillars were just uncommon enough to evoke a little bit of uncertainty. I wasn't quite sure if they were dangerous or not. One of the rumors that circulated among children at the time was that certain caterpillars were poisonous, especially their spines.

Cans were first widely used for food preservation in the late 1800s. The first automated can making machinery was introduced in the 1880s and 1890s. The above can is not likely a beverage can because the top has been completely removed. Even though the can is probably mostly or all steel, it has very little evidence of deterioration due to the super dry environment. From the seam and the type of can, this one has probably been up there in the desert for more than fifty years. Undisturbed, that can will probably still be evident for another fifty or so years.We used to shoot at cans, throw rocks at cans and generally kick them and throw them around the countryside. There was little or no concern for the \"environment.\" The environment included rusty old cans. If we used a can out in the desert, we would squash it flat and put it under a rock. We figured that it would rust away eventually and it was only iron anyway. It wasn't until aluminum cans came on the scene that we realized that these things would probably last forever in the desert and we started packing everything out that we could carry.  Notice that the can is almost the same color as the rocks. There is a reason. The rocks contain iron oxide or rust. So it is only natural that they would be the same color."},

As the Fall came, I could watch the beginnings of leaves turning and feel the coolness in the breeze, only to return to the Valley and find temperatures still over 100 degrees and no sign of anything cooler than the ice in the refrigerator. In the Valley, we would wait until Christmas to see some of the leaves change and the old leaves would only fall off as the new ones came on. Every year the newspapers in the Valley would report the various locations throughout the state where the leaves might be seen changing colors.

The budget for fighting fires in the west is in the millions of dollars every year. Fires, like the one above on the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, appear to destroy the forest for a hundred years. But look, what is wrong with this picture? First of all, the trees have all burned, clear to the top. All of the trees are dead. But what is more important, the trees are very closely spaced and all about the same age. There are almost no older trees in this picture. This is a classic view of the end product of a hundred years of fire suppression. What would happen if the naturally caused fires, those that did not threaten any human structures, were allowed to burn whenever and where ever they started? As is stated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \"Decades of fire suppression are resulting in more catastrophic wild fires.\" Obviously, the solution is not as simple as letting fires burn, but the impact of many of the more damaging fires, like the one above, can be substantially lessened through more modern fire suppression attitudes.  This is not the scenic part of the Colorado Plateau. This is not the Grand Canyon. This is not any of the parts of the Plateau celebrated in song and story. This is the Colorado Plateau that I have known for nearly all of the my life (Since I am not dead, it hasn't been my whole life yet). This is the part of the Plateau that is ruled by extremes and one of those is the wind. We have seen winds over 100 mph tear down a reinforced shed, although high winds are not too common.

{"title": "Looking at the moon", "date": "Friday, September 10, 2010", "text": "One of the things that we do in Arizona is hike at night. I am not sure that this is so prevalent in other places, but when it is over 100 degrees outside, we would leave for our overnight hike late in the afternoon, or just about moonrise and hike by the light of the moon. You would think that this was only good where there was a defined trail, but of course, we would never do anything so simple as to hike on a trail. We would cut straight across country, hoping to hit the trail or dirt road we were aiming for. Hiking at night is an experience, you need to be careful not to step on things. Things that you would normally not want to step on during the day, like cactus and sharp rocks, but also things that are out in the nighttime that you would probably miss during the day.If there was a trail we would make really good time, because we weren't stopping to look at the scenery or whatever, but crosscountry, we had to pick the trail, hoping not to end up at the top of a drop-off (or the bottom). Even though it was not nearly so warm as the desert, I would also, from time to time hike across the Mogollon Rim country in the dark. There is not so much to worry about as there is in the Sonora Desert, but on nights where there was no moon, you sort-of wished that you ran into something familiar. Back to the desert, another interesting area to hike at night is the Colorado Plateau. There is a lot less cactus, a lot fewer trees than the Ponderosa pine forests of the Rim and you can see for miles. Walking on the Plateau is sort-of like walking around in my backyard. You can't get lost on one hike because you can't walk far enough to make any difference. I have never been lost in Arizona, that I can remember, but I am getting on in years and maybe I have forgotten being lost. I never could understand getting lost anyway, until I left Arizona and went to someplace like the Pacific Northwest or the Midwest where the trees grow so thick it is impossible to see more than a short distance and without a compass or map, you might just start going around in circles.

Once you step onto a trail and drop below the Rim the real magnitude of the Canyon begins to impress your mind. I have to admit it, I love the Grand Canyon and I will use any excuse I can find to take a trip to either the North or South Rim. The above picture was taken during July, actually the day after the 4th. I have spent the 4th of July in Boston and that is great experience, but I would really have a hard time deciding if I would rather be in Massachusetts or Arizona, if the choice was to go to the Grand Canyon.

{"title": "A fragile Immensity in space and time", "date": "Wednesday, September 1, 2010", "text": "The Colorado Plateau is land of color and contrasts. But, despite the vast expanse of sky and land, there is always an underlying current of the human impact on the land. Even though the above picture seems timeless, appearances of wildness are superficial. First of all the picture was taken from the edge of a major highway, with cars whizzing by at 65 mph. In the distance, if you click on the picture and look carefully, you will see a power transmission line running across the fields. Even more importantly, the very nature of the view has been determined by years of cattle grazing. Although the grass appears to be growing and green, this is a highly unusual condition, there is seldom enough moisture to green up the grass and except in extremely wet years, the land is usually overgrazed. On the website, Canyons, Cultures and Environmental Change -- An Introduction to the Land Use History of the Colorado Plateau, the Northern Arizona University Center for Environmental Science and Education makes the following observation:By the time federal forest reserves were proclaimed in the 1890s, ranchers on the Colorado Plateau had become accustomed to unregulated use of public lands as range for livestock. As a result of these excessive stocking numbers, once rich grasslands were seriously degraded even before the turn of the century, after less than a human generation of use. By the early 1900s, overstocking of sheep on many middle-elevation mesas and in the area's highlands had brought forest regeneration to a halt. The forest floor in some places was \"as bare and compact as a roadbed.\" The fire ecology of the region's forests, particularly the once grass-rich ponderosa pine forests, was drastically altered, causing significant long-term changes to their structure and composition.By 1912, livestock pressures had penetrated the most remote, timbered and mountainous areas. Theodore Rixon, one of the first foresters in the Southwest, described the situation:\"At the beginning the mountains and heavily timbered areas were used but little, but as the situation grew more acute in the more accessible regions the use of these areas became more general and in course of time conditions within them were more grave than elsewhere... The mountains were denuded of their vegetative cover, forest reproduction was damaged or destroyed, the slopes were seamed with deep erosion gullies, and the water-conserving power of the drainage basins became seriously impaired. Flocks passed each other on the trails, one rushing in to secure what the other had just abandoned as worthless, feed was deliberately wasted to prevent its utilization by others, the ranges were occupied before the snow had left them. Transient sheepmen roamed the country robbing the resident stockmen of forage that was justly theirs.\" (Source: Roberts, P.H. 1963. Hoof prints on forest ranges. San Antonio, TX: Naylor. 151 p.) Over one hundred years later, the effects of intense grazing in the latter part of the 19th century can still be readily seen in many parts of the Colorado Plateau.Out on the open Plateau, like the picture above, there is no frame of reference. There is no way to see what the land once was or what it has become. Driving around the state, the only place you can see a shadow of what once was is along the highways between the roads and the fences. Sometimes the difference in the growth of the grasses is dramatic, with healthy grass and other plants along the roads and bare soil and rocks just on the other side of the fences on the range land.

This impressive pueblo was inhabited both before and after the eruption of the Sunset Crater volcano between 1064 and 1066 AD. At one time it had more than a hundred rooms facing a walled circular plaza. Just north of the structure is the northernmost ballcourt found in the Southwest. The pueblo may have been built at that location because of its proximity to an impressive blow hole. There is some disagreement in the literature concerning the name of the Indians that built the structure, but more recent articles seem to agree on the term \"Sinagua.\" Although there are articles arguing that the inhabitants were Anazazis. It seems to be current doctrine that the Sinaguas were related to the modern Hopi Indians. But since about 1927, the nomenclature of the settlement and artifact style is called the Pecos Classification, which is as follows:Paleo-Indian (? BC - 6500 BC)Basketmaker I (6500 BC - AD 1, an obsolete synonym for Archaic)Basketmaker II (AD 1 - 500) Basketmaker III (500-700) Pueblo I (700-900) Pueblo II (900-1100) Pueblo III (1100-1300) Pueblo IV (1300-1600) Pueblo V (1600-2000)See Land Use History of North America Colorado Plateau According to the dating of the Wupatki site, the pueblo would fall into the Pueblo II time period which corresponds to much of the development of the Chaco Canyon complex in New Mexico."},

One of the most remarkable things we see are the hummingbirds. I used to think that hummingbirds were quite scarce, especially in Arizona. But as we walk along the canal, we see hummingbirds about every 50 yards or so. The little black speck moving back and forth across the canal is a hummingbird. I would venture to say that most people probably never notice them because they are so small and fast moving. They are very territorial birds and there is only one at a time, but they love to hover over the canal. I know you can't see any detail, but you can see what we see, the tiny birds darting back and forth. Even though they are very small, they eat even smaller insects and the canals have plenty of small gnats and other bugs flying over the water in the early morning."},
{"title": "A window to the past", "date": "Sunday, August 22, 2010", "text": "One of the first things that comes to mind looking out from the Wukoki Pueblo is the reason why the builders chose that spot to build a fairly monumental structure. It is easy to conjecture that the weather and rainfall patterns were much different at the time. In fact, there is a theory that the nearby volcanic eruption of what we call Sunset Crater coated the landscape with cinders which retained the moisture and fertilized the soil, making the area a lot more desirable that it appears. Even with this theory, it is very hard to come up with any rationale for building in this location justifying the remoteness and lack of firewood or water. However, there are also theories that air-breathing crevices such as the blow hole by Wupatki, may have had a major roll in locating these post-eruptive sites. See Schley, R.A., Excavation of the Wupatki Blowhole Site, NA7824. The general opinion seems to be that the area was settled by the Sinagua Indians, close relatives to today's Hopi tribe. Sinaguas are also the name given to Indians at other prominent Arizona ruins, like Walnut Canyon and as far south as Montezuma's Castle. Unless you read the technical writings about the ruins, you are likely to find references to Anasazi, Mogollon, Hohokam, Petayan and even references to Mesoamericans. These are all cultural labels that are used by modern archaeologists to denote groups of inhabitants with a common cultural tradition. These labels are by their nature arbitrary and are either artifact based (i.e. pottery), tool based, or style based, or all three. Cultural differences were likely a result of geographic and climatic isolation. However, even the most educated of archaeological theories cannot take into account differences in unidentified cultural or political differences."},
{"title": "Wukoki Pueblo", "date": "Wednesday, August 18, 2010", "text": "Located in the Wupatki National Monument, the Wukoki Pueblo is a classic example of early pueblo construction. The earliest known observation of the ruins was made in 1851 during the U.S. Army exploration of Brevet Captain Lorenzo Sitgreaves. Guided by the mountain man, Antoine Leroux, the Sitgreaves party had the assignment of exploring the Zuni and Colorado River valleys. (See Anthropology Laboratories of Northern Arizona University (NAU), \"History of Archaeological Studies at Wupatki\")Contrary to many of the ruins in the American Southwest, Wukoki and Wupatki, are prominently located on hills overlooking the vast stretches of the Colorado Plateau.  Wukoki in particular appears to have been strategically located for observation purposes. If there was an alert watcher on top of the towers, he or she could have seen someone coming many miles away. The site easily reminds me of the pictures I have seen of European castles. The sites for the dwellings was certainly not located for close proximity to running water, the only significant stream in the area, the Little Colorado River, is about five miles from the site of the pueblo. In this map, Wukoki is in the center of the map.The site marked \"B\" is the Wupatki ruin. The white line running on the right of the map is the Little Colorado River.  If you click on the map, in the expanded view, the pueblo is located at the end of the faint road running from approximately the Wupatki pueblo towards the northeast. North is at the top of this map.It looks like there is a fairly prominent wash just to the south and east of the site of Wukoki. I would speculate that at the time the pueblo was occupied, some of these watercourses may have held more water than they do today, meaning some instead of none.One of the early anthropologist/archaeologists of Southwest region was Jesse Walter Fewkes who became the director of the Smithsonian's Bureau of American Ethnology in 1918. The Bureau's founding director was John Wesley Powell of Grand Canyon fame. Fewkes was one of the early educated explorers of the Wupatki pueblo complex and wrote in his book Two summers work in Pueblo ruins, (Fewkes, Jesse Walter. Two Summers Work in Pueblo Ruins. Washington: G.P.O., 1904) the following at page 56: [spelling as in the original but I tried to correct typographical errors]The racial and clan kinship of the former  inhabitants of these pueblos is somewhat problematic, but it is quite  likely that the people were akin to the Hopis. This is shown not only by  the character of the houses, but also by the pottery and various other  objects found near them. Both legendary and archeological evidences  point to the conclusion that the people who once inhabited the pueblos  near Black falls came from the north, and were related to those who once  lived in cliff houses and other habitations on the Rio Colorado and its  tributary, the San Juan. Hopi legends say that the Snake clans formerly  lived at Tokonabi, on the Rio Colorado, and that they migrated  southward and built a pueblo about 50 miles west of the present Hopi  towns, which they called Wukoki. This pueblo, it is said, still has high-standing walls. The direction and distance of the Black falls ruins from  Walpi correspond pretty closely with those given in the legend, and  while it may not be possible to identify any single ruin of this cluster  as Wukoki, the traditional Wukoki of Hopi legend is not far from Black falls. The tradition that the inhabitants of these ruins came  from the north is supported by the close resemblance in character and  decoration between their pottery and that of the San Juan ruins. It might naturally be supposed that there would be a close likeness between the pottery of the Black falls ruins and that of Homolobi, and that kinship once existed between the inhabitants of these pueblos on the same river. Close study, however,  shows marked differences, and the author is led to the belief that  while both were pueblo people, and, therefore, similar in culture, the  clans which inhabited Homolobi were not the same as those which lived in  the Black falls villages. The clans which lived at Homolobi came from  the far south, through Chaves pass, while those at Wukoki came  from the opposite direction. Both evidently sought refuge in the Hopi  pueblos, where their descendants now live together. The clans from  Homolobi were the Patki, Patun, and Tabo (Piba), whose route to the Hopi  towns was by a trail which extends directly north past the \"Giant's  chair.\" The clans from Wukoki were the Teua and others who migrated almost eastward when they sought their home in Tusayan."},

The colors can be muted pastels and when they are more vivid, they are often surrounded by thorns. When I first arrived at my new home in the jungle, all I could see was a wall of green. I remember standing at the edge of the jungle looking at a wall of vegetation and being afraid to take a step forward because I did not know what the plants were and whether they were poisonous or not. I distinctly remember reflecting on the contrast to my own home in the Arizona Sonora Desert, where everything is familiar and very predictable. Where I could walk without being concerned that something would stick me or bite me.After living in the jungle for a long time, things became more familiar, but still, even years of experience did not make me feel at home with towering trees and vines with snakes and bugs. I remember one tree in the jungle that was totally covered with huge thorns. Not very pleasant. At least cactus are very predicable. It turns out that the tree not only has those huge thorns, but the entire tree is infested with huge ferocious ants that live in the thorns. All you have to do is touch the tree to cause the whole ant colony to attack.When reading about the desert, you get a lot of baloney about rattlesnakes, jumping cactus, scorpions and such, but these are pretty mundane compared to your average jungle. I grew up in the desert and I was married with children before I saw my first scorpion. Really, you have to go looking for them. I must admit that later on in life we have had considerably more experience with scorpions. But they are fairly predictable if totally undesirable. Scorpions would not be helped by a good PR agent.Granted, if you have little or no experience in the desert, you will likely get stuck with a cactus or two and you definitely have to learn how to walk through the desert and avoid picking up some stickers, but you can learn pretty quickly.I also have another problem with the forests of the Eastern U.S., you can't see anything but trees.

{"title": "Afternoon thunderstorms", "date": "Sunday, August 15, 2010", "text": "Unlike some areas where it can rain all day and all night for days, in most of Arizona rain is highly seasonal, localized and comes with huge thunderstorms in torrents. For most of my life the summer thunderstorm season was called a monsoon. Recently, there has been change to conform with political correctness, and it is now officially called the \"Summer Thunderstorm Season.\" Whatever. Watching the clouds form over the mountains and then move out across the Plateau in northeastern Arizona was a summer ritual. Everyone in Arizona loves to point out that the whole state isn't a dry and dusty desert, there are mountains and with green grass and trees, but the rainfall pattern is highly concentrated in the higher elevations and even the high mountains are relatively dry most of the year. Simply put, the high country gets the rain in the summer and sometimes snow in the winter.  The lower deserts are dry all year.Down in the lower desert, we can wait all summer for one or two heavy rainfalls. In the high country it might rain one or two times a week, sometimes more frequently. In the early morning the skies will be almost clear, but by mid-morning, the clouds start to form over the higher hills and mountains and then suddenly begin to explode into huge cumulonimbus clouds systems that can dump rain and hail over large areas of the country. But it only rains right under the clouds. So you can stand on one side of the street and watch it rain on the other. On occasion as we watched the clouds form over the mountains and then slowly move across the desert, we would jump in our car and drive towards the rain. Once and while we could find a road that would take us into the path of the storm and we would drive until it was raining and then leap out of the car and stand around in the rain getting wet.When I lived in Panama, I used to run to the window or outside to watch the rain, every day. None of people who lived there could understand my fascination with seeing buckets of water pour out of the sky. I still have to go outside and watch the rain. I am still amazed that water can actually fall out of the sky."},

{"title": "Aptly named Alligator Juniper", "date": "Thursday, August 12, 2010", "text": "A considerable portion of the Arizona highlands are covered with various species of juniper trees, locally referred to as cedar trees. Not tall enough, usually, to give any shade except right in their vicinity, they have been considered as weeds and are looked down upon by pine tree lovers. Juniper trees grow throughout the entire northern hemisphere. There are 28 species of Juniperus. Those found in Arizona include the alligator juniper shown above, the California juniper, redberry juniper, common juniper, oneseed juniper, Utah juniper, and the Rocky Mountain juniper.Juniper trees have been ubiquitous during my life. We used to have juniper berry fights, we used them for fence posts, clothesline posts, and firewood. The wood is extremely tough but the trunks and branches are so crooked and twisted, there is almost no good building wood in the trees.At one time in Arizona, the ranchers began a huge campaign to eradicate the juniper trees to \"improve\" the range land for cattle. They took two huge Caterpillar tractors and attached a huge chain and dragged the chain across the landscape essentially pulling over all of the juniper trees. Huge areas of the Colorado Plateau were subject to this \"range improvement.\" The destruction of the juniper habitat is still a common practice in other states, like Texas, for example. Ranchers are still looking for the juniper solution. Here is a description of the practice: Numerous and sundry mechanical means are employed to physically destroy plant enemies. Prominent among these is \"chaining,\" in which a heavy chain (or a heavy cable) is dragged between 2 crawler-type tractors to rip out all woody plants. The heavy equipment and huge anchor chain kill wild animals, destroy nests and burrows, kill many non-woody plants, damage the soil, drag and dislocate large rocks, and generally trash the land. In This Land Is Your Land, Bernard Shanks reports that chaining has likewise effaced hundreds of federally \"protected\" Native American ruins and archaeological sites (Shanks 1984). After chaining, the woody debris is burned or left to rot. In an average year hundreds of square miles of Western public land are chained, hundreds or even thousands of acres at a time. Utah State University research scientist Ronald Lanner a decade ago found that more than 3 million acres (the size of Connecticut) of public pinyon/juniper land had been chained for cow pasture (Shanks 1984). Lanner recently stated that the weight of published research does not support any of the reasons used to condone chaining. Yet, common to the remote West is the chained landscape -- thousands of broken juniper, pinyon, greasewood, or sage skeletons scattered about the ravaged land, a few cows seeking forage among them. Some of the juniper removal is done under the guise of increasing rangeland hydrology, even though studies are very inconclusive as to the benefits of chaining all of the junipers. There appear to be few studies that focus on the peripheral damage done to the land by wholesale chaining.  See \"How an increase or reduction in Juniper cover alters rangeland hydrology.\"One thing I do know, overgrazing by cattle greatly alters the natural habitat and variety of species that can survive the extreme temperatures and lack of water on the Colorado Plateau."},
{"title": "Ant Hills", "date": "Wednesday, August 11, 2010", "text": "I am certain that ant hills or ant beds, whatever, exist for thousands of years. There is usually no reason for the ant colony to move out, so when an old queen ant dies, a new one moves in and the colony is renewed and continues in the same location. Obviously, I haven't been around for thousands of years to test my theory, but I remember a specific ant bed from when I was a child (almost 60 years ago) and the last time I checked (not too long ago, maybe a year or two) the ant bed was still there in the same location and going strong. So does anyone out there in the ant expert community agree with my theory? I suppose it is possible that no one else has stayed around an ant hill long enough to determine how long the use the same bed. But the ant hill in the picture above is ancient. I used to watch ants carefully for hours when I was young. When I finished watching the ants, I could still see them crawling with my eyes closed for hours. Occasionally, ants would bite one of our children. That was pretty terrible. I would get ant bites when I was pulling weeds in the garden. There would be nests of millions of little black ants that would come swarming out and bite me all over my hands and bare feet. We have had some ants in our house for years. We have fought back with every remedy known to mankind, but they seem to always come back. Right now, we have some tiny little ants that you can hardly see except as black specks. They are annoying because they will not give up and go away. I like ants a lot more than scorpions."},

I will always have that memory of a hillside of wildflowers, but will seldom have the reality. Sometimes in the spring in the desert there are whole landscapes of color, but in the high country of Arizona wildflowers are more personal. There aren't really whole fields of flowers, they live a more solitary existence. In a way, the fact that they are not in a crowd, makes each plant more impressive. This Indian Paintbrush is the Wyoming State Flower. There are many different species and varieties of the Castilleja genus that grow throughout the U.S.  The USDA lists contain 106 species and 161 accepted taxa overall and they grow everywhere in the U.S. and Canada even as far north as the Arctic. There are even species that grow in Hawaii. They have a lot of common names, like wavyleaf, cobwebby, attenuate, Rincon Mountain, vernal pool, Port Clarence and on and on. Learning about Indian Paintbrush is kind of like finding out your best friend is a triplet. You thought your world was pretty well ordered and explained and then you find out that the one flower you recognize is really dozens of different species.There is a dichotomy between being ignorant and enjoying the beauty of the flower and learning more about it and being wrapped up in details. I think that the dichotomy can be resolved if you love the beauty enough, even knowing the details doesn't spoil the view."},

Here, the sandstone of the Colorado Plateau is capped by huge lava flows and all of the rounded hills in the area are long dormant volcanoes. The combination of a short growing season and poor thin soil made for really difficult farming. The only real possibilities were cattle ranching or timber harvesting. Neither of these activities turned out to be very profitable and nearly all of the settlers left the area after a few years of discouragement. The area is called Nutrioso from the Spanish nutria or beaver and oso or bear. There are now very few beavers, but there are still quite a number of bears. By 1886, a scarlet fever epidemic had wiped out most of the young children in the town. Even though the land appears green and inviting, it is subject to the desert droughts and during the early times hungry timber wolves would come into the settlement and eat calves, colts, lambs, dogs and cats. Around 1900 a severe drought forced most of the rest of the settlers to leave the area. The current year round population is estimated at about 150. During the past few years, the land speculation boom finally reached the area and land prices began to rise, but when the bust came, it came hard to Nutrioso and a tour though the subdivisions around the valley shows dozens of for sale signs."},

On visits to the Canyon, we have witnessed people actually dancing on the edge of the cliffs, seemingly oblivious to the hundreds or thousands of feet down to the first ledges. Recent news articles tell yet another story of a fall from the South Rim. Apparently, a French tourist is the latest to fall from the cliffs. In this case however, the tourist survived with wrist, ankle and neck injuries. In July, a hiker's body was recovered from the Lava Falls trail and regularly, news articles highlight falls and other accidental or suicidal deaths at the Canyon. Almost exactly a year ago, on August 9, 2009, a Canadian fell to his death in the Canyon. On the average two to three people die every year from falls. In 1993, seven people died in accidental falls into the Canyon. When people go to the South Rim (or even parts of the North Rim) in the developed area of the Canyon, there is really no transitional area between the development consisting of stores, hotels, gas stations, parking lots, and other attractions and the huge exposed cliffs of the Canyon. You walk right out of a parking lot and there is the edge with thousands of feet of drop-off. It is probably lost on some people that the Canyon is not exactly a walk in a mall. Considering that in 2008, 4,425,314 people visited the Park, it is probably remarkable that there aren't more falls.

{"title": "Lava froth", "date": "Monday, August 2, 2010", "text": "The type of Igneous rock that develops from lava is determined by the composition of the lava as it comes molten from the volcanic vent. The grain size depends on the speed at which the lava cools and to some extent, the composition of the lava. The finest grained lavas with few, if any, bubbles, are actually glassy and produce obsidian. If the lava is sticky and has more air bubbles, like the lava picture above, the resultant rocks are classified as pumice. A more fluid lava will produce scoria, which is primarily the composition of the cinders I talk about in previous posts. As the silica (quartz) content of the lava increases the lava becomes a felsite. Felsite is fine grained but not glassy like obsidian, and may or may not have phenocrysts (large mineral grains). It is high in silica or felsic, and typically consists of the quartz, (plagioclase feldspar and alkali feldspar). Felsite is considered the extrusive equivalent of granite.With the changes in the composition of the lava, depending on mineral content, the lava could end up a medium silica Andesite or a low silica basalt. Coarse grained rocks from lava can include porphyries, granites, syenites, diorites, gabbros, peridotites, pyroxenites, dunites and pegmatites. Some of the differences between these rock types is based entirely on grain size and not on any variations in mineral content. The variety of rocks, is really fascinating."},

Some of the formations are hollow due to the lava draining out of the structure shortly after the formation.

The signage next to the hole gives the current explanation for the phenomena:Basically, there is a huge crack system running under parts of the Colorado Plateau. The most notable cracks are near Holbrook, Arizona. Here is a post about the cracks from the State Geologist of Arizona. Arizona has over 1600 caves and karst features and even has cave protection laws that make it a crime to damage natural features in a cave. See A.R.S. 13-3702 and 13-3702.01.  It is understood that most of the caves do not have a natural entrance from the surface. In the case of this blow hole, the only known entrance to the cave is the small opening in the rock, now preserved with the stone wall and a heavy screen (just visible in the hole). If you would like more information about Arizona caves, you can see the Arizona Cave Survey. Cavers or spelunkers are very possessive about caves and rightfully so. Some spectacular caves in Arizona have been entirely stripped of formations and are covered with graffiti and otherwise damaged. If you want to visit a wild cave, you can contact a local chapter of the National Speleological Society. Arizona also has three commercial cave sites; Colossal Cave near Tucson; Grand Canyon Caverns near Seligman;  and Kartchner Caverns near Benson. I have considerable experience in caves across the U.S. Starting when I was a teenager, we had all of the necessary equipment from my rock climbing background and went into some of the largest caves in Arizona and Utah. This was long before most of the caves were barred and locked to public access. I have had mixed experiences with the National Speleological Society members. I have not found all of them to have an adequate experience level. But it is obvious that lack of control of caves with our present societal attitudes towards the environment would result in massive destruction. The prime example is Peppersauce Cave on the north side of Mount Lemmon, near Oracle Junction. Quoting from the Wikipedia article, \"The cave has been subject to vandalism and heavy littering for over fifty years. In 2001, the Peppersauce Cave Conservation Project (PCCP) was established upon the discovery of E. Coli and coliform within the cave's lakes. The initiative is funded by the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) and is aided by volunteers who work to keep the cave clean. A sampling conducted in January 2003 indicated that no harmful bacteria were present in the water. The group was also highly successful in removing graffiti, though the cave continues to be heavily subjected to vandalism."},
{"title": "Lava flows in Arizona", "date": "Wednesday, July 28, 2010", "text": "This is where Wikipedia is way off. In the article on a list of lava flows in Arizona, the poster says, \"there are three lava flow areas in the American state of Arizona.\" Wrong. There are dozens, perhaps hundreds of lava flows throughout the state. Some of the most prominent geological features in the state are associated with lava flows. Here is a NASA photo of one of the flows, very near to Sunset Crater and the Bonita Lava Flow shown above.This is the Black Point Lava Flow in northern Arizona, seen in this photograph taken from the International Space Station. The flow is part of Arizona’s San Francisco Volcanic Field, a group of geologically young (approximately six million to less than one thousand years old) volcanoes, lava flows, and cinder cones located just north of Flagstaff, Arizona. NASA.As you travel throughout the state, you will see many old and new lava fields. One prominent section is located near the town of Springerville and is known as the Springerville Volcanic Field. The Springerville volcanic field is a monogenetic volcanic field located in east-central Arizona, USA. The field consists of 405 discrete vents covering approximately 3,000 square kilometers (1,200 sq mi) and is the third largest such field in the continental United States, only the San Francisco volcanic field (Arizona) and Medicine Lake volcanic field (California) are larger. Wikipedia.There is also the Uinkaret Volcanic Field in the Grand Canyon National Park which has been instrumental in creating one of the notable rapids along the Colorado River, Lava Falls. Vulcan's Throne on the rim of the Canyon is a Quaternary cinder cone. See Vulcan's Throne WikipediaQuoting from the USGS, Arizona Volcanoes and Volcanics, \"Late Cenozoic lava flows have repeatedly flowed down Toroweap Valley and several adjacent valleys into the Grand Canyon, at times forming large lava dams. Flows are exposed on the walls of the Grand Canyon, often interbedded with fluvial and lacustrine sediments, up to 600 meters above present river level. Several of the dams are estimated to have been at least 200 meters high. The most recent flows in the Grand Canyon have cascaded over the rim of the Esplanade to the river 1,000 meters below. \"Some of the other notable features of the Arizona landscape that resulted from volcanic activity include the famous Superstition Mountains, the Chiricahua National Monument, the White Mountains and of course, the San Francisco Mountains."},
{"title": "Collapsed Lava Tube", "date": "Sunday, July 25, 2010", "text": "There are a number of lava tubes in Arizona, some of which are very long and big enough to invite exploration. One of the most accessible is mile long, Lava River Cave, located about 14 miles north of Flagstaff on paved highways and graveled forest roads. The above picture shows a collapsed lava tube in the Sunset Crater National Monument. Although the Coconino National Forest claims the Lava River Cave to be the longest such cave in Arizona, this may not be exactly correct. The longest cave is probably Harris Cave located near Vernon, Arizona in the Whiting Knoll Quadrangle.  I have been to the end of the Lava River Cave a number of times, but the day we looked for Harris Cave, it took us so long to find it, we had no time to explore. That was pre-GPS technology days however and today, it can be found quite easily.Lava tubes don't make a particularly appealing type of cave. They have virtually no cave formations except for various types of lava flows, and they can be filled with all kinds of other crawly creatures (besides spelunkers) due to periodic openings to the outer world. The Lava River Cave was previously known as Government Cave, due to its proximity to the Government Prairie, where it is reported that troops were stationed at one time.There are probably dozens (or more) caves in Arizona of lava origin. Most of them are unimpressive. In Sunset Crater, the Park Service used to conduct tours of a 225 foot lava tube filed with ice, but apparently, the cave roof collapsed in 1984 and the tours were discontinued."},
{"title": "Dying in the Desert", "date": "Saturday, July 24, 2010", "text": "One of the persistent icons of the American Southwest is a cartoon of a man crawling across the desert in a state of dehydration. There is nothing amusing about dehydration. Recent news stories in Arizona have focused on three Utah men who left Salt Lake City on July 6, 2010 to search for the fabled gold hidden in the Superstition Mountains east of the Salt River Valley (including Phoenix). Quoting from one news account, \"But the truth of the matter is that they were amateurs, and they went into the mountains at the hottest time of the year with nowhere near enough water, and they died.\" Read more: http://www.azcentral.com/community/pinal/articles/2010/07/17/20100717utah-hikers-searching-for-treasure-feared-dead.html#ixzz0uWskbvkf As of the date of this post, they had not been found and were feared dead. The part of the legend about the desert being hot and dry is very true. In another recent article, it is reported that there have been bodies of 40 illegal immigrants brought to the office of the Pima County Medical Examiner during the first two weeks of July, 2010. The Medical Examiner is quoted as saying, \"Right now, at the halfway point of the month, to have so many is just a very bad sign,\" he said. \"It's definitely on course to perhaps be the deadliest month of all time.\" From Jan. 1 to July 15, the office has handled the bodies of 134 illegal immigrants, up from 93 at the same time last year and 102 in 2008. In 2007, when the office recorded the highest annual deaths of illegal immigrants, 140 bodies had been taken there through July 15. See Fox News.   In all of the U.S. the Centers for Desease Control record the following statistics: During 1999--2003, a total of 3,442 deaths resulting from exposure to extreme heat were reported (annual mean: 688). For 2,239 (65%) of these deaths, the underlying cause of death was recorded as exposure to excessive heat; for the remaining 1,203 (35%), hyperthermia was recorded as a contributing factor. Deaths among males accounted for 66% of deaths and outnumbered deaths among females in all age groups (Figure). Of the 3,401 decedents for whom age information was available, 228 (7%) were aged <15 years, 1,810 (53%) were aged 15--64 years, and 1,363 (40%) were aged >65 years. The state with the highest average annual hyperthermia-related death rate during 1999--2003 was Arizona (1.7 deaths per 100,000 population), followed by Nevada (0.8) and Missouri (0.6).Because of the political implications of the deaths of so many illegal aliens, it is likely that the statistics may be skewed either to include individuals who died from other causes or to exclude individuals to minimize the impact of the actual numbers. Hyperthermia (as opposed to hypothermia) is an elevated body temperature due to failed thermoregulation. In Arizona, we get periodic reminders of the symptoms of heat related conditions by the media. When confronted with excessive heat, the body begins to shut down. Heat exhaustion (also known as heat prostration) is a temporary condition caused by to much exposure to high temperatures or to the sun. Heat exhaustion results from excessive loss of fluids. Its symptoms are nausea, unusually profuse sweating, a sense of anxiety, and weakness or dizziness--i.e., a feeling of \"faintness,\" caused by a drop in blood pressure and a slowing of the pulse. In fact, actual fainting is not uncommon in cases of heat exhaustion. The skin becomes clammy, pale and grayish, and the body temperature drops below normal.  eSSortment. When heat prostration becomes acute, it becomes heat stroke. Heat stroke has the same symptoms except it is the condition when the body shuts down and the there is no sweating, and the skin is dry and hot red or flushed.Once the condition has progressed to the heat stroke stage, in order to survive, a person's body temperature must be brought down by spraying the person with water and promoting sweating and evaporation. Cooling the body back to an acceptable range is imperative."},
{"title": "Sunset Crater National Monument", "date": "Friday, July 23, 2010", "text": "Located just a few miles north of Flagstaff, Arizona on Highway 89, Sunset Crater is one of the mostaccessible National Monuments in Arizona. Quoting from Wikipedia,The eruptions forming the 340-meter-high cone (1,120 ft) were initially considered from tree-ring dating to have begun between the growing seasons of 1064–1065 AD; however, more recent paleomagnetic evidence places the onset of the eruption sometime between about 1080 and 1150 AD. The largest vent of the eruption, Sunset Crater itself, was the source of the Bonito and Kana-a lava flows that extended about 2.5 kilometers (1.6 mi) NW and 9.6 kilometers (6 mi) NE, respectively. Additional vents along a 10-kilometer-long fissure (6.2 mi) extending SE produced small spatter ramparts and a 6.4-kilometer-long lava flow (4 mi) to the east. The Sunset Crater eruption produced a blanket of ash and lapilli covering an area of more than 2,100 square kilometers (810 sq mi) and forced the abandonment of settlements of the indigenous Sinagua Indians.The elevation of the Monument is 8,042 feet and even summer weather can be cool to chilly. Recent forest fires around Flagstaff have come close to the edge of the National Monument but no fires have recently burned inside the boundaries.  There are some interesting short hiking trails and a few viewpoints but the whole National Monument can be seen in a matter of hours. There is a large campground in the National Forest outside the Monument with an additional large group campsite, but other than camping and Ranger presentations, there are not many other things to see and do. Even though it is small, it is well worth the visit."},
{"title": "Mud Cracks", "date": "Thursday, July 22, 2010", "text": "One of the most fascinating things about the desert is the prevalence of mud cracks. I remember hiking into the Pariah Canyon in Northern Arizona/Southern Utah and along the dry stream bed there were huge, dinner plate sized, mud cracks. They were so dry and hard that they clinked like glass and cracked loudly when we walked on them. When I was young, I used to take apart the mud cracks like puzzles and try to put them back together. Anytime a layer of clay silt is deposited by a rainstorm in a depression in the ground, when the clay dries it shrinks and forms the puzzle pattern mud cracks. Like everything else in the world, mud cracks are studied by geologists. If the mud cracks are subsequently covered by another layer of silt and preserved and then through geological changes hardened into rock, they give us a record of the long ago drying event. They use mud cracks to determine the orientation of the original sedimentary beds that formed the cracks. The edges of the mud cracks curl upward and point out which direction was up in the original bed. Also, the cracks get thinner as they go down into the layers and point downward. We had a recent thunderstorm in Mesa and the ditches on the sides of the canals filled with water. Of course, the water evaporates in a day (or even a few minutes or hours) but it leaves behind a thin sheet of sediment, dust from the canal road, that dries into the fabulous patterns of mud cracks. If you would like to see a number of different photos, go to the Earth Science World Image Bank. Mud cracks are like many things I find while walking Arizona, they are fascinating, interesting and mostly ignored by everyone."},

{"title": "Arizona's Volcanic Fields", "date": "Monday, July 19, 2010", "text": "Arizona is not usually associated with volcanoes or with volcanic activity, but much of the state is dominated by former volcanoes and huge areas of lava flows and cinder cones. In north central Arizona, the San Francisco Volcanic Field is listed by the U.S.G.S. as a potentially active volcanic area. Near Flagstaff, Sunset Crater is likely Arizona's most recent volcanic cone, the eruption is generally dated to between 1040 and 1100 A.D. The area around the Crater is now a national monument and a surprisingly small one at that. The Visitors' Center, the campgrounds and most of the scenery lie outside of the national monument. The picture above shows a portion of the Bonita Lava Flow, located slightly north and mostly west of the main crater or cinder cone known as Sunset Crater.The Monument is heavily visited because of its close proximity to Highway 89, a very busy route north and south in Arizona, and to the City of Flagstaff. The Monument is almost at the edge of the City Limits. In my experience the Bonita Campground, adjacent to the Monument itself, is almost always full or nearly full of campers the entire summer.Historically, the National Park Service had a lot of interesting activities at the Monument, including hikes up to the top of Sunset Crater and tours of local ice caves, really lava tubes. Neither of these activities are allowed under the present management of the Monument. The NPS actually hauled huge amounts of cinders back to the cone to replace those worn down by the trails up the hill.The Bonita Lava Flow is very interesting. As the lava flowed from the volcanic vents, the surface of the lava cooled. With the cooling, the surface was broken into plates that look similar to huge plates covering the entire lave field. The lava tubes formed when the walls of the tube cooled and solidified while liquid lava was still moving through the tube. When the liquid lava ran out of the tube, it left a long worm-like tunnel often referred to as a lava tube cave. There are several of these lava tube caves in Arizona, some of which are more than a mile in length.Since you can drive through Sunset Crater National Monument in about half an hour, even at 35 mph, it is worth stopping, even if you don't have much time."},
{"title": "Smoke in the Canyon", "date": "Sunday, July 18, 2010", "text": "According to the National Park Service, the Saffron Fire, currently burning in the Kaibab National Forest at the northern end of the Rainbow Plateau, 2 miles south of the park/forest boundary and 15 miles northwest of the North Rim. As of July 16, 2010, the fire had burned over 3,260 acres. The current fire plan is to allow the fire to burn naturally \"within the planned management boundaries (north and east of the canyon rim, south of Forest Roads (FR) 268 and 223, and north of Swamp Ridge Road – the east/west section of the W4 road) in order to maintain fire’s natural role in the ecosystem.\" See NPS. During our recent trip to the North Rim, we found the smoke from the fire drifting generally to the east, pushed by the prevailing south by southwest winds. In approaching the Park we crossed a band of heavy smoke. At first, at the North Rim, the smoke was mainly to the north of the Grand Canyon National Park, but by the next day the smoke had filled the canyon to the east and south. The picture above shows the smoke looking east from the vicinity of Cape Royal. The bright spot is the reflection of the sun in my camera lens caused by the smoke. There is a lively controversy over the advisability of fire suppression in most instances. Years of unwise fire suppression have caused a huge build up of combustibles in the forests and when there is a fire, the fires burn very hot and kill all of the vegetation. Driving out to Cape Royal from the North Rim Visitors Center, you can see multiple fire burns in various stages of regrowth. The natural Ponderosa pine forest has an open meadow-like nature. Overgrowth of trees due mainly to fire suppression causes the forest to thicken unnaturally and become susceptible to dangerous fires and also bark beetles and disease. Flagstaff has recently suffered a huge fire with flames barely being stopped at the edge of subdivisions. The Schultz fire burned 15,075 acres north and east of Flagstaff. Misguided concerns about \"preserving\" the forest in the past have contributed to recent huge uncontrolled fires. In Flagstaff the Grand Canyon Forests Partnership is actively moving forward on a forest restoration project in the Fort Valley area northwest of Flagstaff. Treatments of the forest vary: thinning of trees, prescribed burning, meadow and wetland restoration, recreation management, etc. Through these means and with the involvement of the public, the Grand Canyon Forests Partnership hopes to enhance forest values so that they are healthy and sustainable for generations to come."},
{"title": "Death in the Grand Canyon", "date": "Tuesday, July 13, 2010", "text": "2009 saw a total of 12 tourists die as a result of visits to the Grand Canyon. However, to put this in perspective, about 4.5 million tourists visit the Canyon every year. Last year's victims included 10 visitors who died from accidents within the canyon, four on backcountry trails and one death from suicide and another from a heart attack. Observing the footwear and physical condition of a lot of the visitors, it is a miracle that more people don't die. I have seen people hiking down the train into the Canyon in flip-flops and even high heels. Most of the viewpoints on the Rim of the Canyon have extreme exposure, but I have seen tourists literally dancing on the edge of the cliffs, apparently unaware of the extreme heights.One particularly tragic death came from heat exhaustion to a 20-year-old characterized as an \"Eagle Scout.\" He was apparently on his way to find the famous Thunder River on the Canyon's North Rim. He died in mid-July when temperatures in the depths of the Canyon can exceed 100 degrees.This year, July is also generating news articles about deaths in the Canyon. On July 8, 2010 Park Rangers recovered the body of a female hiker in the same general area where the man died last year, the Toroweap Valley. It is likely that these hikers vastly underestimate the distances, elevation changes and heat in the Canyon.On one hike into the Canyon, we left the North Rim at 27 degrees and by the time we reached the Colorado River the temperature was 97 degrees. It is very difficult to drink enough water hiking in almost 100 degree temperatures to keep hydrated and maintain life. Many hiker try to avoid the heat by hiking at night or during the early morning hours.Other deaths in the Canyon are more likely the result of the number of people visiting the Canyon. With such a large number of people, statistically, somebody is going to die from a heart attack or commit suicide. In May, June and July of 2010 there have been apparent suicides at the Canyon."},
{"title": "Happy Fourth of July", "date": "Sunday, July 4, 2010", "text": "The Fourth of July in Phoenix is an ambivalent holiday. The State is relatively conservative but the Fourth comes in the middle of the summer. Virtually anyone that can leave town does so. When I was growing up, (some think I never did), we spent all summer up on the \"mountain.\" Translated, into Arizona speak, we actually were out on the Plateau in St. Johns, where we could see mountains to the south. The temperatures were slightly less intense than the Valley and it did rain every couple of weeks. The Fourth of July was a huge holiday on the mountain, a cannon salute at 6:00 am, with races, pancake breakfast, patriotic speeches, barbeque in park, dances and parties. In Phoenix, it was mostly ignored. There was (and is) the obligatory fireworks display, but except for family gatherings, there isn't much going on. So that is why I have a picture of the Statue of Liberty.Mesa has tried to buck the tradition by having a Main Street gathering, but like most things in Mesa, they have almost no publicity. So almost no one, relatively speaking, spends the evening on Main Street.It is strange to me that this low key ignoring of the Fourth of July seems to contrast with the avowed patriotism of almost everyone. I guess when you match up patriotism with 110 degrees outside, the temperature wins. The local Boy Scout troop does put up flags in our neighborhood. But this is not done out of a sense of patriotism but as a fund raising activity. You donate a set amount to the Troop and they put a flag on your front lawn on every holiday, including Flag Day and the Fourth of July."},
{"title": "Saturday in the desert", "date": "Saturday, July 3, 2010", "text": "We had an unusual day at home for a change. Since we both work all week and serve every Saturday at the Mesa, Arizona Temple, we seldom get a free day to do what we need to do around the house. When out subdivision was built, it was an grapefruit orchard and some of the old trees still grow in the yards. But time and re-plantings have changed the nature of the neighborhood and it doesn't look anything like an orchard. Some of the older trees are dying and being replaced from time to time. The first settlers in the Salt River Valley used the existing Indian canals rebuilt to water their crops. Eventually, the ditches and laterals were put underground. Some of the people in the neighborhood still water their yards with underground irrigation. The house we bought has a sprinkler system but the irrigation has been blocked off. Or, mostly blocked off. After living here for a while, we discovered that the old underground irrigation pipes are still there. We found them when holes opened up in flower beds and other locations that were essentially drains into the old pipes. So, this morning the first item of business was to block the most bothersome of the holes down to the old pipes so the sprinkler water wouldn't run down into the ground and disappear. That took just a few minutes but then the job began to expand to include enlarging the basins around the new citrus trees in back. We are used to having a huge variety of citrus and when we moved into this present house, we only had tangerines, oranges and grapefruit. So, one of the first items on the agenda when we moved in, was to plant more citrus, this time a navel orange and a tangelo. We have learned by observation, to buy the trees small and let them grow. A smaller tree will be more healthy and produce more fruit earlier than a large fully grown tree. It takes the larger tree a lot longer to get established and produce fruit.Expanding the watering basins progressed to knocking down cobwebs and cutting a few bushes back. All this was happening as the temperature continued to climb to over 100 degrees. I put the pictures of the two saguaros at the beginning to remind you that I am writing from the middle of one of the hottest large cities in the world. We made a detour to the hardware store to get some screen to fix two torn window screens. Fixing the screens was done later in the day and we suffered mightily from the heat by that time. I have decided not to fix window screens for a profession. I imagine it would be easier to do if you had somewhere other than the floor to work on, but sitting on the floor and trying to get the screen straight is pretty sweaty work. I decided to take a break and watch the Prologue to the Tour de France. I got the program on just in time to see Lance Armstrong come in fourth. I doubt I will see much of the race since we seldom have time to watch anything on TV. This is the first time I remember them having all of this classic bicycle race on TV that we didn't have to pay extra to see.It is always nice to get a few things done before the heat gets to you and you start to sit around and drink lemonade."},

Summer can be nice above 5,000 feet but even at altitude the winter is the best time to see Arizona. Any day that there are clouds and a storm is a good day to see the Grand Canyon. Even if you have to hold onto a tree to keep from being blown away. The views are decidedly more dramatic and impressive. Now don't get me wrong. I don't mind the heat at all. I grew up before air conditioning. I was in my last year in high school before we moved into a house with air conditioning. I didn't have a car with air conditioning until I was married and had several children.When you live in Phoenix it is easy to avoid the heat almost entirely. You go from your air conditioned car, to air conditioned homes and businesses and only go outside when it is absolutely necessary. There is also the almost universally present swimming pool. There are dozens of public pools and tens of thousands of private swimming pools.Then there are those who have to be outside in the heat. All of the service and support people whose jobs require outside work. You see them cutting grass, digging, building and walking. No one who doesn't have to be outside, is out on the streets. Usually, except for the cars, the neighborhoods and streets look deserted. One time I came home from living my summer on the Colorado Plateau and found the house full of water. This was before air conditioning. One of the toilets had run and flooded almost the entire house. It was probably 110+ outside and inside and with the water, the humidity was nearly 100%. I had to move all of the water soaked books and stuff outside and clear out all the water. That was the hottest I ever remember being in my life.When you have to go outside and stay for a while, you begin to notice that 100 degrees is not that hot. They (whoever they are?) always joke about Arizona having a dry heat. Well, dry or hot, once the temperature gets above 110 degrees, the air is hot. If you are driving in a car and the temperature is around 100 degrees, you can put your hand out the window and feel a little bit of cooler air. But if it is 110 or higher, the air feels hot and actually feels like it is burning your hand.During this hot summer, it helps to remind yourself of cool mountains and rain, even snow. Although, most of the time when I think of snow during the summer in Phoenix, I have a really hard time believing that it really exists. One summer, we loaded all the children in the car and I said we were driving north until it got cold. We kept driving until we reached Jasper National Park where we had frost on our tent when we woke up camping next to the Columbia Ice Field."},
{"title": "Petrified Wood", "date": "Tuesday, June 29, 2010", "text": "Petrified wood is found in every county in Arizona. The theory of its origin is that wood buried in mud or sand had the organic portions replaced by minerals in a process called permineralization. The petrified wood preserves, in some cases, the structure of the wood down to the microscopic level. This piece of wood is sitting out in front of the Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum. The most common mineral in petrified wood is quartz in its myriad forms and colors. Pure quartz (rock crystal) is almost colorless, but contaminating elements can radically change the color:carbon - black cobalt - green/blue chromium - green/blue copper - green/blue iron oxides - red, brown, and yellow manganese - pink/orange manganese oxides - black/yellow  I spent a lot of my younger years in a small town on the Colorado Plateau. It did not take me long to recognize the type of clay formation that had petrified wood. I lived only an hour or so away from the Petrified Forest National Monument, (now a National Park) near Holbrook, Arizona. The Petrified Forest National Park is an amazingly diverse area with one of the world's largest concentrations of petrified wood. It is illegal to remove petrified wood from the Park and there is a large pile of wood near the entrance from the Park Rangers' confiscation of people's attempts to steal the wood from the Park.It is ironic that people will spend money to purchase a small piece of petrified wood. In Arizona and other states, the Bureau of Land Management set the reasonable limits for personal use of up to 25 pounds per day, plus one piece, with a total limit of 250 pounds per year. In both Holbrook and Winslow, there are a number of mineral dealers that will sell huge 1000 lb. plus tree trunks of petrified wood. I am sure that many people are absolutely amazed at the price of the larger pieces of petrified wood.Some of the ranchers in the area surrounding the National Park have discovered that by digging down to the strata containing the wood, they can uncover huge pieces of the wood. I had a friend, long since dead, who owned a rock shop. He had worked all his life scrapping out a living on the Plateau and for his retirement he purchased this Rock Shop. Through an agreement with one of the mining ranchers, he obtained a huge piece of highly agatized wood. He rigged a huge mineral saw and spent months sawing the hard quartz into a giant slabs. He then spent many more weeks and months polishing the slabs. He told me that he sold one slab to the Smithsonian and one to museum in Japan. He said in those two sales, he made more money than he had in many years of entire working life. We have always had chunks of wood around our houses both inside and out. Most of which we have found ourselves. I do not believe I have ever spent a dime for a piece of petrified wood. I know of some areas that have concentrations of petrified wood that rival the National Park although I am not likely to tell you, or anyone else, where they are."},

When I arrived in the Valley, about 1953, there were no \"freeways,\" in fact, there were not many paved streets. (compared to 2010). Here is a copy of the Street Arterial Plan for Phoenix in 1949. The northern most visible arterial east/west street is Indian School Road. The furthest west street is 23rd Avenue, the furthest east street is about 32nd Street, but it isn't marked on the map. The furthest east marked street is 20th Street. In looking at the map, it is interesting that Madison is marked as the major one-way east street south of Jefferson. What happened is that Washington became the major street and now does not end at 17th Avenue but continues on around the capitol building to 19th Avenue. Roosevelt did not become a major arterial, today it is definitely a local city street. McDowell, Thomas and Indian School are definitely major arterial streets. Also interesting is that the State Route 51 Freeway/Interstate 10 (south from the 202 to the Papago Freeway) is approximately along the corridor shown as 20th Street. Phoenix's Freeways are extremely efficient, there are times when travel is restricted during rush hours, but most of the time you can travel at the posted speed limit all the way across and around the city. One thing I have noticed is that if you have to travel to get to a freeway, it is almost always just as fast to travel the main streets, I never go out of my way to use a freeway. Phoenix is laid out on a north/south/east/west grid and there is no advantage to taking the freeway if there is not one close to your starting point and destination."},

In another photo, showing the same process there is a large tractor being used to pull the cars, one at a time, across the wash. Do you think Arizona road builders and drivers learned anything from these early experiences? Have you driven across the Salt River when there is water? The answer is not much. Arizona roads seem to close down for all sorts of reasons, lately for forest fires. I cannot count the times I have been in a long line of cars, waiting for some remote event to happen, usually clearing a traffic accident, but the experience is essentially the same and has been for the last hundred years or so."},

There are several varieties of the Washintonia but only one, the Washingtonia filifera is native to the Western U.S.  As the leaves grow, the older leaves die and form a skirt of dead leaves around the trunk. This dry skirt is a nuisance and in the summer thunderstorm season it is not uncommon for lightning to strike the palms and start a fire. Growing up in the Salt River Valley, I expected palm trees. I would guess there are well over a million of them growing in the city. It would be difficult to take a picture of the city and not show at least one palm tree, unless you tried to do so on purpose. One of my most intense memories was waking up in Argentina on my first day there. I arrived in the middle of the night and could not see anything on the trip from the airport. That morning I woke up early and opened the door to the room where I was staying. It was on the second floor, and right in front of the door was the top of a palm tree. I knew I was not going to be homesick.One of my favorite Spanish poets is José Martí, who wrote:Yo soy un hombre sincero De donde crece la palma Y antes de morirme quiero Echar mis versos del alma.This quote is from Martí, José. Versos sencillos de José Martí. La Colección  \"El ciervo herido\". La Habana: [\"La Veronica,\" Imprenta de M.  Altolaguirre, 1939. Martí was a revolutionary poet in Cuba and a national hero. Quoting from Wikipedia, \"Martí is considered one of the great turn-of-the-century Latin American  intellectuals. His written works consist of a series of poems, essays, letters, lectures, a novel, and  even a children's magazine.  He wrote for numerous Latin American and American newspapers;  he also founded a number of newspapers himself. His newspaper Patria  was a key instrument in his campaign for Cuban independence. After his  death, one of his poems from the book, \"Versos  Sencillos\" (Simple Verses) was adapted to the song, \"Guantanamera,\"  which has become the definitive patriotic song of Cuba.\""},
{"title": "Goodbye, Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum", "date": "Friday, June 18, 2010", "text": "One of Arizona's lesser known attractions is one of its best. Quoting from its understated website, the Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum has over \"3,000 minerals, rocks, fossils and mining artifacts are on  exhibit. Highlighting the collection are the colorful minerals from  Arizona's copper mines. Among the spectacular individual specimens on  display are an eight-foot specimen of native copper, a large quartz  geode - each half weighing 240 pounds, rocks from the first Moon  landing,  and a fragment of Meteor Crater's meteorite weighing 206 pounds. Exhibits of special interest encompass cases devoted to the lapidary  arts featuring cabochons made of minerals from throughout Arizona,  faceted gemstones, carved semi-precious bowls and spheres, well-known  Arizona specimen localities, displays on mineral crystal systems,  habits,  causes of color, fulgarites, and fluorescent minerals.\"I have seen some of the largest and most impressive displays of minerals in the U.S. and the Arizona museum ranks up there with some of the most spectacular mineral specimens I have seen, including the annual Tucson Gem and Mineral Show. My favorites include a number of stunning examples of dioptase and some other incredible copper minerals. I also enjoy the meteorite collection.There is an impressive collection of fulgarites (fused sand or minerals from lightening strikes) and many other rare and interesting items.It helps to have a basic understanding of minerals in order to begin to appreciate what you are looking at. It also helps to have gone to a lot of mineral shows so you can appreciate how much money some of these specimens would command if sold on the market.Unfortunately, the Museum is presently embroiled in a legislative controversy. Please read this blog post entitled \"What's Happening to the Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum.\" Essentially, the State passed Arizona House Bill 2251 which will destroy the Museum and which established the 5C Arizona Centennial Museum which is to be constructed  in the building currently occupied by the Arizona Mining and Mineral  Museum.  The new museum will purportedly celebrate the 5Cs (citrus, climate, cattle,  cotton, & copper) which presumably were the origin of Arizona’s  economy, and are claimed to be depicted on the state seal. There are a lot of politics going on with this bill, none of which will ultimately benefit either the current Museum or the State of Arizona.So what will happen to the valuable and beautiful minerals? Nobody is saying. How about selling them to the highest bidder? At least those who bought them would appreciate what they had, unlike the State."},
{"title": "The Arizona State Capitol", "date": "Wednesday, June 16, 2010", "text": "Hmmm. Somewhere in this picture is the Arizona State Capitol building. Sitting high on a hill overlooking the verdant Salt River Valley, the Arizona State Capitol building is known for its Greco-Roman-Territorial design. People travel from all over the world to see this magnificent building. Dream on. Actually, you can drive right by it and never even notice it. If you look really carefully, you can just see the top of the copper coated dome. This picture is take from in front of the Arizona Mining and Mineral Museum which is housed in a much more impressive structure than the capitol only about two blocks away. OK some of what I said at first isn't exactly correct, but it is Neoclassical territorial in design. From the Wikimedia CommonsAsked why Arizona has the ugliest state capitol in the United States, John F. Kennedy's Secretary of Interior Stewart Udall commented,  \"Because we missed the boat and muffed the ball when we       rejected the Oasis Project designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.\" Wright had designed a fantastic Oasis for Arizona and donated the plans to the State. As set out in a site about Wright,The plan called for a 400 foot wide       area of fountains, gardens, and reflecting pools covered gazebo  style by a       hexagonal latticework dome of crenellated concrete.  An enormous       spire similar to that of the First Christian Church would top off  the       dome.  Two hexagonal copper-domed halls, one on each side of the       garden oasis, would be the House and Senate chambers.  Other wings       would house the governor's offices, the Supreme Court,  legislatures'       offices, and a 250 seat restaurant.  The plan for a 212,000 square       foot complex had a drawback greater than its estimated 1960 cost  of $5       million:  It would require moving the capitol from its 1700 W.       Washington location to Papago Park.  In true Wright style, he had       selected a location whose spectacular land formation would  compliment the       unique design.  Instead, the state opted to erect conventional       box-like buildings in front of the original 1900 capitol building  to house       the legislature, and a high rise box behind the capitol building  for the       governor and executive offices.Surrounding the present Arizona State Capitol are some of the worst and most run down industrial districts in the entire Salt River Valley. Unless you stand right in front of the capitol building you can hardly see it. Too bad about Wright's design."},

{"title": "We were walking in the air", "date": "Sunday, June 6, 2010", "text": "We were walking in the air, actually floating, but it was the most amazing and disorienting experience. A much as you can dream of flying, this is the closest you can come without leaving the surface of the earth. With an exact copy of the hills and cliffs below your kayak, you lost the normal perspective of up and down and literally felt like you were in the air. This once in a lifetime experience happened on a perfectly calm day when Blue Ridge Reservoir was almost full. Since calm days in the Arizona high country are rare and a full reservoir is even rarer, this combination will not likely happen again.The reference to \"Walking in the Air\" comes from a song written by Howard Blake for the 1982 animated film of Raymond Briggs' 1976 children's book The Snowman. The story relates the fleeting adventures of a young boy, and a snowman who has come to life. In the second part of the story, the boy and the snowman fly to the North Pole. \"Walking in the Air\" is the theme for the journey. In the film the song was performed by St. Paul's Cathedral choirboy Peter Auty. For the subsequent single release, which reached number five in the UK pop charts in 1985, the vocals were sung by Welsh chorister Aled Jones, who became a popular celebrity on the strength of his performance. Jones' version was not an official The Snowman tie-in though it was authorised by Howard Blake."},

When I first started taking pictures, when I was about twelve, I ran to get my camera when there was a beautiful sunset.

Film never did preserve the essence of the sunset and even digital images look washed out and tame compared to the real thing. I think sunsets are there to remind us that beauty has a purpose in turning our hearts towards eternity.

{"title": "Weaver's Needle", "date": "Tuesday, May 25, 2010", "text": "Weaver's Needle or El Sombrero is a famous landmark in the Superstition Mountains east of the Salt River Valley. This picture was taken many years ago in about 1996 from the Fremont Saddle, at the top of the Fremont Trail, looking southwest toward the Needle and Boulder Canyon. The terrain is more rugged that even the picture can show. Cross country travel, without following one of the established trails can become virtually impossible. The topographical map of the area will give you some idea of the difficulty of the area, although the Needle is practically invisible. The summit elevation of Weaver's Needle is 4553 feet. I remember the view from the top. One interesting thing is that the Needle is not visible from almost anyplace in the Salt River Valley, the main ridge of the Superstition Mountains visible from most of the east valley blocks the view. So, from the top you can see very little of the almost surrounding city. The climb up is quite difficult. Click here for a pretty good description of the climb. You might want to read an interesting story about a fatal fall from the Needle back in the year I climbed it, 1963. Here's my story:My Senior year, I got two friends, and we decided to climb Weavers Needle. Now, this was before the Grand Tetons Climbing School and real equipment. At the time I was driving a Triumph Herald, a little blue car, and we loaded up the car with some water and a lunch and an old nylon rope that the other boy had and drove out to the Superstition Mountains.Weavers Needle is also known as the Sombrero. It is an eroded volcanic cone with shear cliffs all around. It is about 4300 feet high and the cliffs are over 1500 feet high. I had heard that some crazy woman had hired two miners to look for the Lost Dutchman Mine on top of the Needle and one of the miners had fallen to his death while trying to descend the cliffs. As I found out much later, the stories were true and even more bizarre than the rumors. While going down the mountain, the miner had lost his grip and slid down the rope until his gloves were burned off his hands and he fell. I had heard. Someone told me that there was a crack on the south side of the Needle that could be climbed. We hiked to the base of the Needle. The hike in is quite rough and about 5 miles long but at that time it seemed like a cakewalk. We practically ran the whole way. When we got to the bottom of the Needle we could see that there was a huge crack going clear to the top on the south side. We climbed up the base of the mountain and found that the cliff near the bottom was not that steep and soon we were many hundreds of feet up the mountain. We finally reached the steep cliff and to our surprise there was a rope hanging down from the top. It was a huge 1 inch hemp rope, like the kind they use for rope climbing in schools. Using the rope we found the climb up to the top to be relatively simple. Right at the top there was a huge chock stone blocking the way but we were able to climb under the stone and make our way up onto the top of the peak.It turned out that the top was almost flat and about the size of a basketball court. There were two parts. The one to the west was a little larger and by jumping to the chock stone and then to the other side you could move from side to side. Surprisingly, there were a few people up there. There was some evidence of digging on the east side of the peak. We walked around for a while and looked out across the desert. Weavers Needle is the highest peak around for a long way. The view was tremendous. However, to the south, there is the main Superstition Mountain and it blocks the view entirely into the Salt River Valley. Weavers Needle cannot be seen from the Valley. It can only be seen by driving to the north on either the east or west sides of the Superstition Mountains.We decided that we had been up there long enough and started to climb down. Both my friends went quickly down the chock stone and on down the fixed rope. I was soon left to climb down alone. I had no trouble getting down the chock stone and I started down the fixed rope. My hands very quickly got tired. They were so tired I started to have difficulty holding onto the rope. I was still at least 100 feet up the cliff and if I fell I would surely die.I struggled to keep my grip on the rope. My hands were getting so tired that I could no longer keep from slipping slowly down the rope even if I tried with all my strength to stop. I began to be very afraid and started praying for some kind of help. I finally started to slip and told my Heavenly Father that I had done all I could and that I would probably fall to my death.Suddenly, a thought came into my head. I remembered seeing the circus and seeing the trapeze artists wrap the rope around one leg to “stand” on the rope. I quickly wrapped the rope around my leg, even though it was very heavy. I immediately stopped slipping could partially rest my hands. But I couldn’t move down the rope because it was too heavy. I was hanging in a deep crack in the cliff face with ridges on both sides of me. The rock was shear and I couldn’t see anything to hold onto. As I hung on the rope with my leg, I began to turn slowly to the left. As I swung around, right there in front of my eyes was a big metal spike, actually a piece of rebar, pounded into the rock. I lunged for the iron rod and quickly pulled myself onto the cliff. After resting for a few seconds, I discovered that the climb down on the other side of the ridge was not that difficult and I was quickly at the bottom without further incident. I have been forever thankful for the iron rod that saved my life.In later years the symbolism of the iron rod saving my life has occurred to me many times. The true “iron rod” the “word of God” has saved my eternal life just as the iron rod on the cliff saved my life from falling.We hiked back to my car and started to drive home. The road out from the Peralta Trailhead at that time was all dirt and quite rough. As we drove out, I am sure quite a bit faster than I should have been driving, we came up out of a wash with a turn at the top and there was an old pickup truck driving in the middle of the road. I swerved and skidded sideways just missing the truck by inches. The car then spun around and ended up off the road on a dirt bank pointed almost straight up into the air.We climbed out of the car and tried to push it off the dirt bank. It was totally stuck. Another passing car stopped and offered to help pull us off the dirt bank. We tied the nylon rope, doubled a few times, between the two cars and the passing car tried to pull my Triumph off the dirt. Not only did the car not move, even with all of us pushing, but the rope broke. It was not going to go anywhere. You would think after almost falling to my death on the cliff, I would have been a little more careful, at least for while, wouldn’t you? The passing car left and we were stranded, staring at the stuck Triumph. I finally thought about the low gear that the car had. First gear in the Triumph was so low that it would only go about 3 miles an hour top speed. But it would spin the tires all day. I got into the car, put the car in First and drove forward. I went right over the dirt bank and then was able to backup onto the road. We drove home the rest of the way without incident."},

The Lake is now a State Park which first opened in July of 1961. Quoting from the State Park website:Lyman Lake State Park is located in northeastern Arizona along the Little Colorado River in Apache County between St. Johns and Springerville just off of US 191. This 1500 maximum surface acre lake is an irrigation district reservoir that can experience a considerable annual draw down for irrigation purposes.

{"title": "A Real Cowboy", "date": "Tuesday, May 18, 2010", "text": "There haven't been too many cowboy movies made for the last few years, at least not many I would go to see, but the Hollywood concept of the cowboy has forever colored the reality of living in the old west with the primary occupation of tending cows. If you needed to know what a real cowboy looked like, here is an almost hundred year old photo of one. You will notice the hat, but if you look closely, you can see the chaps. You may miss the closed toe stirrups. Which by the way, are coming back into style. The front enclosure is now called, by some manufacturers, the \"safety cage.\"Years ago when I was out with one of my friends riding horses out on the Colorado Plateau, a car load of tourists stopped and got out of their cars and took our picture. When they left we laughed so hard we almost fell off our horses, here were two boys from Phoenix, right in the middle of a large city, who the tourists thought looked like typical cowboys.Being a cowboy was no great honor. It was dirty, hard work with little or no reward. There is nothing romantic about living outdoors with cows. The stylized version of the Old West, was a fiction. My grandparents grew up in the Old West, and they were nothing at all like any of the fictional accounts. They were tough characters physically, but my great-grandfather, who was a real cowboy, was described in his obituary in major newspapers as \"a man of remarkable industry, temperate habits, generous disposition, and unswerving integrity.\" Does that remind you of any Hollywood cowboys?"},
{"title": "Where I grew up in Arizona", "date": "Sunday, May 16, 2010", "text": "When I was very young, my family traveled around the country because my father was in the Air Force (technically the Army Air Corps). For some years I lived in Massachusetts while my father went to law school. Some of my earliest memories were of places in and around Boston. My real life in Arizona started when I was about five years old and our family moved to a small town in eastern Arizona called St. Johns. I was five years old and remember a few things about the trip across the U.S. from Massachusetts to St. Johns. If I had been any older, I would have had a cultural shock, moving from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts to St. Johns, Arizona population at the time about 1600 or 1700 people. One thing I specifically remember is waking up in St. Johns the first day we arrived. The sun was shining and I could see out the window to the orchard, visible in the picture above. The windows of the house were rather large and low to the ground and I opened the screen with its little lock and climbed out the window to explore the backyard. As you can see, the trees were wonderful for climbing and the grass and weeds were high enough to form a make-believe jungle. It was an almost perfect place to live for a five year old. The big elm tree behind me in the picture is long gone and so is the orchard. Almost all the trees from that time have died. Even the road that runs next to the property, in the background of the picture is gone. Since I ran out into that orchard, a lot of miles and years have passed by. I don't know when I realized it, but at some point I stopped feeling sad about how things were and started realizing I liked things pretty much as they are. I like Phoenix, I like Mesa, I like the big city and I like living in my suburban neighborhood. I no longer wish I could return to St. Johns as it was. But I will always remember that magic day with the sun shining on the orchard.   I found this photo and the accompanying explanation in a box of old photographs. The Navajo Meteorite is presently in the Field Museum of Chicago, Illinois. There is an interesting online book about the meteorite as follows:Roy, Sharat Kumar, and Robert Kriss Wyant. The Navajo Meteorite.  1949. There were two meteorites discovered very near to each other near Sanders, Arizona. Although the larger of the two, shown above, was known to the Navajo Indians since their arrival on the Colorado Plateau in about 1600, the meteorite was officially \"discovered\" on July 10, 1921. Apparently, the meteorite had been covered by rocks to keep the white men and other Indians from finding it. I guess hiding it didn't work. Quoting from the book:They called it 'Pish le gin e gin' (black iron). They tell me that the marks were there when they first found it and they think the prehistoric pottery- makers cut them in.\" The marks referred to in the letter do not appear to be anything more unusual than marks made by someone in an effort to determine the nature of the mass. It should, however, be pointed out here that the chisels used to make the marks had wider blades than those generally used now, and that picture writings were found on rocks in nearby outcrops. Navajo II was discovered five years later. It lay about 160 feet northwest of Navajo I, buried in soil formed by outwash from the neighboring ridge. An upright rock was found standing beside it. Quoting further from the book:A peculiar feature of Navajo I- is a deep fissure that extends half way around it, in some places reaching a depth of six inches. About three inches from this fissure and generally parallel to it, another extends for a distance of a little more than a foot. The edges and walls of the fissure are smooth and rounded, indicating that they were subjected to heat and erosion during the meteor's flight to the earth. They also indicate that the fissures were formed, not from the impact of the meteorite upon the earth, but from shock and air pressure after it reached the earth's atmosphere and prior to its fall. The finders of the meteorite stated that at the time of the find there were many loose fragments of the meteorite in the fissures. These fragments, with the exception of one, were dug out and carried away by souvenir hunters while negotiations for the purchase of the meteorite were in progress. The one fragment that was left had an irregular, finger-like shape and measured about two inches in length. Fragments such as these suggest that, unlike the fissures, the fractures were formed from the impact of the meteorite upon the rocky surface, and that considerable disintegration had taken place within them since the fall. Both the fissures and the fractures could have served as receptacles for the retention of water, which is an effective disintegrating and dissolving agent. Polished and etched slices of the meteorite reveal a number of veins of schreibersite of irregular width and varying course. In places these have decomposed to limonite, and, where the decomposition has advanced far enough, the slices are broken up into small pieces easily. It is not improbable that veins of schreibersite may have existed along the fissures, and such a process of decomposition may have been in action, resulting in the formation of the fragments referred to above.You never know what you might find walking around in Arizona. I guess if I were a Navajo, I might be a bit put out at the negotiations that happened about the \"sale\" of the meteorites to the museum."},

One the high Colorado Plateau in northern Arizona and southern Utah, high winds can start waves of tumbleweeds moving across the dry desert. But if you were suddenly transported back in time to the mid-1800s you would find that all the tumbleweeds had disappeared. In fact, the plant, really called by the common name, Russian Thistle and is native to the Ural Mountains of Russia. To quote Wikipedia, \"Salsola is a genus of herbs, subshrubs, shrubs, and  small trees  in the family Chenopodiaceae, native to Africa, Asia, and Europe.  Plants in this genus typically grow on flat, often dry and/or somewhat saline  soils, with some species in salt  marshes. A few species are tumbleweeds. Recent genetic studies have however shown that the genus as traditionally circumscribed is paraphyletic, and many species are likely to be  transferred to other genera in the future.\"A typical plant can have 250,000 seeds which are widely disbursed by the rolling action of the plant. It will grow at any temperature between 28 degrees to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. Each seed is a coiled, embryonic plant wrapped in a thin membrane. The plant was first reported in South Dakota in 1877 and by 1900 had spread to the West Coast of the U.S.Since I wasn't around before 1877, I have always had tumbleweeds as part of my desert experience. It is frightening to have a large tumbleweed blow in front of your car as you are speeding down the highway, but it you hit it, it disintegrates. We used to gather them up for bonfires, they are usually so dry they take only a few seconds to burn, but the blaze in very entertaining to young boys."},

{"title": "Gardening is FUNdamental - May", "date": "Saturday, May 8, 2010", "text": "May is the month of heat and weeds.  You may not be able to do anything about the heat, but you can certainly do something about the weeds.  If you are a close observer of weeds, you can watch the seasonal changes in the types of weeds that grow.  May is a transitional month.  The winter weeds are now going to seed and summer weeds are starting to grow.  Of course, among the most difficult of weeds is bermuda grass.  bermuda propagates by rhizomes, stolons and seeds; one of the few plants to spread in all three ways.  Rhizomes are the \"runners\" the grass sends out along the top of the ground.  Stolons are the sharp pointed shoots from the roots.  Many people chose to spray bermuda with poison.  I don't.  If you understand what makes bermuda grow and what doesn't it is not too difficult to control.  bermuda cannot stand shade or disturbed soil.  To get rid of bermuda either shade it out or cultivate the soil regularly and the grass will die out.  Regular cultivation may mean weeding as frequently as once or twice a week.  If you have a bermuda grass lawn that you want to convert to a garden dig and rake out most of the grass then rototill the ground every week or so for about 2 or 3 months and the grass will be gone.  However, bermuda is not forgiving.  If you leave the grass alone for 3 or 4 weeks it will be back in force.  bermuda can grow as much as 3 or 4 inches a day! May is the month for planting citrus.  As a general rule, the smaller the plant the sooner it will become established and bear fruit.  I have had the best results with 5 gallon citrus.  The large trees cannot bear fruit any faster than the roots become established.  More plants are killed from over-watering than almost any other cause.  Watering is something that must be done on a strict schedule, especially for trees.  A walk through the neighborhood will show many citrus trees that either do not thrive or do not produce.  Most of the problem is the watering schedule.  Citrus needs to be watered on a strict schedule;  every ten days during the summer, (even when it rains,) every two weeks during the spring and fall and once a month during the winter.  The watering should be done in a basin around the base of the tree with water standing in the basin for from five to ten hours. There are very few vegetables that can be planted during May.  If you are interested you can plant okra, sweet potatoes and soy beans.  In our area the trees we planted (or that previous owners planted) are now maturing.  Remember that vegetables need full sun (with some few exceptions).  If you feel like you need to do something for your garden in May go buy a good heavy hoe.  The weak little traditional eastern hoe just doesn't make a dent in Mesa soil.  I have found that a three prong cultivator is very effective and fast for airing the soil and getting rid of most of the weeds."},

{"title": "Snow in the Canyon", "date": "Tuesday, May 4, 2010", "text": "The south rim of the Grand Canyon is a land of extremes. In the depths of the Canyon the temperatures can reach above 110 degrees Fahrenheit , while on the same day the temperature can be thirty to forty degrees lower on the rim. During one trip into the Canyon, we left the North Rim with a temperature of 18 degrees. When we reached Phantom Ranch along the Colorado River, the temperature was over 100 degrees. Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim is often the coldest weather reporting station in Arizona. Although most of Arizona is considered to be a desert, there is enough snow that the North Rim is closed from October 15 to May 15 every year. We have had blizzard conditions on the South Rim with high winds and blowing snow. To quote the National Weather Service:Winter conditions on the South Rim can be extreme.  Be prepared for snow, icy roads and trails, and possible road closures.  Winter weather typically begins by November and becomes well entrenched  by December and January, with frequent light to moderate snows and  increasingly colder weather. Low temperatures are generally in the teens  along the Rim; however afternoon high temperatures still average in the  40s (4-9°C), due to the amount of sunshine the area receives. Along the  river, cold air typically becomes trapped in the canyon leading to high  temperatures only in the 40s and 50s (4-15°C) and low temperatures in  the 30s and 40s (-1C-+9°C). Even with all of the winter sunshine,  significant snowfall can be expected during the winter with an average  snowfall of 50 to over 100 inches (1.3-2.5m) per year on the Rim, and  occasionally snow will make it even to the river. Between storms, when  dry high pressure builds in, winds become light, and fresh snow cover is  on the ground, minimum temperatures can plummet, especially on the Rim,  with sub-zero temperatures likely. Snow continues to be possible at the  higher elevations through April. During the winter and early spring  months, fog occasionally forms due to radiational cooling from snow  cover on the ground. However, this fog usually breaks up quickly by  morning."},
{"title": "Gila Valley LDS Temple Open House", "date": "Saturday, May 1, 2010", "text": "The Gila Valley lies in eastern Arizona along the upper Gila River. It is a huge open east-west valley with high mountains to the south and a lower range to the north. The valley has a very long history of habitation, being full of Indian ruins and the remnants of ancient canals. The earliest European inhabitants came from Mexico. There were Mexican settlements as early as 1871. Other settlers came from parts of Arizona and elsewhere because of the rich mines in the area to the north of the valley.The first explorers from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints arrived in the valley in 1878 and settlement began the following year. Many of the prominent families in Arizona are descendants of these early pioneers. Throughout the long history of the LDS Church in the Gila Valley, the members have had to travel great distances and great personal expense to attend a Temple for marriages and to perform the sacred work for the dead. In April of 2008 the Church announced its intention to build a Temple in the Gila Valley. The Temple is now complete and an Open House has been ongoing since April 23, 2010. The Temple will be dedicated on May 23, 2010. Click here for pictures taken during the construction."},
{"title": "A Saguaro Forest", "date": "Tuesday, April 27, 2010", "text": "Saguaros seem to grow randomly across the lower Sonora Desert, but each one has a history starting with an individual nursery plant. Conditions have to be just right for the relatively small saguaro seeds to sprout and the tiny plants must be protected from adverse conditions that might prevent their growth. In every case, the saguaro grows very near another plant, the nursery plant, that acts as a sun shield and helps the slow growing newly sprouted saguaro to grow. It is not uncommon for the saguaro to far outlive its nursery plant helper living more than 200 years. Stands of saguaros such as these, seem to grow mostly on the warmer south-facing hill sides.The distribution of all plants depends on moisture, soil conditions and temperature. Saguaros are no exception. They do not grow over about 3000 feet in elevation because of the possibility of hard freezes. The cactus is usually found on gravelly slopes or rocky ridges. Despite the advertising and cartoon association of saguaros with deserts around the world, they are only found in the Lower Sonoran Zone of the deserts in certain parts of Arizona and northern Sonora, Mexico. There are a few specimens along the Colorado River in California.  One of the few U.S. National Monuments that have full-time residents, Canyon de Chelly is one of the longest continuously inhabited locations in North America. When I was younger, our family made annual treks via Navajo guided tours into the canyon. The four-wheel-drive trucks too almost the entire day to travel to the canyon's upper reaches, viewing ancient ruins amid the perpendicular canyon walls. The National Monument is comprised entirely of Navajo Tribal Trust Land that is still home to members of the Tribe. Except for one trail, down the canyon walls to the White House Ruin, all parts of the Canyon are closed to visitors unless accompanied by licensed Navajo Nation guides. Travel into the Canyon is not inexpensive, a day long tour can cost as much as $50.00 per hour or more per person.The Canyon is a mixture of the very old and the very new. It is claimed that there are over 2700 archaeological sites withing the Canyon. The floor of the Canyon is mostly soft sand and when wet or dry requires careful driving. The entrance to the Canyon is almost in the center of the small town of Chinle. When I was young, the entrance to the Canyon was undeveloped and had beautiful sand dunes nearby. Now, there are buildings right up to almost the entrance of the Canyon. The whole area is surprisingly small. You can drive completely around the Canyon in a few hours on paved roads and never see into the Canyon.I think it is one of the most spectacular places in the world and although the area around the Canyon has been subject to development, the Canyon itself has been beautifully preserved."},

{"title": "John Wesley Powell", "date": "Friday, April 23, 2010", "text": "Did you know that John Wesley Powell's brain is housed in jar at the Smithsonian Institution? Powell willed his brain to science and so it now rests in a preservative. He also left body parts in Tennessee at the battle of Shiloh (Pittsburg Landing) in April of 1862. Quoting from the United States Geographic Service:Powell was made captain of Battery F, 2d Illinois Artillery Volunteers at the end of the year. A few weeks later, he and his battery were ordered to Pittsburg Landing on the Tennessee River. During the Battle of Shiloh, on April 6, as Powell gave the signal to fire, a Minie ball struck his wrist and plowed into his arm. The wound was so severe that his arm had to be amputated below the elbow.Powell was instrumental in founding and gaining legislation for the USGS.In the spring of 1878, Congress investigated the rivalry among the western surveys but was unable to come to a satisfactory conclusion. They called on the National Academy of Sciences for advice, and the academy in turn called on Powell and others for suggestions. Legislation embodying the academy plan that contained many of Powell's ideas was introduced, but before it was finally enacted several provisions were eliminated, including one of special interest to Powell—a proposal to change the public land system. The bill that was passed on March 3, 1879, provided for the establishment of the U.S. Geological Survey, discontinuation of the western surveys, and appointment of a commission to codify the public land laws. Powell became a member of the commission, and Clarence King, who had been in charge of the Geologic Exploration of the 40th Parallel, the first of the national surveys authorized by Congress, became the first Director of the U.S. Geological Survey.He is most famous for his trips of exploration down the Colorado River and of course, because of his namesake, Lake Powell. The picture above is the Powell Memorial at the South Rim of the Grand Canyon commemorating his first and second voyages down the Colorado River in 1869 and 1872."},

{"title": "Into the Grand Canyon", "date": "Tuesday, April 20, 2010", "text": "Hiking into the Grand Canyon is an unparalleled experience in an upside down world of mountains that go down rather than up. It is the reverse of climbing a mountain. As you descend into the Canyon, your vision narrows and the grand vistas of the rim become views of cliffs and flat topped mesas. Instead of feeling cool breezes and catching glimpses of expansive vistas, the walls close in and the air becomes increasingly warmer. The trails are rough and steep. There are no leisurely walks into the Grand Canyon. The minute you step off the rim, you are committed to climbing back out. Any energy you have to climb will have to be used on the return trip.Some trails are narrow catwalks along cliffs with thousands of feet of exposure. Others are endless trails across huge flat valleys where you lose all sense of being in a canyon, you are instead walking across a plain with mountains in the distance, only these mountains are really the canyon walls. On the rim, you see people dancing on the rocks, taking pictures as they hang out over the cliffs because on the rim there is no sense of scale, nothing to tell you how far it is to the next level down into the canyon.Viewed from above, the people on the canyon trails seem to be walking in slow motion as they seem to crawl endlessly across tiny trails. Walking inside of the Canyon gives you the same feeling, the distances are so great, your progress across the huge flat expanses appears to last forever. There are no short cuts. Trails in the Canyon are there either because they have been there from ancient times or because they were constructed with picks and shovels and dynamite. Leaving the trails to attempt to travel cross country usually ends in tragedy and sometimes death. The Canyon is never forgiving of carelessness nor foolishness.The vision of the Colorado River, away in the distance, does nothing to lessen the desert dry nature of the Canyon. There is little water and springs and streams are far between and mostly inaccessible.There are only a few places left in Arizona, or anywhere else for that matter, that are so wild, so inaccessible and so remote, that they can truly be said to be wilderness. The inner depths of the Grand Canyon is still one of those rare places."},
{"title": "Mogollon Rim", "date": "Sunday, April 18, 2010", "text": "Originally called the Mogollon Plateau, the Rim is one of the most striking geographic features in Arizona. Running across the state from the southeast to the northwest, it is most prominent in the area in northern Gila County. The top of the Rim varies from 6500 to over 7500 feet above sea level and the country below the Rim is almost 1000 feet lower. When I was young, I had no idea how to spell the name because it is pronounced \"muggy-on\" by most of the locals. Later, I learned that the Rim was in reality the edge of the vast Colorado Plateau. It took me a while to put all of the geography together, because in the area shown above, the cliffs do not look at all like the sandstone of the Four Corners area. Most of the rock is a weathered green rather than the striking pinks and reds of the canyon country to the north. But, notwithstanding its appearance, the Rim is still mostly sandstone and limestone.When I was young, the Rim was a wild and lonely place with almost no roads and those that did exist were dirt or mud when it rained. We could go for hours without seeing a car or another person while traveling along the Rim. Now, with a number of wide highways crossing the Rim country, it is not only accessible but crowded on many days during the summer. There are still areas of solitude, but the wilderness atmosphere is long gone.The top of the Rim, and most of the land below the Rim is one vast Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa var.          scopulorum) forest, said to be the largest Ponderosa Pine forest on the continent. OK, now what that really means is that the other large forests in North America just have different types of trees, usually because they have more water. Even though this huge forest is green and inviting, it is really a desert forest. Annual rainfall amounts are well below most other large forested areas. Quoting from the Land Use History of North America, Colorado Plateau from Northern Arizona University,Before European settlement, widespread surface fires that occurred every           2-15 years favored grasses and limited pine densities. Early  explorers          described majestic, open stands with rich grasses and occasional  shrubs          beneath, as young ponderosa seedlings were often killed by the  low-intensity          fires while mature pines, with their thick yellowish red bark,  were only          scarred. The effects of grazing and fire suppression          since the late 1880s on ponderosa pine forests have been  profound, including          a shift to forests with very high tree densities, which in turn  has contributed          to destructive forest fires. Separate web pages give more detail  on ponderosa          pine fire ecology and reintroduction           of fire to forest ecosystems. Two longer research essays, Changed           Southwestern Forests: Resource effects and management remedies,  and          Restoring  Ecosystem Health in          Ponderosa Pine Forests of the Southwest are also available  in this          website."},

Outbreaks in people           still occur in rural communities or in cities. They are  usually associated             with infected rats and rat fleas that live in the home. In  the United             States, the last urban plague epidemic occurred in Los  Angeles in           1924-25. Since then, human plague in the United States has  occurred           as mostly             scattered           cases in rural areas (an average of 10 to 15 persons each  year). Globally,             the World Health Organization reports 1,000 to 3,000 cases  of plague             every           year.

Most human cases in the United States occur in two  regions:             1) northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, and southern  Colorado;           and 2)           California, southern Oregon, and far western Nevada.

From Wikipedia, \"Ocotillo poles are a common fencing material in their native region, and often  take root to form a living  fence. Owing to light weight and an interesting pattern, these have  been used for canes or walking sticks.\"Because they are nearly straight, Native American Indians used the plant as a source of ribs for their shelters.

The landscapers have moved on to dwarf varieties of various plants some of which are not adapted at all to the low desert. One extreme example is the predominance of Ficus trees of a certain age. Because of the raising temperatures in the valley, these tropical plants have grown to huge sizes.

{"title": "Mail Creek, Arizona -- Could you guess?", "date": "Wednesday, April 7, 2010", "text": "This is Mail Creek, just below the Mogollon Rim, before it joins the upper East Verde River near Washington Park, Gila County, Arizona. At this point the creek is just about 6000 feet above sea level and is part of the Central Highlands. The Rim, behind all the trees to the north, is the edge of the Colorado Plateau and the rocks in the picture are a mixture of granite and rhyolite with the sandstone and limestone of the plateau. Quoting from Arizona Roadside Geology from Northern Arizona University:   Unlike the Colorado Plateau to the north, igneous and metamorphic  rocks are well exposed in many areas in this region.  In several  areas granitic plutons have intruded into overlying sedimentary  rocks.  The heat and water associated with this magma caused  intense mineralization of nearby rocks, particularly limestone,  and copper minerals formed.  These valuable copper deposits have  been mined historically and are being mined today in the  Clifton-Morenci area and the Globe-Miami area.  The mines contain  low-grade ore (not very concentrated) so huge open-pit mines have  been dug to extract enough rock to gather the copper.      Interestingly, some quartzite pebbles associated with  ranges  south and below the Mogollon Rim have been found in stream deposits  atop the rim and to the north.  How did they get there? It appears  that at one time at least one of the ranges of the Central  Highlands, the Mazatzal, was once above and connected to the  Colorado Plateau.  The Mogollon Rim did not yet exist, and  sediment from this range was shed northward onto the plateau.    This area is also known as the Apache Highlands Ecoregion. The vegetation is know as the Western Xeric Evergreen Forest and is a mixture of conifers and deciduous trees."},

This may seem counter-intuitive but when the sky is clear and the sun is shining, the Canyon looks sort-of like a painted backdrop, that is very flat. Even in the early morning and late evening, as the sun is going down, if the sky is clear the light is not nearly so photogenic. If you look at a lot of pictures of the Canyon, you will immediately see what I mean. Snow, lightning, thunderstorms, all help make dramatic pictures.The picture above was taken during a snow storm in the morning. If you are looking into the Canyon from the South Rim, it is easy to tell if the picture was taken in the morning or afternoon by which of the canyon walls are illuminated. In the background of the picture above, you can see the sun highlight on the North Rim. Given the time of year, early spring, the sun is from the East.If you look at old copies of Arizona Highways, you will see that practically every picture featured, especially those of the Grand Canyon, have a dramatic sky when it is part of the picture. Arizona Highways considers weather to be a \"huge bonus\" to picture taking."},
{"title": "Arizona's highest mountain -- Humphreys Peak", "date": "Thursday, April 1, 2010", "text": "At 12,637 feet above sea level, Humphreys Peak is the highest mountain in Arizona. It also the highest of a group of peaks the form the edge of a huge volcanic caldera known as the San Francisco Peaks. To quote Wikipedia,Humphreys Peak was named in about 1870 for General Andrew A. Humphreys, a U.S. Army officer who was a Union general during the American Civil War, and who later became Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps  of Engineers. However, a General Land Office map from 1903 showed the name San  Francisco Peak applied to this feature (apparently borrowed from San Francisco Mountain on which the peak stands).  Thus the United States Board on  Geographic Names approved the variant name in 1911. In 1933, the  application of the names was rectified.The picture above was taken southwest of the peak, looking towards the northeast. From the south or southeast, Humphreys Peak is hidden by the other peaks surrounding the caldera. \"A caldera is a cauldron-like volcanic  feature usually formed by the collapse of land following a volcanic  eruption such as the ones at Yellowstone National Park in the  US and Glen  Coe in Scotland. They are sometimes confused with volcanic craters. The word comes from Spanish caldera, and this from Latin CALDARIA,  meaning \"cooking pot\". In some texts the English term cauldron  is also used. Calderas are formed out of stratovolcanoes.\" Wikipedia. The Kachina Wilderness is the caldera, a huge bowl shaped cavity. Again from Wikipedia,Kachina Peaks Wilderness is a 18,616-acre (75 km2) wilderness area located approximately  6 miles (9.7 km) north of Flagstaff within the Coconino National Forest in the U.S.  state of Arizona. The Wilderness encompasses most of the upper reaches of the San Francisco Peaks including Humphreys Peak, Arizona's highest point at 12,643 feet  (3,854 m). The area is named for the Hopi gods, or Kachinas, whom according to Hopi mythology live  here for part of every year. In mid-summer these Gods fly from the top  of the peaks to the Hopi mesas as clouds bringing the rains of the  seasonal monsoons.  These peaks are sacred to tribes including the Havasupai,  Hopi, Navajo,  and Zuni.  Several religious shrines have been identified in the Wilderness, some  of which are still in use."},
{"title": "Grand Falls -- a question of scale", "date": "Tuesday, March 30, 2010", "text": "One of my last posts had a head-on view of the Grand Falls of the Little Colorado. OK so it looks like it could be the size of an irrigation ditch. If you really doubted how large these falls are, look very carefully in the lower left hand corner of the above picture. It helps if you click on the picture so you can see it full size. Down in the corner area are two orange round objects. Those are people with helmets. That's how big this waterfall is. Really! If you still don't believe me, look carefully at the junk floating in the river below the falls, on the left side of the floating mess there is a tire.This waterfall is not on most maps of Arizona, but there are a few of the state highway maps that show the location. If you look at the map, go just to the northeast of Flagstaff and you will see where the Little Colorado River turns sharply north, that is the location of the waterfall. The weather is hot in the summer and very cold in the winter. The wind blows almost every day of the year. Don't plan on seeing any water except at those rare times when the river is running and the snow is melting in the mountains. This is a typical view of the Little Colorado River when it is nearly flooding. This chocolate brown river winds its way across the Colorado Plateau. In this area of the Plateau, just at the west edge of the Navajo Indian Reservation, the river runs through an area almost devoid of trees. The Little Colorado is really three rivers, the first is a clear sparkling snow fed stream in the high White Mountains of Arizona. The second is this muddy, usually almost dry, desert river. The third and last is the deep canyon cut down to the level of the Colorado River in the bottom of the Grand Canyon. In the bottom of the canyon the river is bright blue, dyed by the minerals that line its banks.There are no major dams on the river, although there are a few smaller dams that produce small lakes. The largest lake along the river is the Lyman Reservoir about 15 miles south of the Apache County seat, St. Johns.If it had any water, which it usually doesn't, the Little Colorado River would rank as one of the more important rivers in the United States. It is 315 miles long and has a drainage area of about 25,000 square miles. The average flow is about 400 cubic feet per second (cfs). To compare, there are thousands of streams in the U.S. that have a higher average flow, not to even mention rivers. Unpredictably, it can become a raging torrent of over 120,000 cfs. Wikipedia."},

OK, so there is a big difference in the amount of water, especially in dry times of the year, but think about this huge waterfall at the end of a truck only dirt road, out in Navajo Indian Reservation. Despite the huge size and its chocolate brown water, it is almost totally ignored by everyone, especially the Indians who own the land. There is not so much as a sign on the nearest highway marking the road. As is usual, the wind blows 360 days out of the year and there is not a restroom (or even a tree) for miles in any direction.

I feel sorry for all those people who associate Arizona with dry, sandy wastes. Although it is hot in the summer, the rest of the year is usually delightful and in the Spring, spectacular. The picture above was taken in 2008 on a short loop drive in the east valley, out the Bush Highway and around by Saguaro Lake and back to the Beeline Highway. I just drove up to Globe yesterday and the desert is carpeted with flowers and scenes like the one above are common all along the lower desert roads. Temperatures are in the mid-70s and low 80s and the nights are cool and comfortable.  The colors are magnificent and the drive to Globe, if it had been for pleasure rather than business, would have completely delightful."},

Located along the eastern border of Scottsdale, this 14,000 acre park contains hiking trails, rock climbing areas and a huge variety of plants and animals. Early settlers in the Salt River Valley had little appreciation for the desert, considering all of the unihabited areas to be \"wasteland.\" Preservation of these former wastelands has almost come too little and too late. There are only a few areas around the Salt River Valley where the natural Sonoran desert is still in its original condition. Although the McDowell Sonoran Preserve is crossed by mining roads, now long abandoned, it is still a good example of how the desert looked in earlier, less settled times. As you can see from the photo, the \"wilderness\" around the greater Phoenix area directly abuts the development. The wilderness itself is its own transitional area. You step directly from paved subdivision roads into the designated wilderness park. Although it may not appear to be either rugged or very steep in the photo, the Tom's Thumb butte is at 3,925 above sea level. It is not unusual for the snow level to descend to about 4000 feet, making the McDowell Mountains on of the few places to see snow on cold winter's days after a storm."},

All of these photos and a few more are from the New York Public Library, NYPL Digital Gallery. The photographer was Carl Moon (1878 - 1948) and the photos are gelatin silver prints. They were originally copyrighted by Fred Harvey.Quoting from a Website by Tom Driebe:Carl Moon was born in Wilmington,  Ohio, he became a photographer, painter, and               illustrator who moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico as a  young man               where he operated a photography studio.                        In 1907, he moved into the Grand Canyon headquarters of  Fred               Harvey to manage Harvey's art business. He studied  landscape               painting with visiting artists Louis Akin, Thomas Moran,  and Frank               Sauerwein, and he also took many photographs and films of  Pueblo               Indians. In 1911, he married artist Grace Purdie and  settled in               Pasadena. He focused on landscape painting and  illustrating               children's stories co-authored with his wife. He was a  member of               The Cartoonist Club and the Pasadena Art Association.               Photographing               Native Americans in their natural state was the principal  aim of               Carl E. Moon. He tried to show the Indian as he lived  before               civilization hampered his freedom, warped his views of  life and               changed his picturesque customs and mode of dress. Long before rock climbers appropriated this term for their climbing aids, nature placed its own chockstones by gravity's effect on weathering rock. The highly weathered granite in Arizona provides a wealth of chockstones, some intricately pieced together like giant puzzles. Almost every crevice and crack in the rocks contain chockstones both large and small. Similar rounded  rocks stretch diagonally across the state from the southeast corner towards the northwest. In almost any trip traveling from the south to the north along Arizona's highways and roads, you can spot this band of similar looking rocks. The outcrops are not always granite, some are dacite and other types of rocks of volcanic origin, but the weathering processes are the same and the formations appear similar.Some of the parts of the band of rocks are pretty spectacular, such as those in Queen Creek Canyon just north of the mining town of Superior, Arizona. At least one of the areas in southeast Arizona has been made a national Monument, Chiricahua National Monument."},
{"title": "I-70 Glenwood Canyon Rockfall", "date": "Tuesday, March 9, 2010", "text": "Once again, this isn't exactly Arizona and I wasn't walking at the time, but these pictures show what happens when gravity, road engineering, and a lot of rain and snow get together. In keeping with our Salt River road engineering, here are the pictures of the same kind of damage in Colorado. (Pictures from the Colorado Department of Transportation)The green and sort-of yellowish stuff in the picture is lichen. Lichens are composite organisms consisting of a symbiotic  association of a fungus (the mycobiont) with a photosynthetic partner (the photobiont or  phycobiont), usually either a green  alga (commonly Trebouxia) or cyanobacterium  (commonly Nostoc). Since they grow on rocks in the deserts of Arizona, you can guess that they can withstand extreme heat, cold and dryness. Rock temperatures in the desert can be over 150 degrees which we commonly believe could cook eggs, but this extreme heat doesn't seem to bother lichen at all.Quoting from Wikipedia, \"The algal or cyanobacterial cells are photosynthetic, and as in plants they reduce  atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon sugars to feed both  symbionts. Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from  the atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the  alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral  nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the substrate. If a cyanobacterium  is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to  green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can fix atmospheric nitrogen, complementing the activities of  the green alga.\"The lichen appear in a lot of my photographs of the deserts. OK, guess what? People eat lichen. Again from Wikipedia,Lichens are eaten by many different cultures across the world.  Although some lichens are only eaten in times of famine, others are a  staple food or even a delicacy. Two obstacles are often encountered when  eating lichens: lichen polysaccharides are generally indigestible to  humans, and lichens usually contain mildly toxic secondary compounds that should be  removed before eating. Very few lichens are poisonous, but those high in  vulpinic acid or usnic  acid are toxic.[45]  Most poisonous lichens are yellow. In the past Iceland moss (Cetraria islandica) was an  important human food in northern Europe, and was cooked as a bread,  porridge, pudding, soup, or salad. Wila (Bryoria fremontii) was an important food in  parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked. Northern peoples  in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested reindeer lichen (Cladina spp.)  after they remove it from the rumen of  caribou or reindeer that have been killed. Rock tripe (Umbilicaria spp. and Lasalia  spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in  North America, and one species, Umbilicaria esculenta, is used in a  variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods.\""},

Quoting from The United States National Arboretum:The name “palo verde” means “green branch.”  The trees have thin green  bark on their trunks  and branches. During dry times, which may be most  of the year, the tree will  shed its delicate leaves to conserve  moisture.   The plant can continue to photosynthesize through the  chlorophyll in its  trunk and branches.  Arizona’s  palo verde is a true  desert dweller, and it frequently grows in the company of  the saguaro  cactus (Carnegia gigantea),  which is Arizona’s  state flower.   The palo verde often serves  as a “nurse plant” for saguaro cacti --  the cactus seedlings require a shaded,  moist environment in their first  few years of growth.  The palo verde is an attractive small tree   increasingly used as a street tree in the desert southwest.  In spring  the branches are covered with bright  yellow flowers, and the green  trunk adds interest through the rest of the year.  Three similar palo  verde species are native  in the Sonoran Desert  of Arizona.  There is  also a hybrid palo verde, Parkinsonia ‘Desert Museum’   possessing favorable characteristics for landscaping use.  The  legislation designating Arizona’s state tree does not select a   particular species of palo verde, but only specifies the genus Cercidium.   Studies of the North American Cercidium showed that our palo  verde  species belong in the same group as the African Parkinsonia.   This group of  plants has been reclassified as Parkinsonia,   since this was the earlier name in use."},

In addition, its real estate, even despite the downturn in the economy, is among the most expensive in the U.S.The above panorama was taken from the Pinnacle Peak trail, looking towards the west.  Contrary to most promotional shots of Scottsdale, the above photo is not enhanced, the haze and the color are about what you would expect to see. The area shown in the picture is considered to be north Scottsdale and is filled with very expensive subdivisions, many with view lots. When I was a teenager, I lived just west of the Scottsdale City limits in Phoenix. Since we lived just a block or so from the border between the cities, we considered ourselves part of Scottsdale. At that time, the City did not extend much north of Shea Boulevard. To the East, is the Salt River Indian Reservation, which marks most of the eastern boundary of Scottsdale then, as well as now. In those days, most of the roads across the Reservation were unpaved. Scottsdale had a very small business district, centered around the intersection of Main and Scottsdale Road. Although a few of the original businesses are still open, the area around downtown Scottsdale has grown considerably and many of the old landmarks are long gone. It is almost a cliche, artificial lakes and golf courses in the desert. The developers tout them as icons of the outdoor leisure lifestyle, but they are vilified by the conservationists as wasteful and destructive of the environment. Which are they? In some areas, they have both been outlawed. In Tucson, Arizona water conservation has reached the level of a fanatical movement. In Scottsdale, the landscaping varies from neighborhood to neighborhood. Some have strictly enforced natural desert landscaping, in others, failing to maintain your lawn could cost you a homeowners association fine in the hundreds of dollars. However, the reality of water usage is often lost in the controversy. Here is a quote from Water, Growth and the Future of Agriculture by Grady Gammage, Jr. of the Morrison Institute and Gammage & Burnham.  A section of housing requires on average no more and often less water than the same section of land used to grow crops. So as we convert land to residential use, we use less water, and we explain this to citizens to calm their fears.To give another perspective see this article in The Arizona Republic for January 3, 2005, \"Farms swallowing most of Arizona's water\" by Shaun McKinnon:In an average year, Arizonans go through about 7.25 million acre-feet,  or nearly 2.4 trillion gallons. Put a different way, that amount of  water could support a residential population  of nearly 30 million  people.Except it doesn't. It's supporting a population of 5.7 million - and a  lot of farms, which use about 68 percent of the state's water.   Agriculture has always used the largest share of Arizona's water,  producing cotton, citrus, lettuce, alfalfa and other products that add  up to a $2.4 billion-a-year-industry. Farmers will argue that they have  become more efficient and probably pay better attention to water use  than the average homeowner.The article goes on to note that \"In Greater Phoenix, farms now use about 46 percent of the supply, down  from two-thirds or more just 30 years ago. Industry - mostly power  plants, sand and gravel operations, and golf courses - uses about 6  percent. The rest is residential, business and government - everything  from Arizona State University's 50,000-student Tempe campus to your back  yard.\""},
{"title": "Weathered Granite", "date": "Wednesday, March 3, 2010", "text": "These boulders at Pinnacle Peak near Scottsdale, Arizona, are a result of spheroidal weathering. Granitic rocks develop joints in several directions which have the tendency to break into blocks. Weathering caused by wind erosion, mechanical breakdown from freeze/thaw cycles and the chemical weathering of the rocks, round the boulders even more thus creating this landform common in the Arizona desert areas. These rocks are primarily known as middle Proterozoic granitic and include granodiorite, tonalite, quartz diorite, diorite, and gabbro. These rocks  commonly are characterized by steep, northeast-striking foliation. See Royse, Chester F., Michael F. Sheridan, and H. Wesley Peirce.

It is equal to a volume of water one foot high and one foot wide flowing a distance of  one foot in one second. One \"cfs\" is equal to 7.48 gallons of water flowing each second. As an  example, if your car's gas tank is 2 feet by 1 foot by 1 foot (2 cubic feet), then gas flowing  at a rate of 1 cubic foot/second would fill the tank in two seconds.discharge--the volume of water that passes a given  location within a given       period of time. Usually expressed in cubic feet per second.flood--An overflow of water onto lands that are used or usable by man and not normally covered by water. Floods have two essential characteristics: The inundation of land is temporary; and the land is adjacent to and inundated by overflow from a river, stream, lake, or ocean.  flood, 100-year--A 100-year flood does not refer to a  flood that occurs once every 100 years, but to a flood level with a 1 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any  given year. flood plain--a strip of relatively flat and normally  dry land alongside a stream, river, or lake that is covered by water during a flood. flood stage--The elevation at which overflow of the  natural banks of a stream or body of water begins in the reach or area in which the elevation is measured.peak flow--the maximum instantaneous discharge of a  stream or river at a given location. It usually occurs at or near the time of maximum stage.The picture above shows what happens to roads in the Salt River Valley when the road builders disregard all of the above definitions."},

Historically, the river was lined with brush and cottonwood trees. Most of the vegetation along the Salt River through the Salt River Valley communities has died. There are a few area where runoff from other sources has allowed a significant amount of vegetation to survive, but most of the inhabitants of the city know the river as only a dry bed, crossed by roads and some bridges. Every few years, the reservoirs fill and water starts down the river. This photo was taken in February of 2010 when the reservoirs were nearly at capacity and there was still enough water left over after diversions into the canals had taken as much water as possible.The view is looking east towards Granite Reef Dam, which cannot be seen.

{"title": "8.8 magnitude earthquake in Chile compared to largest earthquake in Arizona", "date": "Saturday, February 27, 2010", "text": "The United States Geological Survey has up to the minute accurate information on the huge Chilean earthquake. A summary of the earthquake information is here. To quote the USGS summary:This earthquake occurred at the boundary between the Nazca and South  American tectonic plates. The two plates are converging at a rate of 80  mm per year. The earthquake occurred as thrust-faulting on the interface  between the two plates, with the Nazca plate moving down and landward  below the South American plate.   Coastal Chile has a history of very large earthquakes. Since 1973, there  have been 13 events of magnitude 7.0 or greater.  The February 27 shock  originated about 230 km north of the source region of the magnitude 9.5  earthquake of May, 1960 – the largest earthquake worldwide in the last  200 years or more.  This giant earthquake spawned a tsunami that  engulfed the Pacific Ocean.  An estimated 1600 lives were lost to the  1960 earthquake and tsunami in Chile, and the 1960 tsunami took another  200 lives among Japan, Hawaii, and the Philippines.  Approximately 870  km to the north of the February 27 earthquake is the source region of  the magnitude 8.5 earthquake of November, 1922.  This great quake  significantly impacted central Chile, killing several hundred people and  causing severe property damage.  The 1922 quake generated a 9-meter  local tsunami that inundated the Chile coast near the town of Coquimbo;  the tsunami also crossed the Pacific, washing away boats in Hilo harbor,  Hawaii.  The magnitude 8.8 earthquake of February 27, 2010 ruptured the  portion of the South American subduction zone separating these two  massive historical earthquakes.  Having been in several earthquakes, I can relate to the dislocation effect of the phenomena. It is very scary to have the earth begin to move and for my part, I knew instantly what was happening. The largest earthquake ever recorded in Arizona was a 5.6 tremor on the Arizona-Utah border in 1959. To quote the USGS, the earthquake caused minor damage to chimneys and walls at Fredonia, Arizona, and Kanab, Utah, about 15 kilometers north of Fredonia. In addition, windows broke in houses and stores and dishes fell from shelves at Fredonia. Almost all merchandise was shaken from shelves in stores. A rockslide at Mather Point in the Grand Canyon was attributed to the shock.USGS."},
{"title": "Four Peaks -- A Salt River Valley Landmark", "date": "Friday, February 26, 2010", "text": "Floating off in the distance in the eastern portions of the Salt River Valley is the vision of a huge mountain with four distinctive peaks. On clear winter days (very rare now) the mountains can sometimes have a coating of snow. The picture above is the more normal view of the mountains from Mesa. In years past the air quality in the east valley was much better than it is now and it was not so unusual to have a clear view of the mountains.  Four Peaks, located in the Tonto National Forest, are part of the Four Peaks Wilderness Area established in 1984. The wilderness area contains approximately 60,740 acres and elevation within the wilderness area ranges from 1600 feet in the low desert to Brown's Peak at 7,657 feet, the highest of the Four Peaks.Quoting from the Tonto National Forest Website, \"The Tonto National Forest, Arizona, embraces almost 3 million acres of rugged and spectacularly beautiful country, ranging from Saguaro cactus-studded desert to pine-forested mountains beneath the Mogollon Rim. This variety in vegetation and range in altitude (from 1,300 to 7,900 feet) offers outstanding recreational opportunities throughout the year, whether it's lake beaches or cool pine forest. As the fifth largest forest in the United States, the Tonto National Forest is one of the most-visited “urban” forests in the U.S. (approximately 5.8 million visitors annually). Its boundaries are Phoenix to the south, the Mogollon Rim to the north and the San Carlos and Fort Apache Indian reservations to the east.\"Just north of the turn-off to the Bush Highway/Saguaro Lake on the Beeline, there is an unpaved road marked to take you to the Four Peaks. The road is passable at some times in a passenger car but a high clearance vehicle would be preferred. The road is extremely popular with ATV riders and 4-wheel drive enthusiasts and has a tendency to be pretty well torn up from the traffic. The road ultimately goes over the ridge by Four Peaks and ends up in the Tonto Basin, but the top part of the road is definitely four-wheel drive territory."},
{"title": "Normally dry Salt River at Gilbert Road Crossing", "date": "Thursday, February 25, 2010", "text": "It is almost a mantra in Phoenix to hear news commentators speak of the \"normally dry Salt River.\" The Gila/Salt River system drains most of southern Arizona. The Gila River is 649 miles long and has several major tributaries, including the Salt and Verde Rivers, the Agua Fria and the San Pedro. The reason they are normally dry by the time the rivers reach the desert is due to huge storage reservoirs in the mountains to the east of the Salt River Valley. Normally dry does not tell even part of the story however. In wet years, like 2010, the reservoirs fill completely with water and then any additional runoff goes down the dry river beds.With a stellar lack of planning, the cities and towns in the Salt River Valley build their roads in the dry river bed, only to have them washed away every few years. The picture above is looking roughly north at the Salt River crossing at Gilbert Road in the east valley. The road was washed out about a year ago, but had been in service for several years before that. The bridge to the west is a replacement for other bridges that had washed away. It is handling the river flow, at the moment, with the river running at about 5500 cfs (cubic feet per second). If the river increases its flow to any greater extent (which is highly likely this year), the river will wash out both ends of the bridge and could, wash out the entire bridge.In the picture, you can see where the water, in a much drier year, ran across the road where I was standing to take the picture. If the rains stop this year, and the weather stays cool, the run off from record snow falls may not flood. But if the weather warms up suddenly and it continues to rain, the runoff will have no place to go but down the Salt and Gila Rivers. Arizona is unique in that the dry river beds are called \"rivers\" but when there is water they are referred to as flooding. One difficulty in gauging the severity of the floods is the fact that various measures of water flow are used by different authorities. The Salt River Project uses cubic feet per second, but scientific journals talking about historic water levels use cubic meters per second roughly 27 times greater. It appears that the greatest floods ever recorded ran at about 4600 cubic meters per second or over 124,000 cubic feet per second.Given the built up condition of the river bottom in the Salt River Valley, a flood of historic proportions would be interesting to say the least."},

Like many of these so-called traditions, this one is not only inaccurate but dangerous to believe. Don't try it. First of all, many of the Ferocactus are on the threatened or endangered species list. Second, they taste awful and I speak from personal experience, long before anyone thought about endangered species. Thirdly, as shown by an article in the Tucson Citizen by Jonathan DuHamel, Economic Geologist,The Seri Indians sometimes used the Fishhook barrel (Ferocactus wislizeni)  for emergency water. However, drinking the juice on an empty stomach  often caused diarrhea, and some Seri report pain in their bones if they  walk a long distance after drinking the juice. The Seri called the  Coville barrel (Ferocactus emoryi), “barrel that kills” because  eating the flesh of the cactus causes nausea, diarrhea, and temporary  paralysis. Think you can tell the two apart?If you go into the desert, take water, don't rely on cactus to quench your thirst and keep alive."},

Scottsdale's Website describes the trail as follows:The Sierra Club rates the 150-acre Pinnacle  Peak as a moderate hike with an elevation gain of approximately 1,300  feet.  The trail has a very smooth tread with a number of ups and downs  over the course of the 1.75 mile trail (one way).  It is not a loop  trail so you come back over the same trail.  High point on the trail is  2,889', the lowest point is 2,366', and the elevation at the trailhead  is 2,570'.   Hiking, horseback riding  and rock climbing will take you to spectacular views of the valley .   Rock climbing, for experienced climbers with appropriate gear, is  permitted in three areas of the park with a variety of routes and skill  levels.  Amenities are a parking area (trailers are ok), restroom, drinking  fountain, ramada, and 4 picnic tables. Like all of the trails around the Salt River Valley, they are best enjoyed in the late fall, winter or early spring when temperatures are in the 70s or 80s and not well over 100 degrees. The peak and surrounding rocky area are made up of a decomposed granite (quartz, biotite mica and feldspar). The rounded shape of the rocks comes from the weathering due to the extremes from freezing cold to baking hot. It is a popular day hike but is also a draw for local rock climbers.I have mixed feelings about Pinnacle Peak stemming from the fact that it is encircled with extremely expensive homes. During the time from 1994 until 2002, the area was actually inaccessible due to the surrounding development. In my mind, it is a symbol of all that is bad about urban sprawl into the deserts. There is almost no place on the trail that you cannot see green manicured golf courses! I am glad the mountain is reopened for public use however."},

Unfortunately, I left my real camera at home and had to rely on my iPhone camera. Sort of like using a sponge to pound nails. At the end of the demonstration, they ladled out their left-over molten glass onto a table for an impressive end to a very good demonstration.Arizona is not the glass blowing capital of the world, but Highway Hotshop's new mobile unit gives a very accessible insight into this very difficult and technical art. Glassblowing dates back thousands of years to ancient Egypt and Phoenicia.The earliest evidence of glassblowing comes from a collection of waste  from a glass workshop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods  and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of  Old City of Jerusalem dated from 37 to 4 B.C.  Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are  partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to  form small bottle, thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of  blowpipe.   Hence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of  experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a  revolutionary step the induced a change in conception and a deep  understanding of glass. Such invention swiftly eclipsed all other traditional methods, such as  casting and core-forming, in working glass. Wikipedia.Arizona has several glass blowing studios, including the Antonius Studios in Prescott, ArizonaGlassArt in Scottsdale and The Glass Studio at the Mesa Arts Center, where, if I understood correctly, Joshua and Adam are currently teaching.Thanks to Desert Botanical Gardens for sponsoring a very enjoyable evening."},

Humphrey's is the highest of the San Francisco Peaks, located just north of Flagstaff and highly visible from a lot of northern Arizona, especially along Interstate 40. The San Francisco Peaks are really a vast volcanic caldera with the \"peaks\" along the edge of what once was a huge mountain. An satellite view of the mountain area shows that the caldera probably exploded towards the northeast. The mountains were named in honor of St. Francis of Assisi by the Spanish settlers in the 1600s. The ring of mountains include, Humprhrey's, Agassiz, Fremont, Aubineau, Reese and Doyle peaks.In just the few miles from the bottom of the Grand Canyon to the top of the San Francisco Peaks, you can travel through six climatic life zones:Lower Sonoran Zone - Sonoran Desert plantsUpper Sonoran Zone - Pinyon and Juniper woodlandsTransition Zone - Ponderosa Pine forestsCanadian Zone - Mixed Conifer ForestHudsonian Zone - Spruce-Fir or Subalpine Conifer ForestArctic-Alpine Zone - alpine tundraThe picture above was taken from the top (or summit if you must) of Humphrey's. The trail up the mountain is supposed to be 4.5 miles one way, but what they don't count is the mile or so hike to the trailhead. The hike is an easy climb until you reach the 11,400 foot treeline where the altitude starts to make a difference to flatlanders. It is discouraging to hike on a nice day because there is always some person in shorts running up the mountain who passes you on the way up and on the way down twice. The view from the top really depends on the weather and air conditions. You can mostly see where all the smoke from the northern Arizona power plants goes.The forest on the trail up the mountain is superb, old trees with a lot of character. It is a lovely place and deserves the significance given to it by thirteen different Indian tribes.According to Wikipedia, \"Humphreys Peak was named in about 1870 for General Andrew A. Humphreys, a U.S. Army officer who was a Union general during the American Civil War, and who later became Chief of Engineers of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.\""},

But some lists give the summit at 9,744 feet, however, it is actually 10,912 feet. What also makes the comparison complicated is that the San Francisco Mountains which have Humphreys Peak as the highest mountain in Arizona at 12,633 feet have up to six \"peaks.\" So if you measure each San Francisco Peak as a separate peak then it moves Escudilla down on the list. The same thing happens with Mount Baldy in the White Mountains. Is it one \"peak\" or several? Some lists show Baldy as five separate peaks, making Escudilla number 12 instead of number 3. But if you are like me, you lump all of the San Francisco Peaks and Mount Baldy into one bundle, making Escudilla number three.It is hard to call Escudilla a peak since the top of the mountain is almost flat. Finding the exact top is a matter of wandering around for a while until you see something that looks higher than where you are standing at the time. The name \"Escudilla\" is of Spanish origin but the translation of the word is conjectural. An \"escudo\" is a shield, so escudilla should be \"little shield.\" In a modern dictionary, escudilla is translated as \"bowl.\" So take  your pick, either little shield or bowl both make sense looking at the mountain. One thing is that there is no other \"Escudilla mountain\" anyplace else in the world. The only other places named that are in New Mexico and Venezuela."},

The above is a wide angle shot of the Tucson Convention Center main showroom. Breaking with tradition, the visiting exhibits were spread out all over the exhibit floor rather than being the center of the floor with minerals on one side and jewelry on the other. As a result, the mix of minerals, gems and jewelry was less separated as in past years. In posts that come, I will feature some of the more remarkable specimens that we saw at the show. But for now, is is sufficient to make more general observations.One interesting observation. We received our February, 2010 Arizona Highways and there was not one mention of the dates or locations of the Tucson Show, even though they had an article on Quartzite and featured another gem and mineral show in the same time period. The Tucson show is international in flavor. The exhibitors come from all over the world. Although the main show in the Tucson Convention Center only lasts four days, the rest of the exhibits and sales go on for most of the month of January and into February, from January 22 to February 14. Overall the exhibitors include gems, minerals, fossils, meteorites, jewelry and beads.The childrens' exhibit is always popular as are the two and sometimes three geode crackers. I assume that most of the other dealers have sales or they would not keep coming back year after year. We have pretty much run out of room for more mineral specimens and that has slowed us down considerably from purchasing anything at the shows. But, there is only one place to see the real world of mineral collecting in all its form and color and that is by visiting the dealers in their individual sales rooms, usually rented motel rooms at various places in Tucson.The show guide has more than forty pages in four columns of the list of the dealers at the Tucson Show. It is probably almost physically impossible to visit all of them during the time the Show is open. We drive down from Phoenix, but have stayed down in the Tucson and find that accommodations are not that expensive.

There were no million dollar homes up the side of the hills, no five star resorts with gated entries. Nothing but rocks, creosote bushes, brittle bushes and cactus.  Oh, yes, there were a few palo verde trees also.There were also no skinny sun-burned hikers, running full tilt up the trails after driving to the base of the mountain in their BMWs. Come to think of it, there weren't any BMWs either. We could hike around in the desert and climb up the mountain and never see another person all day.  Now, on a popular holiday, the parking lot is jambed and thousands of people climb the hill in one day.The view above is from the trail up the south side of the mountain.

On this nanoscale the glass is highly flexible and breathable. The coating is environmentally harmless and non-toxic, and easy to clean using only water or a simple wipe with a damp cloth. It repels bacteria, water and dirt, and resists heat, UV light and even acids.

The lowest temperature recorded in Arizona was 40 degrees below zero at Hawley Lake, just a stone's throw from McNary.The temperature varies greatly with the altitude (everywhere in world) but it is pretty dramatic to drive from Mesa, Arizona in the low desert where the temperature can be in the 70s and in a couple of hours be standing in a snow storm with temperatures well below freezing."},

They do not have areoles or circular clusters of spines that define the Cactaceae family. One thing I do know about agave is that the spine at the end of the leaves leaves a big hole in your foot or leg if you happen to get stuck and it is very poisonous and hurts for a very long time. I once had one go through my boot into my foot, so I know first hand how badly they hurt.When I first moved to the lower desert, one of the first plants I remember were a row of very large agaves along the south edge of our yard. The plants were much taller than I was and years later, after flowering, they all died about the same time. Even though they are sometimes called century plants, they really do not take a whole century to bloom, but when the do bloom, the main plant dies. Not to worry however, they reproduce with shoots from the roots of the parent plant and can spread rapidly. Once they are established, you have to be very persistent to kill them off.They make some of the prettiest patterns of any of the desert plants, even if they aren't cactus."},
{"title": "Pinnacles and spires", "date": "Wednesday, February 3, 2010", "text": "I could do a whole study of just rock pinnacles and spires in Arizona. Almost every little rock hill or mountain in the state has a section. Perhaps I will do a study, I don't have enough to do yet. The rocks in the picture above are near Oatman, Arizona. The town is named after two young girls that were kidnapped by the Yavapai Indians in the 1850s after the girls' family was killed except for one brother. Olive Oatman (see picture above) and her sister, were later traded to the Mohave Indians and Olive was finally released. Her sister Mary Ann died in captivity. In 1857, a pastor named Royal B. Stratton wrote a book about Olive and Mary Ann. The book sold 30,000 copies, a best-seller for that era. In November, 1865, Olive married John B. Fairchild. Though it was rumored that she died in an asylum in New York in 1877, she actually went to live with Fairchild in Sherman, Texas, where they adopted a baby girl, Mamie. Wikipedia.Now, aren't rock spires interesting? The Tucson Gem and Mineral Show is underway in, you guessed it, Tucson, Arizona. Although there are mineral dealers in Tucson all year, during the last part of January and until the middle of February, there are hundreds of dealers who gather from all over the world to sell, trade and generally talk about gems, minerals, beads, jewelry and anything else you could reasonably sell.It would take days just to walk around and view all the sales areas. The biggest event is held in the Tucson Convention Center, this year the weekend of February 14, 2010. Entrance to most of the shows (read sales centers) are free, but there is a small charge for the main show. Few conventions take over a town as completely as does the Gem and Mineral Show.There is only one word to describe the gems and minerals shown at the show: fabulous. We drive down and spend the day or even stay over night and spend two days, without seeing even a small part of all of the exhibits. Would you like to buy a complete stegosaurus skeleton? You can at the show. Could you spend $100,000 or more on one mineral specimen? Easily. If you haven't been to a first class mineral exhibit, you cannot imagine the color, the variety and absolute beauty of the fabulous (yes, I used the word again) minerals at this show."},

One of my daughters once did a school science project on the soils in Eastern Maricopa County. We drove around the area collecting samples of different soil types. I got a book with all the soil maps of Maricopa County and we were able to identify all of the types we collected. I have always appreciated the importance of dirt. I love gardening and I have studied the soil characteristics of the desert for many years. It would have been very useful to have such a Website in the days I was most active in building the soil in my garden so that it would grow vegetables on a consistent basis.One of the challenges is the mechanics of the soil. It was most clay in the area where we lived, with a hard pan of caliche about 3 feet below the surface. I had to add a lot of sand, gypsum and iron to the soil just to break it down so that it wouldn't turn to adobe when it was dry. Here is a really good and really long article from the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum by Joseph R. McAuliffe on Desert Soils.Because of the alluvial nature of the soils in the Salt River Valley, there is never any lack of rocks. Add that to the fact that many of the suburban yards in the Valley have \"desert landscaping\" which consists almost entirely of large gravel or rocks, we always have something to throw close at hand."},

Also, the base of the leaves can be eaten raw or cooked. Even though the current government classifies this plant as a weed, Native Americans not only ate the plant but used the leaves for weaving mats, baskets and a whole variety of useful products. According to real authorities, the leaves of a cattail can be folded around a stalk to make a doll for a child.A few years ago we discovered an interesting fact about cattails. We gathered a few of the stalks when they were brown and still growing and put them in a vase. A few weeks later, when they had thoroughly dried, the cattails suddenly exploded into the soft cottony fluff. I think I knew this was what they did but didn't connect the theory with what actually happens with the plant. It is moderately difficult to get exploded cattail seeds out of your house.On occasion, when finding a patch ready to explode, we have had a rather interesting time hitting the pods. It may not be as spectacular as fireworks, but it is very impressive none the less."},

Grapefruit and grapefruit trees have been permanent fixtures in my yard nearly all my life. As children, I don't think we really thought of them as food. We used them as ammunition to throw at each other. They were so common that they would drop off the trees and be thrown away. It seemed that no one person or family could eat all of the grapefruit from even one tree and our yard always had several.

One of the few things I remember from grade school was the 5 C's of Arizona and citrus is one of them. Of course, citrus trees do not originally come from the American continents but originated in the tropical islands of the Caribbean. Purdue University has a very interesting summary of the history of grapefruit but ignores Arizona other than to note that it was commercially grown in 1910. It is true, despite the 5 C's, Arizona's production of grapefruit is a very small percentage of that grown in other states (unnamed). But, if you even get a chance to eat a real Arizona grapefruit, you will never by one of the cardboard substitutes again."},

Artichokes are one of those vegetables that most people, including me while growing up, could not imagine eating. Fortunately, I married into a food family and learned to love eating them. Just in case you don't know, the scales (it is a bud) have a very tasty portion at the bottom where they attach. You boil the artichoke and then peal off the scales and scrape off the edible part with your lower front teeth. It also tastes good to dip them in mayonnaise or Miracle Whip. The inner portion of the bud is called the \"artichoke heart.\" The heart is the best part. Sometimes artichoke heart is pickled. I like them better fresh however.We also grow them in our home garden occasionally. However, they are one of those plants that take a lot of room and only produce a few edible bulbs. They are usually grown commercially as a field crop. They grow really well in the lower Arizona desert areas, but require quite a bit of water.

The central stiff ribs are accordion-like and give strength to the plant allowing it expand to store thousands of pounds of water for use when there is little or no rainfall. Large saguaro cactus plants can weigh more than six tons, made up almost entirely of water. The plants grow very slowly. We planted a very small saguaro when it was only about 3 or 4 inches high. Over the years we have kept the plant growing, even moving it with us when we moved. After about twenty years, the saguaro is now only about four feet high. See Saguaro National Park.From the outside, the layers you can see in the picture are the epidermis (the green exterior), the cortex or pulp, the ribs, and the pith inside the ribs.There is a legend in Arizona about a man who supposedly shot a saguaro with a shotgun. The shot cut the cactus which fell on him and killed him. OK, so checking with Snopes.com, it turns out that the story is true. It happened in 1982. But that analysis doesn't agree with the story I know from my teenage years. Guess what, more than one person may have died shooting a saguaro."},

Wikipedia.Jesse Allen, NASA Earth Observatory, using data obtained courtesy of the University of Maryland’s Global Land Cover Facility.The aerial photo shows both Roosevelt Lake and Apache Lake to the south. The Salt River enters the lake from the east and the Tonto Creek comes in from the northwest. Also visible are the outlines of three wilderness areas; the Superstition Wilderness, the Four Peaks Wilderness and the Salome Wilderness. Next to the lake, on the south, is the Tonto National Monument, a preserved complex of cliff dwellings. All of these lie within the Tonto National Forest.Roosevelt Lake and the others in the Salt River Project are used extensively for fishing, boating, water skiing, sailing and other water related activities. All of the lakes have boat ramps and other facilities. Roosevelt Lake has an extensive complex of campgrounds.At the time of the aerial photo, Roosevelt Lake was very low, as shown by the extensive areas of light colored land around the lake. Because these are desert lakes, their level depends entirely on rainfall amounts. Every few years, the lakes fill from inflow from the rivers and then they drain down as water is used for domestic and irrigation purposes in the Salt River Valley. Because the level of the lakes fluctuates from year to year, in some years the campgrounds are almost a half a mile from the lake, in other years they are on the lake shore. The boat ramps and docks are constructed to rise and fall with the level of the lake. In extremely dry years, the boat docks are left high up on the shore and access to the lakes is extremely limited.I grew up thinking all lakes were reservoirs. I remember being amazed that there was a lake that didn't have a dam associated with it. I always wondered how they kept the water in the lake and why it didn't all run out."},
{"title": "Mystical? Religious? or just doodling?", "date": "Sunday, January 17, 2010", "text": "Click for enlarged imageEven though this rock art is found in Hieroglyphic Canyon, they are not hieroglyphic writing, they are actually called petroglyphs (literally \"rock writing\") or pictographs. Pictographs are usually dated to the time when other physical remains, i.e. pottery, implements etc., are found in the area. A variety of rocks are used as a substrate, but they all have certain things in common, the surviving pictographs are in protected or semi-protected areas of the rock. That is, they are in niches or on slabs that are protected from the elements either through overhangs or orientation. The pictographs are made by scratching through the darker weathered coating of the rock to show the lighter underlying areas. During some of my future posts, I will show a large variety of pictographs from areas throughout the American Southwest.The dark coating on the rocks comes from a fairly simple chemical reaction, manganese an element, becomes manganese oxide. There are several fomulations of manganese oxide, however the most basic is MnO, a simple combination with oxygen. Manganese in its pure form, is a light grey to white powder that resembles iron. It is used with iron and other elements, to make steel. It is sometimes found dissolved in water as a trace element. In the dessert areas of the world, over time, these traces of manganese are deposited on the surface of the rocks and is sometimes called desert varnish. From personal experience, we have used manganese as a trace element for fertilization of palm trees and if any of the water with manganese gets on any surface, it will permanently stain the surface.Unfortunately, most archaeologists (at least in the U.S.) have a tendency to see either mysticism or religion in everything associated with ancient cultures. Although some of the symbols used do have religious connotations, it is impossible to attribute a religious significance to them without imposing cultural norms from unrelated cultures. As a matter of fact, the pictographs may have been produced out of simple boredom. There are many locations throughout the western part of the U.S. where early pioneers wrote their names on the rocks also. I guess some archaeologist in the distant future, unable to read our handwriting, would probably deem those markings religious also."},

{"title": "What makes a cactus a cactus?", "date": "Wednesday, January 13, 2010", "text": "Click to enlarge imageSome people think that any spiney plant is a cactus. Real cactus in the Cactaceae family are only found in North and South America. There is one lone native species of cactus in Africa the Rhipsalis baccifera, but it is assumed that it is a transplant. All of the cactus in the Middle East and elsewhere are non-native species. The plant above looks rather spiney. Is it a cactus?Look closely at the base of the spines near the green skin. This fuzzy white area is the areole. In some species of cactus the areoles have developed into small, detachable stickers called glochids that are very sharp and painful to the skin. No areoles, no cactus, simple.Although this cactus looks fierce, it is rather easy to avoid since it is a variety of Carnegiea gigantea, aka saguaro. Although saguaro cactus have become synonymous with desert, they are actually only found in the Sonoran Desert of Arizona and Mexico and in an extremely small part of California."},

We have new streets, new buildings and mostly newer homes. The older sections of town are the usual run down with abandoned buildings and other urban blight, but by and large we live in a new city in the desert. What passes for a downtown area is relatively uncrowded mostly because only the people who work there have any reason to go there. Some of the older cities of the world can boast of hundreds of years of history, most of the history of Phoenix has happened during my lifetime.The new veneer of Phoenix is haunted by memories of a dim and hardly known past. People have lived and prospered in this desert valley for thousands of years. The picture, taken from the top of the ruin, above is a composite panorama of the museum and visitors' center for Pueblo Grande, one of the largest remaining and visible Indian ruins. Now almost completely obscured by roads and buildings, the past is seldom mentioned or even acknowledged. If you look closely at the background, visible over the trees, on the left, you can just see the control tower for Sky Harbor Airport. On the right, you can see one of the high rise buildings to the west and north of Pueblo Grande.The larger tree next to the building is a palo verde. The two trees by the canopies are probably mesquite. The planting in the center of the photo contains yucca, two juvenile saguaros, an ocotillo, some creosote bushes and several agaves. There is a large sage brush plant behind the yuccas.  There is a bike rider on the canal bank behind the canopies."},
{"title": "The mighty Superstition Mountains", "date": "Sunday, January 10, 2010", "text": "In 1960 actor Walter Brennan had a hit song called \"Dutchman's Gold.\" (See Wikipedia) The song was pretty terrible even though it was a hit. In the song, Brennan makes reference to \"the mighty Superstition Mountain, standing high and all alone.\" Well, you might call that poetic license, but perhaps he had just never seen the Superstitions up close. The Superstition Mountains stretch eastward, just from the edge of the city of Apache Junction, and include an ill-defined area to the north and east. Most people consider the Superstitions to be contiguous with the Superstition Wilderness Area.Looking from the west towards the mountains, the main Superstition Mountain is one of the eastern Salt River Valley's most prominent features. The mountains are primarily extrusive igneous rocks created as a result of volcanic action. The rocks themselves are mainly dacite, andesite, rhyolite, tuff and breccias. Contrary to legend, the actual wilderness area has never shown any degree of mineralization. There has been extensive core drilling for minerals and no major mineral discoveries have ever been made. Hence, the possibility that there is a lost mine in the Superstition Wilderness Area is almost zero. However, there is extensive mineralization to the east, north and west of the mountains.The view above is taken from the south, looking towards the northwest. The prominent mountain highlighted in the background is known as the Flatiron. It is most prominent in pictures taken from the western slopes of the mountains and from the east valley. One of the more common theories about the origin of the mountains involves volcanic activity and several overlapping calderas. The terrain is extremely rugged and the deep canyons run in a variety of directions leading to the confusion of hikers in the area. The main peak of the Flatiron group is around 5057 feet high depending on your source, but the Flatiron itself is around 4800 feet.The edges of the Superstitions are one of the most visited locations in Arizona. But if you spend a little while hiking you will soon reach areas that are hardly ever visited. Hiking to Hieroglyphic Canyon on a cool weekend day may seem closer to a stroll though the Mall, but other parts of the Wilderness area are extremely isolated due primarily to the rugged terrain and lack of water."},

It is obvious that they are mostly created when softer rocks are weathered away leaving a harder rock layer. The undercutting can be spectacular in some cases. Here is an interesting online collection of pictures. Another rather obvious conclusion is that balanced rocks are not usually found in seismically active areas.Arizona has more than its share of balanced rocks, but the one shown above is particularly spectacular because of its location on a high ridge line. It is visible from most of the canyon floor. It is located in Hieroglyphic Canyon, on the south side of the Superstition Mountain range, just east of the Salt River Valley.I have always been fascinated by balanced rocks and have often thought about publishing a book of pictures of them from Arizona. I am aware of many dozens of them throughout the state."},
{"title": "Very little physical evidence", "date": "Friday, January 8, 2010", "text": "Even though the Salt River Valley was relatively heavily populated during hundreds of years, by the late 1400s the ancient inhabitants had disappeared almost entirely. The vast agricultural community that built hundreds of miles of canals, vanished, almost without a trace, leaving endless speculation for generations of scientists and historians. The remains of the inhabitants' material culture are almost completely obscured by time and subsequent occupation by the modern inhabitants. A remarkably few of the villages and towns remain, preserved in a very small number of parks and monuments. Almost without exception, the canals, the major achievement of their culture, have also vanished, to be replaced by modern cement lined watercourses.Here and there, if you are really observant, you can still see evidence of the ancient ones. The hills around the Salt River Valley are full of petroglyphs. In the photo above, you can see another almost permanent reminder of the people who lived in the desert before the night sky was full of light. The holes in the rock are places where the Indians ground seeds, plants and corn. Imagine how long it took with a stone pestle to grind those holes into the solid rock!There is nothing particularly special about the location of the rock that makes it any different than millions of others in the general vicinity. How did the ancients chose just this rock? Why here and not a few feet further up the canyon or down?This rock is located in Hieroglyphic Canyon in the Superstition Wilderness Area, just at the eastern edge of the huge Salt River Valley."},

I may go into the gold mine story business some day, but right now, I am more interested in cactus and the mountains themselves.The panoramic photo shows the south side of the Superstition Wilderness Area. The Wilderness is administered by the Tonto National Forest. Here is what they have to say about it:This Wilderness was designated in 1939, and was expanded to its     present size in 1984. It now contains approximately 160,200 acres.     There is a well-developed trail system, and the western end of the     wilderness receives heavy use during the cooler times of the year.     Trail conditions vary from fair to very poor. Several trails are unsuitable     for horses.The Superstition Wilderness Area has the distinction of having a wilderness boundary right next to suburban subdivisions and commercial establishments. The picture above was taken from the Hieroglyphic Trail, looking north. If I had completed the picture around to the south, you would see houses and roads and the east end of the huge Salt River Valley which contains the Phoenix/Mesa Metroplex. Phoenix is currently the fifth largest city in the United States.The picture shows the impressive variety of plant life in the Arizona/Sonora Desert, including the prominent saguaro cactus. The other prominent cactus are Teddy-bear cholla. Most of the bushes visible are creosote. There are a large number of palo verde trees which are mostly shorter and bush-like rather than looking like trees.I am sure I will have more comments about the desert."},

It is not well known today, but many of the strip centers and houses that make up this huge city are literally built on Hohokam towns and villages. The vast canal system of the Salt River Valley has its origins in canals built by wood and stone tools hundreds of years ago. There are still places in the Valley you can see traces of the original canals and even see some of the ruins.The picture above is the corner of one of the largest remaining Hohokam structures in Phoenix. It is maintained as part of Pueblo Grande, a Museum and Archaeological Park by the City of Phoenix.No one really knows what the ancient inhabitants of the Southwest called themselves. The names we use like Hohokam, Sinagua and Anazasi, are merely convenient terms used by archaeologists and borrowed from other American Indian languages or Spanish. The term Hohokam was borrowed from the Akimel O'odham, and is used to define an archaeological culture that existed from the beginning of the current era to about the middle of the 15th century AD. Wikipedia.We have been visiting Pueblo Grande from time to time for many years. The present park and museum are really well done. The ruins now lie next to a freeway and just north of the Salt River where airplanes make their landing run into Sky Harbour Airport. It is really difficult to imagine the isolation and quietness that must have existed when these structures were inhabited. The City of Phoenix gets its name from the legend of the Phoenix bird that arose from its own ashes. Early settlers realized that the valley had once been densely populated and that the town they were building was rising literally on the ashes of the vanished civilization. The Arizona State bird is an active and very evident denizen of the lower deserts. I think it deserves the designation just because it can actually sit on the cactus plants without getting stabbed to death. If you have ever tried sitting on a cactus plant, and I know a few people who have, you would probably vote for Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus or the cactus wren as your state bird also.The cactus wren is also the largest of the North American wrens. The bird eats insects, including ants, beetles, grasshoppers and wasps, which makes it my friend any day. By the way, if my name were Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus, I would probably change my name to cactus wren too."},
{"title": "Cholla Cactus", "date": "Monday, January 4, 2010", "text": "Commonly called Cylindropuntia bigelovii but locally known as the Teddy-bear Cholla or Jumping Cactus, this is one of the most prominent features of the mid-level Arizona/Sonoran Desert. This cactus has the annoying characteristic of leaving its easily detached stems all over the ground. The slightest touch of a shoe or pant leg is enough to have this fuzz ball attach. The spines are vicious, possibly the worst in the plant kingdom. After instantly penetrating the skin, the barbs curl like fishhooks when they hit the moisture under the skin. This curled barb is very difficult to remove and may require a strong pair of pliers. The plant actually reproduces from these dropped stems and makes almost no seeds.A close relative, also called Jumping Cactus, is the Cylindropuntia fulgida or chain cholla or chain fruit cholla. This plant makes long strings of green fruit, hence the name chain cholla. Like the Teddy-bear cholla, this plant also propagates from the stems that fall to the ground.It is a learned skill to walk through the desert and avoid stepping on cactus. As you are walking, the cactus, if stepped on, will attach to the heel or bottom of the shoe and with the next step will lodge in the side of the opposite leg. I used to carry a pair of pliers on hikes with the Scouts because it was inevitable that one of the Scouts would step on a cholla. Avoiding cactus is a lesson that one learns rather quickly or the decision is made to never step foot in the wild desert again.The dead stems of the cholla are very distinctive and used to be used for decorative lamps and other tourist trade type objects. For a long time I had a box of the stems with the intent of making one of those decorative objects, but I think the box finally got dumped when I moved a few years ago.There are some parts of the desert, especially along the mountain skirts of the upper desert, where cholla grows in huge forests. The plants are incredibly large and fierce looking. It is not a good idea to try to walk through these areas without a great deal of caution.I think cholla are beautiful and love to use the pictures on my computer desktop."},
{"title": "Mesa Arizona Temple Christmas Lights", "date": "Sunday, January 3, 2010", "text": "Every year from the day after Thanksgiving until New Years Day, the Mesa, Arizona Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a huge Christmas light display. I am well aware of the time and effort that goes into this gorgeous display, because for five years, right after the lights first were displayed, I was in charge of putting up, maintaining and taking down the lights. The entire grounds of the Temple had to be rewired a number of times to accommodate the huge display. The past few years, the crowds of viewers have grown so much that special attention has been paid to restroom facilities and all other aspects of the experience. Every night during the season, there is a live musical presentation in the area between the Visitors Center and the Temple. Back then, we were not so fortunate.During the years we helped with the Temple lights, we got to be experts at fixing light bulbs in strings of lights. We also had some really interesting experiences putting the lights up. To get the lights into the palm trees, it requires a rather high cherry picker lift. One night, the wind was blowing hard enough to sway the trees, but we were up in the cherry picker, thirty or so feet off the ground, putting up lights and fixing those that had blown loose. We did that for about three or four hours straight without a stop.Another night, one of the huge Italian Cypress trees, about 60 feet tall, blew over in a huge storm. Miraculously, the tree fell exactly in a spot where there were no lights and no lights were damaged at all.The main problem, early on, with doing the lights, was the lack of outlets. We ran dozens of extension cords and were constantly blowing fuses and having to re-adjust the lights.One good experience was that my children got to turn on the lights every year for the official turn on ceremony. At the time, there was no central way to control the lights and they had to be turned on at seven or eight different locations. even though we had a person who officially turned on the lights, it really took all of the children and others to get them operating.For those five years, from October to January, the Christmas lights took most of our time and effort. It was an interesting experience and far different from today's organized effort."},

{"title": "Digging the ditch", "date": "Friday, October 9, 2009", "text": "The ancient inhabitants of the low deserts in Arizona were well acquainted with canal technology. In the Salt River Valley the canal system is said to use at least 1000 miles of canals and irrigate over 100,000 acres of land. See The AncientHohokam Canal System in the Valley of the Sun. The early Mormon pioneers had no knowledge of this vast canal system when the began the laborious process of digging canals from the water backed up by brush dams to irrigate small fields in and around St. Joseph, (now Joseph City) Arizona. But the ancient inhabitants of the Salt River Valley and the Mormon pioneers had a lot in common; both used rudimentary manual tools to dig their ditches and canals. Considering the tools and methods used anciently to dig canals, there is no doubt that anyone, modern or ancient, would have the same challenges and have to use similar tools. Although modern tools are electronic and high sophisticated, the dirt still has to be moved. Today our tools move more dirt with less manual effort, but at the time the pioneers came to northern Arizona, they had essentially the same tools possessed by the early inhabitants. The pioneers did have one advantage, animal power, through horses and oxen. But there was no real substitute for a pick and shovel.Despite these relatively primitive methods of moving dirt, the pioneers managed to dig ditches and build substantial dams within a few months of their arrival along the Little Colorado River. Unfortunately, the River did not cooperate in the effort. Before the first year's crop could be grown to harvest, the summer rains had washed out both dams and ditches, leaving the fields to dry out and burn up in the summer sun.The first dam built by the residents of Allen's Camp and Obed cost the settlers $5000.  It took 960 man days of work and an additional 500 more man days of work on the ditch. That was the dam that washed out with the first flood in 1876. In 1877 another dam was built upstream from the first, only to be washed away in the summer rains. Again in 1879 yet another dam was built.And so it continued until finally, cement and engineering won out with a dam that let the water run over the top when the floods came.For some idea of the attitude of the people after so much hardship, here is a contemporary account:Living on the river was not easy but it was worth it.The above story is in:Abruzzi, William S. Dam That River!: Ecology and Mormon Settlement in the Little Colorado River Basin. Lanham, Md: University Press of America, 1993."},

That potential was only realized as a result of extensive irrigation activities. Here is an animated map showing how little rainfall the state receives over a year. You can also see from the map above (click for enlarged image) that almost all of the state receives less than ten inches of rain a year. By definition, all of that area with low rainfall is considered to be desert.The area of northern Arizona where the early Mormon settlers first set up camp, was as much of a desert as the rest of the state. Although the area falls in the part of the State designated as Cool Plateau Highlands, the name is anything but descriptive of the area. It is a flat, mostly treeless sandy desert. Summer temperatures can reach well over 100 degree F. Winter temperatures sometimes drop to almost 20 degrees below zero. The only water in the area comes from intermittent streams like the Little Colorado River. The river can be a raging torrent in the Spring and completely dry in the Summer. Without supplemental water from a very few mountain streams that reached the desert, the pioneers could not have survived.Truly, there are few places in the world less likely to host an agricultural community than the high plateau of Arizona along the Little Colorado River. You have to understand both the religion and the culture of these people to even begin to understand why they came and even more, why they stayed."},
{"title": "A very nasty muddy stream", "date": "Monday, August 24, 2009", "text": "Little Colorado River FlickrThe earliest Mormon settlers into Arizona in 1876 found the Little Colorado River to be \"like a running stream of mud of reddish color.\" (Quoted from John A. Blythe in Tanner, George S., and J. Morris Richards. Colonization on the Little Colorado: The Joseph City Region. Flagstaff: Northland Press, 1977, page 32). Joseph H. Richards used the words in the title to this post to describe the river. See Tanner, page 33. For the settlers camped on the banks of this unpredictable stream, they would depend on the river for almost all of their water for forty years.I drank the water from the Little Colorado River off and on for most of my earlier years and I can still distinctly remember the muddy taste of the water. The early journals describe filling large containers with the water and letting it settle over night only to find only an inch or so of clear water in the top of the barrel or kettle. Although the River enters the world as a clear, cold mountain stream, by the time it crosses the desert plateau, it is salty and bad tasting.The main problem with the River however, was its unpredictability. In the Spring and early Summer it would flood and wash away the diversion dams. Within a few weeks the river bed could be bone dry. When the pioneers arrived on the river bank and established the four small settlements that are today combined in Joseph City, they began immediately to plow and plant crops. Just a few days later they began building a diversion dam on the river to turn the water into ditches to irrigate the crops. In that very first year, they planted a total of fifty acres or wheat, sixty acres of corn, and potatoes, melons and gardens. In July, a summer thunderstorm flooded the river and washed out that first dam. Without the water in the ditches most of the crops failed. See Tanner, page 32.One early settler complained that they had no salt for their bread, but that the river water took care of the problem.That first dam was only the beginning. Although many of the first settlers abandoned the mission and went back to Utah, those that stayed and those that came in later years, built and rebuilt the dams year after year from 1876 to 1923 when the last and most stable dam was finally constructed."},
{"title": "Irrigation, the life blood of the West", "date": "Friday, August 21, 2009", "text": "One of the most amazing things I remember seeing as a child, was when I first traveled out of the state of Arizona and realized that the farms were growing crops just using the rain that fell out of the sky. I still have a hard time believing that it is possible for a plant, other than a native desert plant, like a fruit tree or a vegetable, to grow without supplemental water from a sprinkler or a ditch.We have always grown a garden, now for more than forty years, and each and every plant depended entirely on the water we provided from a hose on the side of the house. If we missed even one watering session, we risked losing the whole garden. If we left town, we had to arrange for someone to come over and water the garden, a common neighborhood task.Modern irrigation can involve hugely expensive pumps and equipment, with automated sprinkler systems running in gigantic circles. But along side these computer operated high-tech systems, there are still the old faithful irrigation ditch with its gravity fed watering system.The whole idea is to block a river or stream with a diversion dam at a level above the place where the water is needed. The water is then conducted downhill in a series of canals and ditches passing through diversion gates, until it finally gets to the field where it is to be used. I learned very early in life that the water does not run from the feeder ditch into the rows, but is siphoned in by large plastic pipes. When doing the irrigation, you put a hand over the end of the pipe and fill it with water from the ditch by dunking it in the water. When the pipe is full of water, you drop the pipe over the ditch bank and the weight of the water starts a siphoning action draining water through the pipe to the row in the field. It is very hard work and fortunately, I didn't have to irrigate too many times using siphons. Some people do that almost every day of their lives.But, before there was plastic pipe, you had to build little feeder ditches to each row and stand there and make sure the water got to each row and then shovel like crazy before the water flooded over the rows and washed away the plants.Irrigation ditches were a subject of constant maintenance. The ditch banks would get soft from the water and eventually leak. Small leaks always became larger leaks. I was already through with field irrigation by the time someone thought about lining a ditch with cement.By the way, I didn't mention that the water was stored in huge reservoirs and delivered to the fields in large canals or feeder ditches. During the growing season the water runs 24/7 and you get your irrigation turn by virtue of the number of water shares you own on a rotating basis. So, guess what? Your water turn can come any day of the week, including Sundays and holidays and can be at any time, 2:00 am, 3:00 am. You get the picture. Almost nothing, not even funerals or weddings will interfere with a water turn. I can't tell you how much fun it is to get up at 2:00 am and try and find the water head and lead the water down to your field or lot. It is a lot of work trying to turn a ditch full of water down a side ditch and then dam off the main ditch so the water will run down your feeder ditch.Irrigation from a ditch turns the whole field into a swamp. That is why it is sometimes called flood irrigation. I am intimately acquainted with a variety of types of mud in Arizona. Most people have a set of boots or shoes left by door or in a shed specifically dedicated to irrigation.It is somehow comforting however, to realize that right now, somewhere in Arizona dozens, perhaps hundreds of people are standing out in the heat, rain or shine, irrigating fields."},

{"title": "The Fabled Water Bottle Burial Ground", "date": "Thursday, August 13, 2009", "text": "We set out on our search for the fabled Water Bottle Burial Ground reportedly located along the canal in Mesa. It was an unusually wet and stormy day, with lowering clouds and rain showers. The canal bank was deserted, probably because of the rain. It rains so infrequently that people freak out when they think about getting wet and stay indoors.Our first indication of civilization as we know it, was the high protective screen on the bridge over the canal. I speculate that it is to keep despondent people from jumping from the bridge and drowning in the canal. Notice that the fence extends about four feet from the edge of the bridge. One morning someone had driven their car into the canal and it was under this bridge. Driving into the canal is a regular occurrence in Mesa and the Salt River Valley.Next we see a walking lady making her way down the canal bank. The Water Bottle Burial Ground is invisible to those who are not in tuned with the spirit of the canal.There it was, the Burial Ground. I conjecture that future generations will find layers of plastic that they will mine for the hydrocarbons. The banks of the canals are coated with fabulous shells. It is easy to resist picking them up however, since you do not want any extra weight so you can survive the fierce summer heat.Every so often, about every 100 yards, the Salt River Project has placed lovely yellow steps in the canal bank. If you fall into the canal and can swim, you can swim to one of these steps and get out of the canal. If you can't swim, you need to fall into the canal right next to the stairs.Walking lady is still walking. Canals banks, power lines, retention basins, irrigation ditches, all sorts of things to see along the canals. More shells, just so you get the idea. Another artifact of the canal banks, a shopping cart. Most of these carts end up thrown in the canal. I never did understand why the people who steal shopping carts throw them in the canals, but there are places where there are dozens of shopping carts rusting away in the canal water. Walking lady reaching her goal of a walk along the canal."},
{"title": "Walking the canal bank", "date": "Thursday, August 6, 2009", "text": "Mesa Canal from FlickrIrrigation ditches and canals are a basic fact of life in the Arizona desert. From the times of the ancient Hohokam Indians to the present, water has been running through our neighborhoods. Walking the canals is an almost daily routine. There are usually wide dirt roads on either side of the canals and there is no vehicular traffic. You can watch the birds, ducks, pigeons, doves and a few humming birds fly over or swim in the canal water. You can also see the fish. There are thousands of huge fish in the bigger canals. I understand that these fish include catfish, bass, trout and the white amur. Another surprising thing is that the sides of the canal roads are partially paved with shells. The bottom of the canals are alive with mollusks.In the summer in the early morning at 6:00 am it is almost 100 degrees. We walk down to the canal and along the canal road. We say hello to the running bag lady. We watch the running blubber man. We are passed by the running fru-fru lady. All the usual characters are there, including us, I presume. We are probably known as the slow older couple walkers. A lot of the walkers and runners have dogs. Evidence of their passage lines the canal road.The raised roads next to the canals give walkers and bike riders a distinct perspective -- the backyards and rear lots of homes and businesses. In a lot of cases, the view is not good. It is amazing the amount of trash some people have in their rear yards. For the most part, the trash is kept far away from the canals however, there is seldom so much as a piece of paper along the canals. One exception is water bottles. They seem to pile up in drifts. You also have to ignore the huge amount of dog droppings, but keeping a positive attitude, you can enjoy your walk.Now, why did I switch from talking about Arizona pioneers to talking about canals? That is simple, the pioneers would never have succeeded in settling this huge desert without water and they got water from canals coming from rivers. In the modern day there is a disconnect, the Central Arizona Project canal that carries water from the Colorado River across the state to somewhere near Tucson. But in the early days canals were a fact of life in Arizona, so much so, that when I go elsewhere and there are no canals or irrigation systems I wonder how the plants live. So it is on to the next chapter in pioneering Arizona, the water projects."},

He was the father of seventeen children and seventy-eight grandchildren. At the time of his death, he had seventeen great-grandchildren. His grandchildren are almost all dead by now and his great-grandchildren are all at or approaching the traditional retirement age of 65. There is no way to estimate the number of his great-great-grandchildren or their descendants but the Sydney Tanner book (see reference below) estimated his descendants at 1025 in 1982. That number has increased considerably since then because my wife and I alone, currently have twenty-eight grandchildren. It is very common for me to encounter one of his descendants, my cousins in Arizona and elsewhere.It is impossible to measure the impact that this one family has had on the history of the Southwest. If you thought that pioneers had to have been hard characters, Henry Tanner was the exception. George A. Parkinson, Henry's brother-in-law wrote to Henry's son George S. Tanner, in 1947, and said, \"George, in regard to my appraisal of your father, words would fail me to give you my estimate of that wonderful soul. I think if ever a child of God will enter the Celestial Kingdom of God he will. Never in my life have I known a sweeter, purer person than he. I don't believe an unclean thought ever entered his mind. A lover of the beautiful things of life like flowers, and saying sweet things. God bless his memory. What more can I say of him?\"Again from George S. Tanner. \"[Henry Tanner] was a great favorite with children of all ages. His quiet gentle ways quickly won them over and no one could compete with him for the affection of a little child. His interest in everyone led them to believe that they were his favorites and many a parent and child has been heard to make a statement to that effect. At his funeral service James M. Flake, one of his lifelong friends, stated that when the news of Henry M. Tanner's death reached them one of his sons remarked, \"I always felt I was Brother Tanner's favorite.\""},

Smith described Lee's hill, or Lee' s backbone, as follows: \"The ascent was bad and the descent difficult and dangerous, the worse road I ever saw traveled with vehicles.\" At the time, future LDS Church President, Wilford Woodruff, who visited this area several times, in his diary described the backbone as \"The worst hill Ridge or Mountain that I Ever attempted to Cross with a team and waggon on Earth.

It didn't seem possible for the horses to pull the wagons up as the road was so sleep and the boulders so big, and it was just as bad on the dugway on the other side.

Smith's camp on the Little Colorado was called Sunset, Ballinger's was called Ballinger's Camp, Lake's camp was called Obed, and Allen's camp was called Allen City (Allen's Camp). Later in 1878 the Little Colorado Stake was organized. Lot Smith was called as Stake President and George Lake was called as a bishop.Quoting from Regional Studies in Latter-Day Saint Church History:\"The leading teams reached Sunset Crossing on the Little Colorado 23 March 1876; others followed during the weeks to come. They all traveled east the following day to a point about three miles east of present-day Joseph City, where a general council was held. They explored the area and selected town sites. It was decided that William C. Allen should go down the river to a location about one mile east of present-day Joseph City. George Lake would go across the river approximately four miles south of the Allen settlement. Lot Smith moved his group back to Sunset Crossing and selected a spot a little below that crossing. When Jesse O. Ballinger arrived, he selected a locale across the river from Lot Smith's site. The only other occupants of the area were Hopi and Navajo Indians, who were friendly and did not seem to be alarmed at the arrival of their new neighbors. Joseph City was founded officially on 24 March 1876. Because the settlers needed to provide food for themselves from the soil, John Bushman, one of Joseph City's original colonists, plowed ground the day after their arrival. He reported that the land looked salty. Time was precious, and the settlers hastily made preparations for crops. An irrigation ditch was surveyed and a diversion dam established so that wheat could be sowed on April 3, just ten days after their arrival. The colonies received names as follows: George Lake's camp was named Obed; Lot Smith's, Sunset; Jesse O. Ballinger's, Ballinger's Camp. William C. Allen' s camp also took on the leader's name being, called \"Allen City.\" Interestingly, the last name was chosen by a three-year old boy, Frank Cluff, who drew it from a hat instead of the alternate choice, Ramah City. \"Regional Studies in Latter-Day Saint Church History, Arizona.

Brigham City (Ballinger's Camp), Obed (Lake's Camp), Sunset (Smith's Camp), and  St. Joseph (Allen's Camp). Of these four settlements, only St. Joseph, later Joseph City survive to the present day. There is presently a restoration effort directed at preserving the location of Brigham City. Quoting from the blog about the project:As a small, but significant piece of church history, located in Northern Arizona, Brigham City was designated by the Arizona Governor's office as part of Arizona's Centennial Celebration in 2012. On July 17, 2006, while visiting Winslow on a Support-Your-Candidate stopover, Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano was invited to visit the old Mormon fort located just outside of Winslow on the edge of the Little Colorado River. She liked what she saw and agreed to support the restoration of the Fort as part of the Arizona Centennial Celebration.An Arizona Centennial Celebration Portfolio, issued from the Governor's office, now includes \"Brigham City\" as part of the statewide celebration in 2012. Because of this, all donations for the Brigham City Restoration project could possibly be matched by state funds allocated by the state for \"Restoration of Arizona's Historical Sites\".Having spent time driving around Joseph City, I think it would be helpful to have a historic map of the locations to visit and see what is left of this monumental pioneer effort. The project is also mentioned on the Winslow City Website."},

David King Udall, an early pioneer in St. Johns, Arizona made the following comment about the trip in his autobiography; [Udall, David King, Ella Udall, and Ida Hunt Udall. Arizona Pioneer Mormon. Tucson, Ariz: Arizona Silhouettes, 1959.] We reached St. Johns October 6, 1880, having traveled four hundred miles through a wilderness inhabited        page 70  mostly by jackrabbits, prairie dogs, and roaming Indians. The Indians were friendly, due largely to the missionary work of Jacob Hamblin, Anthony W. Ivins, Ammon M. Tenney, Andrew S. Gibbons (Utah pioneer of 1847) and his sons, Ira Hatch, Thales Haskell, and others. Most of the country through which we passed was desolate beyond description. Its terrible remoteness was broken a few years later when the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad (now the Santa Fe) was built through northern Arizona.   It is likely that the severity of the desert left little time to write, with survival being of the utmost importance. The Tanners left no first hand account of their desert crossing, but a couple of stories about the dangers of the trail were preserved.At one point all of the party's water was gone and the animals were about exhausted. They decided to have Henry Tanner drive the stock loose until they found water. He had hardly gone a quarter of a mile from the camp when he found plenty of water in the holes of the rocks in a stream bed. While Henry was driving the stock, Eliza drove the wagon. A wind storm came up and several trees were blown across the road which had to be removed before they could proceed.  Imagine a 19 year old girl driving a team of horses in the midst of a huge storm so fierce that it was blowing down trees. Perhaps you can begin to see what kind of people these pioneers really were."},

No air conditioning, no heat in the winter, no fast food restaurants just off the freeway, no DVD to entertain the children, no radio, no weather service to warn of storms, no doctors, no hospitals, no traffic, no trucks, but there was plenty of wind and dust. The pioneers didn't know they had a spectacular view of the night sky, because that was the only view they had ever seen. If they wanted to eat, they had to build a fire and cook their meal. If they wanted to take a bath, too bad, it didn't happen.Why did they travel into our Arizona desert? The answer is very complex. It starts with a prayer by a 14 year old boy in upper New York State and is still going on with their descendants today in a world wide Church called The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The pioneers had joined the Church in a lot of different places. Some came from Europe, England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France, Norway and Australia. Some came from New England, some from the South and the Mid-Atlantic States. Many of them walked or rode across the continent before coming to Arizona.The pioneers were farmers, carpenters, masons, teamsters and many other trades. They carried all they owned in their wagons and started from the ground up and built towns and cities all over the Mountain West. They established schools, colleges and universities. Their children were school teachers, businessmen and contractors. Their grandchildren were doctors, lawyers, politicians and judges. Their great-grandchildren are poets, university professors and artists. Their great-great-grandchildren study political science, neuro-psychology and astrophysics.As we their descendants sing:They, the builders of the nation,Blazing trails along the way;Stepping-stones for generationsWere their deeds of ev’ry day.Building new and firm foundations,Pushing on the wild frontier,Forging onward, ever onward,Blessed, honored Pioneer!Text: Ida R.

From the Bushman Diary as quoted by George S. Tanner, \"From the river south, the roads were sandy and hard to go along. We had to make considerable roads which delayed us some. Water being so scarce, we divided the company. Came to Walaipi Valley thirty miles long and ten miles wide, but no water. On Monday, April 2nd, came to Hackberry, a little mining camp. on the 3rd came to the old Beal road that was used in 1852. This road will take us past the San Francisco Mountains to the little settlements on the Little Colorado River. On April 13th, the first part of the company arrived at Fort Valley by the San Francisco Mountain. They remained there until April 20th when all the company came. All rested here until the 24th when the started for the Little Colorado.\"It is reported by George S. Tanner that several of the Hunt girls left diaries of the trip and from those diaries it seems that the company was divided into three groups; the Bushmans and Manasseh Blackburn company, followed by the Westovers and their company, with the Hunts and Tanners taking up the rear. The description of the trip evidences difficult conditions that created extreme hardship. Here is the Hunt sisters' account as edited by George S. Tanner. The account begins at the Walaipi Valley where they rested their animals due to the availability of water and grass: (Spelling and grammar in the original).\"Here one of Henry's [Henry Martin Tanner] mares died of distemper.\" At Footoon Spring an ox in Hunt team gave out and had to be left. \"There was very little grass here so we did not expect to see him again.\" On April 7th they came to Young Springs where they noted \"a great many Indians but very little water. There being only two little springs, had it not been for a ranch (Peach Springs) three miles off the road on the left, the animals would have suffered greatly for water. We unloaded our light wagon and took the barrels and everything that would hold water up to be filled. Here our old Broad, our trusty near wheel ox, got down on a rockly hill and could not get up so we sold him to the Indians to eat. This left only two oxen in the team and we had to work cows in the place of the dead oxen.\"The magnitude of the journey can be sensed by looking at the Google Maps of Peach Springs, Arizona, located just north of U.S. 66 and quite a bit north of the newer Interstate 40.

{"title": "Across the Colorado and into Arizona", "date": "Monday, July 6, 2009", "text": "John Hunt and Henry Tanner explored the southern route. Instead of crossing the river at Lee's Ferry, they traveled to the south and crossed at Pearce's Ferry. As we learned previously, this crossing had been pioneered by Jacob Hamblin in 1862, but a regular ferry was not established until December, 1876 by Harrison Pearce, father of James Pearce who was later a pioneer in Taylor, Arizona. The site of the ferry now lies under the waters of Lake Mead.South of St. George, Utah, the pioneer company was increased with the addition of the John Bushman company. John, accompanied by his second wife, Mary Peterson, and his daughter Lois, had previous agreed to travel with the pioneers to Arizona. The Bushman party also included Edwin Lycurgus Westover, his wife Joanna, Joanna's father, and her two small children.In the words of John Bushman:This road was very bad, dugways for miles, very hilly and water scarce. This is a new road from St. George to the Pearce Ferry on the Big Colorado River. Some places were almost impassable and rocky. On Monday, March 19th, we reached the Ferry and found Father Pearce very glad to see us. Quoting George Shepherd Tanner's account of the river crossing:Two days were used in getting the wagons and animals across the river. The wagons were ferried across without mishap but the livestock presented a difficult problem. The animals refused to swim the broad river and there was no other way to get them across. Henry was a skilled horseman and used to handling stock and it was his job to get the animals across. After scores of attempts which met with failure, the company was about to despair. He related that on the second day after many failures, a old Indian came into the camp and asked for food. While he was being fed, he noticed the men trying to get the animals to swim the river. One of the women noticed the the Indian showed a great deal of interest in the ferry operation. It came to her that this Indian had had experience in crossing the river with animals and she mentioned the fact to one of the men. By the use of sign language, he was asked if he knew how to gt the animals across. He said that he did and was asked to help. But he wanted to be paid. After some bargaining, he settled for a small sack of flour which he tied on the saddle of his horse. He then went down to the river and motioned for the men to drive all the animals into the edge of he water. At the right moment when all the animals were up to their bellies in the water, the Indian, who by this time had taken off what few clothes he had and was covered only with an Indian blanket, seized the top corners of the blanket in his hands and began flapping the blanket and letting out war whoops. The animals, now more frightened of the Indian than the river, quickly took to the water and headed for the other side. The last animal to take to the water was an old, lazy mule. As he was getting out his depth, the Indian threw his blanket to one of the men, seized the tail of the old mule and let him pull him across the river. When the mule saw the Indian on his tail he was so frightened that it is reported he made a new record in crossing the river. The Indian's long loose hair was streaming behind him in the water. He would put his head into the water for an instant, fill his mouth with water and blow it at the frightened animal and then let out another whoop. The animals could possibly be excused for being frightened. They even experienced some difficulty in getting the animals rounded up after they were across.Next, into the wilds of Arizona.Source unless otherwise indicated:Tanner, George S.

Henry was 24 years old and Eliza was 19. At the time of their marriage, Henry had already been called to settle in Arizona. They spent the next month preparing their wagons and obtaining provisions for the trip. Neither of them was a stranger to wagon travel. They owned a fine pair of mares called Mag and Puss. They were a spirited pair of horses and Puss would dance to music. Henry also had another span of horses and saddle horse, for a total of five horses in all.Eliza's father, Thomas Parkinson, gave her a milk cow named Red. They also had other cattle for the trip.Quoting from George S. Tanner's biography of Henry Martin Tanner:In preparation for their   departure, Sydney Tanner gave a   reception and farewell, for   the young couple in the upstairs of his   ample home. In addition to the friends in Beaver who attended   were the members of the Hunt   family who were also going to   Arizona. For the past year   the Hunts had been living on Cove   Creek two and a half miles   from Joseph City, Sevier County, Utah.   The Hunts had eight   children, the oldest of whom was but one year   younger than Eliza Tanner.   They had three wagons of their own,   one drawn by two yoke of   oxen, one by two span of horses and a   light wagon with one span of horses. The oxen were driven by   a young man anxious for a   bit of adventure by the name if Isadore   Wilson. He was a neighbor of   the Hunts. John Hunt drove the fair   horse team and two of the   girls, drove the light wagon. Also in the   Hunt company was a four mule   team owned by Manasseh Blackburn,   also anxious for the   adventure of the trip. His wagon carried   mostly heavy supplies   belonging 10 the Hunts.   Before leaving Beaver, Thomas Parkinson had mixed a large   quantity of flour with soda   and probably cream, at tartar so that   all that was necessary in making bread was to add salt and water.   The company left Beaver   February 21, 1877, accompanied by   Father Sidney Tanner who went one day's journey with them and   hauled feed for their animals. Enroute to St. George, Henry   and Eliza went by way of   Toquerville for a few day's visit with   relatives. Emma Ellen   Stapley, cousin of Eliza, was at that   time a girl of fifteen.   Perhaps she little dreamed that ten years   later she would be going to   Arizona too. She undoubtedly met the   Tanner couple on this visit. At St. George, Sam Porter, half   brother of Eliza, joined a   party of well wishers who accompanied   them a mile and a half from   the city to bid them God's speed.Next, the journey to Northern Arizona"},
{"title": "The migration begins -- Mormon colonization of Arizona", "date": "Sunday, June 28, 2009", "text": "Wikipedia The Arizona colonies were an extension of Brigham Young's plan for the colonization of the West. The settlers in these colonies were called as missionaries, some for the rest of their lives. The Arizona missionary call came in early 1876. Despite the exploratory work done by Jacob Hamblin and all of the others, this was a hazardous and tremendously difficult undertaking. Before their departure on the mission, all of the missionaries were re-baptized as a token of their devotion to their duty and \"so they could enter into the work with their former sins forgiven and with renewed fervor.\" Tanner page 12 see citation below.The original plan called for four settlements of fifty families each.  The four leaders called were George Lake, William C. Allen, Jesse O. Ballinger and Lot Smith.The Lake company was recruited from Cache, Box Elder and Weber Counties in Utah.The Smith company came from Davis, Morgan, Summit and Wasatch counties.The Allen company was drawn from Utah County.The Ballinger company from Sanpete and Juab counties.The companies did not all leave at the same time but the migration stretched out over two years or more. The first company left Salt Lake on February 3, 1876. They followed the trail across the north side of the Grand Canyon along the cliffs to Kanab. They crossed over into Arizona at Lee's Ferry. On March 23, they arrived at Sunset Crossing on the Little Colorado River. After traveling about twenty-five miles up the River, they held a council to decide on a location for the settlement.After lengthy discussion, including input from James S. Brown, an Indian missionary. the council finally decided, after much discussion, to settle where they had stopped. The Allen company chose a spot four miles east of the town of Joseph City, Arizona. The settlement was originally called Allen's Camp. A few months later, the Allen Company was moved about two miles closer to the present settlement of Joseph City where the colonists constructed a fort. The fort was used by the colony for a number of years.Source unless otherwise indicated:Tanner, George S.

Blythe and began service on October 15, 1873. Since John D. Lee was arrested in 1874, he was long gone by the time of the early settlers in 1876 and 1877. As a note, John D. Lee was executed by firing squad on March 23, 1877. By 1877, the Paria Road, as it was known, was used for hauling freight into Arizona, especially to Prescott, which was, at that time, the Territorial Capital and remained so until Phoenix became the Capital in 1889.When the first Mormon pioneer settlers started into the deserts and mountains of Arizona, there were no rail lines, everything coming into the State had to be hauled by horse or ox wagon. At that time the nearest railroad terminus was west of Yuma, many hundreds of miles from northern Arizona.My Great-grandfather, Henry Martin Tanner, came to the Little Colorado River colonies in 1877, about a year after the first colonists began entering the Territory. One exceptional account of crossing the Colorado at Lee's Ferry comes from a narrative by Erastus B. Snow, who reached the river on January 16, 1878. The account is as follows:The Colorado River, the Little Colorado and all the springs and watering places were frozen over. Many of the springs and tanks were entirely frozen up, so that we were compelled to melt snow and ice for our teams. We (that is J. W. Young and I), crossed our team and wagon on the ice over the Colorado. I assure you it was quite a novelty to me, to cross such a stream of water on ice; many other heavily loaded wagons did the same, some with 2500 pounds on. One party did a very foolish trick, which resulted in the loss of an ox; they attempted to cross three head of large cattle all yoked and chained together, and one of the wheelers stepped on a chain that was dragging behind, tripped and fell, pulling his mate with him, thereby bringing such a heft on the ice that it broke through, letting the whole into the water; but the ice being sufficiently strong they could stand on it and pull them out one at a time. One got under the ice and was drowned, the live one swimming some length of time holding the dead one up by the yoke.This is the last reported time that the Colorado River has ever frozen. The incident in crossing the river was also recounted by Anthony W. Ivins, later a member of the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as related to James H. McClintock: [T]he river was frozen from shore to shore, but, above and below for a short distance, the river was open and running rapidly.\" Great care was taken in crossing, the wagons with their loads usually pulled over by hand and the horses taken over singly. Thus the ice was cracked. Mr. Ivins recites the episode of the oxen and then tells that a herd of cattle was taken across by throwing each animal, tying its legs and dragging it across. One man could drag a grown cow over the smooth ice. Mr. Ivins tells that he remained at the river several days, crossing on the ice 32 times. On the 22d the missionaries and settlers all were at Navajo Springs, ready to continue the journey.The journey continues...Source unless otherwise noted:McClintock, James H.

We used to stop at the campground frequently to sleep overnight on trips from Arizona to Utah, but the National Park Service raised the entrance fee to $15 per vehicle and the camping fee to $12 per night per site. Since the total is only slightly less than the cost of a motel room, we have opted for the motels.Lee's Ferry is upriver from Navajo Bridge. There are really two bridges, the old one now confined to foot traffic and the newer bridge which is the only way to drive across the river and the canyons by automobile between Hoover Dam and Mexican Hat. [There are two foot bridges at the bottom of the Grand Canyon and a ferry boat between Halls Crossing and Bullfrog Marina in Utah.]Now to the history. The first European crossing of the river at the mouth of the Paria River (also spelled Pahreah) was in the fall of 1860. This attempt was unsuccessful and the exploration party, headed by Jacob Hamblin, finally gave up and continued up the river to the Crossing of the Fathers. The official \"first\" crossing took place in March of 1864 when Jacob Hamblin again tried the route. This time the party was able to transport fifteen men and their horses and supplies across the river.In 1869 or early 1870 a fort with guards was built on the north side of the river. The official date of the establishment being given as January 31, 1870. In the fall of 1870 Brigham Young, President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints visited the mouth of the Paria. From time to time, other crossings were made at the location and by October 28, 1871 a ferry service had been established.The name of the crossing came from the notorious John D. Lee, who has been vilified mainly by anti-Mormons for his participation in the Mountain Meadows massacre. Lee arrived at the crossing in 1872 and named it \"Lonely Dell.\" Although he only lived there with his family for a short time, his name passed to the ferry and now the location. There has been much written about the incident at Mountain Meadows and a considerable amount about Lee, but I will not add anything to the present state of the scholarship on that incident.Continued later."},

He was truly one of the great men of our history and certainly of the history of the Southwest. One story that I have heard all my life gives an idea of the estimation in which the Indians held him.As told by his son Jacob Hamblin, Jr. it is transcribed as follows:One day my father sent me to trade a horse with an old Navajo Indian chief. I was a little fellow and I went on horseback, leading the horse to be traded. The old chief came out and lifted me down from my horse. I told him my father wanted me to trade the horse for some blankets. He brought out a number of handsome blankets, but, as my father had told me to be sure and make a good trade, I shook my head and said I would have to have more. He then brought out two buffalo robes and quite a number of other blankets and finally, when I thought I had done very well, I took the roll on my horse, and started for home. When I gave the blankets to my father, he unrolled them, looked at them, and then began to separate them. He put blanket after blanket into a roll and then did them up and told me to get on my horse and take them back and tell the chief he had sent me too many. When I got back, the old chief took them and smiled. He said, \"I knew you would come back; I knew Jacob would not keep so many; you know Jacob is our father, as well as your father.Jacob Hamblin died of malarial fever, August 31, 1886, at Pleasanton, in Williams Valley, New Mexico, where a settlement of Saints had been made in October, 1882. Hamblin's remains were removed from Pleasanton before 1889, to Alpine, Arizona, where was erected a shaft bearing this very appropriate inscription: In memory of JACOB V.

Bishop Lorenzo W. Roundy has the distinction of drowning at Lee's Ferry in 1876.\"The year before the above incident, in the spring of 1873, President Brigham Young had called a number of people to establish settlements in Arizona. They met at the tabernacle in Salt Lake where they were given instructions by President Young. A company of these people headed by Lorenzo W. Roundy stopped in Kanab for a short time in April as they were on their way to Arizona. After the river was crossed, the expedition was abandoned when they saw the desert wasteland and because they feared Indians. They returned to Utah. Among these were Charles S. Cram and family, who first settled in Johnson, but later located at Kanab. They brought with them a number of cows and horses which they first ran in Stewart Canyon.       According to John R. Young, it was 1873 that the road over 'Lee's Backbone' near Lee's Ferry was built.       Zadok Judd, Jr., says that he, Walter Dinsor, and L. C. Mariger from Kanab worked with the other men in Southern Utah on this project. They repaired the road from Kanab and spent about three weeks building the road over Lee's Backbone. On their way home they met the Lorenzo W. Roundy company. He says, \"Thus we opened the gateway from Utah to Arizona and it was, I suppose, the only wagon road used for many years.\"From information attributed to a manuscript \"History of Kanab\" compiled from old journals, etc. by Rose H. Hamblin. See Jared Pratt Family Association.Jacob Hamblin's Narrative gives a more complete account of the death of Bishop Roundy:In May, 1876, Brothers D. H. Wells, Erastus Snow and other leading men among the Saints, were sent to visit the new settlements in Arizona. I was sent with them as a guide. The Colorado was then high — a raging torrent. The current shifted from side to side, and the surging of the waters against the rocks caused large and dangerous whirlpools.We put three wagons and some luggage on the ferry boat. We were under the necessity of towing the boat up stream one mile, to give a chance for landing at the proper place on the other side of the river. When taking the boat around a point of rock, the water poured over the bow. Word was given to slacken the tow rope. In doing so, the rope caught in the seam of a rock, and the draft on the boat continuing, the bow was drawn under water.In a moment the rapid current swept the boat clear of its contents. Men, wagons and luggage went into the surging waters. When I plunged into the cold snow-water to swim, my rightarm cramped, which caused me to almost despair of getting ashore. A large oar was passing me, and I threw my arm over it to Save myself from sinking. About the same time Brother L. John Nuttall caught the same oar, so I thought it best to try to swim with one arm. However, I was soon able to use both, and went safely to shore.I ran down the river bank, got into a skiff with two others, pulled out to the heads of the rapids, and saved a wagon and its contents on an island. The other two wagons with all the valuables they contained, including the most of our supplies, passed over the rapids into the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. On getting together we found that Brother Lorenzo W. Roundy was missing. He was said to be a good swimmer, and it is probable he was taken with the cramp and sank at once. His body has never been found.Brother Lorenzo Hatch sank deep into the river, but saved himself from drowning and was picked up by the skiff. Brother Warren Johnson and another man hung to a wagon until they were taken up with the skiff, just in time to save them from going over the rapids.This unfortunate affair occurred on the 28th of May. We gathered up what was left of our outfit, and visited the missions at Mowabby and Moancoppy, and the settlements on the Little Colorado.Little, James A.

{"title": "The Little Colorado River", "date": "Monday, June 8, 2009", "text": "WikipediaFor the past few posts I have been giving the background for the Mormon pioneering of the Little Colorado River settlements. It is time to say something about the river.For a good portion of my life I drank and bathed in the water from the Little Colorado River. It is a river in name only. In most parts of the country it would not even merit a name as a stream, although during parts of the year it is a raging flood. I could easily wade across and at some times even jump across the River.There are a few things I distinctly remember about the water. The first is the taste. When I was young, in St. Johns, the water came out of the tap barely filtered. If you filled an ice cube tray with water from the tap (there wasn't anywhere else to get it) the cubes would come out half white and half red from the silt in the water. The water had a distinctive sandy gritty taste. All I have to do is think about it and I can still taste it in my imagination.If you took a bath in the bathtub, you might want to fill the tub before you got in. In filling the tub you could always find two or three small leaches swimming around in the water. It was also a good idea to look at the glass before taking a drink.The Little Colorado starts as a sparkling (they always use that word) mountain stream, high in the White Mountains of Arizona near Mount Baldy. As the river runs north out of the mountains it enters a small canyon and then runs into a large reservoir, Lyman Lake. The Lyman was the principal water supply for St. Johns and anywhere north. There was another small reservoir, called appropriately, the Little Reservoir, right off the hill from where I lived. But it was on private land and technically, even though it was \"owned\" by my uncle, we were trespassing when we played in the water floating rafts and swimming in the mud.The Lyman was big enough for boats and water skiing. But during the current long drought it almost went dry several times. At the moment it is quite full as of 2009, but that could change by next year. There used to be a buffalo herd around the Lake, but it was removed quite a few years ago. Lyman Lake is a State Park and there is an entrance fee. There is also a nice campground and good fishing. But the State Park is scheduled to be closed because of budget cuts.There are several Indian ruins along the River. Two of them have been open to the public for a charge. Raven House was promoted for a while and then closed to the public. There are two other ruins, Rattlesnake Ruins and Casa Malpais. Bother of which charge admission.There are a number of springs and caves along the Little Colorado. The biggest spring is in the place called Salado or Salado Spring. It is a very deep artisan spring with clear water. The caves are mostly sink holes and as far as I could determine, very short. I always hoped that I would find a large cave, but it never happened.After going north from St. Johns the River winds across the Plateau passing Hunt, Holbrook, Joseph City, Winslow and then going north to the Grand Falls. This is feature is either a little trickle of water or a roaring waterfall higher than Niagara. Eventually, after crossing most of the Navajo Indian Reservation, the River passes by Cameron and then into a deep canyon where it joins the Colorado.The pioneers used the water for everything from drinking to washing. In a lot of the settlements it was the only water available. Next we will go back to the history of the settlements."},

The official name of the painting is Chief Tuba and Jacob Hamblin, by John Jarvis, gousch, 1982. Interestingly, (to me anyway) the picture is painted right next to the Tanner Wash. By the way, a copy of Jacob Hamblin complete autobiography is here:\"Jacob Hamblin, a narrative of his personal experience, as a frontiersman, missionary to the Indians and explorer : disclosing interpositions of Providence, severe privations, perilous situations and remarkable escapes\"In the early 1870s Jacob Hamblin made several trips to the Hopi Villages and succeeded in surveying the different routes to the Little Colorado River area. Although the Little Colorado River is mostly a dry riverbed with a seasonal flow, it is the only semi-dependable water source in the entire area. Although from a modern perspective, it is practically impossible to understand why the Mormons would settle in such a desolate area, you can only begin to understand these settlements in the historic context of the time.The Mormons had been literally driven across the continent by persecution. Our promised land consisted of a vast unexplored wilderness. Brigham Young's vision of the settlement of this wilderness did not include congregating in one large settlement. From the very beginning, Brigham Young sent out colonists to establish outposts in the major river valleys and along all of the major trade routes. This colonization extended from Canada on the north to Mexico on the south. There are hundreds of cities, towns and villages that were first settled by the Mormons. Some very large cities, like Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, Mesa and many others, have resulted from this early settlement. The harsness and isolation of the early living conditions created a social and cultural structure that gave a legacy to all of the descendants of those early pioneers. Those same societal and cultural structures are still a dominent force in their descendants.Now back to the story. During the years of 1871 to 1873, Hamblin and the other missionaries located a settlement on the Paria River (now abandoned), started a ranch in House Rock Valley (now a tourist stop and staging area for Colorado River cruises) and laid out a practical route from Lee's Ferry to the Little Colorado.The earliest crossing of the Colorado River at Lee's Ferry by wagons was in 1873 by a exploration party headed by Lorenzo W. Roundy. The party traveled southward to Navajo Springs, then to Bitter Springs and on to Moen Copie (now spelled Moencopi or Moenkopi) just south of present day Tuba City.The Encyclopedia of Mormonism (Ludlow, Daniel H. Encyclopedia of Mormonism. New York: Macmillan, 1992.) notes that:A party of scouts under Lorenzo Roundy examined the San Francisco Mountains and the Little Colorado River drainages for town sites. Brigham Young called 200 colonizing and Indian missionaries who, without adequate preparation, hurried south in the winter and spring of 1873. This mission foundered in the desert country north of the Little Colorado, and the missionaries retreated to Utah. Only John D. Lee and a few others held on at Lees Ferry and Moenkopi.McClintock reports that Roundy \"passed by a Moqui village and thence on to the overland mail route. The Little Colorado was described as \"not quite the size of the Virgin River, water a little brackish, but better than that of the Virgin.\" In May of the same year, Hamblin piloted, as far as Moen Copie, the first ten wagons of the Horton D. Haight expedition that failed in an attempt to found a settlement on the Little Colorado.\" It is reported that the expedition reached the Grand Falls of the Little Colorado, but went no further.Some of these 1873 missionaries stayed at Moen Copie (Moenkopi) until 1874 when trouble with the Indians convinced them to return to Utah.At about this time, as stated by the Utah State University Libraries, a \"Geographical Survey was led by Lieutenant George Montague Wheeler and traveled throughout the mountains, plains, and deserts in California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Idaho and New Mexico. The purpose of these expeditions was to create maps and gain information that would be useful for future military operations, for the establishment of roads, and for potential railways. In addition, the survey was to catalog natural resources and record the location and population of the Indian tribes.\""},

By 1870 it was assumed that the Mormon pioneers would settle somewhere in Arizona. One of the most obvious impediments to the settlement was the Navajo nation. It is reported that in 1869 the Indians had stolen approximately $1,000,000 worth of cattle, horses and sheep in southern Utah. In the autumn of that year, Jacob Hamblin, at Major J. W. Powell's invitation, gathered with the Major's party and some others, including Ammon M. Tenney, Ashton Nebecker, Nathan Terry and Elijah Potter, with an Indian guide to attend peace talks with the Navajos.McClintock relates an interview with Ammon Tenney in which the great council, including U.S. Army officers, Powell, Hamblin's party and some 8000 Indians, took place at Fort Defiance. Fort Defiance had been established as a military outpost in 1851. The U.S. Government, by this time, had a long history with the Navajos. Tribal land had been reduced by the Bonneville Treaty of 1858. Other treaties had been signed in 1849, and 1861. It is important to understand the immediate background of this meeting. The Navajo had been at war with the U.S. for many years culminating with an unsuccessful attack on Fort Defiance in 1860. However, because of the U.S. Civil War, troops were removed from most of the forts in Arizona. After the war, Brigadier General James H. Carleton and Kit Carson were sent with troops to restore order and subdue the Navajo. This was accomplished through a brutal campaign of repression ending with the wholesale removal of the majority of the Navajos to Fort Sumner, New Mexico. The exodus of the Navajos in 1864 is referred to as the \"Long Walk.\" Navajos on the Long Walk In the Navajo Treaty of 1868 the remnant of the Navajos were allowed to return to their own lands. Despite the Treaty, raids along the southern border of Utah had continued unabated. The Great Council was decidedly hostile. Hamblin spoke to the gathering and concluded as follows:What shall I tell my people, the Mormons, when I return home? That we may live in peace, live as friends, and trade with one another? Or shall we look for you to come prowling around our weak settlements, like wolves in the night? I hope we may live in peace in time to come. I have now gray hairs on my head, and from my boyhood I have been on the frontiers doing all I could to preserve peace between white men and Indians I despise this killing, this shedding of blood. I hope you will stop this and come and visit and trade with our people. We would like to hear what you have got to say before we go home. The response of the Indians as reported by McClintock is described as follows:Barbenceta, the principal chief, slowly approached as Jacob ended and, putting his arms around him, said, \"My friend and brother, I will do all that I can to bring about what you have advised. We will not give all our answer now. Many of the Navajos are here. We will talk to them tonight and will see you on your way home.\" The chief addressed his people from a little eminence. The Americans understood little or nothing of what he was saying, but it was agreed that it was a great oration. The Indians hung upon every word and responded to every gesture and occasionally, in unison, there would come from the crowd a harsh \"Huh, Huh,\" in approval of their chieftain's advice and admonition.It is notable that in John Wesley Powell's account the participation of Jacob Hamblin in the Great Council is entirely omitted.Source unless indicatedMcClintock, James H.

{"title": "Jacob Hamblin and John Wesley Powell", "date": "Sunday, May 31, 2009", "text": "TAU-GU, CHIEF OF THE PAIUTES, OVERLOOKING THE VIRGIN RIVER WITH J.W. POWELL, AGE 39. Circa 1873 - Grca 13806In 1870, Jacob Hamblin met the explorer John Wesley Powell. Powell had descended the Colorado River the previous year. Three of Powell's men had been killed near Mount Trumbull, southwest of Kanab by Shivwits Indians. Although there is some recently manufactured controversy over the killings, Powell described the meeting with the Indians:This evening, the Shivwits, for whom we have sent, come in, and after supper we hold a long council. A blazing fire is built, and around this we sit — the Indians living here, the Shivwits, Jacob Hamblin and myself. This man, Hamblin, speaks their language well and has a great influence over all the Indians in the region round about. He is a silent, reserved man, and when he speaks it is in a slow, quiet way that inspires great awe. His talk is so low that they must listen attentively to hear, and they sit around him in deathlike silence. When he finishes a measured sentence the chief repeats it and they all give a solemn grunt. But, first, I fill my pipe, light it, and take a few whiffs, then pass it to Hamblin; he smokes and gives it to the man next, and so it goes around. When it has passed the chief, he takes out his own pipe, fills and lights it, and passes it around after mine. I can smoke my own pipe in turn, but when the Indian pipe comes around, I am nonplussed. It has a large stem, which has at some time been broken, and now there is a buckskin rag wound around it and tied with sinew, so that the end of the stem is a huge mouthful, exceedingly repulsive. To gain time, I refill it, then engage in very earnest conversation, and, all unawares, I pass it to my neighbor unlighted. I tell the Indians that I wish to spend some months in their country during the coming year and that I would like them to treat me as a friend. I do not wish to trade; do not want their lands.Heretofore I have found it very difficult to make the natives understand my object, but the gravity of the Mormon missionary helps me much. Then their chief replies: \"Your talk is good and we believe what you say. We believe in Jacob, and look upon you as a father. When you are hungry, you may have our game. You may gather our sweet fruits. We will give you food when you come to our land. We will show you the springs and you may drink; the water is good. We will be friends and when you come we will be glad. We will tell the Indians who live on the other side of the great river that we have seen Kapurats (one-armed—the Indian name for Powell) and that he is the Indian's friend. We will tell them he is Jacob's friend.\" The Indians told that the three men had been killed in the belief they were miners. They had come upon an Indian village, almost starved and exhausted with fatigue, had been supplied with food and put on their way to the settlements. On receipt of news that certain Indians had been killed by whites, the men were followed, ambushed and slain with many arrows. Powell observes that that night he slept in peace, \"although these murderers of my men were sleeping not 500 yards away.\" Hamblin improved the time in trying to make the Indians understand the idea of an overruling Providence and to appreciate that God was not pleased with the shedding of blood. He admitted, \"These teachings did not appear to have much influence at the time, but afterwards they yielded much good fruit.\"Much later recent accounts try to lay the blame for the killings on the Mormons, tying the whole thing into the Mountain Meadows massacre. However, the Mountain Meadows incident occurred twelve years before the Powell expedition in September of 1857. It stretches belief beyond credibility that Jacob Hamblin would have been even indirectly involved in killing anyone.Sources unless indicatedMcClintock, James H.

{"title": "Indian trouble in old Northern Arizona", "date": "Friday, May 29, 2009", "text": "The exploration of settlement of northern Arizona was not free of frontier violence. Although the Indians were not being displaced during the early years of the exploration, they were a constant threat to the missionary/explorers. Dr. Jas. M. Whitmore and his herder, Robert McIntire were killed by a band of Paiede Paiutes and Navajos on January 8, 1866. The Indians also drove off horses, sheep and cattle. The incident reportedly occurred four miles north of Pipe Springs, just south of the Utah border with Arizona.Quoting Gottfredson's History of Indian Depredations in Utah at page 179:Early in the year 1866 the Navajo Indians who were on the Arizona side of the Colorado River, being more numerous and superior than the Shevete Indians who inhabited the Utah side of the river, would often cross over and compel the less powerful tribe to do their bidding. Frequently they also captured and made slave of some of them. On this certain occasion some of them crossed over and compelled the Shevet's who were camped in the neighborhood to assist in killing Dr. J. M. Whitmore and his hired man, Robert McIntyre, and drive away their sheep-herd and some cattle. This took place in the beginning of a big snow storm. When Dr. Whitmore and his hired man left the herd-house Whimore had on his overcoat and carried in pocket two twenty dollar gold pieces. The Shevete Indians secured the men's clothing but not knowing the value of money, the gold pieces were later recovered. The Navajoes took the sheep and cattle over the river and they were never recovered. About the 20th of January, 1866, a company of armed men from St. George went in search of the murdered men. They came across two young Indians and compelled them to assist in the hunt. They acknowledged having seen the killing, but claimed they had no hand in it. There was about eighteen inches of crusted snow on the ground and the bodies were covered up. The men rode forward and back, four abreast and finally Colonel Pierce's horse stepped over the body of Dr. Whitmore and uncovered one hand which was raised above the body. When the whites informed the Indians that one of the murdered men had been found, one asked if it was the man with whiskers. When answered in the affirmative, he said: the other is over this way, they followed the Indian and then found Mclntyre's body. There was a camp of Indians not far distant and Captain Pierce, with some of his men, went there and found the murdered men's clothing. The Indians refused to be taken prisoners and put up a fight, which resulted in seven of them being killed.The McClintock version of the same incident is quite different in many details, at page 72:There was pursuit from St. George by Col. D. D. McArthur and company. A tale of the pursuit comes from Anthony W. Ivins, a member of the company, then a mere boy who went out on a mule with a quilt for a saddle. The weather was bitterly cold. The bodies were found covered with snow, which was three feet deep. Each body had many arrow and bullet wounds. The men had been attacked while riding the range, only Mclntire being armed. A detachment, under Captain James Andrus, found the murderous Indians in camp and, in a short engagement, killed nine of them. During the next few years there was continual conflict between the Navajo raiders and the Mormon colonists in southern Utah. The Shevete Indians are now more commonly called the Shivwits and there is no modern designation for the Indians referred to a Paiede Piautes.Sources unless indicatedGottfredson, Peter.

{"title": "A fight with the Indians", "date": "Wednesday, May 27, 2009", "text": "Not only did the early pioneers and explorers have to deal with the extreme temperatures and desert conditions of northern Arizona, there were frequent confrontations with the Indians, primarily the Navajos. In our present society of overwhelming political correctness, we have a tendency to downplay the role these often violent conflicts played in the story of the settlement of Arizona and the other western states.Ammon M. Tenney had an experience that was retold by James McClintock in his book Mormon Settlement in Arizona. Although the book is entitled a peaceful conquest, the reality was that the conquest was not always peaceful.Here is the story as told to McClintock:Ammon M. Tenney in Phoenix lately told the Author that the Navajo were the only Indians who ever really fought the Mormons and the only tribe against which the Mormons were compelled to depart from their rule against the shedding of blood. It is not intended in this work to go into any history of the many encounters between the Utah Mormons and the Arizona Navajo, but there should be inclusion of a story told by Tenney of an experience in 1865 at a point eighteen miles west of Pipe Springs and six miles southwest of Canaan, Utah. There were three Americans from Toquerville, the elder Tenney, the narrator, and Enoch Dodge, the last known as one of the bravest of southern Utah pioneers. The three were surrounded by sixteen Navajos, and, with their backs to the wall, fought for an hour or more, finally abandoning their thirteen horses and running for better shelter. Dodge was shot through the knee cap, a wound that incapacitated him from the fight thereafter. The elder Tenney fell and broke his shoulder blade and was stunned, though he was not shot. This left the fight upon the younger Tenney, who managed to climb a twelve-foot rocky escarpment. He reached down with his rifle and dragged up his father and Dodge. The three opportunely found a little cave in which they secreted themselves until reasonably rested, hearing the Indians searching for them on the plateau above. Then, in the darkness, they made their way fifteen miles into Duncan's Retreat on the Virgin River in Utah. \"There is one thing I will say for the Navajo,\" Tenney declared with fervor. \"He is a sure-enough fighting man. The sixteen of them stood shoulder to shoulder, not taking cover, as almost any other southwestern Indian would have done.\"We will have more stories about the Navajos and the Mormon Settlers.Sources unless indicated:McClintock, James H.

{"title": "Finally, a pioneer route into Arizona", "date": "Saturday, May 23, 2009", "text": "Beginning on March 18, 1863, the venerable explorer and missionary, Jacob Hamblin, returned to Arizona with a party of six white men and the Hopi Indians they had taken with them the year before. Once again they tried the western route into Arizona, crossing the Colorado at a place that became known as Pearce's Ferry. This fortuitous discovery opened a way into Arizona that did not require the effort of either the Crossing of the Fathers or the yet to be established Lee's Ferry at the mouth of the Paria. Pearce's Ferry now lies beneath the waters of Lake Mead.After crossing the river, the explorers were overtaken by Lewis Greeley, the nephew of Horace Greeley of the New York Tribune. Lewis had been sent down to the river by apostle Erastus Snow. Notably, on this trip, Hamblin and his band made their way deep into the Grand Canyon to visit the Hava-Supai Indians. Although the group did not penetrate deep into the Hava-Supai territory, they were undoubtedly the first white men to see the spectacular Havasupai Canyon formerly called Cataract Canyon. Having hiked into Havasupai Canyon three times, I can imagine the difficulties experienced in traveling in this very rugged area.The explorers continued their trek eastward following along the Moqui Indian trail south of the Grand Canyon. However, they had a mission to accomplish and did not take any side trips to see the canyon. After delivering the Indians back to their villages, the explorers struck out to the southwest, passing to the east of the San Francisco Peaks, stopping just a few miles north of what is now Flagstaff, Arizona. Later, a settlement called Fort Moroni or Fort Valley would be established six miles west of LeRoux Springs.The party was searching for the Beale Trail, named after Navy Lieutenant, Edward Fitzgerald Beale, who, beginning in 1857, surveyed a route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas through Oklahoma to Fort Defiance and on into California.The Hamblin party followed the Beale Road but found the way very dry and went for 56 hours without water. Also, ten of their eighteen horses were stolen. They reached St. George on May 13, 1863 after establishing a practicable wagon road from St. George to the Little Colorado River and the Hopi villages. This set the stage for the settlement of the Little Colorado River communities. But there is still more story to tell.Source unless otherwise noted:McClintock, James H.

{"title": "The First Tour Around the Grand Canyon", "date": "Wednesday, May 20, 2009", "text": "Jacob Hamblin, apostle to the LamanitesIn the winter of 1860, Jacob Hamblin and others returned to northern Arizona to retrieve the body of George Albert Smith, Jr., who had been killed by the Navajos. The party had to fight snow and ice and were only able to find the skull and the larger bones which were returned for burial in Salt Lake City, Utah.Death was the constant companion of the early explorers and colonists. Northern Arizona was so remote from contact with the rest of the country, that everyone entering that expansive desert had to rely on whatever was at hand to survive. In the current world of instant communication it is virtually impossible to imagine the isolation of these early pioneers.In 1862 Jacob Hamblin was again called upon by Brigham Young to venture into the heart of the Colorado Plateau and visit the Hopi villages. President Young recommended  that this expedition cross the Colorado south of St. George in order to find an easier crossing of the river.Hambin, who lived in the town of Santa Clara had lost his grist mill and other improvements to a flood. Many other residents of Santa Clara had also had their homes destroyed and crops ruined by the flooding of the Santa Clara River. It is notable that floods in recent times have caused similar damage in the same areas along the Virgin River, of which the Santa Clara is a tributary. Leaving his home in shambles, Hamblin took twenty men and a small boat.The expedition crossed the Colorado at an unknown location, possibly near the mouth of the Grand Wash, presently near the Arizona/Nevada state line and under Lake Mead. The party struck out across the desert towards the San Francisco Peaks and finally reached the Hopi villages. If you are unfamiliar with this area, you should know that except for prominent mountains, the land is very flat and you can see for many, many miles. It is fairly easy to navigate because of the reference points of the high mountain peaks, such as the San Francisco Peaks, over 12,000 feet high. Those particular mountains can be seen for over 100 miles to the north looking south.The men returned to Utah after visiting the Hopis, returning by crossing the Colorado River at the Ute Crossing (Crossing of the Fathers) now deep under Lake Powell. The crossing was dangerous because of the cold and ice on the river. On the return trip, food became so scarce, the explorers were reduced to eating crows.To be continued.Source unless noted:McClintock, James H.

The 1859 company consisted of Marion J. Shelton, Thales Haskell, Taylor Crosby, Benjamin Knell, Ira Hatch and John William Young. As was the usual custom, the expedition left in the Fall after the farm crops had been harvested and reached the Hopi villages on November 6. The explorers used the \"Ute Ford\" also known as the Crossing of the Fathers.Unless you have experienced the combination of wind and cold on the Colorado Plateau, you can have no idea of the hardship these early explorers suffered. Temperatures can change more than 40 degrees in a 24 hour period. In the winter the temperatures fall well below freezing, but the wind blows nearly every day and the wind chill factor can fall into the single digits.Again in 1860 Jacob Hamblin was sent as a missionary to the Hopi villages. This 1860 expedition had George A. Smith, Jr., the son of an apostle of the Church, Thales Haskell, Jehiel McConnell, Ira Hatch, Isaac Riddle, Amos G. Thornton, Francis M. Hamblin, James Pearce and an Indian guide, Enos. The party tried to cross the Colorado at the Paria without success. After finally crossing the Colorado at the Crossing of the Fathers, the party was immediately attacked by Navajo Indians. Smith was shot by the Indians when he inadvisedly gave his revolver to an Indian to inspect it. The party continued on despite the threats of the Indians.As James H. McClintock narrates, \"The Indians readily admitted responsibility, stating that it was in reprisal for the killing of three Navajos by palefaces and they demanded two more victims before the Mormon company would be allowed to go in peace. The situation was a difficult one for Jacob, but he answered bravely, \"I would not give a cent to live after I had given up two men to be murdered; I would rather die like a man than live like a dog.\" Jacob went out by himself and had a little session of prayer and then the party started northward, flanked by hostile Navajos, but accompanied by four old friendly tribesmen. Smith was taken along on a mule, with McConnell behind to hold him on. Thus it was that he died about sundown. His last words, when told that a stop could not be made, were, \"Oh, well, go on then; but I wish I could die in peace.\" The body was wrapped in a blanket and laid in a hollow by the side of the trail, for no stop could be made even to bury the dead.About a week later, Santa Clara was reached by the worn and jaded party, sustained the last few days on a diet mainly of pinon nuts.\"Source unless noted:McClintock, James H.

{"title": "Coming to Arizona -- The Welsh Legend Expedition", "date": "Wednesday, May 13, 2009", "text": "Picture of Jacob Hamblin, Mormon Explorer.Before we get to the story of the first settlers, including Henry Martin Tanner and his new bride, we need to review how the country became known to the Utah Mormons as a place of possible settlement.The trail from Southern Utah to Arizona crossed some of the ruggedest and most inhospitable country in the entire continent. Water was always a problem and the relatively high altitude made winter travel extremely dangerous. During the early years, there were only two practical ways to cross the Colorado River, either at the western end of the Grand Canyon at Pearce's Ferry or at the famous Lee's Ferry, located between Glen Canyon and Marble Canyon at the mouth of the Paria River.One of the earliest attempts to find a pathway into the northern Arizona wilderness came in 1858, when President Brigham Young sent an expedition lead by Jacob Hamblin to investigate rumors that the Moqui (Hopi) Indians had a dialect that embraced many Welsh words. The expedition included Durias Davis, a Welshman, Ammon M. Tenney later a notable settler in Arizona, William Hamblin, Frederick Hambin, Thomas Leavitt, Samuel Knight, Ira Hatch, Andrew S. Gibbons, Benjamin Knell and a Piute guide, Naraguts. These early expeditions were conducted mainly during the winter months, causing the participants extreme hardships but necessary because of the need to maintain their farms during the warmer months.Incidentally, descendants of Andrew S. Gibbons intermarried with my family and I have several Gibbons relatives.Brigham Young had heard that hundreds of years before a group of Welsh explorers had settled in the area of northern Arizona. After a long and difficult trip into the Hopi/Moqui settlements, it was determined that the Hopi language had no Welsh words at all.  In future posts I will discuss the legends that Welshmen may have come to the Southwest, but that is another story for now.This early expedition was notable in that Hamblin and his party found two places to cross the Colorado, one was rediscovered at the location known as the Crossing of the Fathers. This crossing had been used by the Dominguez-Escalante expedition in 1776. The other potential crossing point was discovered at the mouth of the Paria River but was not used by the expedition. The explorers found the Hopi or Moqui villages just in time to keep from starving to death. They stayed for a time with the Indians and four of the expedition members, William Hamblin, Leavitt, Gibbons and Knell were left at the villages as missionaries. Those left behind returned that same winter.The Crossing of the Fathers was found to be impractical for most purposes and future expeditions concentrated their efforts at the mouth of the Paria or avoided the issue altogether by starting out across the Colorado south of the Grand Canyon.I have spent most of my life traveling around this area of northern Arizona. The general route followed by this original expedition and later ones roughly parallels Highway 389 (Arizona) and 59 (Utah). I am always amazed that these early explorers found a way to survive in this country.Continued...Source: (other than noted above)McClintock, James H.

{"title": "Coming to Arizona", "date": "Monday, May 11, 2009", "text": "At the suggestion of the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, a company was organized in 1851 to purchase a tract below the Cajon Pass in the State of California. Members of the company included Amasa M. Lyman, Chas. C. Rich and Collins R. Hakes, who was later the President of the Maricopa Stake in Mesa.  They purchased what was known as the Lugo Ranch, consisting of some nine square leagues, including an abandoned mission. The original purchase price was $77,500, but the price eventually climbed to $140,000. In today's money, taking into account the extreme inflation since 1851, the equivalent price of the $140,000 would be more than $3,580,000. However, the purchase price was a \"good deal\" considering the entire area was in the San Bernardino Valley.One of the settlers who came that year to San Bernardino was my Great-great-grandfather, Sidney Tanner. My Great-grandfather, Henry Martin Tanner, was born the next year in San Bernardino.  Many years later, I would serve in LDS Church with President Hakes' grandson, Clayton H. Hakes.Unfortunately, for California and fortunately for Arizona, the San Bernardino pioneers were forced to leave in 1857 and 1858, because of the invasion of Utah by Johnston's Army. The Tanners, along with many of their neighbors, moved back into Utah, settling in Beaver, Utah. Although the departure from California is often characterized as a retreat due to the invasion, many of the settlers left because of threats of violence from vigilantes in California.Next time we will follow Henry and his new bride, Eliza Ellen Parkinson, on the long and dry trail into Northern Arizona.Source material, in part:McClintock, James H.

{"title": "Shorts and the Salt River Valley", "date": "Wednesday, May 6, 2009", "text": "Located just south of the center of Arizona, the Salt River Valley is home to the huge Phoenix/Mesa Metroplex. It is called a valley because it is encircled by low to medium high mountain ranges. The city has grown so large that some of the outlying suburbs are actually out of the valley entirely and in different watersheds.I remember distinctly one of my first entries into the Salt River Valley. I was living in a small town in Eastern Arizona called St. Johns when my parents decided to move to the Valley. Although I had lived in Boston while my father was going to school, my only real memories were in and about St. Johns, high on the Colorado Plateau. I was only eight years old and just starting to discover the world. My grandparents lived in Salt Lake City, Utah and my mother was expecting a baby (who would turn out to be my first brother) but I didn't know that at the time, of course.We packed up and left for Utah. In those days, traveling to Utah was an adventure. So was living with my grandparents for many months. Finally, it came time to move to Phoenix. My father had purchased a house and moved everything down from St. Johns in our absence, so I had never seen the house. This was long before freeways, and we had to drive down Highway 89, we drove into the city on Grand Avenue and I remember seeing the State Fair Grounds at the time the Fair was in full swing.We arrived at our small house at 12th Street and Oak, on a street called Edgemere. This was a \"newer\" subdivision at the time, but today is in the very center of the oldest part of Phoenix.I quickly started at Whittier School, since it was well into the year. The first day of school, my mother, thinking we were now living in the big city, sent me to school in shorts. Now, children may wear shorts today to school, but in Phoenix in 1953, that was phenomena. I had to hide behind a door at recess to avoid being mobbed. Needless to say, that was the last time I ever wore anything other than Levi's to school for the rest of my life."},

We also ride mainly on side streets.We have ridden with a few of our compulsive addicted road bike friends and it is interesting to see them working away while you lay there on the ground looking up at them, hardly trying to pedal. I can get up to almost 30 mph on the flat for short sprints. I realize real bike riders can do much better than that, but I am old and gray and they are mostly young and athletic.We get a good view of the sunrise almost every morning and get to see a lot of birds and dogs. Some dogs just stare at us. Others consider that we must be food and almost pull over their owners trying to get at us.

{"title": "Stop the foreign invasion", "date": "Wednesday, April 29, 2009", "text": "No, this isn't a post about illegal aliens. Arizona has long been the site of a different kind of invasion, foreign plants. One of the most invasive species is the tamarisk. Native of Africa and Eurasia, these sturdy plants can spread both vegetatively, by adventitious roots or submerged stems, and sexually, by seeds. There are over fifty species of tamarisks with eight now found in the U.S. The Tamarix was introduced to the United States as an ornamental shrub, a windbreak, and a shade tree in the early 1800s. In the 1930s, during The Great Depression, tree-planting was used as a tool to fight soil erosion on the Great Plains, and the trees were planted by the millions.WikipediaAs the photo above illustrates, stands of this non-native plant have spread along most of the waterways in Arizona. Although there is some controversy over whether or not the tamarisks displace native species, it is my own observation that they grow so thickly along the rivers and streams that nothing else can live.  The USGS has a research program \"Changes in Riparian Vegetation in Arizona Repeat Photography at Gaging Stations.\" One set of photos, along the Virgin River at Littlefield, dramatically shows the effects of the tamarisk invasion. This first photo was taken in 1942:The second photo was taken in 2000 at exactly the same location:It is interesting to watch so-called western movies, many times the scenery and plant life in the movies will be anachronistic with the time period depicted, merely because of the presence of foreign plant invaders."},
{"title": "Watching baby ducks on the canal", "date": "Tuesday, April 28, 2009", "text": "Twice a week we walk about three miles, mostly along the canal bank. One of the benefits of walking the canals is watching the ducks that live on the canals all year around. Since this is Spring, the mother ducks are herding their little flocks of baby ducks. One mother duck had eight babies a week or so ago. This morning she only had five. I thought about whether or not the mother ducks grieve over the loss of their babies. We assume that the babies are lost to either cats or dogs that run loose along the canals. There is no brush or cover along a Salt River Valley Canal, the canal companies keep the banks of the canals entirely free of any plant life at all. The banks are barren desert wastelands.However, there are several places along the canals where the adjacent land owners have neglected their property and allowed the weeds and brush to grow in abundance. This is likely where the ducks can go to raise their families of baby birds. One thing that is pretty strange about the Mesa canals is that the banks are covered with bleached out shells. There are species of small bivalve mollusks that live in the canals and when the canals are dredged, the shells pile up on the banks. Walking along the canal bank is a study in contrasts, with the barren canal bank, the irrigated yards and the silent canal. A common fixture of the canals are abandoned shopping carts. It is amazing how may shopping carts find their way into the canals. Every year the canal companies dry up the canals for maintenance and in some spots there will be dozens of mud covered shopping carts rusting in the empty canal bottom. There are only bridges across the canals where the major roads cross. Otherwise, the canals act as boundary lines between neighborhoods and divide up the city into sections. We get so used to driving around the canals we hardly notice the breaks in the roads. One morning, on our walk, we noticed a large number of police and emergency vehicles at one of the bridges near our home. One of the locals had driven his or her car into the canal. This happens regularly in the Valley and sometimes ends in tragedy for the person in the car. When I was younger, the time the canals dried up was a golden opportunity to ride my bike along the canals and look for neat stuff that showed up when the water disappeared. In this age of videos and TV, I suppose the young people of today don't even notice the canals at all."},

Looking towards the sky we saw a huge \"V\" of birds and then another, and yet another. We stopped the car and could hear the exotic sound of these huge birds flying low over the desert, towards the south. We followed one flock for about half an hour, stopping along the road to watch them move steadily through the air like something out a prehistoric past. We were witnesses to a small part of the annual Sandhill Crane migration to the Willcox dry playa.It takes a readjustment in perception to realize that Arizona is a premier area for birding and all sorts of birding activities. Every year Willcox, Arizona has a huge birding festival called Wings over Willcox. You may wish to check out the Willcox Playa Wildlife Area Website. You may also want to view the Audubon Arizona Website.We live a few minutes from a spectacular birding site, the Gilbert Riparian Institute. The Riparian Preserve at Water Ranch, located in Gilbert, Arizona has an extensive bird list with 219 species. We can see a lot of those birds in the trees and along the canals near our house.

The Arizona Bird Committee has listed hundreds of species of birds. While riding bikes around the city in the early morning we see dozens of bird species. This morning we saw a large, chicken-sized bird that looked like a huge fat quail. After combing the bird lists and looking at pictures, we decided that it was a chukar or Alectoris Chukar or possibly a rock partridge Alectoris graeca. The chukar is a bird from Central Asia that was imported into the U.S. as a potential game bird. It is supposed to be known in Arizona only in isolated populations in the northern part of the state, but there are reports of sitings in the Phoenix area. It is certainly not a quail.This is just one of the very unusual birds we frequently encounter in the Mesa, Arizona area.  It is not unusual for us to see peacocks roaming wild in both Phoenix and Mesa. When I was younger, peacocks used to fly into our yard and wake me up in the morning with their very loud cries. We commonly see cardinals, humming birds and a wide variety of other bird species in our backyard or along the canals.  Mesa is also home to a sizable duck and goose population. They live in canals and can visit home swimming pools on occasion. From time to time I plan to write about our interactions with Arizona's bird population."},
{"title": "Over 100 degrees in April?", "date": "Tuesday, April 21, 2009", "text": "When I was growing up, I remember that we could always count on temperatures over 90 degrees by Easter. This year was no exception, but the temperature has been going up and down and just over a week ago we were out when it was 45 degrees. However, as the statistics and experience show, cool temperatures won't last long in the desert. Today is the day the temperature goes over 100 degrees. As I drove to work I saw the temperature rise 3 degrees in the ten minutes it takes me to get to my office.Having the day come this early, makes us think that 110 degree temperatures can't be that far off. I don't want to make it seem that I am fixated on the weather, mostly, because of central air conditioning and car air conditioners, we ignore the outside totally, but some places have groundhogs, we have thermometers.There isn't really a lot of difference in the livability outside when the temperature is below 110 degrees. I can tell, every time, when the temperature goes above 110, because the air feels hot. If you are driving around and roll down the window, 110 degrees actually heats up your arm and feels hot. Below 11o, the air feels cooler when it is blowing by. You can also tell the hot temperature by looking around the streets. They are empty. No one is outside. No children playing, no dogs running around, no people walking down the street. Except for the cars (and there are a lot of cars) it looks like a old time Apocalypse movie.Quite a few things happen when the temperature goes over 110, the asphalt melts, the sidewalks literally become hot enough to cook and egg, the air turns into a semi-translucent haze of dust and heat waves and the Malls fill up with people.The weather forecasters are really funny, they keep predicting that the temperature will go down. They also issue heat advisories to tell us that it is hot and the polution is high also. Duh.Everyone is driving in a car that is why the heat and the polution go together.

{"title": "Bushnell Tanks -- traditional Phoenix camp spot", "date": "Friday, April 17, 2009", "text": "Bushnell Tanks is the name used for an area along Sycamore Creek, near Sunflower, Arizona. Access to the area has been from dirt roads off off of Highway 87, commonly known as the Beeline Highway. I have camped in this area off and on since I was a 12 year old Boy Scout. The area just off the road has been extremely impacted by off road vehicles and despite the heroic efforts of the Tonto National Forest, the area is usually fairly trashed. A few years ago, the Beeline was improved from a twisty two to four lane highway into a four lane divided freeway-like highway along its entire length to Payson, Arizona, as a result, access to the area became somewhat limited and the whole area has been closed by the Forest Service for some time. The last time I drove by, (just this week) the gate was still closed.Bushnell is roughly a half hour or so from the edge of Mesa. At the point where the Sycamore Creek crosses the highway, there is a sizable grove of old growth sycamore trees. The creek runs during the Spring and into the Summer, but there are springs in the area and during the late summer it is still possible to find some water. The attraction of accessibility, shade and water make the area irresistible. It is not unusual to have hundreds of people camped over a weekend.Like all intermittent streams in Arizona, if there is enough rain Sycamore Creek can become a deadly raging torrent. Some years ago a group of Boy Scouts camped at Bushnell stalled in a car in the middle of the creek during a flash flood and some of the Scouts were killed. The surrounding hills have also been the site of several brush fires in the last few years, almost completely changing the aspect of the area from when I was very young. Statements made by the Forest Service personnel seem to indicate that the fire damage is the cause of the closure.The area is especially attractive in early Fall when the leaves turn and the colors are gorgeous. With the closure of Bushnell, there are hardly any areas left, near the Salt River Valley, where there is access to water and where a group can camp."},
{"title": "Saguaro -- an engineering marvel", "date": "Sunday, April 12, 2009", "text": "This is a cross section (sort of dried out) of a saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea). The cut off pieces in a ring around the center of the plant stem are actually long very strong poles that run all the way up through the cactus stem called saguaro ribs. Here is a photo of a mature saguaro:This particular plant has an abnormal arm growth called fasciation or cresting, which may be caused by a bacterial infection, or mite or insect attack on the plant tissue.The saguaro blossom is the state flower of Arizona. The flowers provide food for a variety of flying animals and insects, including bats and the Whitewing Dove. The construction of the stem with pleats, allows for expansion and contraction depending on the water supply. The roots system spreads out from the plant in a circle, extending out approximately to the height of the plant. During periods of increased rainfall, the plant will adsorb as much water as possible, enabling it to survive long periods of drought. Adult saguaros may weigh as much as 12,000 pounds.The ripe fruit is edible and tastes quite good. The plant's ribs and fruit have been used for centuries by the native Americans of the Southwest. Although it is the tallest cactus native to the U.S., there are cactus in Mexico, the Cardon (Pachycereus pringlei ), which grow much taller.Since I grew up in the Phoenix area, I always remember seeing saguaro cactus. I used to amuse me to see tourists stop their cars and stand next to a saguaro to get their pictures taken.  I have grown a saguaro from a small seedling only about three inches high for many years. The plant is now about four feet high and will take another fifty years to grow arms. I do not plan on outliving the saguaro.As cactus go, they are extremely visible but not very dangerous. The spines are really tough and could conceivably make quite a hole in your skin, but you would have to be sleep walking to run into one. I do not recall ever hearing about anyone who got stuck with a saguaro spine."},
{"title": "Arizona's unnatural lakes and rivers", "date": "Thursday, April 9, 2009", "text": "The area of mountains and desert enclosed by the present political boundary of the State of Arizona has almost no natural lakes. The only lakes that existed historically as natural occurring bodies include Mormon Lake which is intermittently completely dry, Stoneman Lake and maybe a few more. It is very difficult to determine which of the lakes really existed before stockmen and ranchers began making catchment basins and other small ponds. Most lakes have an obvious dam and are and were not naturally occurring. In reality, many of the so-called lakes are really tiny ponds only a few dozen feet across. At least one guide lists 81 lakes. Another list has about 127 lakes but includes many metropolitan Phoenix urban lakes.  Some of the lakes, like Montezma Well, a part of Montezuma Castle National Monument is a limestone sink hole with a spring fed pond. Other's like Jacob Lake, on the Kaibab Plateau, are little more than over sized puddles. It is definitely a myth that Arizona has more boats per capita than any other state, but it is interesting to drive through the desert and see trucks and cars pulling boats on trailers. Growing up in Phoenix, I spent a considerable time water skiing on the Salt River Lakes north and east of the Salt Rive Valley. The four large lakes starting from the one closest to Phoenix are Saguaro Lake, Canyon Lake, Apache Lake and Roosevelt Lake. They are all reservoirs with very large dams. I have also spent time kayaking on all four. Sitting in a kayak is a very relaxing way to watch the beautiful Sonora Desert and observe the wildlife including desert mountain sheep, wild horses, eagles, egrets and a huge variety of water and shore birds.Living in the desert most of my life has given an active appreciation for water in all its forms and all of its natural manifestations. Even if the water behind the dams is sometime brown and silt filled, it is still cool and wet and a great relief from the heat of the sun."},
{"title": "A Major Myth of Desert Survival", "date": "Tuesday, April 7, 2009", "text": "In reading a book on desert survival recently, I ran across one of the perennial myths of the desert, that you can chop open a barrel cactus (or equivalent) and get enough liquid to stay alive. Before getting into a discussion about the merits of this method of survival, there are a few things you need to know, first of all, being out in the desert without a lot of water available is a very bad idea. There are lots of kinds of deserts and only a few of the real deserts have barrel cactus. So this method of getting water is limited to only those desert, like the Arizona-Sonora Desert, that have barrel cactus and also limited to those areas in the desert where the cactus grow. There is probably some way to get lost or stranded out in a desert with exactly the right combination of altitude, rainfall and soil composition to grow cactus but the possibility is extremely remote.In addition, most of the barrel cactus are protected species. Although I concede that you might not worry so much about this if you really needed the water, you might think about it when you got the fine from the U.S. Forest Service Ranger. You might want to check with the USDA to find out what species are protected. Also, young saguaros look an awful lot like a barrel cactus, if you are so naive as to get lost or stranded in the desert without water, you probably can't tell the difference between an echinocactus or a ferocactus (barrel) and a carnegiea gigantea (saguaro), but the saguaros are really protected and are nearly impossible to cut open to get any water.Now, about the water in the cactus. Yes, there is water in some of the barrel cactus and yes, it could keep you alive for a while, assuming you didn't have a reaction to the slimy alkaline juice that will likely cause diarrhea. In my pre-civilized days, I tried the inside of a barrel cactus and would not recommend it to anyone for any purpose. In those days, even though we lived in the city, we could ride our bikes out to the desert in a few minutes, since the desert was only a mile or so away. Now, the subdivisions and shopping centers go on for miles and miles past the areas we had completely to ourselves in the lovely Sonoran Desert."},
{"title": "But its a dry heat and other myths", "date": "Saturday, April 4, 2009", "text": "It is commonly stated that Phoenix is the hottest large city on the planet. Or maybe it is the largest hot city on the planet. Those two things seem to go together in the commentary. Size and heat. OK, how hot is it? If you look at the yearly average temperature of U.S. cities in degrees Fahrenheit, you get places like Albany, New York with an average temperature of 47.4 degrees. Flagstaff, Arizona, right up the road a ways, has an average temperature of 45.8 degrees. At 72.6, Phoenix is way up there, along with Yuma, Arizona at 74.2 degrees. West Palm Beach, Florida tops out at 74.7 degrees and Honolulu, Hawaii is top at 77.2 degrees, along with Key West, Florida at 77.8. There are a few other cities in that range.Here is the issue, Key West, West Palm Beach and Honolulu are all about the same temperature all year. So their average is about what the temperature is right now (or whenever). Phoenix is an entirely different story. The average temperature in Phoenix in July is 93.5 degrees (that means day and night). The average temperature in Key West in July is 84.4 degrees.Phoenix consistently ranks the hottest of the 40 largest cities in the U.S. Phoenix has a record high temperature of 122 degrees and reaches 90 degrees on the average 169 days each year. Just to be informative, the lowest temperature ever recorded in Phoenix is 17 degrees.The folk lore about Phoenix, undoubtedly made up by the Chamber of Commerce, is that it is a dry heat. Let's get this straight, if it is 115 degrees in the shade, who cares if it is a dry heat? You die either way.

{"title": "Citrus in Arizona", "date": "Thursday, April 2, 2009", "text": "Southern Arizona has about a perfect climate for citrus. Most people have probably had oranges and many people eat grapefruit, but there are dozens of varieties of citrus fruit and even people in Phoenix are often unfamiliar with some of the different types. We have been growing citrus for over thirty years. Our trees included white and pink grapefruit, navel oranges, Arizona Sweet oranges, tangelos, tangerines (also called mandarins) limes and lemons. Each of those general categories have numerous varieties. I also happen to like kumquats, but no one else does so we don't have a tree.We usually purchase our trees for planting in 5 gallon containers when they are about three to five years old. From the time they are planted until they start giving fruit is usually about two more years. Most citrus trees will live and bear fruit for over a hundred years if properly maintained. We presently have five full grown grapefruit trees. Four of those trees had over 700 pounds of fruit when it was picked and donated to the local food bank.Citrus trees are susceptible to a number of diseases, including Texas Root Rot. However, most of the varieties they sell in Arizona are grafted onto rot resistant root stock to avoid the problem. Citrus trees bloom in the early Spring, which means January and February in Phoenix. They set fruit and the fruit matures during the year, ripening in late November and December. Unless the trees are picked, they will have blossoms and fruit ready to pick at the same time.If the trees are not picked, the fruit will start to fall off by the end of January or so. Tangelos are the first to go, then oranges and grapefruit. Lemons and grapefruit can stay on the tree into March and even April, but beyond April the fruit will start to dry out in the heat. Sometimes a few grapefruit will summer-over and still be edible in the Fall.When I was young, our Scouts used to make money for camps by picking grapefruit and selling it to the citrus suppliers. We would have metal rings and the fruit had to fit in the ring to be salable. It was sweaty and dirty work since the trees are covered with dust. The branches are also stickery. We always seemed to have a ready supply of citrus all winter and so we would also have citrus fights. It is not fun to get hit in side of the head with a grapefruit. Especially, if you don't know it is coming. We would also roll the citrus out into the street just as cars went by to see if we could get the cars to run over the fruit.I guess it never occurred to us that children were starving in where ever while we threw edible fruit at each other."},

For comparison, lightning killed 17 people in Arizona from 1990 to 2003, so you are in slightly more danger dying from lightning than from snake bite.But to get a handle on reality, in 2007 alone, Arizona had 1,066 traffic fatalities.

Then I noticed another, within a few seconds I had spotted about twenty rattlesnakes coiled in early morning coolness, in a complete circle around the camp.Before and since I have seen hundreds of rattlesnakes. My first one was just under the top of the Mogollon Rim above Boy Scout Camp Geronimo when I was about 13 years old. The last one I saw was next to the Salt River at Coons Bluff. Like the old saying goes, if you don't bother them, they won't bother you. The best defense against snake bite is vigilance, look where you step and look where you reach."},
{"title": "The empty streets", "date": "Thursday, March 26, 2009", "text": "When we were children in Phoenix, in the pre-home refrigeration days, dusk was the signal to run outside and play. We would run around with all of the neighborhood children and play the usual games. When I purchased a new home in Mesa, I wanted to duplicate that same neighborhood experience. Happily, we moved into a neighborhood with lots of children and my own children had the same experience of growing up in Mesa with a neighborhood.One of my best memories happened late one night when there was a huge thunderstorm. The street in front of our house filled with water two or three feet deep. The houses up and down the street emptied of children, all of whom were dancing in the rain and water. It was a glorious night for children.All of that is now past. In our new neighborhood, the streets are empty, even in the cooler evening hours. The children we see are constantly supervised by parents and not allowed out of their driveway. If they are riding a bike or scooter, they are heavily padded with helmets, elbow and knee protectors. In one instance, a few children rode their bikes around our neighbor's circular driveway, which was open to the street. The neighbor stormed out of his house and loudly complained to the children's parents and ordered them to keep off his paved driveway.  Children are no longer allowed to be human, they are kept like nicknack's and wrapped in bubble wrap. The streets are now mostly empty.One day I saw some children playing in the park next to our house. However, immediately, their father was out on the sidewalk yelling at them to get home. We have lived next to a park for over thirty years. The old one was always full of children, the new one is entirely empty, it seems to be a park for dogs only.I know there may still be some places left in this world where children can play, unsupervised, for an hour or two outside. Where they can build mud villages and dig ditches in the dirt. Where they can run and play like children and enjoy being outside. When I see the poor little creatures sitting in front of the video or TV my heart cries out, go outside! See the sun, the moon and the stars. Look at the trees. Find bugs. Dig holes, make a mess, do things children have always done until now."},
{"title": "Wind", "date": "Tuesday, March 24, 2009", "text": "Standing out on the Colorado Plateau, looking across miles of almost flat rocks and sand, you can really begin to appreciate the force of the wind. Stories passed down from my ancestors who pioneered this almost lifeless landscape, tell about people going crazy from the wind. Literally losing their minds from the constant blowing. Statistics don't do the wind justice. The Plateau doesn't have monopoly on the wind, of course, there are lots of places in on the plains where the wind blows just as much, but the combination of high altitude and dry air make for some really spectacular wind storms.One day we drove up on the Plateau and got out of our car, I thought I might have gone deaf or perhaps was suffering from some sort of hallucination, there wasn't any wind. No such luck, ten minutes later it started blowing so hard, we couldn't open the car doors without bracing ourselves against the blast.Since there are no trees to speak of, at least by normal tree standards, (there are Juniper bushes that most people call trees but they aren't usually more than about twenty feet high at most) there is nothing to stop the wind once it gets moving. In the Spring and Fall when the huge cold fronts start coming down from the Northwest, the wind really take off and blows, sometimes over 100 mph, which most places would be hurricane force, but up there is just another Spring breeze.Even today, after living in the low desert most of my life, on a quiet evening, I can still hear the wind blowing in my ears."},
{"title": "Death through dehydration", "date": "Monday, March 23, 2009", "text": "I haven't had a post about dying in the desert lately.  But it is now getting over 90 degrees in Phoenix and it is that time of year again. The University of Maryland Medical Center has first aid site that gives a good explanation of both heat stroke and dehydration. But there is one problem, Maryland isn't much like Arizona and especially the low deserts (which includes the bottom of the Grand Canyon).To quote MedicineNet. com: \"The cause of heat stroke is simple: being too hot for too long. If sweating isn't enough to cool you down, your body temperature rises rapidly, up to 106 degrees in as little as ten or 15 minutes. That's hot enough to literally cook your brain. You pass out, and if you're not treated immediately, you will suffer brain damage or die.\"One of the symptoms of both dehydration and heat stroke is the inability to think properly. Many people start taking off clothes when overly hot thereby exposing more of their skin to the sun. In Phoenix, you can die of heat stroke working in your front yard, you don't have to be out in the desert. In a real sense, all of the Salt River Valley is out in the desert. Some statistics indicate that up to 50% of the people with heat stroke die of the condition.I have been very dehydrated, one day hiking in overly warm weather, actually in November, I lost six pounds of water in an afternoon. Fortunately, none of those in our hiking group got heat stroke. But it was a real possibility."},

{"title": "Scorpion Wars, Episode 395", "date": "Sunday, March 15, 2009", "text": "In our last episode of the Scorpion Wars, our noble heroes had battled their nemesis, the scorpion horde to a standstill, cold winter weather (relatively cold winter weather) had temporarily created a false sense of security in our noble heroes. They had become lax in manning the bastions of their defense and now.... on with our story.When I was child growing up in the mostly desert Salt River Valley, we had every imaginable bug except scorpions. One of those things the Chamber of Commerce would like you to ignore, Phoenix is a very, very buggy place. Exterminators do a lively business and most residents have their homes sprayed regularly. The most common offenders are ants, crickets, cockroaches and silver fish. With a sprinkling of more exotic species and varieties thrown in, like earwigs, black widow spiders, brown recluse spiders and even more interesting crawly things. I had not seen a scorpion until one day, while turning over rocks in the desert, there was a scorpion, hiding down in the dirt.Now let me say, I do not like scorpions. I do not like bugs very much at all, especially at night and especially when they land on you suddenly. One day, while living up on the Colorado Plateau, we had a \"Child of the Earth\" land on our screen door, which freaked us all out, anyway, to get back to scorpions, we now have scorpions. They are a fact of life. We have probably killed hundreds in the past three years alone, all of them in our house or on our lot. Scorpions do not respond to poison. They can live without air, they can live without water, they are closest thing to eternal that exists on the earth. We use glue boards to trap them and a vacuum to get the ones we see. The vacuum has the air go through an impeller, which is highly impractical for cleaning but good for bugs.It is now the time of year to start to see them again. We will start the annual battle of the ultra-violet light (scorpions fluoresce in black light) and we will once again watch for their straw to brown colored bodies on our walls, ceilings, carpets, anyplace. The worst is finding some scorpion carrying all of the little babies on its back, yuk."},
{"title": "Driving around in the Phoenix/Mesa Metroplex", "date": "Friday, March 13, 2009", "text": "In case you didn't know the area around the Salt River Valley is now called the Phoenix/Mesa Metroplex. Not to denigrate any of the other communities, but Mesa's population is now over 445,000 people. The Phoenix population is over 1.5 million and growing at almost 15% a year. Phoenix passed Philadelphia as the fifth largest city in the U.S. Now that you are suitably impressed with the size of this huge city, you can start imagining driving around in 115 degree heat.First the positive, Phoenix has a really good freeway system compared to someplace like Philadelphia, but it is about the same as that in San Diego. Drivers tend to drive much faster that the allowable speed limit, like up to 80 mph in a 65 mph zone. But the drivers are much more predictable than they are in a city like Salt Lake City, Utah. Plus, there is no snow and almost no rain making the streets clear almost all of the time. Another advantage is that most, not all, of the major streets are straight and a few go all the way across the city, I mean like about 50 miles. So if you are familiar with McDowell Road in Phoenix, you will find the same east/west street in Apache Junction and the same street in the far west valley except where blocked by freeways and mountains, canals or whatever.We do have some really interesting things to contend with, for example, four wheel drive trucks that look like they are going to compete in a monster truck competition. I drive a Prius and I can look under (and might be able to drive under) some of the trucks.I have found that driving in Phoenix is the same in all directions, the streets all look the same, the signs all look the same, the shopping centers all look the same, it is Alzheimer's patient's nightmare. If you were driving in Glendale and were suddenly beamed to Chandler, you might not notice.The city is filling up with photo radar speed traps. That is a recent innovation. I was behind one crash that occurred when someone spotted the photo radar on the freeway and jammed on the brakes. People love to run red lights in Phoenix but not so much as other cities. The so-called downtown section of Phoenix has been a maize for years, they are always reconstruction some or all of the streets and you can never predict how you will have to go to get into the downtown area. Fortunately, though, unless you work in downtown Phoenix or attend sports games, you have absolutely no reason to go down there. I find many people in Mesa who haven't ever seen downtown Phoenix in their entire lives. I also find that people in Phoenix in a lot of cases have never been outside of Phoenix, they don't know that the Salt River has water in some places or that there are huge lakes, mountains and green trees.We do see a lot of major accidents. Like the one this week where a small car smashed into a palm tree in the median of Main Street in Mesa. We could not figure out how the car got onto the median to hit the tree, the curb is almost a foot high."},
{"title": "The Dream of Thunder River", "date": "Tuesday, March 10, 2009", "text": "Many years ago as a young child, I read of a fantastic adventure traveling to the depths of the Grand Canyon to see a fabulous waterfall coming right out of a cave in the side of the cliff. This place of fantasy had the dramatic name of Thunder River. I read and re-read the account of the trip to this fabled place. Years past, but the dream of the waterfall was kept fresh in my mind. Sometimes I would start to think that maybe I had dreamed about the waterfall and the cave. Maybe it didn't really exist. One day, I decided to go and see for myself if this place of dreams really lived on the side of a cliff deep in the Grand Canyon. I recruited some friends and took my oldest son, then only eight years old, and we set off for Thunder River. Of course, the reality was hardly dream-like, we had to obtain camping permits from the National Park, find the trail head, walk miles and miles through the Canyon, but finally, there it was the fabled place. Unfortunately, we chose to hike in August. The heat was brutal, 95 degrees at 6:00 am in the morning. We ended up spending the day sitting next to the waterfall and then walking out of the Canyon after dark.It is not a trip for the unprepared. We found two groups of people lost in the Canyon. It is dangerous place and really far from any support system. I think about the trip often. It was one of those things, when you get my age, that you don't think seriously about doing again."},

This year the weather keeps getting warm and then cool again. Of course, cool here is relative. We think that 80 degrees is a cool day. This tree is growing right across the street from the Temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. One of the major events in our desert is the blooming of the cactus flowers. We will be going to the Desert Botanical Gardens soon, because the cactus start to bloom in March. Here is a cactus flower picture from past years:Because of the mostly dry climate in Arizona and surrounding states, drawings and carvings from the ancient inhabitants have been preserved in abundance. From the above paintings in Canyon de Chelly, to the petroglyphs in Phoenix's South Mountain Park, there are lots of interesting sites throughout the state.In almost every description of petroglyphs, they are described as \"mysterious.\" Archaeologists spend thousands of pages analyzing them and trying to decipher some meaning.Most of the rock art is subtle and unless you are aware of the location, might be missed. Occasionally, there is a huge collection, such as Newspaper Rock, in the Petrified Forest National Park, but even the larger collections, such as Three Rivers Petroglyph Site in New Mexico, have many glyphs that are small and unnoticeable.The only real mystery about rock art is why the scientists think there is some kind of mystery. Graffiti has been a common human experience forever. If you spray paint a wall it is graffiti, if some ancient Indian scratched his name into a rock, it is rock art. There are a lot of good reasons to study ancient artifacts and ancient rock art. Mystery is not one of them.The Phoenix area is a good place to visit and see an amazing array of rock art. You might try South Mountain Park, San Tan Mountain Regional Park, and Estrella Mountain Regional Park for a start.Thanks to Flickr for the South Mountain Park photo."},
{"title": "The Usery Mountain Wind Cave", "date": "Tuesday, March 3, 2009", "text": "There are 29 miles of trails through the desert in the Usery Mountain Regional Park. The Wind Cave trail winds up onto the side of the mountains and ends at a huge hollow in the rock face. The band of light colored rock, where the cave is located, is visible from most of the eastern part of the Salt River Valley, although after years of living in Mesa, the view becomes almost invisible. The trail is suitable for younger children, but becomes a little steep and unless they are used to hiking, they will probably asked to be carried some of the way. This is one of the first hikes my children probably remember.The entrance road to the Park continues over Usery Pass and then down into the Salt River valley and joins up with the Bush Highway. The circuit from Power Road in Mesa, over the hill to the Bush Highway and then along the Salt River to Usery Mountain Road and back over the Pass is a favorite with bike riders. The road can be dangerous due to its proximity to Saguaro Lake and huge amount of traffic generated on weekends and holidays.Thanks to Flickr for the photo."},
{"title": "Seven Springs", "date": "Monday, March 2, 2009", "text": "Water creates the greatest contrasts in Arizona, either present or not present. Anyplace there is water year round becomes a mecca for water-starved desert dwellers. Seven Springs, originally a Civilian Conservation Corps camp, is located in the Tonto National Forest. Yes, Arizona has rivers without water and forests without trees. To be fair, there are a lot of trees in the Tonto National Forest, at least in parts. My trips to Seven Springs started as a young Boy Scout camping in the wilds at the end of a long dirt road. There were very few facilities and almost no traffic.In contrast, on a warm day in Phoenix, Seven Springs located 15 1/2 miles north of Carefree, can look like an outdoor mall in the holiday season, with a constant stream of traffic both directions on the still dirt road. There is a short perennial creek with a picnic site consisting of a few tables. There is also a pack-it-in/pack-it-out campground consisting of four tent sites. You may wish to check with the Tonto National Forest before trying to camp there as the reports indicate there is no camping from time to time.As with many sites in the Tonto National Forest, it now has a daily fee. Recently, the campsites and tables have all been full every time we have visited, but on an off day, it would be a lovely place for a hike, suitable for toddlers if watched carefully up to challenging and long desert trails. The trails in the area link with Cave Creek and you can hike well over 20 miles if you care to do soWe used to find geodes in the area, but the geode beds appear to be long picked over."},
{"title": "Roosevelt Lake Full", "date": "Sunday, March 1, 2009", "text": "Roosevelt Lake, the Salt River's largest reservoir, is at the flood limit and water releases are starting through the valley. Arizona is one of the few places that has rivers with no water. The Salt River, which supposedly runs through the valley, is almost always a dry, sandy, rocky and empty river bed. However, in years when there is sufficient run-off from mountain streams, the river runs through the valley. This event is generally called a \"flood.\" When the river is running like any normal river, it is a flood. When it is dry, it is a river. It is a major event every time the river runs, because in their infinite wisdom, the city, state and county governments build their roads in the \"dry\" river bed. So, every time the river \"floods\" the roads are under water and generally destroyed. The governments also build \"bridges\" which sometimes begin and end in the middle of the \"flood.\" So the roads and bridges are closed to traffic. Before they built all the bridges, that used to mean that there were only one or two ways to cross the river, on the \"real\" bridges that had been built when the river was a real river. But now, unless there is a big flood, most of the bridges work and people can drive from Mesa to Phoenix without waiting for three or four hours to cross a bridge. Now that we have the ground rules out of way, we read the story about Roosevelt being full, and drove to the lake, about a four hour drive if you return by way of the Apache Trail, a 15 mph dirt road. Anyway, the lake was full. Of course, the pictures are really bad and all they show is a lake with a lot of water, but that is the point, the lake doesn't usually have a lot of water. Maybe I could find a few early photos to show the change. If so, I will post them. I will also tell about the Apache Trail. The bridge in the photos is across the lake at the dam. It is the longest single arch steel bridge in the United States. Roosevelt Dam was rebuilt and raised in the past few years. If it had not been raised, the water in the lake would now be pouring over the spillway and running through the valley in a real flood, as opposed to the fake floods when the river is running normally for a river.Here are some quotes from the news:Roosevelt Lake, which had risen steadily since a series of storms in January and early February, crept closer to the flood-control limit as water gushed in from the Salt River and Tonto Creek. The three downstream reservoirs - Apache, Canyon and Saguaro lakes - were already full. Shortly before 4 p.m. Friday, Roosevelt hit the legal top, an elevation of 2,151 feet above sea level. At that point, SRP switched its operations to comply with rules written by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that oversees flood-control regulations. The utility increased the water flowing past Roosevelt Dam to 1,900 cubic feet per second, about 853,000 gallons per minute. During typical dam operations, the amount of water released from Roosevelt is much lower and fluctuates depending on the need for water in the Valley. SRP will continue to release water at the required rate until water levels at the reservoir stabilize below the flood-control limit.We were out walking and noticed the canals were full to the edge of the concrete, now we know why. They are running water into the canals rather than send it down the river."},
{"title": "The Gila Box Canyon", "date": "Friday, February 27, 2009", "text": "Although relatively close to a major highway and accessible by passenger car at most times of the year at the mouth of the canyon, the Gila Box Canyon is still an interesting place to see and be seen. The canyon is only about twenty feet wide at its most narrow point, and is hundreds of feet deep. The canyon floor is alternatively sandy and rocky. This small canyon, just south of the Superstition Mountains, is not to be confused with the Gila Box Riparian National Conservation Area in eastern Arizona.My first outing to the canyon was on a Scout trip when I was about 14 years old. We camped by a windmill above the canyon on a dirt road that started on the Highway south of Florence Junction. The canyon seemed like a spooky place with rocky cliffs crowned with hoodos. Our Troop had an old yellow school bus for transportation and my Scoutmaster drove the bus down through the canyon, when the canyon walls were only a few inches from the bus in many places.In later years, I discovered that the most accessible road turned off of Highway 79 just north of the bridge over the Gila River to the east. The road, which follows an old rail line, is scenic but can be too rough or muddy for anything but a high clearance vehicle during part of the year  and can be impassible if the Gila River is running. The road ends at a place marked as Price on the map with a parking area at the mouth of the canyon.Do not hike this canyon if you are looking for solitude. It is a busy place, on most days in the cool months, dozens of four-wheel drive vehicle traverse the canyon. Since my trip down the canyon in a school bus, the canyon had eroded considerably and is now a challenge for the local off road vehicles. It is very interesting to sit on the side lines and watch the various vehicles try to negotiate the rocky canyon floor. By most standards, the rocks are not considered much of a challenge but the variety of vehicles makes for an interesting afternoon to watch the show."},
{"title": "Arizona is hot, I mean really hot", "date": "Sunday, February 22, 2009", "text": "On June 26, 1990 during the hottest part of the day, we all went outside to stand in the sun to see what 122 degrees F. (50 degrees C.) felt like. This was the record hot temperature for Phoenix, Arizona, although most of us believe that the temperature actually gets hotter because they changed the method of measuring the temperature. Some of us believe that the change in method was done to avoid discouraging tourists. To quote Wikipedia:Phoenix has an arid climate, with very hot summers and temperate winters. The average summer high temperature is among the hottest of any populated area in the United States and approaches those of cities such as Riyadh and Baghdad. The temperature reaches or exceeds 100°F (38°C) on an average of 110 days during the year, including most days from early June through early September, and highs top 110 °F (43 °C) an average of 18 days during the year.Phoenix is the largest of many cities in and around the Salt River Valley also known, appropriately, as the Valley of the Sun. Having lived here most of my life, I was a senior in high school before we ever had air conditioning other than an evaporative cooler or swamp cooler as it was and is known. We used to go barefoot all over town. We would stand on the grass at the edge of the streets, get up our courage, and then run across the hot asphalt. We would then stand on another patch of grass until our feet stopped hurting from the heat. I guess it never occurred to us to wear shoes, that would have been too easy.Phoenix is getting larger every year. It is now the fifth largest city in the United States and would probably shrink back to oblivion if the air conditioning ever stopped running. One of the running jokes in Phoenix is that it is a dry heat. Most of the country has a lot of humidity and 110 degrees would kill off the population. Anyone who thinks Phoenix is dry hasn't been here. One of the most common methods of watering plants is flood irrigation. What that means is that the underground pipes spill thousands of gallons of water into huge basins constructed around grassy areas. Your whole neighborhood can resemble a swamp. The desert around Phoenix may be dry, but with the canals and flood irrigation, it is not comfortable at any time the temperature goes above 115 degrees.People come here for the jobs and the climate. Nine months of the year it is great and the whole summer is great, especially if you have access to a swimming pool and a lot of cold water. It is still almost impossible for me to pass a drinking fountain without getting a drink. That was a survival tactic when I was young and it is a hard habit to break."},

These old signs have lately become an icon of the fifties and earlier. Mesa, Arizona still has one of these old signs, prominently displayed on East Main Street. It is the famous diving lady sign. There are actually three of the ladies, each of which light up in succession giving the appearance that she is diving into a swimming pool.We have to drive by this sign almost every day of our lives. She is supposed to be diving into a pool of blue water. Right now, the water is not working, so we wonder if she is diving into the sidewalk or the grass or whatever. The irony of the sign is that this particular motel, no longer has a swimming pool, so the diving lady is obviously a fraud as well as not particularly smart to be diving into the sidewalk. It is always something we notice when sometimes the diving lady is missing or there are only two of her.Mesa has recently gone to these huge full color monitor displays. But the problem is that when you are driving down the street it is like trying to watch TV and not nearly as cool as the diving lady. (Thanks to who ever put the picture on Flickr)"},
{"title": "Arizona is cold, I mean really cold", "date": "Monday, February 16, 2009", "text": "The iconic view of Arizona is a desert with saguaro cactus. In reality only a small portion of the state conforms with the obligatory cactus. Much of the state is high deserts or mountains. North and west of the low deserts, the land rises abruptly along the Mogollon Rim and you enter the world of the Colorado Plateau. The average height of the Plateau is over 5000 feet above sea level and there are mountains going much higher.You may not associate Arizona with cold weather, but in the White Mountains of eastern Arizona, Hawley Lake had a reading of -40 degrees F. (-40 degrees C.) on January 7, 1971. While this low temperature does not compare with other really cold locations, it would certainly come as a shock to someone expecting to wear shorts and a T-shirt. Even with this extreme temperature, it is not unusual for young people raised in Phoenix, just a few hours away, to have never seen snow.One of the highlights of the Mesa Days Celebration used to be a huge pile of snow trucked in from the mountains. Families with smaller children would stand in lines just for the chance to stand on some snow and try and make a snowball. This contrast with the cold weather of the mountains and Plateau is really commentary on how little local people travel around the state, particularly in the winter.One time while staying on the Plateau, the temperature was a balmy -17 degrees F. below zero and I attempted to open my Suburban which had become covered with ice. I finally got the rear door open to load our gear, but when I closed the door, due to the cold temperature, the rear window shattered. We fixed the problem, temporarily, by taping some clear plastic over the window with duct tape. It can get cold in Arizona."},
{"title": "The mysterious disappearance of the ancient inhabitants of Arizona", "date": "Tuesday, February 10, 2009", "text": "Well, first of all, Arizona, as a state has only been around since February 14, 1912 and so the ancient inhabitants didn't actually live in Arizona, as such. But, it seems like every exhibit, TV show or magazine article about the original indigenous inhabitants refers to their disappearance and has to say that it was a mysterious disappearance. For example, if you do a Google search on \"mysterious disappearance ancient inhabitants Arizona\" you will get thousands of resultant Websites. Whether you visit Casa Grande Ruins National Monument or any of the other ruins, you will always see a reference to the mystery. Speaking of Casa Grande, one mystery is why the National Monument is right across the street from a Walmart.Regarding the issue of a mystery, first of all, there were a lot of inhabitants in Arizona when the Europeans first came in about 1528. What isn't a mystery, is that shortly after the first European contact, smallpox and other diseases decimated the native population. Estimates run as high as 75% to 90% of the population killed throughout the North American Continent. This is a historical fact that seems to mostly escape the speculation as to what happened to the native population. It is really no mystery that by the time European settlers started to colonize what is now the Southwestern part of the U.S., there were comparatively few natives left. When was the last time you read about the epidemics decimating the native population in one of your history books?The other speculative reasons for the apparent abandonment of the indigenous ruins are drought, warfare among the tribes and migrations for social or other reasons. The only real mystery is why everyone thinks it is a mystery. It might also have been a good idea to ask the Indians at the time as to what happened to the early inhabitants, but that didn't seem to occur to any of the early explorers. By the way, there has been a recent dramatic increase in the number of Indians counted by the U.S. Census.There are dozens of Indian ruins and petroglyph sites in Arizona. It is extremely interesting to visit them. I will come back to this topic again and again."},
{"title": "Storms and Rain in the Desert", "date": "Monday, February 9, 2009", "text": "One of my early memories of rain in the desert goes back to when I lived in Tucson. At that time, Tucson was a relatively small town and the desert was easily accessible. Tucson is slightly higher above sea level than Phoenix and has a little more rain. One day we drove out into the desert on a dirt road that went up and down over the hills like a roller coaster. At the top of one of the hills there were a couple of cars stopped and people out looking down into the wash. We stopped and looking up the wash, saw a flash flood coming. There was an actual wall of water about two feet high pushing along small debris. It washed out over the road and turned to mud. I have always heard about flash floods but that is the only one I have ever seen actually start and come down a dry wash.We used to have a summer monsoon, but then the weather people all got together and decided that the annual increase in moist air really wasn't a monsoon and anyway, we now have a summer thunderstorm season. The monsoon was defined by two consecutive days with the dew point above 55 degrees. They used to have lotteries about guessing the start date. I guess the weather service doesn't like gambling so they changed the start date to a date certain. Beginning last year, the Summer Thunderstorm Season starts officially on June 15, which is easy for me to remember because it is both my birthday and my wedding anniversary. Last summer the thunderstorms decided to celebrate the new opening of the season. We had one storm that was so incredible. It started to lightning and suddenly, the whole sky lit up with lightning continuously for about 45 minutes without stopping. The thunder was so loud and continuous we thought the sky would fall in. Of course it didn't or I wouldn't be writing this blog. We stood outside until the lightning was so close, we got afraid and moved inside.We also have these huge dust storms. Mostly the people who promote Arizona for tourism try to ignore the dust storms, thunderstorms, hail, rain and snow in the state. They would like you to believe that the weather is always perfect. It isn't. Sometimes it is unbearable. The dust comes in huge storms called haboobs. You can see the edge of the dust coming across the city and suddenly the whole world is blown away with huge clouds of dust. It is pretty spectacular but really messy.I will probably write about the weather and such again some time."},
{"title": "Katabatic wind in the desert", "date": "Saturday, February 7, 2009", "text": "The desert breathes. The most common views of Arizona show one of three things; the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley or the Arizona-Sonora Desert with saguaro cactus. Actually, a substantial portion of the state is forested and well above 5000 feet. For example, both rims of the Grand Canyon are forested in their most popular parts. A most dramatic feature of the state is the Mogollon Rim, actually the southern-western edge of the Colorado Plateau. This 1000 to 2000 foot escarpment is highly visible in central Arizona and around the Sedona area.The huge elevation changes create a significant atmospheric phenomena called katabatic winds. These winds arise in any area of the world where there are differences in altitude but are particularly regular and significant along the Rim. During the daytime, especially in the warmer months, the temperature gradient between the top of the Mogollon Rim and the deserts below can be 40 or 50 degrees Fahrenheit or more. This vast temperature difference means that during the daytime, the hot desert air rises up through the canyons and finally blows out at the top of the Rim. In the night, the cooler air on the Rim sinks down through the canyons and blows out onto the desert.You would think that the cooler air from the mountains would be a welcome relief, but as the air descends it is heated adiabatically, so that in the lower deserts, the wind feels warm and sometimes hot.Camping on the Rim during the summer, the wind picks up in the early evening and blows up the canyons, in the morning the air is calm. Camping in the desert, you get the reverse, in the evening the air will be calm, but by morning there is a breeze which last until the sun comes fully up and starts to heat the ground again.In our rush, rush modern world, perhaps it would be nice just to experience the daily breathing of the deserts."},
{"title": "Bisbee, county seat and tourist attraction", "date": "Thursday, February 5, 2009", "text": "Arizona has a number of old mining towns, but none as scenic as Bisbee, the Cochise County seat in the southeast corner of Arizona. Although I usually prefer wilderness locations, Bisbee is easily one of my favorite commercial-type destinations in Arizona. As their Website states:Welcome                    to Bisbee. Stroll its sidewalks and find delight in the many                    art galleries, gourmet restaurants, coffee houses, book stores                    and specialty shops. Visit the charmingly restored neighborhoods                    of Victorian and European-style homes perched miraculously on                    the hillsides. Unwind...relax...and find soothing respite from                    your everyday world.One of the major attractions is the Queen Mine Tour. We have taken the tour a few times and each time it is still a novelty. You ride an actual mine train deep into a hard rock mine for an hour long tour. The tour is $12 plus tax for adults and $5 for children 4 to 15, under 4 are free. Although I doubt that children under four will enjoy the tour. It is wet and chilly and really interesting.Don't miss the Lavender Pit Jeep Tours. The Lavender Pit is a huge open pit mine right in the middle of the town. The pit covers an area of 300 acres (1.2 km²), and is 900 feet (274 m) deep.Old Bisbee is in a narrow canyon and the houses are built up on the sides of the steep canyon walls and hills. The roads are narrow and really fun to drive, if you like cliffs and sharp turns. If not, take the town tour and let someone else navigate the roads.Bisbee is in the center of a lot of other attractions, including Sierra Vista and Tombstone. I can unqualifiedly recommend Bisbee as a place to visit."},

{"title": "I survived driving the Apache Trail", "date": "Tuesday, January 27, 2009", "text": "Phoenix is a huge metropolitan area of 475.1 square miles. The City of Phoenix is surrounded by a cloud of smaller satellite cities such as Mesa, Scottsdale, Gilbert, Peoria, Glendale, Chandler and many others. At the eastern edge of the Valley is the town of Apache Junction. Although the town has no identifiable downtown area, the main street is called the Apache Trail. In what would be the center of town, if the town had a center, the Apache Trail turns north into the western edge of the Superstition Mountains. It follows the Salt River and overlooks three large lakes, Canyon Lake, Apache Lake and Roosevelt Lake.The road stretches about 41 miles and for most of its length, it has been preserved in its unpaved glory. Pictures taken along the road do not convey the absolutely rugged nature of the surrounding desert and the possibly terrifying grades and drop offs that confront the driver. It also doesn't help that you share the road with hundreds of others, some of whom are driving huge trucks pulling gigantic boats. At certain times of the year, the dust can be formidable. At other times, the road can be a morass of mud. It is an adventure at any time.Despite all of the camps, hikes, climbing trips and boating trips, the Apache Trail is still a wonder, even driven in the middle of the night. It is not for the faint hearted or for those with little or no dirt road driving experience. Although the road can be negotiated in the average passenger car, it is evident from following some drivers that they are completely out of their element. The road has a long and storied history having been built to supply the construction of the Roosevelt Dam. It is no longer the only way to reach the Dam or the Lake, but it is the most interesting.If you come to the Salt River Valley, you will have missed an important part of what makes Arizona special, if you miss the Apache Trail."},
{"title": "Arizona urban wildlife", "date": "Saturday, January 24, 2009", "text": "Listening to the militant conservationists, you would get the impression that wild animals in general were on the verge of extinction. That pretty propaganda piece, the BBC Planet Earth, portrays a world where all the cute little cuddly creatures are disappearing. For a lot of species that well may be the case, but no one ever mentions that species have been disappearing for millions of years, many of which were likely cute and cuddly. The media leave strictly alone those species that not only are not on verge of extinction, but have extended their range and numbers because they can take advantage of the urban environment. Most of these animals are definitely not in cute or cuddly category, for example coyotes, cockroaches, scorpions, pigeons, rattlesnakes, gophers, not to mention the old standbys, rats and mice.Take coyotes for an example, these resilient animals have vastly extended their range. They now inhabit such diverse ares as Nova Scotia and Florida. Coyotes are definitely considered pests. It is undisputed that many (if not nearly all) of the signs you see around advertising for a lost cat or dog, are the result of coyote predation. It is not impossible to catch a coyote, but very, very difficult. We live with coyotes in our neighborhood. On a bike ride we saw two large coyotes standing the middle of a major street. When we approached they both ran, one continued down the same street we were riding on, running along a high wall that parallels the road. The coyote turned and ran up an eight foot wall, just like a cat, then stood at the top of the wall and looked at us, then jumped down into the backyard of a home. Despite intensive eradication efforts involving killing over 400,000 of these animals every year, their populations continue to increase. Hal the Central Park Coyote lived for two days in Central Park before being captured in 2006.  It is interesting that the very active wildlife biologists have no idea how many coyotes live in my neighborhood. Sightings are not rare, but most people, I assume, think they are looking at a stray dog.Another beneficiary of urban sprawl is the common pigeon. It not uncommon for pigeons to be scavenging on the local school campuses, eating a steady diet of the same thing eaten by the area's children. Like the children, the pigeons are obese, only taking to the air when approached within a few feet. There are over 97,000 Web sites for pigeon population control. It is always amusing to me to go into a high rise building here in Phoenix and see the spikes, electrical leads and other anti-pigeon measures, usually with a pigeon sitting on the ledge anyway. Wikipedia deals with pigeons as \"Rock Pigeons.\" You guessed it, no one knows (or cares) how many pigeons there are in Phoenix or anywhere else for that matter.If you would like an amusing activity apply for a federal grant to study pigeons unless you can tie the study into West Nile Virus or some other disease.What about the rest of the denizens of our urban world in Arizona? Scorpions, definitely not endangered. Rats and mice, not a common as some places in the U.S. but still not about to disappear any time soon. That leave cockroaches. You have to come to Phoenix or some other warm climate area to really appreciate how many cockroaches there are in the world. Try opening a sewer manhole sometime. The only good thing about scorpions (there might be other good things but I haven't spent much time thinking about the good things about scorpions) is that when you have scorpions they eat the cockroaches.OK, that leaves rattlesnakes. I really shouldn't have included them in this urban tirade, but they are one of the most recognizable \"dangerous\" animals in Arizona and elsewhere, but what is surprising is that no one seems to know how many rattlesnakes there are. One study concluded that \"The survey teams systematically searched areas that were suspected to be good habitat for the species and recorded basic statistics for each rattlesnake encountered. These efforts resulted in the identification of a relatively small number of Arizona black rattlesnakes. For this reason, it was not possible for scientists to determine specific population numbers for individual park units.\"I could have included a lot of other animals that are far from any endangered species list, like mosquitoes. But I assume no one is counting them either.My point? Ecological hand wringing is sometimes pretty selective."},
{"title": "More thoughts on Canyon de Chelly", "date": "Tuesday, January 20, 2009", "text": "Canyon de Chelly is a different type of scenic destination. It is spectacularly beautiful, it is high accessible and it is relatively well known, but, for example, it is very seldom mentioned or featured in Arizona Highways magazine. There are probably two reasons for this, first and foremost is that it is private property. Although the Canyon is officially designated as a National Monument, it is also on the Navajo Nation and has permanent residents. The Canyon is composed entirely of Navajo Tribal Trust Land. This is the Navajo people's home, it is not on public land. This fact leads to the second issue, that entrance to the Canyon is controlled and can be pretty expensive both in money and time. Although it is possible to drive around the perimeter of the Canyon and visit the overlooks without charge, going into the Canyon can take an entire day and can be quite expensive. A drive-in tour to see both branches of the Canyon, Spider Rock and Mummy Cave, can easily take eight hours. Prices vary but a short three hour trip can cost up to $60 or $70 per person with an additional charge of almost $70 an hour for longer trips. If you can afford the trip, it is certainly worth the time and the money, but even comparing this to the Grand Canyon, a very expensive place, and it is much more expensive for a casual visit. Another factor in the popularity of the Canyon is the difference in accessibility. Since the Grand Canyon has been a destination for so many years, there are a multitude of tours and ways to get to the Canyon. On the other hand, Canyon de Chelly is tucked away, well off the beaten path in eastern Arizona. The facilities are decided limited and the Grand Canyon-like infrastructure is entirely missing. I love the place. It is spectacular, but it must be enjoyed in its own unique context. Up in the northeast corner of Arizona, located in the Navajo Nation, is a most remarkable canyon called Canyon de Chelly (pronounced \"shay\"). Like many places in Arizona it is a study in contrasts. The entrance to the Canyon is practically in the middle of a good sized town, Chinle, Arizona. When I first visited the Canyon, the town was very small and the Canyon seemed to be quite a distance from the town, but over the years Chinle has grown into a major economic center, with a hospital, a number of schools and many government buildings. There are shopping centers and a lot of other businesses. In the U.S. Census for 2000, Chinle had 5,366 people.Just to the south and east of the town, the entrance to the Canyon is unremarkable and unless you knew that the Canyon was there, you might drive by without noticing it. Canyon de Chelly is one of the longest continuously inhabited places in North America. From the National Park Service description:The cultural resources of Canyon de Chelly include distinctive architecture, artifacts, and rock imagery while exhibiting remarkable preservation integrity that provides outstanding opportunities for study and contemplation. Canyon de Chelly also sustains a living community of Navajo people, who are connected to a landscape of great historical and spiritual significance. Canyon de Chelly is unique among National Park service units, as it is comprised entirely of Navajo Tribal Trust Land that remains home to the canyon community. NPS works in partnership with the Navajo Nation to manage park resources and sustain the living Navajo community.Because the Canyon is home to the Navajo people, travel into the Canyon is tightly controlled. There is only one place that you can descend the Canyon walls and visit the floor unaccompanied by a local guide. The hike down to the White House Ruin from the South Rim Drive is one of those locations. Although the hike is short, it is memorable and worth the drive to the Canyon.If you have time and the money, you can take a guided tour through the Canyon. Authorized Navajo Guides are required and charge $15 an hour for one vehicle and $5 and hour for each additional vehicle with a 5-vehicle limit. Travel in the Canyon is definitely limited to four-wheel drive and sand equipped vehicles. For a larger fee, you can take a guided tour on one of the large four-wheel drive trucks operated by concessionaires.More later (Thanks to the NPS for the photo above)"},
{"title": "Fat Man's Pass", "date": "Saturday, January 17, 2009", "text": "Descending by airplane into Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix at night is fantastic experience. But it is amazing how few of your fellow fliers, jaded by years of flying, will even bother to look out the windows. One of the most prominent landmarks is the huge dark curtain of South Mountain, crowned with it sparkling ring of transmission towers. The towers are so visible, they are a certain reference point to orient any guess at which part of the valley you are flying over. In the daytime they are an almost invisible backdrop to the city.But spend a few hours and drive to the edge of these urban mountains and you will experience one of the most contradictory wilderness experiences possible, hiking in solitude in an almost untouched desert environment while overlooking  one of the largest cities in America. Granted, some of the trails are so overused as to be beaten to powder, but the western end of the enclave is as remote as any mountains could be so close to a large city. The further west you go, the more solitary your hiking experience.South Mountain Park is one of the largest, at 16,283 acres, if not the largest city park in the United States.  At the eastern end of the mountains lies one of the most unusual and surprising destinations of the Park, Fat Man's Pass. This rock canyon is located in Hidden Valley, a valley whose hills block out any view of the City and transform the small environment into a magical place of Indian Petroglyphs and a very small intermittent stream. The most prominent feature of the valley is a ridge of rocks on the west side, with a narrow crack of an entrance or exit giving the area its name.The hike to Fat Man's Pass is located on the National Trail about a mile and half from the trail head. The National, as it is called, is frequented by mountain bikers, horse riders and hikers and is easily negotiated. The hike is especially popular with children since the entrance to hidden valley is through a natural tunnel made of huge boulders. Access to the trail head is along an abandoned dirt road that runs from a parking lot on the extreme eastern edge of the Park. Very few natural areas are so accessible and still retain their wilderness feel."},
{"title": "The Boyce Thompson Arboretum", "date": "Wednesday, January 14, 2009", "text": "There are all sorts of out-of-the-way places in Arizona that get almost no media coverage. One of the most remarkable of these is the Boyce Thompson Arboretum. Located about an hour east of Phoenix on U.S. Highway 60 and about 3 miles south of Superior, it is another of Arizona's gems. Named after William Boyce Thompson, a mining entrepreneur who purchased the Magma Mine in Superior in 1907. The Arboretum was established on a portion of the 400 acres acquired by Thompson in a land swap with the National Forest Service. Thompson built a mansion nearby, known as the Picket Post House, named after the prominent red rock mountain that dominates the view south of Superior.The Boyce Thompson Arboretum is home to over 3,200 varieties of desert plants including more than 800 kinds of cacti, more than 230 species of birds and 72 animal species. The main portion of the Arboretum can be seen from a 1.5 mile loop trail. The collection includes plants from Africa, South America, Asia and the Mediterranean area.My first introduction to the Arboretum was when I was in the fourth grade and wrote a report about it. However, it wasn't until many years later, after I had gained an appreciation for the desert and its plants, that I actually visited the Arboretum.  The promotional materials describe the garden as follows:As you approach the Arboretum on Highway 60 you'll see towering Picketpost      Mountain dominating the southern horizon. The Arboretum brings together plants      from the Earth's many and varied deserts and dry lands and displays them alongside      unspoiled examples of the native Sonoran Desert vegetation. No matter what      the season, you will enjoy a moving and memorable experience of the beauty,      majesty, and mystery of arid land plants. You will also enjoy the many natural      communities that form the arid land environment. Memorable experiences await      you as you walk the Main Trail; you will see enthralling, otherworldly shapes      and forms in the Cactus Garden. You will also find peaceful reflection in      the cool shade of towering trees in Queen Creek Canyon; and intellectual stimulation      in the many and varied displays at the Smith Interpretive Center. You may      enjoy a quiet and intimate time at the Wing Memorial Garden; as well as inspiration      for home or business landscapes at the Demonstration Gardens of Low Water-demanding      Plants. You will see expansive southwestern vistas visible from the High Trail.      There are many gardens here; so find your special places among them.The Arboretum is now part of the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences of the University of Arizona. There is an admission fee to visit the garden."},
{"title": "Pariah -- trail with a history Part Two", "date": "Sunday, January 11, 2009", "text": "Entering Pariah Canyon from the north, you begin by walking down a wash. At this time of year, the Pariah River (more a small stream) was entirely dry. I loved walking over the crackly dried mud mosaic and couldn't suppress the urge to pick up the puzzle pieces. The way mud cracks when it dries has been a delight to me since childhood. The walls of the Canyon rise rapidly and just as suddenly, the water appeared. We could walk along the bank of the stream for quite a distance, but suddenly, the water filled the entire Canyon from wall to wall and we had to make a decision as to how we were going to proceed. Most of us put on our water sandals or canvas shoes and picked up our packs. For the next few days, we would spend most of our walking back and forth, in and out of the water, sometimes crossing creek many times in an hour.The first major milestone is the confluence of the Pariah and the Buckskin Gulch. We had a good time playing in the quicksand and getting covered with sand and mud. By this time the Canyon is deep enough to be considered a slot canyon, with no visible way to exit the Canyon.The rest of the trip, involved walking, resting, looking for the infrequent springs and wondering about paths up and out of the Canyon. Although the weather in late May was very warm, almost hot, we certainly had enough water, especially if we wanted to purify the river water. It seems that we spent a lot of time drinking water.Once we came out of the south end of the Canyon we expected that we would be through with walking, but there was a considerable distance to go across sand dunes but it was no longer necessary to wade the river.Words can barely express a place that is so beautiful. It is one of those places that can be loved to death. It is really such a small place. Anything that disturbs the Canyon floor remains, at least until the next major flood. Both the Pariah and Buckskin Gulch are subject to multiple flash floods each year and extreme caution is necessary in planning any trip into the Canyon.The southern end of the Canyon is at Lee's Ferry, which is the major staging point for rafting trips down through the Grand Canyon and for fishing trips up the Canyon towards Glenn Canyon Dam.One of the saddest events in the settlement of Southern Utah is closely connected with the fabulous Pariah Canyon, a slot canyon running roughly from north to south into the Colorado River. In 1871, settler John D. Lee and his family settled at a remote outpost which came to be called Lonely Dell. He established a ferry across the Colorado River near the confluence of the Pariah and the Colorado. The location came to be called \"Lee's Ferry.\"John D. Lee's exile to this remote region came about as a result of his participation in the infamous Mountain Meadow Massacre. But the ferry he established was one of the very few places where travelers could cross the Colorado. The location remains today as the Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District and is located adjacent to the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness.Access to Lee's Ferry, before the roads were built, was from Kanab down through the pass between Buckskin Mountain (the Kaibab Plateau) and the Vermilion Cliffs or directly down Pariah Canyon itself. (the name is variously spelled Pariah or Paria and you can tell if someone is a local by the way the name is pronounced). In 1929 the Arizona State Highway Commission built a bridge across the Colorado just below Lee's Ferry called Navajo Bridge. From the end of the Grand Canyon near the Arizona/Nevada/Utah border, across Arizona to the Four Corners at Mexican Hat, there are still only four ways to drive or walk across the Colorado River or its tributaries; Hoover Dam and the bridge being built there, Navajo Bridge, the two bridges at the bottom of the Grand Canyon near Phantom Ranch, and the bridge over the San Juan at Mexican Hat. (In Utah there is a seasonal shuttle/ferry between Halls Crossing and the Bullfrog Marina but that doesn't count).The Navajo Bridge was rebuilt in 1995 so there are now two bridges crossing the river, the old one is open to foot traffic only.The northern end of Pariah Canyon can be approached from either the White House Trailhead along the river itself or from Buckskin Gulch. None of these hikes are for the inexperienced. Entry into these narrow slot canyons at the wrong time can be deadly. Permits are required and can be obtained from the Bureau of Land Management.There are some pretty good photos at Pariah."},
{"title": "At the top of Arizona -- Humphrey's Peak", "date": "Thursday, January 8, 2009", "text": "Although there is considerable disagreement over the actual elevation, Humphrey's Peak is acknowledged as the highest point in the State of Arizona. Depending on weather conditions, hiking the trail to the top is mostly a long walk uphill. There are one or two places where the trail goes through some rocks, but the real difficulties are wind, weather, cold and altitude. The measured altitude of the peak is around 12,637 feet. But a quick search on the Internet will show that the elevation either changes a lot from day to day, or the reports differ.There are a lot of descriptions of the trail including very large number of pictures. Humphey's is one of the group of peaks known as the San Francisco Peaks, located just north and west of Flagstaff. Since they are visible from most of the Arizona side of the Colorado Plateau, including some locations in Grand Canyon National Park, they are extremely well known to travelers. Most of the fall, spring and winter, the Peaks are generally the only mountains you can see with snow while driving around in northern Arizona.I have used the trail up Humphrey's as a gauge to determine if I was ready to hike into the Grand Canyon. If I make it to the top without problems, I feel that walking across the Canyon is possible. This is not a solitary wilderness experience, on any given day, with good weather, you might see a couple of hundred people walking the trail. On occasion, sitting room has been a premium at the top. Walking the trail gives you a real mountain experience, since the trail head is deep in an old growth forest and the top is above the tree line. I fully realize that climbing Humphrey's is not like climbing in the Sierra Nevada or Cascades, but this is Arizona, not the Pacific Northwest.It is interesting that getting to the tree line corresponds with hitting the altitude wall at about 11,000 feet. Just as you walk out of the trees, you start to notice that you can't breathe as well as you did when you got out of your car.One of Arizona's few ski resorts in located on the southwest facing side of the Mountain, Arizona Snowbowl. One of the chair lifts goes most of the way up the mountains and a ride to the top gives you a good view of the whole San Francisco Peaks area. But the end of the ski lift is quite a ways from the actual top of the mountain. I especially like the forest on the way to the top. It is old and dark and very untidy, unlike most of the other forests in Arizona, where the Forest Service and logging have turned most of the forest into a left over commercial enterprise. The hike up the Humphrey's trail is worth it, even if you never make it to the top. Reports on the distance to the top also vary considerably. Part of the reason, is that the trail register is located about a mile or so from the parking area below the Snowbowl ski resort. The trail is about 4.5 miles, one way, making the round trip about 9 miles. But there with the hike to the trailhead, you had better count on more like 11 miles round trip.Because the mountains are so isolated, storms can come in quickly and without warning you can be in extreme danger from lightning. There is no water and there are no facilities on the trail so caution is advised. Coming from Phoenix, you are already experience a considerable altitude change when you are in the parking lot and we have had people with heart conditions decide that they really didn't want to walk past the parking lot.The mountain isn't quite as crowded as Camelback Mountain in Phoenix, and the views are spectacular."},

The wind is blowing in gusts and I can smell the rain and see the lightning striking closer and closer. It is time to move off the Rim and back into the forest.With a whisper, like a gossamer curtain, I move to the top of an extinct volcano, a cinder cone, looking across the Colorado Plateau, into the haze of the distance, again watching the clouds, make a patchwork of shade as they move across the desert.Again I move, this time to the edge of deep canyon, so deep and dark, I cannot see the bottom. I clamber along the rocks, trying to get to point where the bottom is visible. I cannot believe that such a huge and deep canyon could be so unknown. I can finally see the creek at the bottom and I am surprised at the amount of water, where did this huge creek come from here in dry Arizona?With a sweeping motion, I am sitting on a mountain top, looking out over the red and blue wastelands of the painted desert and glimpsing the edge of a huge crack running across the whole horizon. The wind is blowing again and I crouch down behind a rock to keep warm and to keep my eyes from running with tears from the cold and wind. There isn't a cloud in the sky, and the sunlight is intense. I can feel my skin burning.I am walking, like a shadow, wading through ice cold water, the canyon so narrow there is no other path. The cliffs above rise in rocky crags, almost shutting out the sun. The green jungle growth in the bottom of the canyon, contrasts with the barren Sonoran desert of the canyon walls.I move again, to a narrow box canyon. The echoes of my footsteps heighten the constriction of the rocks. I can reach out and touch both sides of the canyon at the same time. I can only see a narrow shaft of sunlight reflecting down from the cliffs above.I am walking across the desert, stepping carefully to avoid the cholla, and watching for snakes. I see glimpses of the red ornaments of the Christmas cactus and watch for the sudden jumps of rabbits.A thousand pictures, a thousand smells, a thousand sounds, crowd into my mind and again, my eyes fill with tears, this time not from the wind and not from the sun, but from my memories of walking Arizona."},
{"title": "Desert dangers: dehydration", "date": "Sunday, December 28, 2008", "text": "Every year there are news stories about people dying in the desert in Arizona. This has become a big issue with many Latin American migrants being the victims. However, anyone who ventures into the desert must be prepared or suffer the same fate. There have been a number of occasions when I have been caught without enough water under the circumstances. One day, when the temperature was over 95 degrees F I lost six pounds to water loss alone. What may be a pleasant outing, can quickly turn into a challenge of survival, if you are not prepared.Early symptoms of dehydration include thirst, loss of appetite, dry skin, skin flushing, dark colored urine, dry mouth, fatigue, and even, chills. Once your heart rate and respiration increase, and your body temperature increases, you are in serious trouble. When loss of bodily fluids reaches 10% you are in serious danger of dying.The first and best rule is do not venture into the desert without adequate preparation. Make sure you carry enough water for everyone in your group, at least a gallon a day per person. There are certain times of the year when the desert experience is just not worth the risk. The Superstition Wilderness Area is a wonderful place to hike, but not between the months of May and September. Let good sense dictate when and where you go.When you do go into the desert, make sure you tell someone your plans and your return date or time. When you do go into the desert, take those things that will be helpful in an emergency; a tool kit, a shovel, spare parts, extra engine oil and coolant.With today's off road vehicles, you can get into trouble by having an accident or a breakdown only a short few minute's drive from the highway.

As I noted in my last post, the North and South Rims of the Grand Canyon are both over 7000 feet above sea level. The northeast third of Arizona lies on the Colorado Plateau, most of which is over 5000. Temperatures in the Arizona high country can go as low as 40 degrees F below zero which was recorded at Hawley Lake at 8,180 feet above sea level. However, one hallmark of the high country in Arizona is the wind. It is not unusual for the wind to blow almost constantly at over 30 mph. With a wind chill factor, that -40 degrees F would have been the equivalent of the lowest temperature ever recorded in Alaska, -80 degrees F. NWS Wind Chill ChartAt those low temperatures the average time to frostbite can be as low as five minutes. But it does not take such extreme temperatures to put someone in danger of hypothermia. The primary indication of hypothermia is a core body temperature below 95 degrees F (35 degrees C). Below that temperature, hypothermia is life threatening. With the contrasts in temperature varying by altitude, you can leave Phoenix at a balmy 60 or 70 degrees F and within an hour or so, step out of your car into below freezing temperatures. Additionally, the temperature can vary significantly during twenty-four hours most places in Arizona, especially at altitude. For example, in the winter, Flagstaff can have a temperature variation of over 30 degrees from day to night.Hypothermia can occur whenever the ambient temperature is lower than the body temperature. Obviously, the lower the temperature outside, the greater the danger. Hypothermia can be classified into three stages, mild with a core body temperature above 89.5 degrees F, moderate with a core body temperature over 82.4 degrees F and severe when the body temperature falls below 82.4 degrees. Young people and those with little or no body fat are at greater risk of hypothermia. The main symptoms of mild hypothermia are shivering, lethargy, confusion, loss of coordination and rapid heart rate. As the hypothermia gets worse, the shivering stops and confusion becomes delirium. At very low temperatures, the heart stops and you die.Don't treat excursions out into the Arizona wilderness lightly. Temperature conditions can be extreme.Next time: Heat exhaustion and heat stroke"},
{"title": "Grand Canyon dangers -- altitude", "date": "Saturday, December 20, 2008", "text": "Dropping over the Rim of the Grand Canyon, you enter an entirely foreign world. Both the North and South Rims are relatively high, and quite cool, even in the summer months. The Kaibab National Forest, on the North Rim, is a high, between 7000 and 8000 foot mountain, known as Buckskin Mountain. The North Rim is traditionally closed to vehicular traffic during the winter months because of snow and difficult weather conditions. The South Rim is lower, but still about  7000 feet above sea level.This combination of altitude, heat and dryness is a real danger to those who, without proper preparation, leave the cushions of civilization on the Rim and drop into the Canyon.First, the vast majority of people live well below 7000 feet. Altitude sickness, also known as acute mountain sickness commonly occurs above 2400 meters or approximately 8000 feet.  See Altitude Sickness. However, symptoms of the condition can appear as low as 6,500 feet about sea level (2000 meters). Symptoms include headache, fatigue, stomach illness, dizziness, and sleep disturbance. Exertion aggravates the symptoms. In extreme cases, altitude sickness can be fatal.I have lived much of my life at altitude, but have had acute symptoms of altitude sickness strike randomly, without warning. I remember one episode on Humphrey's Peak, the highest mountain in Arizona. I got an acute headache and had to lay down several times coming down the mountain to recover. I spent a lot of my summers up on the Colorado Plateau, I finally realized that my symptoms of fatigue were probably altitude related, going from near sea level in the desert to almost 6000 feet.The Grand Canyon is definitely within the range of altitudes that can cause acute altitude sickness. When planning any hike into the Canyon, you definitely need to be aware of this possibility. While hiking out of the Canyon from Phantom Ranch, on one occasion, I could not figure out why I was hiking so slowly near the Rim. I finally realized that I had to breathe. So I would stop every 50 steps or so and breathe deeply. I finally began to move up the trail.With all the other issues about hiking in the Canyon, this is one that is often overlooked."},
{"title": "Grand Canyon: Death and Injury", "date": "Thursday, December 18, 2008", "text": "The scenario is almost legendary, a tourist on the Rim of the Grand Canyon backs up to get into a picture and falls to death off the cliffs. Unfortunately, the legend is in many cases, a reality. The exposure to falls on the North and South Rims of the Canyon are immense and the number of visitors is huge, combined these facts make for a relatively common problem. What it comes down to is that the Grand Canyon is reality, it is not Disneyland where the rides are not real. A fall into the Canyon is not cushioned by foam rubber. But falls are not the only dangers in the Canyon.There is a recent book on the subject of the dangers of the Canyon. Here is the citation to the book:Ghiglieri, Michael Patrick, and Thomas M. Myers. Over the Edge: Death in Grand Canyon : Gripping Accounts of All Known Fatal Mishaps in the Most Famous of the World's Seven Natural Wonders. Flagstaff, AZ: Puma Press, 2001.Although this subject is \"gripping\" and perhaps \"dramatic\" my experience has been that, more than any other place I hike, the Grand Canyon seems to attract the unprepared and just plain stupid. On one hike, down from the North Rim to Thunder River, we found two groups of hikers that were in serious trouble. One group was wandering aimlessly on the Esplanade totally disoriented and lost. Hopefully, we put them back on the trail. The second group was caught without water. According to my conversations with Park Rangers, it is a very common occurrence.On one trip out of the Canyon, we passed a man who was limping up the trail, his boots held together with Duck Tape. Another group, a man and two very small children passed us with the children crying from exhaustion. A short time later I passed the young boy laying down in the middle of the trail. Apparently his father was too tired himself, to help him up the trail.Stepping off the Rim, either accidentally or intentionally on a trail, is a serious business and requires preparation and planning. Once we left the North Rim where the temperature was 27 degrees Fahrenheit, by the time we reach Phantom Ranch, the temperature was 97 degrees in the shade. Although I am not sure how helpful it is to know about foolish people who fall off the Rim but here are a few stories:Canadian falls to his death in Grand CanyonServices Held for Canyon Death VictimJunction man recovering after Grand Canyon hiking accidentThe list goes on and on.

{"title": "The Grand Canyon a place or an institution?", "date": "Monday, December 15, 2008", "text": "Grand Canyon Village on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon is the hub of a complex transportation and communications network. People can travel to the Canyon by air, train, bus or automobile. Thousands of tour groups travel to the Canyon each year, many from distant foreign countries. It is evident that the Grand Canyon is a destination attraction. But how does it compare to some other attractions?According to InfoPlease, France is the world's top country for tourists, followed by Spain and then the United States. However, the United States earns the most in the world in tourist dollars. In 2003 Arizona was not even in the top ten of the U.S. States visited by foreign travelers and none of the top ten cities for foreign visitors was in Arizona. According to The Travelers Zone, the Grand Canyon was number twenty among the top visited tourist attractions in the U.S., far behind Times Square in New York and Temple Square in Salt Lake City.  To give you an idea of popularity, Walt Disney World in Florida was number five and Disneyland in California, number six.In Arizona, the Grand Canyon is, by far, the most popular and visited attraction in the state. According to the Arizona Department of Tourism report \"Arizona 2007 Tourism Facts, Year-end Summary,\" the Grand Canyon led in numbers of tourists by more than a million people over the second place destination, Phoenix's South Mountain Park.  The next three attractions on the list, number two, South Mountain Park, and number three, Saguaro National Monument near Tucson, and number four, Tempe Town Lake, are located adjacent to or actually in, large metropolitan areas.It is apparent that the Grand Canyon has become an institution with a visitation to the specific facilities at either the North or South Rims as practically the only major activity.  An examination of the statistics in the Tourism Report show that only about 10% of the Arizona resident visitors actually hike or camp in any of Arizona's natural attractions. The number one activity is dining out at a restaurant. When non-resident visitors are counted, only 6% either hike or bike and camping isn't even a measured activity. It is clear that the commonly portrayed image of the outdoors as a place for camping and hiking involves only a very, very small minority of the tourism population. This probably isn't surprising given the fact that the average age of a tourist in Arizona, whether resident or non-resident is between 40 and 50 years old.There are two entirely different and divergent poles of experience at the Grand Canyon; those who view the Canyon from above as an attraction, a commercial institution, and those who experience the Canyon from below and see the real Grand Canyon, a huge and complex ecosystem. Think about it, how many photographs have you seen in Arizona Highways Magazine taken from down inside the Canyon? (Not counting the rafting photos)."},

While sites like Coal Mine Canyon might get a hundred people a year, the Grand Canyon is host to roughly five million visitors each year.The Arizona Hospitality Research and Resource Center, School of Hotel & Restaurant Management at Northern Arizona University did a Tourism Study of the Grand Canyon National Park in April, 2005. Not surprisingly, they found that the Grand Canyon National Park is one of the world’s premier attractions, with the power to draw visitors from great distances. to quote from the survey: \"This survey documented visitors from all 50 U.S. states and Puerto Rico, plus visitors from 41 foreign countries. Overall, 83% were domestic visitors residing in the United States; California (12.2%), Arizona (8.9%), Texas (4.8%), Florida (3.4%) and New York (3.2%) represented the top domestic markets. Seventeen percent of visitors were of foreign origins, and the top foreign markets were: the United Kingdom (3.8%), Canada (3.5%), Japan (2.1%), Germany (1.9%) and The Netherlands (1.2%). \"Although these facts may not be so surprising, the study also says: \"Grand Canyon visitors averaged 48.5 years of age. Nearly half (47.5%) of survey respondents were between the ages of 46 and 65. Those 26 to 45 years comprised over a third of the sample (35.2%). Visitors over age 65 years (11.5%), and those 25 years or younger (5.8%) completed the age segments. GCNP visitors were highly educated. The vast majority of respondents (85.2%) had attended some college. Of these, one-fourth (24.8%) had completed a 4-year degree, while another 34.3% engaged in graduate study or earned graduate degrees.\"The economic impact of the Canyon is substantial, the study states that: \"Grand Canyon visitor expenditures averaged $536 per travel party in the park and $595 per travel party within 90 miles of the park. The total annual economic impact (direct, indirect and induced) of Grand Canyon National Park visitors was $687 million of output into the regional economy, which supported 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the area.Only a very small percentage of the visitors descend below the rim. Even fewer hike to the bottom of the Canyon. It is something to be viewed, but not experienced, I guess."},

It is almost entirely unknown and yet is located only a short distance from a major highway. There are no signs marking the turnoff or identifying the canyon. No interpretive sites. No visitors' center. No guardrails. No signs telling you not to fall into the canyon. No vendors. No IMAX movie. No Japanese or European tourists. No shuttle buses. No Rangers in uniform. No hikers. No campers. No newlyweds taking each others' pictures. No curio shops. Not much except the canyon.You can see Coal Mine Canyon in the morning and be to the Grand Canyon National Park by lunch if you want all the other things listed above. Or you can spend a week exploring its nooks and crannies.It is one of the jewels of Arizona and it is hard to find. Even if you know where it is, it is hard to find. The roads are not only not marked they are dirt and don't go directly to the canyon. It cannot be seen from any paved road. It is not on any map of Arizona. Here are some pictures.The rim of the Canyon and the view points are extremely unstable and undercut. Walking too close to the edge could dump you 200 feet down to the bottom of the canyon.The upper edge of the Canyon is a low grade coal. The Hopi Indians used to come here to mine coal. The red rock is shale and is said to have oxidized as a result of the burning of the coal. In examining the beds of shale, I disagree, they are highly oxidized but the shale is in narrow bands separated by other clay bands that do not appear to have any coal content. The read shale beds have fossils.This site is on the Navajo Indian Reservation and subject to Navajo Nation laws and police. A Navajo Nation permit is required to camp anywhere on the Reservation. The Canyon is practically in the backyard of someone's home and they would certainly be aware if you were camped there.The wind blows all the time and there are no restrooms, water or anything resembling civilization other than five cement picnic tables. Some of the accounts mentioned a lot of garbage, we didn't see much, it must have been removed by the Navajos or some other civic minded people."},
{"title": "Remarkable Antelope Island", "date": "Sunday, December 7, 2008", "text": "There are many places in the vast Western United States that are so beautiful that they defy description. One of those places is Antelope Island State Park. Antelope Island is the largest island in the Great Salt Lake, the largest lake in the Western U.S. and probably the largest salt water lake in the world. Although it is only a short distance from a large city, it has a remote and unworldly feeling. The level of the Great Salt Lake determines how much land there is adjacent to the island. In years of high water, these pictures would show the lake covering all of the flat land. This picture shows the \"beach\" made of oolitic sand. I talked about oolitic sand in a previous post but on this trip we found out that the little spherical grains are mineral deposits on salt water shrimp fecal matter. We lost some of our fascination with the sand upon learning this fact. There really is water way out there in the distance.This next picture shows the lake disappearing into the haze.In the distance you can see the dramatic Wasatch FrontThere are almost no trees on the whole island.But there is a herd of around 800 North American BisonEven though this blog is called Walking Arizona, I do walk, ride and fly to other places now and again.

{"title": "Beautiful sights in Arizona", "date": "Friday, December 5, 2008", "text": "It is almost guaranteed that in any given issue of the Arizona Highways, there will be one or more pictures of the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley and/or the Oak Creek Canyon area around Sedona. I do have to agree that all of these places, and more, warrant the attention they get from the media. But I am equally impressed with a lot of other areas that are just as beautiful, if not as well known. In the next few posts I will give my impressions of some of these other, less well known, locations throughout the State.First on my list are Big Lake and Mount Baldy. Located in eastern Arizona, just about midway from the north and south borders, this area known as the White Mountains is spectacular. Mount Baldy is the second highest mountain in Arizona and can be easily climbed by anyone with the stamina to walk up to 11,391 feet. On some lists it is ranked as low as number eight, due to the fact that the San Francisco Peaks, including the highest peak, Humphrey's Peak at 12,562 or thereabouts, have the first seven highest peaks.Arizona has very few natural lakes. Almost every lake in the State has its origin as a man-made reservoir and Big Lake is no exception. When I have taken people to see this area of Arizona for the first time, almost with out exception, they declare that they had no idea that Arizona had such a beautiful place.The White Mountains are volcanic in origin and are now covered in thick stands of Ponderosa Pine and Fir, with open meadows called cienegas. Intermixed with the pine and fir are stands of quaking aspen and the fall colors are spectacular.There are dozens of Web sites that tell the story of the mountains, here are a few of them:http://azwhitemountains.net/http://www.go-arizona.com/White-Mountainshttp://www.wmonline.com/http://www.arizonawhitemountains.com/http://www.biglakeaz.com/Big%20Lake%20AZ.htmhttp://www.go-arizona.com/Big-LakeCheck these sites out."},

{"title": "Myths of TV and other media", "date": "Wednesday, November 26, 2008", "text": "The proliferation of cable TV channels has exalted the myths of TV to a new level. It is impossible to watch almost any channel without seeing pure nonsense in the form of commercials and entertainment. Without conscious effort the viewer is indoctrinated by this constant stream of concepts that have no anchor to reality. First, it is important to understand that I grew up with TV. I watched hours and hours a week, often until end of the Tonight Show. When I was younger, I was outraged by the suggestion made, in the context of a Church meeting, that TV viewing on Sunday was inappropriate. Now in my dotage, I have finally begun to understand the message of the media and I find it wanting.Myth #1That life consists of a series of crisis that can all be solved.Life does not ever resolve. It goes on and on with no real satisfying ending. Although the cast of characters in real life changes slowly over time, the themes, the plots and the stories never end.  There are no easy solutions to life's challenges, unlike the TV episodes that would have you believe people never have to shop regularly for food, work all day for a living, ride buses, drive for hours in cars to get anywhere, go through airport security, take regular baths and perform other such bodily maintenance activities and so forth. Even if people die, the rest  of us have to go on with our daily routines. TV fails to show this well or at all. No one would really want to watch a real reality show, it would only remind us how real reality really is.Myth #2The majority of people look like movie stars.I started to watch some mindless movie about a huge earthquake in New York. That should have been the giveaway, there has never been a huge earthquake in New York, but I stopped watching when it turned out that all the refugees from the disaster were beautiful people. Now I have been to New York, and the people there look remarkably just like the people anywhere else in the United States and I didn't see one person that looked like a movie star. You know the type, perfect hair, perfect smile, no skin blemishes, no fat, not one paunch in the lot. When TV does show real people they cut away fast so they can get back to the beautiful ones. I believe the number of beautiful people is roughly similar to the percentage of basketball players that make it into the NBA.Myth #3All cars are luxuriously manufactured to go fast and smash through things.If you watch car commercials, the cheapest Ford or GM models are filled with luxury and drive like they could win the gran prix. Every car is shown charging down the empty highway  or dashing through traffic at speeds that would usually get the attention of the local police or photo radar. Despite the commercials, all cars made in the world are about the same. The more expensive fast cars are just that, more expensive and fast, not really any better. Cars vary in their size and weight. The only real innovation in automotive design is a figment of the imagination of the ad agencies. If car manufacturers really cared about gas mileage and innovation then more cars would look like and get the gas mileage of a Toyota Prius. Cars are not a luxury, they do not make us happy or rich or popular. They are a huge expense and have a monumental impact on our culture, our environment and our society and that is not all good.Myth #4People are not accountable for their actions and any life style is acceptable.Not only does TV show only beautiful people, they do whatever they want to do without any consequences. Just as in the old movies, all of the people smoked and no one ever got lung cancer, today, nearly all of the TV shows depict people doing immoral, dishonest and wicked things without any consequences. Wickedness never was happiness and depicting evil as good is not acceptable. Everyone will be held accountable for their actions, either in this life or the next. There is no free lunch, every action has a consequence.Myth #5No physical possession can make us happy.TV would have you believe that happiness comes from using the right products or owning the right possessions. None of this is true. Happiness does not come from owning anything. You will not be any happier with a 64 inch flat screen TV than you are today without one. Some of the most unhappy people have the most physical possessions.More commentary later"},
{"title": "Why was the Dutchman lost?", "date": "Sunday, November 16, 2008", "text": "Through the mists of legend, can we discern the truth? Not always. Arizona is replete with stories of lost mines. There are lists, books and Web sites. Very few of the publications acknowledge that no \"lost mine\" has ever been found.It always fascinated me that someone could discover a fabulous mineral deposit, spend time tunneling into solid rock and then, lose the mine. Gold and silver are heavy metals. I have a hard time believing that if I had a pile of gold, I could somehow lose it. Even though gold is not easy to carry around, it is so valuable that I doubt I would just leave it lying around. Likewise, if I spent days and weeks, perhaps years, tunneling into the side of a mountain, I probably would remember where it was. As I have pointed out in previous posts, there are over 6 million people in Arizona now, averaging almost 50 per square mile. With all of the hiking, camping, ATVs and other vehicles, it seems almost impossible that there are \"undiscovered\" mines in the state.Reality has never been a strong point with those who promote UFOs, Monster Animals or Lost Mines. Lost mines and lost treasures are typical of this type of story. Ship wrecks to the contrary, most of the persistent stories of lost gold and silver involve robberies of some kind or another. (You might note that there haven't been that many ship wrecks in Arizona). The robbers always stash the loot, usually thousands of pounds of gold, in some unlikely spot and then all get killed before they can return and claim their ill-begotten gains. Unfortunately, the stories never tell how a few robbers are able to transport the thousands of pounds of gold to the stash point.  It is also absolutely certain, that those who believe cannot be dissuaded by the truth.  When I was a lot younger, we had an older desert rat of a man who used to come into the law office where I worked. He returned from time to time and I learned that he was trying to raise money for a mine. He claimed to have discovered the Lost Dutchman Mine. I guess he never got the funding because supposedly the mine is still lost.Maybe this was the reason that I got started on reading about lost mines in Arizona. For years I researched the mines and read everything I could find printed on the subject. The most famous mine story is that of the Lost Dutchman Mine, supposedly in the Superstition Mountains east of the Salt River Valley. The \"Dutchman\" was really a German immigrant named Jacob Waltz or Walz. He was reportedly born in 1810 in Wurttemberg and died of pneumonia on October 25, 1891 in Phoenix, Arizona. Likely, the report of a mine came about as a result of a dying man's attempt to explain away his \"high grading\" activities. High grading was the practice of hard rock miners taking high grade ore and smuggling it out of the mine in sort-off pre-social security system. Coincidentally, a major gold strike was made in the area at the base of the Superstition Mountains in 1892. There were 50 working mines and millions of dollars in gold was mined. If there was a mine near Weaver's Needle in the Superstition Mountains, then it was likely the one found.More on lost mines later."},
{"title": "Contrast contrasts", "date": "Friday, November 14, 2008", "text": "I recently wrote about the population of Arizona. This post was in contrast to the earlier posts about wilderness. Arizona is quartered by major Interstate Highways, but off of these heavily traveled roads are highways where it is still possible to drive for a long time without seeing another car. On some of Arizona's dirt roads, it is best to be prepared for trouble. If you break down it could be days or longer before someone happens along. As I have learned first hand, your friendly automobile insurance company will not dispatch a tow truck to help you out of being stuck in sand in the middle of a dry river bed. The contrast between six, eight or ten lane freeways and a dirt road is immense. Not just the technology gap, but the whole outlook on life difference. On the freeway, in most metropolitan areas of Arizona, you can get a traffic ticket for driving too slow. On a dirt road, you can get seriously injured by driving too fast, not to mention turning your tires into macrame.As you speed along at 75 mph on the freeway, you can often look off to the side of the road and see a dirt track snaking off into the distance. Here is a quantitative illustration of the difference between the two worlds:Over ten million people per year visit the Grand Canyon.Sonora National Monument (you may never have heard of this one) has only 20,000 visits per year and it has a major freeway going right through it.Coal Mine Canyon has such few visitors that there don't seem to be any records of how many people go there.

{"title": "Wilderness is in the eye of the beholder", "date": "Tuesday, November 11, 2008", "text": "One of the most sublime places is one of the least visited and, for most people, one the least attractive, that is the western deserts of Utah. The area south of the Salt Flats is mostly flat and barren between the low hills and one of my favorite places in the whole world.  In reflecting on the attraction of this area, I decided that it is real wilderness. Except for a few sheep herders, no one seems to have found a use for the area. The United States Government has used it for chemical and biological warfare testing, and accidentally killing herds of sheep in the process, but no one else seems to be able to figure out what to do with the huge empty land.Recently, we have seen an increase in the number of all terrain vehicles and four-wheelers. But the land is so big, that even they have to plan for the distances involved.Almost all of the areas designated as \"Wilderness\" possess extraordinary natural beauty like the Grand Canyon, and other places where people have traveled from around the world to visit. I would guess that virtually no one travels from Europe or Asia to the western desert. There are no bus loads of Japanese tourists, no French and German campers, no car loads of Chinese. There is just miles and miles of solitude and beautiful empty desert. There are animals. In the picture above, if you look closely, you can see mounds of dirt. These are ancient ant hills scattered across the valley floor. From their size, it is obvious that they are thousands of years old. There are also antelope, actually Pronghorns. They run in small herds across the plains at speeds in excess of thirty miles an hour. If you do not know where and how to look, they are almost invisible.Now, what are the chances that some environmentalist group is going to throw themselves in front of the bulldozers to protect this desert. The chances are vanishingly small. Why? Because, for all the hand wringing and angst of the environmentalists, they are only really interested in preserving the outstandingly beautiful parts of the land, the Yellowstones and Yosemites, where there are thousands or millions of visitors. But if you really want to have a wilderness experience, you need to go into the western deserts of the world. Then you can really begin to understand the meaning of the word, wilderness.Now, don't get me wrong, I am certainly in favor of National Parks and Monuments. I certainly recognize the need to \"preserve\" the physically attractive places of the world from dams and development. But, that isn't the same as wilderness. In hiking across the Grand Canyon, I probably passed thousands of people. In driving out into the western desert, we might pass a few cars on the road. Off the road, you may never see another person.More later."},

Ironically, Linton spent the latter part of his long life, ferrying people down the Colorado River at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. His company, Grand Canyon Dories, advertises: \"10,000 Trips, 3,000 Destinations, 126 Countries.\" The Grand Canyon Trip is from 4 to 19 days and costs from $1,735 to $5,267 per person.  See http://whitewater-rafting.gordonsguide.com/grandcanyondories/trips.cfmSo apparently as long as the aberration is willing to pay big bucks, they are welcome in his wilderness. If you don't want to pay that high price for a trip down the river, the current waiting list for private trips has over 8,000 names on it, and the projected wait period is about 15 years. See http://southwestpaddler.com/docs/coloradoaz2.htmlThe Grand Canyon National Park has about five million visitors each year according to the National Park Service. See http://www.grand.canyon.national-park.com/info.htm The description of the regulations about river trips is pages long and as detailed as a legal contract. See http://www.grand.canyon.national-park.com/river.htm Even though you might hate humans, wilderness is a big business in the United States.More to come."},
{"title": "Ah wilderness", "date": "Monday, November 3, 2008", "text": "Jean Jacques Rousseau (1712-1778) one of the major political philosophers of the Enlightenment is often cited as the creator of the noble savage myth. However, the actual phrase came from John Dryden's The Conquest of Granada, a play first performed in 1670. Briefly, the idea of the noble savage is that man, in his natural state, is good and noble and that he has been corrupted by \"civilization.\" The idea of the noble savage is so pervasive in literature that it has become a significant theme. Just as Rousseau saw civilization as corrupt, this same viewpoint has become a dominant theme among those who would preserve the wilderness.The title of this post, \"Ah, Wilderness\" comes from Quatrain XI of Edward Fitzgerald's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. There was also a Broadway Show of the same name by Eugene O'Neill. Neither of which have anything to do with wilderness. Actually, the translation of the Rubaiyat says \"Oh, Wilderness.\"It turns out that there are 704 Wilderness Areas in the United States with over 100 million acres of designated land. According to Wilderness.net, over 12 million people visit wilderness each year. In this context, only Federally designated land that is part of the Wilderness Preservation System under the Wilderness Act of 1964 is considered Wilderness (with a capital W).  4.57% of the United States, an area slightly larger than California, is designated as Wilderness. Assuming the government or any one else can actually count the number of people that visit a Wilderness (how do they know how many times I visited the Superstition Wilderness last year, for example) you can compare that to the attendance at Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom, 17.1 million visitors in 2007. See http://travel.latimes.com/daily-deal-blog/index.php/socal-amusement-park-1492/See also http://www.wilderness.net/index.cfm Wilderness.net Just as a note, I searched this site for a photo of \"Arizona\" and got a picture of the Superstition Mountain from the west. It must be a really old picture because where the photographer is standing is now all subdivisions.Now, back to the noble savage and his connection to the wilderness (with a small w). It reminds me of the time we were sitting around Thunder Falls, at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It was well over 100 degrees in the shade and we were waiting until evening to hike out of the canyon. We had a number of young people with us, including one of my sons, who was under 12. Suddenly, we saw this man run up to the waterfall and start frantically pumping water through a water purifier into a canteen. He was dressed in the best REI attire imaginable down to the expensive hiking shoes. I wandered over to ask him what was going on and he told me that there were a group of people up in the canyon and they had run out of water and he was carrying all the canteens and was going hike back up and rescue them. I pointed out that Thunder River came out of the cliff side about 200 feet away and there was likely no reason to filter the water. He filled the canteens and ran off up the trail. A couple of hours later, the group came stumbling down the trail and literally fell into the creek. They were in terrible shape. Later, when it was cooling off, we left them and began our hike out of the canyon. We had stashed water along the trail on the way in, so we would have enough to make the hike out. On the way out, we reported the unfortunate hikers to the National Park Ranger we met on the trail and he headed their direction.What is the attraction of the wilderness that will put a group of totally unprepared hikers at the bottom of the Grand Canyon in the middle of the summer without adequate water? Why do 12 million people a year think it necessary to hike, camp, ski, and climb in the wilderness every year? Why do I see hikers in flip-flops or with shoes taped with duct tape hiking out of the Grand Canyon? Just as Rousseau, who had probably never talked to a native aboriginal person in his life, romanticized the native existence, so too today in a society that has lost contact with nature and either believes that it should be transformed into a more manageable commodity or preserved out of a nostalgic desire to return to a simpler and less commercialized society. In both cases humankind is viewed as something apart from nature, either separated by our responsibility as custodians or our need to preserve \"wild places\" from the evils of society as a whole. Often, the native indigenous population is seen as an integral part of nature, not exactly human, and therefore also to be preserved in their primeval pristine state. There is an insightful essay on the issue of wilderness sponsored by the Faculty Resource Laboratory at the University of Connecticut. You can read the article by David R. Klein at:http://arcticcircle.uconn.edu/HistoryCulture/wilderness.html Although I do not agree with most of the article's historic analysis, I do agree that only a small minority of the American population ever visits a wilderness or a Wilderness. Klein's statement that \"[t]he act of offering legal protection for wilderness that is far removed from our everyday lives provides salve for our conscience, perhaps in recognition that we have lacked the will to initiate the major governmental and economic restructuring necessary if we are to move toward sustainability of Western society\" is a capsule summary of the  entire wilderness issue.More later"},
{"title": "Thoughts on the illusion of wilderness", "date": "Sunday, November 2, 2008", "text": "The theme of wilderness permeates western civilization and its literature. But the concept of a place devoid of human habitation and untouched by human intervention is a highly charged cultural concept that has little relation to the actual existence of such a place in the real world. Many of the early pioneers from the earliest European settlers along the eastern seaboard and westward across the continent had the concept that the area they were entering was a \"wilderness\" even though it appeared to be inhabited, sometimes heavily, with native American people. Today, it would be difficult, if not impossible to point to an area of the world, other than the continent of Antarctica, that could fall into the classic cultural notion of a wilderness. I have found petroglyphs and other evidence of human habitation in some of the most remote areas in North America, evidence that people have lived in the area for thousands of years.In the United States we have codified our wildernesses into Federally owned enclaves, designated by law. Some of these areas are as heavily visited as an urban mall, but are still \"wilderness\" under the law. One night, I was laying awake in the bottom of Pariah Canyon, a norther Arizona slot canyon and an officially designated \"wilderness area.\" I looked into the dark midnight sky and realized that I was watching a series of airplanes fly over. With a little thought I remembered that the main north/south airline routes between Phoenix and Salt Lake City, led right over the canyon. I thought of my wilderness experience, being days on foot from the nearest commercial outpost, but in reality, only a few thousand feet from people sitting in comfort reading or sleeping or talking on a cross country flight.  The experience shattered the illusion of wilderness, that I could somehow separate myself from the rest of humanity by merely walking into the desert or mountains.In the eastern part of the Mesa/Phoenix Metroplex there is a famous range of mountains which are included in the Superstition Wilderness area. Driving along U.S. 60 going east from Mesa, you can look towards the mountains and see them outlined with a line demarking the edge of the \"wilderness\" next to suburban subdivisions.I frequently read about someone who moves out into the countryside, to experience the solitude and like a recent article in Arizona Highways magazine, living \"off the grid... where the world is more primal and elemental.\" Arizona Highways, November 2008, page 21. But the fact that we are reading about this person in a major magazine, a person who is usually a contributor, indicates that living in the \"wilderness\" is simply part of their job, if you will. They define themselves by living at some distance from commercial services to make a point.Talking about a businessman that just purchased 2.5 million square acres of wilderness in Chile, the news report states: \"Doug is intense, driven, obsessive and self-deprecating. He is a curious fusion of Henry David Thoreau and Charles Lindberg with Martha Stewart's eye for detail. But at his core, he is a deeply committed environmentalist.\" Describing his land the article explains, \"In this isolated region with chronic poverty, Doug is creating his own Utopian world -- a South American Walden Pond where natural splendor is complimented by handcrafted beauty. No detail too small: paths made of stone, fences of twigs, signs hand-carved, public campgrounds immaculate. And nine Hobbit-like cabins for visitors. Pumalin isn't just about preserving wilderness, it is about living in harmony with nature.\"Wilderness including all the modern conveniences. As the article states: \"Suddenly, in this remote mountain valley near the bottom of the earth, we enter a manicured lane way, passing immaculate gardens, glass greenhouses and then, far from everyone and everywhere, a graceful home. This is where Doug Tompkins and his wife, Kristine, live.\"See http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/GlobalWarming/story?id=2931202More about wilderness later."},
{"title": "The rare annual saguaro migration unveiled", "date": "Tuesday, October 28, 2008", "text": "During a recent trip to Payson, up the Beeline Highway, I was privileged to see the annual Saguaro Migration in full swing. This annual event has been totally ignored by everyone from National Geographic to Arizona Highways. It has also yet to be featured on Blue Planet. You will have to excuse the pictures because they were taken at 65 mph on the highway. It is not recommended that you exit your vehicle while the Saguaros are migrating.You can just see the herd in the distance, coming over the hill. It is unusual to see them during daylight hours, but the weather has been very warm into the later part of the year and saguaros take advantage of the warm weather, even during daylight hours.An old male saguaro is running from a pack of carnivorous cholla. The cholla prey on the weaker, smaller saguaros or those who stray from the herd.You can just catch the lead bull saguaro leading the march across the desert.A few juvenile Saguaros approach the highway. Unfortunately, many are killed trying to cross four lanes of traffic. You often see their squished bodies laying on the side of the road with their little roots sticking into the air. You who live in the South can relate by thinking of armadillos only longer and green. Another shot showing a mixed group gathering for a quick dash across the highway. He who hesitates is lost. Some of these fellows appear a little undecided.This is a Saguaro barrier, a futile attempt to protect the migrating herd. You may think it is a crash barrier but that is what they want you to think.Arizona is a land of extremes. But it is very disappointing that the conservationists have been so effective in protecting this species that their annual migration has almost gone unnoticed."},
{"title": "Arizona has flowers besides cactus", "date": "Wednesday, October 22, 2008", "text": "Writing poetry is hard work. Contrary to popular belief, poetry is not simply short lines of prose arranged to look like a \"poem.\" Here is an apparently simple poem by Robert Louis Stevenson:Rain The rain is falling all around,      It falls on field and tree, It rains on the umbrellas here,      And on the ships at sea.[this poem came from A Child's Garden of Verses by Robert Louis Stevenson, as available on Gutenberg.org]I say apparently simple, because no poetry is simple. Let's look at this poem.Stevenson makes a comment that is universal. But he makes his comment in a formal way, using certain conventions that make the thought unique and memorable. It is not the line length or the appearance that makes this into a poem. It is the combination of rhyme, meter, and content. So much of what I see today tries to be poetry by talking about \"poetical\" things. The whole world may be full of poetry, but it must be put into some form of rhyme, meter or content to actually become a poem.Considering Stevenson's poem only from the standpoint of syllabic meter, it is in the form 8 syllables/6 syllables/8 syllables/6 syllables with rhyme on the last syllable of each of the two 6 syllable lines. The first and third lines have 4 iambic feet (tetrameter), that is accent on the second syllable such as -/. The second and fourth lines each have three iambic feet (trimeter). The word \"umbrellas\" is slightly problematical because the preceding stressed syllable falls on the word \"the.\" The poem is constructed with enjambed or run-on lines in which the sense of the poem continues on to the next line without a natural syntactical pause, establishing a strong grammatical pull between the lines known as enjambment. Seehttp://english3.fsu.edu/~mkennedy/poeticform.htm Meegan Kennedy, Department of English, Florida State University.Although the content of the poem appears simple, the thought shows substantial reflection on the universality of human experience and the egalitarian nature of natural phenomenon.The next time you see a \"poem\" in print, think about both the form and content. You may find that much of what is being passed off as poetry isn't poetry at all.  From time to time I will continue to comment on poetry. I believe that if poetry fails so fails the world. Not that I believe that poetry has any saving grace, but that true poetry embodies all that is good and beautiful in the world. An evil world cannot produce true poetry. However, just as pictures can uplift and edify as well as degrade and destroy, so words can be used for evil purposes. True poetry comes from the fullness of the heart and if used for evil, to that extent is no longer poetry."},
{"title": "Back to signs", "date": "Monday, October 13, 2008", "text": "I know this one is pretty silly. But how many of you worry about those labels that say do not remove under penalty of law?I think I can now relate to this poem I have read all my life, especially the sixth stanza:\"You are old, Father William,\" the young man said,\"And your hair has become very white;And yet you incessantly stand on your head -Do you think, at your age, it is right?\" \"In my youth,\" Father William replied to his son,\"I feared it might injure the brain;But now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,Why, I do it again and again.\"  \"You are old,\" said the youth, \"As I mentioned before,And have grown most uncommonly fat;Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door -Pray, what is the reason of that?\" \"In my youth,\" said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\"I kept all my limbs very suppleBy the use of this ointment - one shilling the box -Allow me to sell you a couple?\"  \"You are old,\" said the youth, \"And your jaws are too weakFor anything tougher than suet;Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beakPray, how did you manage to do it?\" \"In my youth,\" said his father, \"I took to the law,And argued each case with my wife;And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw,Has lasted the rest of my life.\"  \"You are old,\" said the youth, \"one would hardly supposeThat your eye was as steady as ever;Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -What has made you so awfully clever?\" \"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\"Said his father; \"don't give yourself airs!Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!\"by Lewis CarrollNow that I am on the subject of signs, I thought I should complement the Arizona State Department of Transportation for dispelling one of my great fears in life. All around the state you see signs that say \"ICE MAY BE PRESENT IN COLD WEATHER.\"  It was always a secret fear of mine that driving through the blazing heat of summer in Arizona, I just might hit a patch of ice and fly off the road. Now courtesy of the AZDOT I no longer have to worry.Dust storms in Arizona can cause serious accidents on the highways. Admittedly, this is a problem and one that all drivers should be aware of. However, there are signs that say \"REDUCE SPEED IN TIMES OF LOW VISIBILITY.\" (There are a few variations). Now, if there is reduced visibility, how am supposed to see the sign? I guess its just supposed to be a reminder, like all those signs that say \"DO NOT CROSS DOUBLE LINE.\" They just make it hard to turn left. Not to mention all of the signs that say, \"DO NOT PASS.\" I guess I break that one every time I pass one of the signs.I was driving down the road and, as usual, reading all the signs. There was a truck in front of me with a large box. Printed on the box were the words, \"USE NO FORKS.\" Now, I have been living for quite a while, and I am pretty much up on the news and such, but I have no idea why there is now a movement in America to ban the use of forks. As a former, and sometimes present, Boy Scout, I have gotten along well with just a knife. However, it is a little hard to eat things like jello, pudding and cold cereal with a knife. I assumed that spoons were invented for that purpose, and although I could probably make due with my fingers, a spoon and knife, forks have seemed to be convenient on occasion. Come to think of it, I really can't think of anything I couldn't eat with my fingers, a spoon and a knife. Maybe they are on to something?"},
{"title": "The Death March", "date": "Sunday, October 5, 2008", "text": "About twenty five years ago we had one of those memorable hikes that has long since passed into legend and has been referred to as the Death March. First of all, and right out of the chute, no one died. This was a Stake Camporee. The organizers, who will remain anonymous to protect the guilty, decided that all of the eight or so Scout Troops should have a real hiking experience. Since the hike was planned for November, they decided to hike to Charlebois Spring, probably named for a cattleman named Lou Charlebois who was the President of the Arizona Cattlemen's Association, deep in the Superstition Wilderness area, just east of Apache Junction, Arizona.http://archimede.mat.ulaval.ca/pages/morin/charlebois.web/RR01/RR01_003.HTMIf you want more information, do a search on Charlebois Spring and you will find hundreds of references. Others claim that the Spring was named after Joseph Fernando Charlebois.See http://genforum.genealogy.com/charlebois/messages/83.htmlBut as my son Jared would say, I digress. Now, depending on the reference it is anywhere from 6 to 8 from any access road. It just so happened that very few of these potential Scout hikers had actually walked that far in their lifetimes, especially not in Superstition Mountains. It also happened, as is possible at any time in the desert, that the temperature during the day was about 95 degrees. Unfortunately, they set the time for departure about 4:00 in the afternoon, guaranteeing that most of the participants would have to hike in the dark. (This is the tie-in to my previous post). If you do go looking for pictures of Charlebois Spring, you will note that most of the people in the pictures are wearing coats. This is not because they are crazy, it is because no one, in their right mind, would go hiking out into the middle of the Superstitions if the temperature is not down in the low 70s or 60s, with night time temperatures in the 40s or below.At this time, my sons were not old enough to be in Scouting, and I had little contact with the Scouting program. (Of course this changed dramatically and I have spent the last twenty years or so in Scouting). We left later than the rest of the Scouts and their leaders. I remember that there were three or four of us hiking in together. I went along, essentially, for the ride.We hiked in from the west end at the First Water Trailhead following the Peralta Trail.  Keeping to the right (south) we got to the junction with the Boulder Canyon trail (if you follow this trail you go past Weaver's Needle and then to the northwest side of the Fremont Saddle). At this point the trail follows a wash for a ways and it is difficult to tell where the trail splits off so, of course, we missed the Peralta Trail. I figured out that we weren't on the right trail after a few minutes. We circled back in a large circle until I found the trail part way up a hill. Now, to understand this story, you have to realize that circling back to find a trail in the Superstitions isn't not very straight forward. You can never tell if you are going to run into a canyon or a cliff or something and you have to avoid cactus and catclaw.It was starting to get dark when we were moving down the Peralta and soon it got really dark. I didn't have much of a light and I don't use a flashlight unless it is absolutely necessary, so I just kept moving. When we got to the main group, it was about 8:30 or so and the scene looked like that part of Gone with the Wind where all the wounded soldiers are laying all over the ground. It was pretty grim. A lot of people were injured and had blisters or back problems or whatever. They were spread along the trail for a couple of hundred yards, since there really isn't a clearing or anything to camp in large enough for Scout Troops. Some of the Troops never made it to the gathering area and just camped along the trail.I went to sleep and in the morning it was even worse. The area of the Spring is pretty, especially with 100 or so Scouts running around. I worked on filling my water bottles with my filter pump. There was plenty of water. Those in charge decided that they had made a mistake and told everyone to just leave. They had a bunch of activities planned but all of them seemed irrelevant given the condition of the leaders and Scouts.  We started hiking out the Peralta towards the Peralta Trailhead. We were supposed to have people come and pick us up about 4:00 in the afternoon. This was pre-cell phone and so we had no way to coordinate the pickup time with the rides who were coming. I walked out by Bluff Spring and still had most of my water. Bad decision, I should have filled up there. Making the climb over the ridge by Miner's Needle, the Scouts and leaders started to run out of water. I found some to filter, but my filter clogged up. I have given away most of my water and so I decided I better get out so I could be of some help to the rest on the trail. I was like the second or third person out, but there is no water at the Peralta Trailhead so I begged water off of people leaving in their cars. Finally, someone gave me a two gallon jug full, so I drank the whole thing and started back up the trail with one other leader. We found people all along the trail so we passed everyone to find out who was in the back of the group. We found a couple of leaders in really bad shape, almost passing out from the heat and dehydration. We gave them some water, took their packs and made them keep moving. I literally had to push my guy down the trail. We finally all got out.When I got home, I found out I had lost six pounds of water in one day. Some of the Troops didn't get back until late that Saturday night after being lost all day. It was interesting."},
{"title": "Things that go blink in the night", "date": "Wednesday, October 1, 2008", "text": "Thinking about walking around in the dark reminded me of other dark related incidents in my, now dim, past. Our Scout troop would camp at various locations around the state, most of which, at the time, were moderately inaccessible. We camped for almost a week in a campground back into the canyon above where West Clear Creek now crosses Highway 260, which at the time was mostly a dirt road.One night on this West Clear Creek camp, we were out running around in the dark making noise and probably playing capture the flag, when we saw a light a short distance away. Suddenly, we all stopped and stared at this rather unusual event. We ran towards the light to see if we could find the source and soon discovered that it was in a large bush. We shined our flashlights into the bush and the light disappeared. After a rather long discussion, we chocked the whole thing up to some hitherto unexplained natural phenomena, when the light appeared again a little ways off. At this point we had to decide whether to start being afraid or what. But the light disappeared and we finally all went to bed in our sleeping bags.Many years later,  for a short time, I lived along the Ohio River in Kentucky. This was my first introduction, as an adult, to the middle part of the United States. One of the things I saw for the first time were fireflies. It immediately occured to me that what had so mystified a bunch of Scouts from Arizona was nothing more than a lone firefly. I now know that fireflies are very uncommon, but not unknown, in Arizona. But it doesn't take that much to freak out a bunch of Scouts in the middle of the night."},
{"title": "Hiking in the dark", "date": "Saturday, September 27, 2008", "text": "Sometimes I end up walking, misjudging the distance, and the hike turns into a night hike without planning for one. Occasionally we have planned to walk in the dark. When I was young, living in a small town, the electricity would go off regularly. Sometimes we would be sitting in the movie theater when the lights went out and the movie came to a grinding halt. We would all sit there and clap and yell, but eventually the novelty would wear off and we would file out and walk home. I had to walk up a long hill and it is amazing how dark it is outside with little or no ambient light.  The only way I could make sure I didn't fall in a ditch, was to walk with one foot on the pavement and one foot off on the side of the road. It was so dark I really couldn't see my feet.Maybe it was the darkness of the Colorado Plateau that made me unafraid of the dark and let me know that if you keep walking you will eventually get home or fall into or bump into something. It didn't really matter what happened. One of the more memorable dark night episodes occurred at the Dugway Proving Ground in the salt desert of Utah. At the time, I was being trained as an Army Ranger and I guess they thought it might be a good idea for us to wander around in the dark for a while, just in case we ever had to fight in the dark or anything. So they loaded us all up and trucked us out to the salt desert. It is dark out there at night and I would assume that they chose a night when the moon was supposed to come up pretty late. We were put in teams of two or three and given a compass bearing and a distance. We were supposed to find the next compass bearing and distance at the destination.We took off in the direction we were supposed to go, walking out across the almost flat and very empty desert. When we had gone the distance, we found the next set of directions, but there was one small problem, back in those pre-digital days, it was too dark to see the directions, or see our compass or even tell what time it was. Every team had a different goal so we weren't all standing around in a group, but we could hear for miles and everybody was having a similar experience. We were on a tiny little hill, mostly just a rise in the ground, and couldn't see a thing. We could barely make out our hands in front of our faces. Looking to the East, I could see a glow on the horizon. I figured if we waited long enough, they would get tired of waiting for us or moon would come up and we would be able to read everything. It is quite interesting standing in the middle of an almost flat desert waiting for the moon to rise. It is amazing how slow the earth turns.You can probably guess that the moon came up, or I probably wouldn't be telling this story. I can't remember what happened exactly, but I think the organizers got tired of waiting for everyone about 1:00 or 2:00 am and turned on a light and we all walked towards the light, got in our trucks and road back to the base. This must have been some sort-of standard Army experience because from time to time over the years I was in the Army, they would haul us out into the (fill in the blank) and let us try to find our way to (fill in another blank). The novelty of these experiences didn't last long, because before I was in the Army, I had already spent a considerable amount of time wandering around in the desert in the middle of the night. One time, we even swam across Saguaro Lake in the middle of the night. This is not an endorsement for doing things that aren't too bright, in the middle of the night in the desert, but it does cause me to think.Usually, I start to think about these experiences when I read about someone who wanders away from a camp and gets lost.  I could never figure this out. If it were daytime, you can see for miles in the desert and it would be hard to walk far enough so that you couldn't see where you started. Even in the night, there are few clouds and you can almost always see some kind of star which instantly tells you the direction. Even if you can only see a few stars, if you wait a while you can see them move and tell the major cardinal directions.  Anyway, the wind always blows from the same direction in the Arizona and Utah at the same time of the year, so even if you can't see anything, if you can feel the wind you know what the directions are. If directions are important that is. It seems like from the time I was young, I had a map of Arizona and Utah in my head and I always knew exactly (or pretty close anyway) where I was.One time I got disoriented in the middle of the night at Camp Geronimo, near Pine, Arizona. I was walking back to my camp and thought to take a short cut over a hill. When I got over the hill, I didn't know if I had come out above or below my campsite. I walked into another campsite and asked them the number of their site, which, by the way, none of them knew, and finally got an answer and immediately turned and walked to my own campsite.OK, back to being lost. When I was in the Army in Kentucky and Washington state, I finally realized that with all those trees and bushes, if you got disoriented, it could take a while to find some way to see the sky or anything else for that matter. At least, I could now sympathize with some of the people that got lost.One of my memorable night hikes was into the Superstition Mountains with a full moon. It was bright enough that we didn't need flashlights and I mostly remember walking through the huge cholla forests, it was like being on another planet. It is interesting but I can remember almost every foot of every trail I have ever hiked. (What a burden!!)"},
{"title": "Relative Risk v. Perceived Risk", "date": "Friday, September 26, 2008", "text": "I am still thinking about the idea of relative v. perceived risk. Many outdoor activities are viewed as risky. For example, downhill skiing appears to have a higher risk factor than walking in a city park. However, depending on the time of day and the location of the park, the walk in the park might be much more of a risk that skiing. There are some activities which, by their nature, are high risk activities. For example, free climbing without protection, is more hazardes than with protection. My issue with the Scouting Magazine article for October, 2008 \"Don't get sick on the trail\" is the use of an unexplained statistic to increase the reader's perceived risk of an otherwise safe activity. It seems to me that ultimately, the real measure of any activity's risk is the mortality rate per number of participants. The use of mortality rates eliminates the issue that in a rather benign activity, like hiking, the injuries are likely to be minor, whereas a crash in bobsled could be a lot more serious.Authors  Richard J Zeckhauser and W. Kip Viscusi  give the following observation:\"Society's system for managing risks to life and limb is deeply flawed. We overreact to some risks and virtually ignor others.  Often too much wight is placed on risks of low probability but high salience  (such  as those posed by trace carcinogens or terrorist action); risks of commission rather than omission; and risks, scuh as those associated with frontier technologies, whose magnitue is difficult to estimate.  Too little effort is spent ameliorating voluntary risks, such as those involving automobiles and diet. When the bearers of risk do not share in the costs of reduction, moreover, extravagance is likely. \"  See Simon, Julian Lincoln. The State of Humanity. Oxford, UK: Blackwell in association with the Cato Institute, 1995.It is interesting to note the following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Mortality Data (See http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/otheract/injury/injury_mortality.htm ):\"In 2002, the 10 leading causes of death were (in rank order) Diseases of heart; Malignant neoplasms; Cerebrovascular diseases; Chronic lower respiratory diseases; Accidents (unintentional injuries); Diabetes mellitus; Influenza and pneumonia; Alzheimer’s disease; Nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis; and Septicemia and accounted for about 79 percent of all deaths occurring in the United States.\"The CDCP indicates that in 2002, accidents comprised only 4.4% of all deaths in the U.S. However, the death rate for males between the ages of the 10 and 40 is as high as 50% from accidents. Essentially, what that means is that young men are not likely to die of anything else.Perhaps, it would be a good idea to weigh the benefits of walking and hiking as compared to the risks of heart disease. When obesity is a national epidemic, it not appropriate to give overemphasis to the risks involved in walking around in the sunshine."},
{"title": "Relative Risk", "date": "Thursday, September 25, 2008", "text": "Some further thoughts on the relative risk in outdoor activities. The list of activities in the study include the following:Boats, Bobsleds, Camping equipment, Climbing, mountain, Exercise (hiking), Fishing, Horseback riding, Ice/snow boating, Jet skis, Mountain bikes, Scuba diving, Sleds, Skydiving/hang gliding, Snow disks, Snow skiing, Snowmobiles, Snowboarding, Surfing, Swimming, Toboggans, Water skisI find this list to be an interesting selection. First of all, what is the real difference between sleds, toboggans and snow disks? Why include mountain bikes but not other bikes, like road bikes? How many people are injured by fishing? If boats are a different category than fishing, does fishing only include those who are injured while fishing and not in a boat? Why are boats a category when ATVs and off-road vehicles, including motorcycles, are not? Why is swimming an outdoor activity but golfing is not?The study says that it is focusing on the interaction with the natural environment. What about motocross? It is evident that the assumptions of the study eliminate a lot of inherently dangerous activities and include some, like bobsleding, that very, very few people are ever going to do in their lifetimes.This got me thinking about risk factors in general. Over the years we have known quite a few young people that have been killed in automobile accidents, in some case, because of not wearing a seat belt. Overall I know a lot of people who have been killed in automobile accidents. I also know a significant number of people who have been killed in airplane accidents. I also know a number of people, mostly men, who have been seriously injured on ATVs. I also personally know a number of people who have been seriously injured riding road bikes. The question here is, which of these activities are perceived as dangerous but are not and which activities are perceived as \"safe\" and are really dangerous?More later."},
{"title": "Hiking the third most dangerous outdoor activity", "date": "Wednesday, September 24, 2008", "text": "I was reading in the Scouting magazine for October, 2008 and the author of an article called \"Don't get sick on the trail\" cited a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study listing hiking as the third most dangerous outdoor activity. Not being very impressed with statistics, I looked up the original story. Here it is:http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2008/r080610.htmThe CDC news release had an expired link to the Wilderness Medical Society in Salt Lake City, Utah.http://www.wms.org/After a bit of searching I found the following report: Flores AH, Haileyesus T, Greenspan AI.  National    estimates of outdoor recreational injuries treated in    emergency departments, United States, 2004-2005. Wilderness Environ Medicine. 2008;19:91-98. Unfortunately, that link was also broken, but I did find the original report at:http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/E-News/2008/06-12-2008.doc.Snowboarding, sledding, and hiking were associated with the highest number of injuries requiring emergency department visits.  More than two-thirds of patients treated for outdoor-related injuries were male, with the greatest number of injuries affecting young men ages ten to 35. Half of all injuries treated were fractures, strains and sprains, and most injuries involved the head and neck or limbs.  6.5% of all outdoor injuries in the study were diagnosed as traumatic brain injury, or TBI- a serious injury that helmets, when used appropriately, can help prevent.         The report also noted:Skiing was the most common of the activities in the “other” category- more than half of the injuries classified as “other” were skiing-related.Some of the observations of the study made me wish someone would pay me to do this kind of study, such as \"Falling while moving at a relatively fast speed increases someone’s likelihood of being injured if they fall.\" That would never have occurred to me. Actually, what would never have occurred to me is that someone would pay me to say that. Anyway, back to the study.This may be a valid study, but it occurs to me that they are comparing a lot of very dissimilar activities. I would just guess that many more people go hiking each year than go snowboarding. It is probably easy to guess that there will be more injuries from hiking than from some other types of activities, such as bungee jumping or sky diving. But the absolute number of injuries is meaningless, unless there is an adjustment for the number of people participating in the activity.I finally did find the entire report at:http://www.wemjournal.org/pdfserv/i1080-6032-019-02-0091.pdfThe Study notes that 29.8 million people participated in hiking in 2004. What is more important, the overall rate of injury, including very high risk groups, was 4.6 injuries per 100,000. That means that out of 100,000 people participating in hiking only less than five of them will be injured at any given time. Compare this with a FATALITY rate of 13.61 per 100,000 of population for motor vehicle accidents.  You can see the statistics athttp://www-fars.nhtsa.dot.gov/Main/index.aspxYou are more than three times more likely to die from a motor vehicle accident than you are to be injured while hiking. This doesn't diminish the need to be careful while in the outdoors but it would be nice sometime if the people writing articles for magazines wouldn't use statistics as propaganda.It seems to be a lot safer to hike around in the desert than it is to drive there on the freeway."},

I got up and went into the bathroom and realized that my hands were itching. Within a couple of minutes I began to feel like my lips were tingling and my throat was closing up. Since this was not exactly normal, I decided we needed to do something drastic, like go to the hospital. We went to the emergency room and, for a change, were quickly admitted. After a few minutes doctors started interviewing me. One of them shined a light in my eyes and ask me to follow it back and forth from right to left. Strangely enough, I couldn't do that. My eyes were jerking and wouldn't track. The doctor announced that I had been stung by a scorpion and immediately ordered and IV with pure benadryl. Within a few seconds, it was like there was ice water in my blood and the feeling started at my feet and then worked its way up to my head. That ended the scorpion sting effects.They kept me in the hospital for an hour or so and then sent me home. They said I would probably sleep for most of the day. But, that isn't what happened. I don't get sleepy with benadryl.Anyway, that was the official start of the Scorpion Wars. Our old house had tons of bugs for many years. Then all the bugs disappeared and we got scorpions. We mostly fight them with sticky glue board traps that work really well. When we moved to our new house, we inherited a huge supply of scorpions. We have killed more than twenty in one evening. We now fight them with glue boards, diotomaceous earth, and a black light. We have sprayed around the house, mostly to kill the bugs scorpions eat. They don't seem to be bothered with any of the commercial spray poisons out there. We can still get two or three in one night. There seems to be a never ending supply.Tune in for Episode Two"},

It is only through pure self restraint that I could be kept from starting some of these non-fiction classics, not mention some of great historical accounts begging to begin:A Brief History of Okra       The ultimate theory of everything green in the universe.Godel, Escher, Okra       Only through the meta-okra can we begin to understand the true essence of okra.The Stillness at Okra       The end of the Great Okra War finally has a voice.Okra's Seed       The origin of the five okra societies in America.I couldn't resist one last work, the musical:Okrahoma       A poor okra farmer struggles to make a living singing on Broadway.Wait, wait, I almost forgot, that terribly popular TV show:OKRAA short time ago I noticed a plant growing in our raised garden. It looked like some kind if squash and since it is still hot outside, I figured I would let it grow and see if we could finally get some squash. I am so busy that it was some time before I looked closely at the garden again. The plant had grown appreciably but now looked more like some kind of sunflower. I couldn't image how a sunflower got planted but I decided to let it grow and flower.My next observation of the garden showed that that plant was almost five feet tall and still growing. The stem was about an inch thick. Finally a few days later, my wife came in one morning and said that the plant was growing chiles. I went out and there was a huge long pointed vegetable. It was definitely an okra. Now, there is a remote possibility that I somehow planted a sunflower seed. But there is no possibility that I planted an okra plant. Here are some pictures of our volunteer okra. We actually have two plants."},
{"title": "Pariah Canyon", "date": "Tuesday, September 16, 2008", "text": "Coming out of Pariah, after following the river for nearly forty miles, the canyon widens. The trail leaves the river and starts to cut the meanders. The good news is the trail may actually be shorter by doing this, the bad news is the trail leads into huge sand dunes. As you walk in the brilliant sun, you suddenly realize why Navajo, Hopi and Zuni jewelry uses turquoise, jet, coral and mother of pearl. The sky is turquoise, the canyon walls are coral, the shadows are jet and the clouds are mother of pearl. Unfortunately, this insight is not helpful in climbing the huge hills of sand. As the trail crosses the flat canyon floor, you keep looking hoping that the trail goes around the hills. You keep saying to yourself, \"The trail can't go up that hill,\" \"The trail can't go up that hill.\" It does go up the hill. The struggle is whether the sand is worse than the heat or whether the heat is worse than the sand.        Time doesn't erase the feeling of climbing sand dunes. That feeling is part of the intense feeling of strangeness you feel at the bottom of the Colorado Plateau canyons, especially at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. The canyon world is so restricted and yet expansive at the same time, that it is like coming home after a long absence, like a half remembered dream or the smell of dinner when you were young. It is the essence of existence in the light and shade of canyon floor that carries you through all those days when the canyon is only a faint memory. Once there, you never really forget. The canyon is in your soul. There have to be canyons in heaven."},
{"title": "Not what you might expect", "date": "Monday, September 15, 2008", "text": "Living in the desert, sometimes you have to learn to rely on what it on hand to survive. One day years ago, my father decided to show us a development his company was doing down on the Mexican border. The farming operation turned out to be about 10 miles north of Mexico and about 60 miles from the nearest paved road. Driving back out to the highway in our Rambler Ambassador Stationwagon, my father hit a huge rock and knocked a good sized hole in the gas tank. Instead of becoming vulture bait, he grabbed a bar of soap, jumped out of the car and rubbed the soap on the hole in the tank. Miraculously, within a few seconds the gas stopped leaking and we drove out to the highway and home.        We drove that car for months and months with the hole in the gas tank. Every once in a while, we would get out and put a little more soap on the hole. I think we finally sold the car.        Many years later, after I was married with lots of little children, I drove off the pavement in a camp ground and hit a rock in our Suburban. Same problem, hole in the gas tank. When I finally realized that gas was running out onto the ground I yelled for my wife to grab a bar of soap. She thought I had lost my mind and thought I was going to run over to the water faucet and wash my hands or something. But she got the soap and in a few seconds, like magic, the leak stopped and we were able to drive home.        Good thing we were all raised in the desert."},
{"title": "Storms in the desert", "date": "Tuesday, September 2, 2008", "text": "When I was younger, we spent our summers out on the Colorado Plateau, in a small town just north of Arizona's White Mountains. To the south, I had a clear view, across the miles of desert, of the mountains, about thirty miles away. Each day, beginning around the first of July, the clouds would start to build in huge mounds over the mountains. As the day wore on, the clouds would climb higher and higher in the sky, and start to move north out over the relatively flat plateau. As the days progressed and the moisture came up from the Gulf of California across Mexico, the clouds would grow larger and eventually, small thunderstorms would break loose and wander northward.      This was the time for us to jump into action. We could see the small thunder storms moving slowly across the plateau and we could tell approximately where the rain was falling. We would jump in the car and drive out towards the rainstorm, until we found a dirt road leading to where the rain was falling. We would race across the desert on the dirt roads, until we found a spot where it was raining. Then we would pile out of the car and dance around in the rain. As soon as the storm moved on, we would start all over again, trying to find the rain.      Years later, when I was living in Panama, I would still go outside to watch the rain, which caused a lot of people to question my sanity. Even today, if I could drive to a rainstorm I would do it, just to see water fall out of the sky. My father told me a story about a farmer in northern Arizona who was packing his car one day. A neighbor stopped and asked if he were going on a trip. The farmer said yep, he was going to take his son back east. The neighbor asked why he was going to do something like that. In reply the farmer said, Well, I saw rain once, but my boy is almost 17 and I thought he ought to see some rain before he goes to college."},
{"title": "Oolitic Sand Page Three", "date": "Wednesday, July 16, 2008", "text": "I have been thinking about old things, like sand. Most sands are made of quartz and feldspar. Since quartz has a Mohs Scale hardness of seven and feldspar is six, sand is very durable. http://science.jrank.org/pages/4394/Mohs-Scale Its fortunate that geologic forces weld sand into rock and melt sand into metamorphic rocks, or the whole world might end up being just sand and water. Most people outside of Arizona, think that the whole state is nothing but sand and cactus (except for one large canyon that will not be named). Surprisingly, they are right. It is all sand. Just kidding. Ironically, the most popular sand dune site in Arizona is in California, just across the state line from Yuma. The most extensive sand deposits are in the northeast corner of the state, high up on the Colorado Plateau. The sand there is multicolored. http://geology.utah.gov/online/pdf/pi-77.pdf   The color comes from the different levels of iron oxides. One of the strangest sand formations are sometimes called Moki Marbles. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concretion  They are concretions formed from sand and hematite (crystalized iron oxide). It is not unusual to find rounded pieces of sandstone in small pockets in the rock where they are rolled around by the wind. The larger and darker hematite concretions are formed in the sandstone rocks and weather out as the sandstone erodes away. I guess the challenge is to find something as unique as a hematite concretion and leave it where it was found. I am used to seeing them sold by the bucket full at mineral shows. They run about $5 a pound. They are probably happier sitting out in the rain and wind, than gathering dust in someone’s garage or at the bottom of a drawer. Hematite is the state mineral of Alabama and has been since 1967.  If you have to have a favorite, my favorite sand in oolitic. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oolite It is found outside of Arizona, along the shore of the Great Salt Lake in Northern Utah. The most accessible deposit is along the beach, just west of the causeway to Antelope Island and on Stansbury Island. http://geology.utah.gov/utahgeo/rockmineral/collecting/oolitic.htm   Usually, even if I am tempted to pick up a rock now and then, like at the bottom of the unnamed canyon, I am seldom tempted to pick up sand. Unfortunately, I end up with a certain collection of sand at the end of any trip out into northern Arizona.   If understatement is a virtue, then the Grand Canyon is the most virtuous of canyons. Some of the Arizona place names come from Spanish. It sounds much more romantic or something to English speakers to have a name in Spanish rather than the same mundane name in English. El cañon grande del rio colorado, sounds a lot more exotic than the big canyon of the red river. Even the attraction of having the name in Spanish is lost when it is Anglecised. But, like I was saying, “grand” hardly says it. Laying in the bottom of the canyon, in August, of all months, when it is 98 degrees at 6:00 in the morning, looking up through the layers and layers rock to the brilliant night sky and counting the meteors from the Perseids. The music of the Tapeats Creek and the oppressively calm hot air fade in the distraction of the sky. It is not surprising that a significant number of place names in Arizona come from Spanish, since most of the whole area was part of Mexico until 1848 and the rest was purchased in 1853. What is surprising is the all of the Spanish street names in Phoenix and the surrounding area, especially Scottsdale. It seems like almost every street is a “calle” this or a “calle” that. Some of the names should have been translated first, but come to think about it, maybe they were. It is strange that some of the names don’t even mean anything in Spanish, they just use Spanish sounding words."},
{"title": "Walking Arizona Page One", "date": "Saturday, July 12, 2008", "text": "The rocks are a polished mosaic of subtle reds and browns, a carefully fitted,  infinitely patient jigsaw puzzle covering the ground as far as I can see. Each unique rock blends into a stoically patient crowd and becomes a foundation for the wind. The wind that never truly stops blowing. Only by degrees it seems less evident. I can hear the wind in my ears. It is a sound peculiar to the plateau. I can hear no human sounds, only the sputtering, stuttering wind. It almost dies and then comes back, shuffling and sliding by, blowing my hair and drying my skin. The wind shapes everything from the short stuffy curve of the salt cedars to the perpetual bend in the grass and weeds. No need for a compass, every plant tells the direction of the wind.  The wind talks to me. It tells me stories of time past time and when there was no time. It talks to the rocks with the voice of grass. It talks to the cliffs with the voice of longing for days of sun, blinding and fierce. It talks of nights with stars like searchlights, lighting the soul of the fugitive from the sun. It tells of jasper and quartz. It moans of sandstone and limestone. It weeps of granite and basalt. It cries of clay and sand, of mud sticking to your boots and drying hard as the rock. Sometimes the wind isn’t my friend, its voice is no comfort. It talks of thirst and dryness.   The land is always my friend. Trees that are bushes are my companions. Cactus, yucca and agaves are my guideposts. Lizards doing pushups on the rocks are my audience. I walk without a sound. Silently gliding across the powder-fine dust, breaking the pattern of the rocks with every step. This is a good place to wear a hat. The land is deceptively featureless. From a distance it looks like a blue and gray backdrop, as I walk, it becomes an endless maize of cliffs and canyons. Men build roads straight--out of defiance and for convenience. Nothing is convenient on the plateau.   The clay hills curve and twist. Their loads of rocks gather in piles in the gullies at their base. The hills have a crust, like French bread. As I climb, my feet break through the crust and sink deep into the soft centers of the hills. On the ridges are petrified trees sticking out of the clay like gravestones for a wetter world. The washes form a fractal world zooming out to a satellite view and then in again to the smallest crack and crevice, a highway for ants.  Ants and flies abide. When we take the garbage to the dump thousands of their relatives and friends gather for the viewing. Uninvited, we take some of them with us, opening the windows and driving fast to let the last of them return home. I am certain that anthills live forever. Absent some cataclysmic movement of the crust of the earth, the anthill will be there to greet the Millennium. Ants and flies don’t talk to me at all. The flies become sticky and fly in your eyes and nose just before a storm.   It does rain. The landforms testify of the rain. But even Noah’s flood wouldn’t be enough to keep the land from looking dry. It seems dry even when it is raining. The wind shifts from the south and the islands of clouds send down their veils of moisture. I think it is funny how the people pray for moisture, instead of rain. Its as if God would be offended if we asked for good old honest rain. We need moisture, they pray. I suppose they don’t want to leave out snow, hail and sleet. I must have been born praying for rain. In Panama the people thought I was crazy to go outside and watch the rain. You never get over living in the desert.  When the storm comes, I go outside in my geezer shoes and watch the wind blow the trees. They dance infinite patterns. I keep waiting for the gust that will break the branches but it almost never comes. When it does come, it is dark and we have to run and get saws and ropes to save the fence and house. Dust outlines the wind pattern and races the leaves down the street. Nobody else is watching the wind.  When I was very young, the car stopped and I ran for the cinder hill. I kept running until I reached the top. I had a grandstand seat for the clouds and the lightning. The wind blew and told me of the rain. The land whispered its history of fire and molten rock. I felt, without understanding, the primal forces lifting rock thousands of feet into the air. There were no houses, no cars, except my father’s, nothing but the sky, the clouds and the lightning. In one sharp impression the world became part of my soul. The plateau wind in my ears would always speak to me. I ran down the hill and I was old.  I lay on my back in the dark, looking up through the cliffs to the sky highway. The ground is warm, still reflecting the sun. The night noises echo against the rocks. There is no color, no red and ocher. No mauve and beige. No manganese stains on the rocks. The sky is black and clear, the stars are on the sky highway and move slowly. I can feel the earth turn. I can almost feel it rushing through space around the sun. An airplane passes over and I imagine the people tired, trying to sleep in their uncomfortable seats while I am on the soft earth, in the wilderness only a few thousand feet and many days from their civilization.  I step off into the ice cold water. My sandals catch the current and I slide forward, carefully stepping on the sand and rocks, using my stick to remain upright. The cold water bites into my legs. I know that soon it will not seem cold, but I am happy to reach the dry sand. Within a few steps, my feet are coated with sand. I flip my sandals, shooting wet sand all around.  The sun is hot. The tops of my feet begin to dry but the sand is still under my feet rubbing against the soles of sandals. The second time, the water feels good. It washes away the sand and cools my feet. A rock stays. Caught by my foot and the sandal. I stoop to pick it loose. I think I should have worn my boots but then I remember to lift my foot away from the sandal and let the water remove the rocks. A few more steps and I forget sandals and sand and rocks, I begin to see the trees, the birds and the canyon walls. I see the giant saguaro, on the cliffs above the trees, standing guard, never coming close to the water, as if afraid of the grass and trees.  Big fires are big news, but when the fire dies, the black trees and black earth gather no interviews. No one is there to watch once the flames and color die. I step into the ash and it coats my boots with black against brown and red. The dead trees lie like pick-up-sticks, in a random pile. There is supposed to be a trail somewhere in this tangle. But I am high off the ground, stepping from tree to tree, hoping that they do not shift and dump me to the ground. The edge of the Rim is steep and the piles have shifted downhill blocking the turns in the trail. Suddenly, the trail appears and I float through an eddy of green shade and flowers. Fires are untidy, they leave patches of trees untouched. The older burn scars are a tangle of weeds and brush, exposed to the brilliant sun. I am in the cool shade of the trees.The wind blusters through the juniper bushes on the high plateau. The ground is rough with small blackened ridges. I am careful not to step on the blackened soil because it is alive. It is one of the oldest living things in the world, cyanobacteria or blue-green algae. Its ancestors’ fossils date back over 3.5 billion years. The ridges are formed by the sticky, mucilaginous sheaths of the bacterial filaments. The soil is commonly called crypto (from the Greek word for hidden) and gamic (marriage or to marry). There are a number of names for the soil. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil_crust and http://www.xmlgadgets.com/home.pl?site=mwikt&query=cryptogamic   One step can destroy a crust that may take hundreds of years to rebuild. The fragile nature of the soil crust reminds me of a story, now folklore, about a scientist who cut down a bristlecone pine tree (Pinaceae Pinus Balfourianae) to find out how old it was. http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/08/23/SC72173.DTL  Some of these trees may have been alive for 5000 years and are considered the oldest single living organism. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristlecone_pine The operative word here is single. It seems that the age of these trees is emphasized by the record they keep. They are old, but they are only recognized as old because they keep a record. It may be that the cryptogamic soils or creosote bushes (Larrea tridentataor) aspen trees (Populus tremuloides) are older, but it is only the methodical yearly tree rings that can prove the age of the bristlecone pines. Walking through stands of creosote you can speculate on its age, http://www.lucernevalley.net/creosote/photo_tour.htm  but I wonder how many other, less attractive and less obvious plants there are in the world that may be older? http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ww0601.htm#oldest Maybe the bristlecone pines only have the best publicity agents? Maybe, on the other hand, we should all walk a little more carefully and respect our elders?  Now, the trail leads upward like a snake coiling around a staff, winding up through the rocks and trees until the trees lose to the trail and the rocks win. At the edge of the tree line, the ancient bristlecone pines stand like solitary picket soldiers. The view is worth the climb and the trees have always had the view. If we sit and listen, we can hear their story.  I always carry more food than I need. The first days of walking kill my appetite to the same degree that they increases my thirst. Juice, soup, anything with water, anything with salt. Walking from water to sand, from sand to rock, from rock to water or sand, the first days are like battling upstream, pushing against the current. The sun stands still overhead. Slowly, as the hours pass, I focus on my feet, on the creaking of my pack and the rocks, sand and water start to flow around me. I feel like I am swept along in the stream. The rocks begin to live. They bend and sway with each step as the world collapses into the next step and the next. The whole world is nothing more than one more step on the trail of existence. Time is no more and eternity stretches from one bend of the stream to the next, and the next.   I try to imagine how long it took the stream to cut through all that rock. Why do the rocks remain? Is this big rock in the trail more resilient than its brothers and sisters? Why did the trailmakers go straight to the rock, just so the trail could wind around and break my pace? I think about the difference between sandstone and granite, between rhyolite and tuff, between basalt and conglomerate. I walk without hope towards the sand hill, repeating over and over, it can’t be that high, it can’t be that high. Halfway up, I wish for granite, for sandstone, for anything other than sand. Maybe, the trail doesn’t really go up here through the sand, maybe we missed the trail and we will have walk all the way back. How long does it take to turn sandstone into sand and back into sandstone?"}
