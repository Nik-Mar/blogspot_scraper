{"title": null, "date": "Wednesday, December 20, 2023", "text": "6 years ago this is where I was.  It was a wonderful day.Today too is wonderful.  So many changes have happened.  I’m on track to retire in 9-10 months. Currently saving $500 per week to add to the retirement plan.  I don’t know if I will end my employment then, but I can if I want. My work has been thrown into complete chaos.  Not terrible but definitely not a great environment.  My coworker has a new boss. The new boss is a useless fool. The fool keeps busy by micromanaging to the point of ridiculous.  They try that with me too.  When I tell them “I can’t get anything done because you keep asking what I’m getting done every 30 minutes”. I get a duhh face. Then I have to explain what I’ve already explained 30 minutes ago. Repeat 5 times a day!  I’ve had 3 toddlers so I’ve dealt with this before!I just smile and keep it simple.  Seems to work.Some huge life changes since I blogged last. My nest is empty. Kid 3 was added to a team a few hours away. Scramble to set up classes and living away. I was not prepared to say the least. I miss him horribly.  But a couple months and he will be back.  Now we have xmas together and I love it.  Grocery bill is 1/3 of what it used to be.  The man and I reached the brink.  He is in weekly counselling since the end of September.  I saw a therapist too. I’m not going back for now.  She said when I feel I’m ready to address trauma that I had as a child and young woman it would help, but I’m not ready.  What I do know is I will not put up with his behaviour for one more minute. I’m prepared financially if I need to leave.  My parental units continue to be an annoyance.  I can’t fix things that are their own doing and choosing.  The mother has a noticeable cognitive decline, but her wicked narcissism helps cover it up.  She has always made herself to be the victim/martyr in stories, so the validity of her tales has always been questionable.  But now recounting events with names and dates is quite off.  Her incontinence continues to get worse.  (I wonder if someone has tried smacking the shit out of her as she did me and my sibling at age 2 for using a diaper?). Oops part of my old unhealed trauma coming out.  They have refused to move closer, so come what may.  I’m not dropping everything and driving half a day to cater to them. This xmas should be quiet.  Trying to have some time with all 4 kids now and eagerly awaiting the grand baby.  My dil is doing great.  Had a queasy start, but it’s actually funny to see how big her appetite is. (I of course do not ever say this!) she’s making up for lost meals that she had for the first few months.  I have some shopping to do for kid 3 who needs some clothes for school.  (Easy to wash stuff because he has to do his own…funny how that’s a worry when mom isn’t there)A couple stocking stuffers and then I should be all relaxed 😎 Wishing you and yours a very happy holiday season!BKat"},
{"title": "Smoking Summer ", "date": "Monday, September 4, 2023", "text": "Try to keep on the bright side.Summertime is over, back to school. A summer of smoke and haze.  Not that enjoyable outside most days. I have a constant runny nose, cough and or mildly sore throat on the daily. I don’t have underlying lung issues either, for those it must be awful. Sports camp ended in disappointment. (Not for mom) So at home for grade 12.I was able to max out my TFSA for the year. I chose a 1 year GIC. 5.5% is solid earnings. The RRSP’s that I have are not great. My older TFSA holdings are doing very well. I’m on track to retire in 12 months. My hesitation is that the man is still working from home. My days off now are often not enjoyable or relaxing. I may need to extend my career if he’s still not in the office. What is beyond wonderful…I’m going to be a grandma!!! I couldn’t be happier!!!I will make myself available for childcare whenever they need. So proud of both of them. They’re both working on their masters now too.Middle kid - praises be has found a job and seems to really like it.Youngest, well when one door closes another one opens. I think there are great things ahead for this year.Things that are great:My TFSAMy hair! (Not even joking) I use my new brush/dryer and found a great product medley and no more frizz,My grandbaby!Things that suck:My parental units Not having a peaceful house for retirement.Here are more happy flowers 😁 to end on a positive!"},
{"title": "Bloom Where You Are Planted", "date": "Saturday, June 10, 2023", "text": "One low bloom on my lilac.  The rest are waaay up there on a shrub that should not be that tall.  I like this one, it blooms deep pink.  The yard is heading into full bloom, and needs tending every day. Watering and some dead heading keeps the colours on show.  A quiet summer ahead.  No graduation, no wedding.  Sports camp in September.  I want to head to the east coast.  I’ve never been in Canada, only the u.s.  As usual, it’s all depending upon the camp success.  Health is seemingly a constant thing for me now. Just waiting for CT results that should be coming Monday. If it’s like this now, how awful will it be when I’m in my 60’s?For nice things I spent an afternoon with extended family and had a wonderful visit. Lots of laughter and a few tears, but filled my heart. The most wonderful thing ever said to me “Who would have thought 54 years ago how wonderful your life would be”. Remembering me as an infant coming home from the hospital. “Look how great you turned out! Look what a beautiful family you’ve made!”  I needed to hear that. They know how hard I have worked to be better than where I came from and the loads I have carried. Because of the nice time we spent, my parental units are giving me the silent treatment. Jealous and angry because people are happy, visiting freely and each drank 1 beer. They don’t know how to enjoy the company of others.  It has to be a constant stream of mean gossip, how they are better than everyone…smarter, work harder, richer.  Nobody except them know how to do anything.  It all has to be awful or it isn’t worth talking about.  Then they get into politics and sexual preferences.  The minds are so narrow that they can’t see in front of their face.  The silent treatment isn’t such a bad thing!I’m going to enjoy today, walk to the library.  Bbq this evening with the in-laws, but it’s only for a couple hours so I can handle it.  My kid 3 is growing like a weed.  The food intake and sleep is astonishing really!  School marks are so good, I’m super proud.  Lots of activities being juggled around homework and a social life that’s 100x better and busier than mine 😊 If the camp doesn’t play out, I get to keep him at home another year. We’ve had a few rough patches, undeveloped frontal cortex issues.  Or being stupid some would say, but learning life lessons.  Much more mature than I was at 16 that is for certain. I’m hoping that unconditional love that I share with all 3 of my kids helps them get past mistakes and gives confidence.  I’m trying anyway, it’s not how I was raised, or ever treated.  I’m trying to do better every day.Enjoy the weekend!"},
{"title": null, "date": "Tuesday, April 25, 2023", "text": "Changes have Reverted The person that I used to work with, had been moved into management. The odd behaviour and the inability to navigate management type problems caught up with them.  They were removed from their management role and slid back into the desk beside me. Thus I am back with my original colleague. This isn’t such a bad thing. This is a case of the devil you know is better than the devil you don’t.My third kid had a great sports season, however, was cut from team that invited him to camp for 10 days last year. This isn’t a bad thing in Mom‘s opinion. Living at home for the last year of high school, maintaining excellent marks, and having good friends in his social circle will be of great benefit.  The saying that when one door closes, another door opens is very true. There have been numerous potential opportunities that he can take advantage of after graduating high school. He is interested in playing in the US, and with his skills and high marks this should be achievable.My family situation is chaotic and hilarious. The golden sibling has ended another relationship. That is a good thing. The bad thing is, there was no legal agreement. (but when you won’t listen to your mom or your sister and you think you are smarter than everyone, you can sort these things out on your own) You can also sort out your debt which has grown by another 125,000. (This is on top of the 300,000 from before) It is beyond ridiculous. The best part is the expectation that the elderly parents should pay off the debt in its entirety. I have been living within my means, have paid off all of my debts, and have saved for my future. Meanwhile, the golden sibling lives the life of Riley without a care in the world, or thought about where the money is coming from. Banks, car dealerships and credit card companies love suckers like that. Once again, I was summoned that I needed to fix this problem. However, this problem is not mine to fix. The golden child, who scoffs at my house and rolls her eyes at my 15-year-old car does not need my advice, because clearly I am beneath them. You are smart enough to figure out how to obtain all of this money that isn’t yours then you should be smart enough to figure out how to pay it back.My retirement is on the horizon. My focus is on my health, my children and our lives.  I’m also trying really hard to keep a positive mind frame and not fall into the everything is terrible mindset. The spring time should help with that! I’m looking forward to spending time on the deck.we’ve been able to barbeque a few times and that helps take some pressure off of me for meal planning. I did subscribe to a meal kit delivery service and so far it has been fantastic. The only downside is, there is more prep than what I thought, but it is very nice to have all ingredients pop out of a bag! The food selection and flavour has been great and received well by myself and my teenager. I’m going to keep using it probably not every week, but I will get it for weeks that we are busy. I can’t buy the variety of groceries needed for the recipes for the price that I get it for.  Plus, I have been in a real rut, deciding what to make for dinners. Everybody is hungry, but nobody has any ideas what they want to eat! The good things:My children.My retirement.3-5 meals a week decided upon!"},
{"title": "Winter Update", "date": "Monday, January 9, 2023", "text": "Sometimes you need to only look out your window to see the beauty around.  This was out my back door the other day.  Hoar frost is a treat in the winter, turning everything into a sparkling show.When I typed “Out your window” I immediately thought of Kim and my heart goes out to her and her family.  She’s been such a kind and funny support for me over the years.  I hope that she knows how much she’s appreciated and cared about.I saw the new year in with family, exhausted after a 7 hour drive and a week away for kid 3 sport.  I did get to see my favourite cousin and his family for a few hours, so that was a welcome bonus.  Kid 3 did great, very proud of the hard work.I checked my “retirement calendar” and it shows 619 days!  I am putting the cruise control on and plowing forwards.  Anytime that I mention it to the man he becomes even more surly than his normal surly self.  And that is how he is.  The parental units are purging their hoard and planning on a move here in the next year.  The purge = giving me all the crap that my sibling doesn’t want.  Lucky me.  Things that I needed 20 years ago, going through my divorce they were unable to give me.  Like a dining table and chairs in the basement that they piled boxes on.  They needed it.  Nobody has ever eaten a meal at that table, but it couldn’t be parted with.  Now - “Didn’t you want that table downstairs?”  No thanks, I’m getting ready to downsize myself.What has been positive is that I am finally not completely exhausted every day.  The secret…My own bedroom.  I don’t get woke up 15-20 times a night by snoring and flopping around on the bed, him up to the bathroom 2-3 times.  The man is morbidly obese and his health is not unaffected.  I found my sleep success when he had covid and I moved to a different bedroom.  Glorious, simply glorious to sleep 8 hours a night!  To not have dark circles under my eyes and be dragging myself out of bed everyday, amazing!  It was awful sharing a bed in the hotel.  I needed a nap every day to function.I am also reading books, last year was only 25, but I was busy with the wedding.  This year I hope to hit 40.  I use the Good Reads app and my local library has an app that makes it beyond simple to request books.  I get an email when my book is in, and it is on a shelf waiting for me with my name on it.  I love it.  My work situation has changed.  It happened quite suddenly when I walked into work, there was someone else sitting beside me. I knew nothing about the change happening.  This person has loads of family problems and a sense of great self importance.  They also think that they are my boss.  They aren’t.  So there are quite a few clarifications that I need to do daily as they try to define my scope of practice.  This new person is permanent I fear, so I only work extra days when they aren’t there.  The family disruptions that they get are so bizarre and disrupting to myself and all the offices around it is ridiculous.  I like working alone best.  I also like working from home.  I have a good set up here.  Comfortable and quiet, but sadly I need to be on site for much of what I do.I go back to work in a couple of days and I’m feeling the dread build up.  I hate that.But it pays the bills and builds my retirement fund.So only good things to end:A stack of booksA wonderful nights sleepHealthy kids that I love being around and spending time with.Just keep swimming!"},
{"title": "Into Winter", "date": "Wednesday, November 9, 2022", "text": "This is from the day before the wedding in summer.  There are 2/3 of my kids ahead of me on the golf course. The other 1 doesn’t like golfing so is off hiking.The wedding was beautiful.  Extremely stressful for me, but everyone that mattered seemed to have a wonderful time.  My daughter-in-law’s family are a very different bunch. (Not in a lovely/friendly/pleasant/well educated way) To quote my youngest “How did the wonderful new sister-in-law come from that group!?”  My X and his 3rd wife were dufus’s as anticipated and my parents pulled a lot of drama the week prior.  I had my parents ironed out by the day of the wedding, and of all people, my sibling and the boyfriend were very helpful.I went back to work and did a couple of weeks of full time hours then my youngest was at a sports camp.  That turned out to be 12 days long as he made it to the final round of cuts.  It was 5 days longer than I had thought it would be, so that was quite costly to be away for 11 nights/12 days.  I was exhausted.  He was disappointed, but things have turned out really well with his team here at home.  And we probably get to do it again next year.  Ugh.There has been zero opportunity to get away to relax somewhere.  To be honest I like to be at home and not having to plan anything.  I took this week off of work and the spouse is away for work so having the house to myself during the day is quiet and relaxing.  It’s snowing and cold, but I don’t care, I’m not going outside.Summer and the fall sports camp were incredibly expensive.  Hanging out at home reading, watching MY shows is rejuvenating without spending a dime.I haven’t been feeling good for the last couple of weeks so this is needed R&R.The good things:My youngest and I get along so easily. (I love my older kids but we had a lot of disagreements when they were teens)I was able to work from home last weekThings that suck:My investmentsThe parental units who thought they should “Come for a visit so you can look after Mom” (that was shut down in a hurry)"},

{"title": "Some Goals Set", "date": "Saturday, February 20, 2021", "text": "The last couple of weeks I have had bad go of it.  Not feeling well, and of course the only thing talked about is COVID.  I don’t have covid.  I’ve been off work for 2 weeks, I will try to get back the end of next week if I’m feeling better.Tons of bloodwork, and repeated bloodwork, 3 doctors visits over the phone, 2 more tests in the next 2 weeks. A mittful of pills to take every day and a diet change.  Today I got dressed.  That’s an improvement from PJ’s.I need to lose 15 lbs.  I need to exercise.  Hard to exercise when your iron is so low your hair is falling out, short of breath all of the time... but I can do a little.So these goals that I made the title about:1. Lose 1.5-2 lbs a week until goal weight. 2.  Build my early retirement fund as high as I can.    ~ move all extra $$ into separate savings account every payday    ~ take the lump sum back pay I’m getting with my raise and move into savings.3.  Start selling off things not being used that I have in the basement and garage.4.  Keep reading and meditating to help my zen.That’s more than enough to focus on when I have no energy.I did make a spinach and feta quiche today and it was delish!  I have picked out 8 new recipes to try in the next couple of weeks.  Almost all of them are from Skinny Taste.  I have her first cookbook, but these are off the website.  They need to be healthy and be very quick prep time as I don’t have the stamina to do a big meal. I have an insta pot that I enjoy using too. My kid #3 is getting better in the kitchen and has been a sweet soul to have around when I haven’t been feeling good.  He has made a few meals for all of us, very proud of him.I’m cautiously optimistic about the raging pandemic.  I think that there is an end in sight. (Or maybe the light ahead is a freight train). I haven’t seen any of my friends in so long, it feels like 10 years.  No vacation in over a year.   Things have got to get better, right?"},

I’ve felt a lot worse with colds, so this was tolerable.  I guess for all the nutball conspiracy loons - the chip is implanted.  Government/Bill Gates care deeply when I go for groceries.  I can’t stand the stupid.I’m making my yearly appointment to see my financial advisor in a couple of weeks.  Hopefully to get a very clear path to retirement.  Freedom 55.  I will make it happen. My investments are holding steady with the chaos of the world and I am building up my savings every month.  The whole pandemic thing... if you are lucky enough to keep your job, there aren’t a lot of ways to spend money anymore.  I am still finding a couple of things to buy.  Lately it has been books.  I used to exchange books with a Mom of kid #3’s teammate.  Well, thanks Covid.  Everything is totally f’d for kids that play team sports. I don’t see her very often at all. So I got the Goodreads app and I buy my own.  Some day we will have boxes of books to exchange.  Right now I’m reading Lilac Girls and finished The Great Believers.  Quite outside of my usual reads, but very much eye openers.  I don’t ever want to be unable to see past the end of my nose.  My part of the world is still moderately locked down.  I know 2 people that have lost their elderly parents due to Covid.  I know about 15 people that have had it. 1 in ICU for a week, and one with lingering problems since March.  The anti-mask dip shits are so stupid it pains my mind. The lockdown rules that allow big retail to stay wide open but I can’t have company to my home, or we just go meet in a bar makes no sense except that retailers have the politicians under their thumbs.But other than that I’m great.   Not really , but we just keep swimming, finding joy in small ways.  We have family game nights now, that we didn’t ever have time for before.  We take walks, we try new recipes, I’m teaching kid #3 cooking and baking on the days off from school.  I watch movies that I didn’t have time for before.  I can’t comment on any blogs which is really a pain - I enjoy reading about others days as mine are pretty quiet.  Here is out a window after a wee bit of snow a couple months ago:The Good Things:I’m vaccinatedI’m EmployedHealthy Family"},

I still was “In the line of fire” for covid so I had to strip at the back door, wipe down every surface I touched and shower.  The pandemic response at my work is being run by people with ZERO medical knowledge.  Not very comforting.  Dumb asses.  I will take my pay and shake my head.I’ve also been jerked around this week working at home.  Meetings that have been moved 4 times, people that don’t show up.  Lots of excuses but no valid reason to not be professional.  Nobody is hands on COVID care.  Learn how to use a clock and a calendar. Dumb asses.I bought masks for the 3 of us, and an extra.  It isn’t the norm yet anywhere I have gone.  I think that it should be.  It doesn’t protect me from the virus, it protects others from me if I have it and not know.I think that the 3 of us may have already had it. Not that anyone can be sure as there is no proper testing for antibodies done in Canada.  No proper meaning that there isn’t even a test to run that is really accurate.  The existing one gives a lot of false positives from what I read.  Or who even knows anymore.  I just hope I don’t croak from a damn virus that came from a bat.There have been some OK and even funny things.  During the telethon they had Bryan Adams singing.  Kid 3 says - who is that guy mom?  He’s really good.  “Ya he is pretty awesome”  Randy Bachman “Taking Care of Business” was worth a big grin too. I donate to the food bank at our grocery store, so I didn’t give money that evening.  The weather has been decent for a few days in the last week.  Able to sit outside and enjoy a drink on the deck.  I did a bunch of baking the other day.  6 dozen cookies.  Eat some and freeze some.  I found yeast at the store. I’m going to try buns again.  Last time I made a rock collection!  Kid 1 finished another university class towards a second degree.  An 84%.  Not shabby at all for working full time.Kid 2 is finished his course.  And there are no jobs to be found.  Not sure what the plan going forward will be.  Doesn’t matter, just be healthy and safe.Kid 3 is online learning everyday.  The math seems to be taught alright, the other classes seem to be quite optional and well below grade level work required.  Just to get him out of bed and his mind thinking about something I guess.I like to start looking around garden centers this time of year.  No browsing sessions for me.  I will make a list and in and out same day.  Not for a couple of weeks yet. Today is windy and cool.  Not good for tender plants.  My lillies are coming back, and trees have the buds ready, but no green yet.I can’t add pictures, I think that is a thing happening with Blogger quite a bit.  I also can’t comment on anyone’s blog.  Well I can but it switches my ID to that of kid 3 and his school ID name and number.  So I will have to keep my comments to myself until my iPad isn’t the classroom.I see that there will be a meat supply issue.  This is what happens when you rely on giants that don’t give a shit about their workers.  Luckily we are city folk with a country background and can source right from the farmers.So I’m still cranky and have the blah’s but there are always things to be grateful for:We are all healthyI made an extra $800 this pay period because people are stupidMy cookies are 100 x better than my buns ☺️Fridge and freezer have everything we need. I don’t have any debtI’m still able to work as much as I want toSpring is here, the snow is gone and the birds are singing.Peace out, stay safe, wash your hands and wear a mask to keep your cooties to yourself."},

Talking away about 3 vastly different topics.My oldest that was exposed to his friend that has/had the virus did not develop any symptoms.  I saw on facebook a friend from childhood caught it too.  She’s finally feeling better after 2 weeks.  One of my occasional office mates has a friend that caught it too.  Her friend was tested because she was at an event now we call it a “cluster event” in hindsight.  She had only the symptom of fatigue, but because everyone that attended was tested, she found out and isolated herself.  Otherwise she would have been spreading it with family and at the grocery store.Our grocery situation has been fine.  Shelves were a little sparse after everyone was ordered to stay home.  But they were good the week after.  Hubs and I did a Costco run.  That was interesting.  We waited about 10 minutes to get into the store.  All people except for 1 family observed the 6 foot rule and were respectful.  I bought $450 worth of meat and staples, which will last us about 1.5 months.  We still need to supplement with fresh produce, but that is about once every 10 days. The daily updates from our Canadian leaders and health ministers are very informative. We all need Dr. Bonnie Henry in our lives.  BC you are so fortunate!!  Things are changing daily.  Can I just say that I LOVE the sign language interpreters.  When they make the mad/disgusted faces with thier gestures, as well as when you can see that they are truly frightened about the information they are conveying, it is sobering.Then there is the 3 ring circus to the south, led by the orange buffoon.  What a performance.  It’s shameful.  There is a Canadian rage building over his behaviour and orders. It’s going to get worse.The weather has been nothing short of awful, that helps everyone stay inside.  Snow, wind howling, it might as well be January.  The window in my home office is a bit higher so I cant see the ground when I sit.  It makes me “think” is is a beautiful sunny day as all I see is tree tops and the birds hopping along the fence.I’m cancelling our family trip that I have booked for July.  We aren’t going anywhere.  This isn’t going away.  Until there is a vaccine, which is at least a year away, I think this world is going to be pretty subdued.Luckily we have a friend’s netflix account, high speed internet, treadmill and gym equipment, lots of food and we both have our jobs.  Life is as good as it can get under the circumstances.I hope that our scientists that are working tirelessly on a vaccine, and our Doctors that are struggling to manage the worst of the symptoms can get it figured out, sooner than later.My thoughts of the morning:I’m so happy I can go to work in my bathrobeMost of the people could really benefit from understanding basic rules to “Cooties”"},

This was 2 weeks ago. There was no quarantine in place and ZERO information for him at the airport when he landed.  I don’t blame the young man.  It’s really just a giant petri dish.  It’s a matter of when, not if.  The family dinner has been cancelled needless to say.School is done.  I’m sure that the year is over.  We will see what the fall brings.  I am being eaten out of the house.  Yesterday I “taught” culinary arts.  Called make your own damn macaroni and cheese.I’m actually going to use this time together to get a lot of cooking lessons in.  It’s too cold to be outside, so I am cleaning.  The garbage and the recycle bin are full and it’s Sunday. No pickup for a few days.  It’s being packed in the garage.  Today is fridge and light fixtures.  I pace and plan to keep the excitement and anticipation under control.We were supposed to be on a hot holiday right now.  Obviously not happening.  And it was to the same place my kids friend brought is back from. We started last weekend on our “Not Hot Holiday” with cleaning.  The hubs is being a good help.  This week will be closets. The only downside is that you can’t donate anything as understandably that isn’t happening right now.My neighbours returned from a trip to the states.  They were in a top 3 hotspot.  I texted them when they got back and asked if they were prepared - seeing if they needed groceries for 14 days.  She told me that they didn’t have to do the 14 days because “Nobody told me we had to”.  I’m not sure what rock they were under?  Then after a day they decided to self isolate.  This is why we are all going to get it.  People not knowing and people that are choosing to be ignorant.My hubs is fully work from home now. He’s also “promoted” to a response team.  It means a hundred emails and calls a day.  That is if the network can handle it.  Usually he can’t get onto the company server until everyone in Ontario gets off.I could easily be working from home but my employer is inept.  So I go into the flames tomorrow.Every morning I watch the news to see what fresh hell awaits today.  It’s not getting better with time.Italy is our only source of truth as to how the virus will affect us.We are supposed to get a little sunshine and a bit warmer today.  At least above freezing.  We’re going to BBQ.  The new norm is still unfolding daily.Take careWash your damn handsStay at homeMind your business when I strip outside and then go in my house."},
{"title": "Summer is Here!", "date": "Wednesday, July 31, 2019", "text": "The end of July is upon us.  It has been a warm and lovely summer with some wild and crazy weather thrown in!!We’ve only had 1 hail storm so far that didn’t do too much damage to my yard, but boy has the wind ever blown some days.  I have picked up tree branches all over the lawn - from a tree that I don’t have and neither do my next door neighbours.  Flown in from somewhere.The yard is lovely.  My oasis and my escape.  Made a new flowerbed and added some shrubs and flowers.  Also bought some furniture.  It’s a bistro set that doesn’t have any cushions.  I got real tired of running outside and rescuing the cushions from potential rain all of the time.  Then the forecast would be wrong and I would get home to sopping wet pillows that would drip for 2 days and you couldn’t sit on them.  I sat my but in a lot of different chairs to find ones that were comfy.  It’s an iron set, and so far it has been one of my best ever purchases for the yard! Kid 3 and I eat out there all of the time and I have my coffee outside daily (weather permitting). I have a lot of daylillies.  I like their shape and how they look like long blades of grass.I had no idea that this vine bloomed!  It was bought as filler!My Hen and chicks that thrive in the hot dry south exposure.  My Aunt that passed away a few years ago used to grow them.  They remind me of her. This is my jungle planter.  Vines and blooms and toughness that survives hail!Kid 2 did not get the job he was counting on.  But, has already been accepted into school this fall.  Into something that I think is a good fit, unlike the last time that I correctly predicted disaster... but I keep that to myself and here on the blog.Kid 1 and GF are both full time for next year.  He is still temporary, but soon I think he will get permanent.Kid 3 is big, not a baby anymore.  Becoming very independent and quite a reliable kid.  So many friends and a good leader.I continue to wait for my elusive job.  I am going to have a meeting with my manager in the next couple of weeks to propose something that I could do outside of my current job.  She’s the one I had to report to the higher ups... I don’t expect any favours, but it’s worth a shot. The woman that I work with is a certifiable loon some days.  Her behaviour has been grinding me down.  Being in a tiny office with her is too much some days.  So I am trying to find a position to utilize my skills outside of that tiny room.  Maybe even part-time or less than that and do both jobs.  Just to get a breather some days.In June and July I worked an extra 8 shifts while she was away.  Those were nice paydays!I have been skimming off the top of my  checking account after the bills are paid.  I keep the balance high enough so that I don’t ever pay fees, and anything over that goes into savings. I’ve maxed my RRSP’s and have set my sights to max out my TFSA in the next couple of years. My TFSA sits about 68k right now.  I have quite a bit of contribution room left as my investments have been doing very well. What I do need to do is work on my health.  I feel like crap all of the time.  Other than gaining 20lbs in the last year, my doc says I’m fine.  “Just lose some weight”No problem - thats easy when you feel like shit and are exhausted all of the time.  Any exercise leaves me stiff and sore for days.  I mean a 20 minute walk and I have to lay down and wait for all of my leg muscles to quit twitching when I get back. That is if I can even do that, usually too dizzy.Likely all in my head I guess.Well off to read a good book, as I’m not too tired to focus my eyes today."},

I see my GP in a couple of weeks.  She will say I have classic fibromyalgia and that I need to exercise more.  I will tell her I’m exhausted and it feels like rigormortis sets in for days and gets only worse when I “push through the pain”.  Then there will be talk of new medication, all with nasty side effects....I continue to meditate daily.  That helps me sleep.  My kids are doing great.  Kid 2 still has no concrete plans, but that’s ok.  I’m so proud of all 3 of them. My maternal unit called me yesterday for no apparent reason except to smugly tell me that they were in the city last week to see my siblings kids.  Of course they didn’t call, or stop in because why would you want to see all of your grandchildren when you only have the important ones?? I don’t bite when she throws out tidbits.  I’ve perfected a “grey rock” method with her.  I don’t forget the selfishness and favouritism, neither will my kids.  Demonstrates how I NEVER want to be with my kids and family. I need to do my laundry for the week.  I’m out of pants that fit.  Because when the side effect of your medication is weight gain, and it hurts to move, your pants get too small.  I have 3 pair in rotation.  Out of stubbornness I don’t want to buy more.  I have many nice pair that are too tight!  I need to stop eating for a few weeks.  I don’t know if that is feasible?!Kid 3 found a tick crawling on his arm yesterday.  So now I have the itches.  We took a flashlight and went all over the chair, the blanket and the dog (who we think was the tick taxi) .  Haven’t found another...yet.  Blagh!!The good things...Great kidsBeautiful YardGood FriendsThings that suck...The parental units.Decrepit body"},
{"title": "Spring??", "date": "Sunday, April 7, 2019", "text": "We’ve been thrown a few curveballs this last while and thankfully have been able to field them all. My oldest got a partial refund for dental work that paid me back $1200.  That was more than I thought.  Our hot water heater quit, we were able to get a replacement installed the next day, plus another plumbing issue fixed.  My youngest broke a piece of sporting equipment.  Luckily the replacement was completely covered by gift cards we had at home.Then there is just the regular things like the house insurance that is due this month.  It is $1450 for a year.  The dog needed his yearly check-up and vaccinations.  That came to $200 by the time I bought his glucosomine treats, dental treats, another bag of food... We went to a new vet that is only a 5 minute drive away and I really like their new facility.  Clean, comfortable and friendly.  He’s apparently still a bit overweight.  I say he’s just fluffy!  The groomer that he goes to says that his body is just right. We are trying to be more vigilant with feeding him smaller amounts and less table treats.  He has a bit of a knee issue and I don’t want it to bother him because he is too heavy.Our hot holiday has been pushed back to Xmas maybe. Timing isn’t working right for our vacation days/work requirements/school. I don’t know if it ever will.Kid 2 is one step closer to getting the job he interviewed for prior to Christmas.  It will be a very big adjustment if successful. Not for him, he just rolls with it, but for me.  He’s always up for adventure.  He should know by the end of April.  I will take vacation to travel with him and get him settled. Of course this is all still a big maybe.I finished my and dh’s taxes and my return is in the bank.  I did kid 2’s and the return is deposited. Tonight I will do kid 1 and his gf asked me to do hers too.  It’s not like I’m an expert. I use Simple Tax and plug in the numbers.  So far so good.I haven’t been feeling well for the last few weeks. I’m exhausted, but haven’t done anything. At least I sleep at night now. Insomnia used to be my best friend, we’ve parted ways for now.The weather has finally turned the corner for spring. I went for a short walk this evening with the fluffy dog.  It was nice to not have ice and wind.My Easter Bunny. My dh has been going to a lot of conferences this year. Many days away, lots of planning to keep the schedule running for kid 3. Good thing I am only part time. He’s also taking on 2 volunteer positions outside of work. He would love for one to be a permanent position, they are both sports organizations and there will be some spin off perks for the family. So that is good. I’m not doing well with my further downsizing and simplifying plans because of feeling so tired. Hopefully with warmer weather and sunshine I can throw open the windows and do some cleaning and purging, I might be solar powered. I know I’m not snow powered!Happy April!!"},
{"title": "I’m Frozen this Winter", "date": "Tuesday, February 26, 2019", "text": "We are on schedule to be the 2nd coldest February on record.  Hooray!!  NOT!As I get older I notice how much I am affected by the cold.  I don’t like it.  I don’t want to go out.  I like to sit in the sun in my living room and bask.  Today I am typing away with my orchid blooms dangling above my iPad and the sun shining on me.  I’m dreaming of the ocean and the lush tropics.  This Canadian winter is not meeting my needs.Kid 3 is still in hockey and apparently it would be life crushing to miss playoffs to go to Mexico.  My birthday trip to Scotland this spring is on hold.  Kid 2 that was to be my travel companion is currently out of a job and if the interviews go the right way he will be moving away in the next 4-6 months. There was a ridiculous conversation with my mother who said that she would go with me.  Good Lord.  I would rather chew off my own leg than travel alone with her for 2 weeks.  This is the person that thinks “The only reason people go to Boston Pizza is to get drunk”. Uhm what??  No mom, it’s a family pizza and pasta place that has a separate bar area.  “I KNOW why people go there” she tells me.  No mom, you don’t.  She really believes that she knows things that the rest of the world doesn’t.  She also knows what people are thinking apparently.  Mom, you don’t know what people think - “Oh YES I DO”. When I asked her if she thought she was psychic she glared at me.  I told her to use her special powers to win the lottery and walked away.  She’s bananas and so is my dad who doesn’t disagree with a single piece of crap that comes out of her mouth.  Taking pills is a sign of weakness to her, so my hypothyroidism that has to be treated with a pill is something that makes her roll her eyes.  My neck and shoulder injury that were confirmed years ago with MRI happened because I don’t walk enough.   It’s endless.  I’m almost 50 and this has been going on since I have memory of anything.  I’m so glad that I don’t live any closer than they do!!  My dad has actually said to me that he doesn’t know why they don’t have any friends!  I wanted to say to ask mom why - as she is the psychic, but also  racist, homophobic, misogynistic, narcissistic people have trouble in that area I guess.I’m grateful for my little family and I try to steer clear of all their foolishness. Back to my own business and real life...I did a preliminary run through of our taxes.  This year with the Carbon Tax rebate the dh doesn’t have to pay anything.  I will be getting $1150 back and don’t have to buy any RRSP’s.  That is great! I will put more money into my TFSA’s as I have quite a bit of room yet.  I will do $15k for this year.  Keeping some savings ready for travel.  Hopefully to give us a quick get away for a week so that spring will come sooner.I have bought a couple of things that I didn’t need, but wanted.  Only some jeans and boots.  Both of which I wear to work all of the time.  Thankfully I have a scaled back dress code.  Mostly because a lady that is part time in our office only wears jeans and t-shirts.  So my dark jeans and blouses and sweaters look just fine.I’m off to do a school pick-up as it is -30 with the windchill and understandable how  kid 3 isn’t enthusiastic about walking!!

{"title": "The Bank of Mom", "date": "Saturday, January 19, 2019", "text": "I always thought that infants and kids would be the hardest part of raising a child.  LOL!!It is physically demanding and they have 1000’s of books to resource on sleeping, eating, behaviour, learning... not so much with kids in their 20’s.This week my oldest encountered dental issues that had to be taken care of.  $1900 of surgery issues and $50 of medications.  This office doesn’t bill insurance, you have to send it in after the fact.  But when you don’t have $1900 available on your credit card (because your limit is $1800) and you don’t have that much cash...Mom to the rescue.There will be reimbursement of likely $800-900 by the insurance, but that is it.  The importance of having some extra money around is very clear.  While I was getting medications I thought that the fridge was pretty low on fluids for someone that can’t eat solids, so I added smoothies, ginger ale, sports drinks, broth soups.  I’m so happy that I could do that.  30 years ago I needed a huge surgery to have my wisdom teeth out.  I was hospitalized.  My parental units wouldn’t help with a penny of the cost.  It was $800.  They also felt no need to be with me.  My sibling had all of her dental work through high school and college including COSMETIC paid out of pocket by my parents.  I didn’t even see a dentist between the ages of 12-20.  I couldn’t imagine treating my kids so differently. I guess that is how they saved money.  Pretend that you only have one child.We have been trapped inside with very cold temperatures here for the last week.  I would really like to get away on vacation.  It hasn’t been booked yet.  Waiting for some dates we have to be at home added to the calendar.  The dh has been on his yearly diet/fitness try for all of January.  He’s not happy with the scale, but his digestive issues are so much better without a pail of Diet Pepsi and a bag of chips every day. (Go figure).  Kid 3 is enjoying the fitness equipment that we’ve bought.  Very dedicated to exercising daily.  So that is nice. It gives dh a workout partner too!  The rap music pumping through the house is a bit much for me and the dog but we will survive!  LOL.Kid 1 has been texting me and looks to be recovering really well.  I’m relieved.  That is the part that I worry about, not the money.I had a huge find in my “Clean and Purge” last week.  In a drawer were 5 gift cards (to the same place) and I didn’t know if they had money on them.  I took them into the store yesterday - $100!!  Wowza!  Happy day for me! I already know that I will use this for a xmas present for one of the kids for next year. Have a good week!The good things:Having money in the bank  of MomHaving appreciative kidsFinding $$Things that suck:Painful dental workHaving to pay for painful dental work-40 windchill"},
{"title": "2019 Simple and Splurges", "date": "Friday, January 11, 2019", "text": "This is my personal splurge year.I bought a new iPad and a keyboard to attach.  The keyboard takes a bit of adjustment compared to my one at work, but I like being able to type normally.  I’m also able to add pictures now, and comment easier on others blogs.  I bought a lamp for my livingroom so that I can see to read in the evenings.  I bought a printer so that kid#3 can do homework easier, we bought a home gym so that kid#3 and dh can do workouts at home instead of the $50 a month gym.Our Christmas was small.  Just us and and kids.  I prefer that now instead of trying to make uncomfortable chit chat with jerk family. I took a week off work to relax and catch up on sleep.  I averaged 2 hours of extra sleep a day!!I did a shwack of baking.  (That means a ton). Cookies and squares mostly.  And 2/3 of it was gifts for the neighbours.I got lovely gifts that I appreciate and enjoy from DH and the kids.  My parents gave $$ which is good and my MIL gave me a gift card.  She also gave me a horrid smelly candle.  Somehow it made its way into a donation pile 😉. I actually got 5 candles for xmas, plus a wax melting pot. (Maybe my house stinks??)Dh and I talked about taking the 3 of us on a hot holiday.  It will be to Mexico.  Not visiting the US until there is a change in government.  Like almost all of my co-workers as well.  Canadian politics is bad, but hoo boy, what a circus going on (not a fun one to watch either) I am sick to death of that con man on our t.v. It is soon 7 years that I have been mortgage free!!  I am planning my retirement date already.  Freedom 55 here I come!!  Because I am only working part time it does take quite a bit of planning to reach the numbers that I need to make that a reality.  The markets are doing very poor these days, so this year I am doing my TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account) in a GIC.  Super low interest rate, but safe and will be short term and hopefully reinvest in a year or 2 when the markets are doing better.2019 will be the year that I free myself from many things.  I am cleaning and purging many aspects.  Both physical and emotional.  I have too much stuff, too much baggage.  Too many things in the way, too many things holding me down, too much that I keep- just in case. Simple makes me happy.  I don’t like things complicated and intense anymore.  I get exhausted from almost nothing.  I have to pace myself all of the time.  It is my new normal.Right now I am enjoying the flock of birds in my backyard chirping away as they jostle for space at my bird feeder.  My $2 feeder and $6 of birdseed have given hours of enjoyment!  Sparrows, chickadees and blue jays seem to be my most frequent visitors. They aren’t the most beautiful birds, but they sing happily.  I also have enjoyed this morning’s snow.  Soft and fluffy, making everything look clean.  I had to run a quick trip to get some laundry fabric softener as I was out.  I don’t dry my clothes in the dryer and they get a bit “crispy” without it.  Sometimes I will throw the air dried clothes into the dryer with a fabric softener sheet, but that is just an extra step that I don’t wan’t to do.  Well, no reason to procrastinate doing the laundry now... so off I go!Happy 2019 to everyone!! The Good Things:My little familyMy grown kids that thank me for what I did for them when they were little.Costco Sweet Potato Crackers (Man I LOVE these)Things that Suck:My parental unitsAches, pains and exhaustion."},

So I am trying to be ready!I used to buy things for everyone that I agonized over, and I always spent more than I should have.  It would take me forever to find “the perfect” gift.  I used to search for what I thought was a meaningful small tree ornament in addition to a present to go to my nieces and nephew each year.  Not a single one of them mentioned even a thank you.  The year after my sibling gave my 2 oldest kids empty gift cards and then didn’t apologize or replace them, I said enough.  We don’t need to exchange gifts thank you!  My parents don’t like anything and the house is packed to the rafters with crap.  I have for several years bought them a food basket. Filled with locally made jams, chocolate, teas, honey, etc.  My Dad informed me that they don’t like any of it because it doesn’t taste as good as Mom can make.  She hasn’t made jam in 15 years, but sure.  Glad he told me and I don’t have to waste my time and money anymore.I had to see them last weekend.  My youngest and I went out for supper with them.  It was embarrassing how racist and obnoxious my father is.  I was told after they left “Mom, I don’t know how you even came from people like that?!”  Thank you. Biggest compliment I’ve had in a long while.  They don’t change, they like exactly how they are. So back in my world... Christmas is very low key.  The decorations are pared down and simple.  We put up a real tree with about 1/4 of the decorations that I used to.  I bought a poinsettia from costco for $20. That is that.  The kids are getting only a couple gifts. The oldest is getting a set of pots and pans, with some of my recipes in a book. $300. Middle is getting new glasses and sunglasses $300+ Youngest is getting some sports stuff $200. I have got dh shoes and will get a couple neckties. $200. Still debating about concert tickets. $100-180 But I think he might be in Vancouver that week.  I will have to check tonight.I would love to get family pictures done as my gift. But others aren’t as enthusiastic about that as I am 😀My job has been better the last month.  There is supposed to be another person joining us in the office which is good.  I’m still looking for something else but for now I enjoy my schedule.Time for after school snacks, do my wild hair for a work supper tonight, take the laundry out and pull out my ironing board.Busy, but not.  Just rolling with things these days and trying to avoid stress.  Meditate and find some zen!"},

Today is that day for me.  We are getting a new garage door.  Ours has broke 4 times.  The last fix, the repairman said it couldn't be fixed again.  The door has warped and the weather stripping has torn from ice and snow.  Had it been replaced a few years ago it probably wouldn't cost this much.I have also put off going to the dentist.  For over a year.  My last dentist that I had for 15 years moved away.  I liked him, I could keep my anxiety under control.  Now I know I have a cavity.  My first one since elementary school. It is going to cost both extra money and pain because I put off check up and cleaning.I have made some money on the side selling winter wear that is too small for kid 3.  The local facebook selling group has been really easy to use and nice normal people have come to the door.  I have used kijiji a lot in the past and I find there are too many flakes that waste my time.  Unless it is free!  Then people beat a path to the door!  I used the cash for October spending money.  So that saved me $80.We went on vacation and it was over so fast.  It wasn't as relaxing as I needed.  I was very tired and my back killing me when we got home. We did see beautiful sights, drink perfect wine and had great meals. Being mentally and physically exhausted is my new normal.  Yoga and meditation help a lot.  Medication helps but, this is how I am now.  Physio is $500+ a month.  I think sitting in the sun on a beach would help as much as anything.  I shall keep dreaming.I have worked more this year than I did last.  I have already passed my last years total wage, so I guess the next month and a half are all gravy.I do plan to treat myself to a new iPad.  This is the one I bought when I paid off my mortgage in 2012.  It's time for an upgrade.  I'm buying some xmas gifts this weekend to take advantage of the sales.  I also have to buy a new hair straightener as mine died Tuesday.  I had to invent a new very curly hair style at 6:50 am before I left at 7!! The dh comes back from a business trip tonight.  We have sports all weekend with kid 3.  There is no school tomorrow and neither of us work so I am praying for a sleep in morning!  Time for more coffee, the laundry isn't doing itself and the garage door people should be here soon.The good things:No mortgageHardly any snowMoney to pay for sh!t we needThings that suck:CavitiesDepressionNo sunshineMy work that pays well is killing my soul."},

I may have to get mechanical pencils by xmas, will see.All kid 3 wanted for school clothes was a new pair of pants and a pair of shoes.  The pants were a quick $55 but the shoes were hard to find.  Mens 7.5 is not an easy size to come across.  Finally found some size 8's that met the fashion/athletic criteria.

I will, once the cake is baking.I ran into a sweet lady that lived down the street from me when I was a child.  She's in her 80's now.  She recognized me instantly.  I haven't seen her more than once in the last 28 years.  She is still sweet to me.  One of her sons and I are facebook friends, she doesn't talk to him because he's gay.  I don't see that as a reason to not talk to your own child.  Like I said she is very kind towards me but I guess nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors.  Her son is a wonderful person, I wish we lived closer.  I would have him over for dinner.  I had such a crush on him when I was little! (Like I was 10 years old and he was 20) He looked like a Ken doll!  He's also smart and funny and kind.  I don't know why that wouldn't be enough for a Mom?I don't know lots of things.My oldest has found full time work for the next 8 months.  Hopefully it will become permanent.  Kid 2 is starting school again in the fall and still working full time.  Kid 3 has had the busiest summer of all, going with friends to their lake, sleepovers, camps, movies...it has been great!The wind is crazy now, maybe it will blow some smoke away so I can go outside?  Hopefully.Enjoy the summer!!"},

He did all of the backbreaking work.  As we move along it becomes clear that we will stay in this house for at minimum 6 more years.  The swingset was sold a couple of years ago, no need for a sandbox anymore.  The basketball hoop and hockey net are the only \"toys\" that stay out now.  Looking at putting in a firepit in the back yard now that kids \"hang out\" vs play.The trip to the west coast was put on hold.  Making the yard a sanctuary that we like to hang out in every day used up some of that $$ and is a good personal return on investment! Many hours are spent relaxing and entertaining. A 10 day trip would have been a great adventure but that would mean that the yard improvements and house fixes wait another year.  We mostly needed the hours at home to do the work. Some day when it isn't windy I will need a couple days for painting/staining projects.  It should have been done last year but post-op I didn't feel like it!  The house trim and the shed are looking very shabby.Dh and I booked an anniversary trip for fall.  3 months from now I hope to be relaxing in the mountains.  Flights paid with airmiles, car rental from Costco and rooms with a professional association discount.  Our first adult only vacation in 9 years! I've returned to physio.  I think it's helping, hard to say what is injury vs. getting older.  My GP gently talked to me about having a diagnosis of fibromyalgia.  She knew I wouldn't take that well.  I don't know how to process that yet.  After my third day back to work yesterday I was so completely exhausted I went to bed at 6:10, stayed in bed until 9 this morning.  My legs were cramping and aching, I had the bad \"crawlies\" sensation on my back that I get.  I get a lot of weird stuff happening.  No rash and fever which was unusual as it often is concurrent when I hit the wall like that.  Part of the physio treatment is psychological too.  It's a holistic place.  I'm grieving and also downright pissed off that I can't do what I used to 8 years ago.  I used to be a very decent athlete.  I played every sport except basketball.  Dh and I used to golf together.  Sports is a huge part of my kids lives and I can't do anything except watch now. I miss playing catch, shooting pucks, diving in a pool and swimming laps, riding my mountain bike...  I'm learning to meditate.  It's hard to let go.  It's hard to not be angry and sad.  Serenity now!  I can walk.  I can downhill ski (only the green runs). I can snorkel with my flippers on.  I win at mini golf.  I sit on the deck and bask in the sun like an old cat. (Not for long because I'm a redhead- but it warms my aching bones). There will be nutritional counselling too at my holistic place.  I haven't met with that person yet but I like lentils and quinoa and chia seeds!  Maybe more of that.  More kale.  (The dh will not be enthused haha).This weekend is a birthday weekend for kid3. Not my baby anymore.  The inlaws are here for a night.  I'm not happy about it but will handle it for my kid.  They let their thoughts about me be known last summer. I'm done sacrificing my time and energy for them.  Trust me that they are vampires that suck the life out of me.  That is one thing that has been very refreshing is being done catering to them all of the time.  It was never appreciated.  Thank god they don't live here!!!I'm going to enjoy my day off, drink my coffee in the sun, water my new trees and flowers.  I wish I could upload pictures onto the blog to show my mango rose.  It is beautiful, the moment I saw it, it reminded me of my grandma.  She would love the color!  I'm also going to mark out where I think a firepit should go.  Dh will be so thrilled with my plans for him to dig!!The good things:Summer sunPopsiclesLillies and rosesThings that suck:People that are usersDecrepid body"},

Nothing set in stone yet.  It depends on his education plans.  I eagerly await Jane's trip (From Life Begins at Retirement) to see what she and her brother do! I have a travel savings account and I will add to it every month for the next year.  I think $10k will be what I need for the 2 of us.  I have that now and will pad this up.  The thought of driving on the left terrifies me - and kid 2 will only be 22 years old so I don't think he can drive a rental, tours may be very costly.  Doesn't matter.  I'm doing this.  When kid3 is older I will do a great trip with him too.  Memories are more important than being the richest person in the cemetery.  With the knowledge of my retirement being comfortable I am spreading the extra bucks into different pots.  Not such a focus on 20 years from now.  I need some good things now too.  More travel, more self care, more time to stress less and enjoy.The good things:Payday todayNice dinner out planned for tonight.  FREE with gift cardsMy yard is in full bloom.Things that suck:I need a new computer and am having trouble deciding what would suit my needsMy office at work was 27 degrees (Celsius)Dh needs new pants.  Worlds worst shopper for clothes."},

I don't buy fancy food. Pork chops/chicken/ground beef.  Potatoes/rice/pasta.

So I ended up staying where I was and still am.  It's not a fulfilling job.  It's not a pleasant job most days, but brain numbing, and well paid!  I also pick my own part time schedule.  That part is fairly awesome!  I'm able to go to all of kid3's sports and activities.  My other 2 are both on their own now.  Both working and one also going to school.  I try to do a weekly meal with everyone so that kid3 doesn't feel like an only child!With my maxed out RRSP's and also TFSA's these will top up my pension and make it feasible to retire at 55!  I won't be rich, but I will be able to live as comfortably as I am now!  Including some travel every year.  And according to my investment person at the bank I will live until I'm 90!  So that is the withdrawal number he worked with.  As my Grandma would say \"That's too long to hang around\".  I may lower that number as time rolls along 😉  My dh has to work likely for 10-15 more years after I retire as he didn't start his current job and contributing to his pension plan until 10 years ago.  He has reached the top of his pay scale, and with his last review he was put on track for succeeding the current director.  This is great $$ but more travel and longer hours.  Thus me being able to be around for kid3 makes more sense.As we know life can change in the blink of an eye.  What the future holds and what you predict and hope are often very different.  Dealing with change, coping with curve balls and staying grounded as the days go by is also a full time job.  I love my little family.  I tolerate my obnoxious parents and in laws, but I don't bust my ass to cater to them anymore.  You can't fix or change stupid.  Being used by them is tolerated no more.  I've found some great very extended family that we mesh with very well.  I identify with them, and so do my husband and kids.  Same goes on dh's side of the family.  He has a 3rd cousin and family that we are very close to.  Normal, intelligent, fun and kind people.  Always laughter and enjoyable times when spent together.  Being able to break away from the tight clutches of my in-laws has given us opportunity to expand our circle as I don't have to cater to them every stinking weekend like I used to!  Spending time with wonderful friends does the heart good.  Such a relief to look forward to weekends!! Which reminds me -with days off this week I'm making a coffee date with a friend that retired a couple years ago.  She makes me laugh with her dry wit!  I've booked a pedicure, I'm going to try and get a massage too!  Self care is an important part of life now too!  And once or twice a year isn't going crazy with $$.  The good things:My kidsThis beautiful hot weatherNo mortgage so that money is all going to retirementThings that suck:Getting a sunburn 😎Not winning the lottoNarcissistic parents"},

TFSA's and an RESP for my kids 2&3.  I don't do stock trading, have gold bullion in my basement or a wad of bills under my mattress.  Although the mattress plan is seeming more appealing with every trip to the bank.  It shouldn't be such a huge pain in the arse to purchase some mutual funds.  I obviously oversimplify the process.  I have a new person looking after me.  Based on our one hour today I think it will be fine.  But that's what I thought about my last person and she made so many mistakes it was quite shocking.  He did clarify that I didn't have a mortgage and I don't have any debt's.  We talked for awhile about how I did it and that I can't work like that anymore due to injury.Next week is another meeting.  I have to find out more information regarding my pension plan at work, my insurance coverage and copies of POA that we have.What I would rather do is work in my yard and drink iced tea on the deck.  If doing all of this now will give me more time for that later...worth the pain!Well I'm off to find out my pension numbers, and sort out my unplanned life.Here's hoping to a Lotto Max win!  (Just kidding, I haven't bought a ticket in 8 years - a work pool) but 55 million would help me with a 5-10 year plan!! 😉"},

There were or still are commercials about people paying high fees for investments.  MER's (Management expense ratio's) Mine were almost 3% on a couple of funds I was in.  Over the last 2 years they have performed poorly but adding insult to injury was the money removed from the small gains that put me to 0.  So over they went from another bank into CIBC \"Premium Class\" to pay less MER's and hopefully get some forward traction.With my eyes set on \"freedom 55\" I moved other funds around and topped up my woeful Tax free savings by 25k.  Much more than the 15 I had planned.  But I had the room to contribute and it makes sense to be making tax free gains vs. Sitting in my chequing account and I pay income tax on the pitiful $85/year I was making.The RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan) that I still have for kids #2 and 3 is doing well.  To max out the government contribution you need to put $2500 in to get the $500.  Kid #2 is too old to have contributions matched.  But a guaranteed $500 return on $2500 is good in my mind and kid3 still has a few years left.  I don't intend to pay for all secondary education, my oldest has about $10k in loans after 5 years, but is fully employed and can easily afford payments. My kid 2 is sorting out life and hasn't picked a path yet.  So working full time.  I also don't pay if they don't pass.  I'm mean like that.  I work very hard for my money, I expect that its use will be with consideration and effort.I am still trying to think about a summer trip.  Its very hard to nail down vacation time needed and kid3's activities and dh's vacation days.  He is away for work for a week in 2 months and I will take vacation then as my hours of work are very early and kid3 has to be seen off to school.  At work there might be a change in the office.  I don't want to get my hopes up too much.  It would help the stress level go down and satisfaction go up.  But I remain pessimistic that there will be any forward thinking done by management. I haven't used my credit card for anything other than haircut and badly needed colour and some potion and spray to tame the frizzies.  Staying the same weight also saves money on clothes!  I am looking forward to warmer temperatures so I can pull out some different pants and tops and shoes.  Even some ice melting would change the shoe situation.  There is no physical space to put a change of footwear in my overcrowded office.  Seriously, not a spot for me to keep shoes.  I had a locker that was mine for years taken away because I went part time.  Now my coat is on a shared hook!  Thank god nobody smokes.Here is hoping that St. Paddy brings in some warmth and sunshine!The good things:My kids all together last nightFeeling betterThings that suck:Not getting away for vacation for MarchMy parental units are loons"},

I'm looking and looking....The parental units stopped at our house for 63 minutes on the 24th. (That brings the 2017 year visit total to 63 minutes hahaha!  In May they said on the evening before my birthday they would be over to see me in the morning for coffee.  They never showed up.).Of course they were in a huge rush to get to see the Golden sibling and the grandkids that matter so \"We have to get going\". My fathers phone was constantly dinging with texts from the princess.  My little guy saw them from where he was sitting.  \"When are you getting here?  Where are you?\"  Etc. Etc.It was fine that they left.  They asked 2 questions about our trip and then proceeded to go on the stupidest political and racist rants for an hour.  So hard to listen to and you can't have a conversation as all they want is a platform to blather their nonsense.When you are uneducated and closed minded and obnoxious about your opinions I don't want to be around you and I don't want my youngest around that.I want no part of the shit show. After they left my youngest said \"Mom, they don't know anything about us\". No, they don't and they don't want to either.Not everyone gets a great family, or a family that cares.  I try really hard to do better with my kids all of the time.Like I said before, I've been cutting the garbage out of my life.  All but 63 minutes of 2017.Many friends and family members have distanced themselves or ended their relationship with my parents since my grandma died.  At least the constant bragging about how they are millionaires has all but ceased.  Who knows, its probably all spent, or used to pay off some of the hundreds of thousands of debt that the princess has.Not my circus.  Not my monkeys.  This is my mantra.We did have a fantastic vacation though and I know that my heart is at peace when I sit by the ocean. I will be socking away all extra pennies to go every chance I can.We also went to see some of my family that I haven't seen since I was small.  They are lovely people. It was nice to feel cared about and have conversations about things we shared interest in and learn about them and their lives.  So much laughter and fun.We were all invited back again and would love to go.Travel is where my savings will go. Now to plan my west coast trip!!!The good things...My childrenMy improving relationship with the dhMy very extended familyHaving no debtHappy New year!

Change has become constant.  New people, places and things in our life.  I've cut out the garbage people.  People that don't value me or my family.  Health changes, surgeries.  I don't have the strength for the negative anymore.I've had a lot of counselling in the last year.  Guess what?  I can't do it all!  I can't be all things to all people!  I take responsibility for only myself and hold others accountable for their own actions. Holding others accountable for themselves has pissed off a few people.  Stop playing a victim/martyr.  Poor choices and poor decisions do not equal a huge pity party.Behaviour/actions show your priorities and intent, not words.It's sad but we've all become very wary of people now.  We have boundaries in place and enforce them. There will also be a hell storm of epic proportions if you hurt one of my kids.I am not in any way comparable to either of my parents.  (Which is one of my greatest accomplishments!!) this should go in my list of positives...and in my resume and euology.There are some positives:Our little family is tight.  The 5 of us have clung together through some rough times.Our finances are not a worry.

Because my salary is only part time I don't have a lot of money left at the end of the month.  Property taxes, utilities, licence plates for my car and I still pay for kid#2's car plates monthly.Last year after my bank fiasco and over contribution to my RRSP's, I don't think I will have anything to top up.  I do plan to add to my TFSA.  I won't max it, but hope to do $10,000 this year.So finances are actually mundane, in a very good way.  What hasn't been mundane is the rest of my life.  Health has been a roller coaster, mental health has been something else as well.Totally change of topic ahead but still a Monster that I need to slay:There was a horrible incident with a friend's child this past fall.  The child is safe now, and getting help.  It was a huge trigger for me.  I too was 10 years old when repeatedly sexually assaulted by my cousin.  He was 5 years older, 100lbs heavier and he threatened me to never tell. So I didn't, until this fall.  37 years later.  I have told my husband and 1 friend, and now internet strangers.  Because it is easier here in the safety of my home to type it out than say it out loud.  I've been coming to terms with what happened, not really, but I've at least got it out of me.  Between him and the abuse I had at the hands of my parents, what a messed up kid and then adult I have become.I will, at this point never tell my parents.  Why?  Because they will say I deserved it, or I am lying.  Besides, he is a saint that can never do wrong. He was fired TWICE for embezzling from his last 2 employers.  But \"That can't be true!  He could never do that!\"  Well, once maybe, twice, the asshole did it. And \"his dad doesn't treat him very good you know\".  All of this because \"They were so lucky to adopt a boy!\"  What a dream come true to my dad.  A son.  My parental units fall all over themselves when he is around.  \"He's so smart\". (Dropped out of community college). \"He's making so much money!\" (Probably stealing it)This cousin doesn't show up at any functions I am at.  Which is a great thing.  My parents pulled a shit fit when I didn't invite him and his wife and daughters to my wedding.  I had to make huge adjustments to a very crowded reception to have the golden boy and his family at a table.  His wife responded that they would attend.  Then 2 days before my wedding there was a sporting event for their daughter that they couldn't miss.  Asshole cost me $125 for not showing up.  Not reimbursed by my parents because if the golden nephew couldn't attend, well then they knew it was VERY important.  Truth be told that bastard can't look me in the eye.  That's why.I'm not sure why, today, I need to throw this out there.  But today I'm sick of this dirty little secret festering and eating a hole in my soul.  Some day I will need to tell my boys.  Someday I need to talk to a counsellor. Not ready today.The good things:Sun is shiningI'm financially fineI love my childrenThings that suck:The parental unitsMy childhood"},

Zero ability to concentrate, activity leaving me stiff and sore for days.Finally in July I went for more bloodwork as I could honestly barely be functional.  My doc phoned and low and behold \"your thyroid has quit\".  So I started on medication the end of July.  I can say that I am finally feeling better now after 3 months. I'm still tired but I can stay awake until 10 pm.  I've lost 5 pounds, changing nothing in my diet or activity.  So I guess pills are working.The kids are doing ok.  My oldest is home and it has been a pleasant change.  He is in a \"rough area\" school for an internship and has an appreciation of the effort I gave to give my kids a nice home, with clothes and toys and extra curricular activities. The middle kid is off to University 6 hours away.  He's struggling in his courses.  Not because he's not smart, but he's in a couple of courses that you needed background in.  He doesn't have it.  I told him that I didn't agree with his choices for classes.  But as always, I'm an idiot who knows nothing about him or the real world.  Have at it then buddy.  He has my full support but not financially.  He got a student loan that I will reimburse if he passes his classes.  I work too hard to throw away my money.  He has always been the kid that is fiercely independant.  I admire that in him now, it was a lot to handle and keep him safe from himself when he was little! My little one is great, loving school, busy with friends and sports.  He did some camps over the summer that have made him think he should be a veterinarian.  I'm all for it!I changed banks a couple of months ago.  I got so pissed off with an idiot teller that wouldn't cash a cheque.  It was an RESP payout for my oldest from the CST foundation.  It was a big kerfuffle with this very patronizing tone given by a 20 year old that did not know what an RESP was!  Then the cherry on top was when she took the cheque to the manager and the manager wouldn't get his ass off of his chair 30 feet away to even talk to me!  He wasn't on the phone as he was able to speak freely with the dingbat, and nobody was in his office.  See Ya!!  I will go to a bank that doesn't give me a pissy face when I bring them money.  I went back the next day and pulled all of my accounts.  The manager phoned me that day after I pulled out $40 k.    It must have been a misunderstanding, blah, blah blah.  I said if you are going to \"sit on your ass for $6000, then you are not the person I want overseeing my money\". \"I should have talked to you \". Yes you should have.  You are a day late. Good bye.I qualify for a $300 deposit into my savings from my new bank for switching over.  And I love their app for my phone!  Super easy to track investments and my credit card.  And the Manager of the branch came to talk to me and thanked me for using their services.That's all for today, I have a ton of errands to run.Then get ready for Tricks and treats!Good things:Great kids$300 cashThings that suck:Changing banking information"},

When he moved home, before he moved in we had a \"Come to Jesus\" meeting.  I laid out expectations and conditions that I had, and if he couldn't live with them, he could live elsewhere.Turns out he did mature in the 8 months of living with a landlord and roommates.  A much cleaner, neater and considerate version of himself.  After a long job hunt he landed a decent $18.75 an hour for the rest of the summer.  After 3 weeks, he's tanned, broken in his steel toed boots and put some callouses on his hands.His car however was a problem.  Fully paid for, but killing him with repair bills every month and then it was something new each week!  A piece of junk.  I had bought him new tires in the fall (I could't sleep when the snow started, worried non-stop about him driving!). Then for Christmas a gift was a CAA membership so that he could get that stupid car towed to the garage when it quit on him.He's been looking for something else since March and this past weekend found a gem at a local dealership.  Exactly what he wanted. For the last 5-6 years anytime I had kid expenses that the x had to split the cost with me, I put what he paid me into a separate account.  So essentially I paid for the full amount and put his contribution into savings.  I also added into it anything that the older 2 had to pay me back for.  School amounts that were too big for the credit card, trips for kid 2 etc.  I have built up this account to several thousand.  Out of this account I helped with a substantial down payment.  Then at the dealership my kid had to apply for a small loan.  I was there to be a co-signer if necessary.  The finance person was asking all of the regular questions about place of residence, existing monthly payments, then credit card.  My kid has had a credit card for 3 years, they have upped his limit twice, but his card balance at the end of every month is ZERO.  The finance man stopped writing and clarified if he used his card.  \"Yes, but I never buy more than I have cash on hand and I never carry a balance.  My Mom said to never get into debt with a credit card\"He looked at my son and told him that he never hears that from people his age, he is being very smart with his money.Because he has only been full time for less than a month, the finance person thought it wise to have my information available for the loan submission.The usual questions, then house value, then who holds your mortgage? Nobody.\"Wow, I don't hear that very often\".In the end, he was accepted on his own credit information, mine not required.  The handshake at the end of the deal was \"You taught him well Mom\"He ended up selling his old clunker privately the very next day for $1200 more than the dealer would give on trade.  Then he kijiji'd other things he had laying around.  Payments are covered for many months!The loan has no pre-payment penalties.  He graduates from university next April, god willing there is a job waiting.  At least he can drive himself to work with a reliable set of wheels!The good things:  first day of summer!Sun shiningA little nest of pretty warblers off my deckFeeling more like my old self some days (after 5 years)Things that suck:  some bugs ate every single leaf off my rose bush!"},

A couple weeks ago our air conditioner went kaput.  For now we just open the windows at night and close the blinds during the day.  We are holding off until spring to buy a new one.  We're having it installed by a friend of ours to keep the cost down.  Lucky for us he is a journeyman plumber and refrigeration repair person.  We can also purchase the air-conditioner through him at cost.  This will save us a few thousand dollars!I've been too relaxed keeping track of my investments.  I have to change my contributions so that I don't go over my RRSP limit.  I've decided that I will just switch that amount over to my tax-free savings account and do a monthly contribution to that.  I've read in a couple places and I saw on TV that the government plan is to double the tax-free contribution savings room if the budget balances.  Here's hoping that government makes a promise and keeps a promise!!!I must run, time to go to hockey!"},

A healthy one that could last over a year if I couldn't work.  I don't use it unless there is a real emergency either.  And by real emergency I mean loosing a limb, fire, flood, natural disaster, that kind of thing.  Your kid's feet growing and needing shoes, vet bills, a flat tire, a leaking hot water heater.  Not an emergency.  A fact of life.  I have an account for that too.  I call it \"Crap Happens\" and it makes me smile every time I take money out and put back in to read it on my bank statement.The dh's looser siblings have no issue hitting people up for money.  Then they go on a trip to Jamaica, buy clothes,  remodel a kitchen.  Neither have a dime saved in the bank.Then there is my looser sibling.  So far in debt and denial it is laughable.  After scoffing at my clothes, home, cars for years.  The open ridicule that was given to me.  Now the shift is from pompous to panic as the debt skyrockets and the paycheque stays the same.  At least her family will look good in trendy clothes and shoes when they repossess the house.  :)I have no urge to flaunt anything.  We enjoy our friends and the extended family that aren't a part of the drama and nonsense.My little one is done sports until the end of August!  Next weekend will be the first one at home since I don't know when!  I cannot wait to spend time in the yard and to get the bathroom remodel underway!The smell from all of the fruit trees blooming in my yard and the neighbourhood is heavenly!  I could sit outside all day!I am off to find something to eat for kid #3 and myself, and then off to swimming lessons.  (I don't count that as a sport- I call it a life necessity!)The Good Things...Having enough hours in to get one of the jobs I wantedMy dh and I have been working on our marriage for a long time now.  Things are much better.My older 2 are working hard at their jobs and maturing Things that suck...Don't judge me by the size of my paycheque.all of our siblings.﻿"},
{"title": "March Blurb", "date": "Monday, March 17, 2014", "text": "I'ts been awhile now so I am throwing a quick post up.On the financial front things are happily rolling along well.  I finished my tax return and had my refund within 8 days!This year I made less money than the hubs. (first time ever) So I got to claim the deductions for once!  This resulted in a big boom of a return.  Because I had been putting away a substantial amount on my RRSP's this helped my tax return even more.Things that I learned this year of taxes:  my dh has a very good pension plan with work.  He \"doesn't believe in RRSP's\". And thus he owed $2500.  He has maxed out his TFSA total however.  Suits me.  I do believe in RRSP's because my pension sucks!  I haven't maxed out my TFSA but I hope to by the end of the year.I am taking my tax return and investing in my TFSA.  In the past that money would have been a lump sum on the mortgage.  It feels so good to know that I am now investing in my retirement instead of paying the bank!I did a No Spend February (Groceries not included) - with only $60 in cash used in outside $$ and it was all for the kids.  My credit card statement came and it was $0.  I think that proves I don't need anything else than what I already have!  I packed all my lunches for work, didn't shop for clothes or house stuff.  This next month there are a few bills and costs on the horizon:  house insurance.  ACK!  this has gone up and up every year - now $1500.  That is what happens when your basement floods....  In a couple of weeks it is kid #1 and #2's birthdays and kid #3 starts a new hockey league.  3 out of town trips and a lot of practices.This summer is a reunion for my old high school - it is for the last 50 years of graduates.  I will not be attending.  I spoke with my mother who I believe is on the organizing committee - she told me that they can't find most of the people.  (She likes to be very secretive and strange about the oddest things)  Well mother, have you guys thought of Facebook?  No... they are mailing everything via snail mail.  I told her it is a ridiculous waste of money on stamps!  Set up a facebook page or a website.  \"They are working on it\"  Whatever.  I have no desire to spend an uncomfortable weekend with my parents watching my mother and her fake smile plastered on for 3 days.This summer is going to be very busy with my work project wrapping up.  Vacation requests are not being granted for then anyways.I started the dh on Weight Watchers a month ago.  He has 125 lbs to loose to be at normal weight.  I would settle for 50.  In 14 days he lost 8 pounds and then decided it was too hard to go without his daily 2litres of pepsi and eating whatever and whenever he wanted.  So its all back.  I've lost a big 5 pounds (sarcasm) but I like the plan and the recipes so I am doing it myself and continue to make healthy meals and lunches at home. Another 12 pounds to go and I hope to get back into my clothes from last summer!  I've cut my coffee back to 2 cups a day - down from a pot a day!  I'm sleeping better and my heartburn is better too.  I can't give it up totally yet.....It is looking like spring is trying to come around and so when some more of the ice melts I can get out walking!  That should help the weight a bit and I need some fresh air every day.  Been cooped up all winter!  Today I have a list of errands that need to be done and I might do some shopping for kid #3 that needs some sweats and or jeans that reach his ankles!  His are all so snug and have holes in the knees!  He has been eating like a little horse and sleeping so much - having a growth spurt for sure.On my agenda today is also a trip to Target - lol!  See if I can find me my sweet clerk for some coupons!  As one annon commenter (in a nice way) accused me that I was too hard on the clerk and if it was me I might be the same as the rude clerk.  Ummm nope!  It doesn't matter if you make $10 or $60 per hour you can still be courteous and civil when dealing with the public and if you don't know what to do or how to do it - learn.  Mumbling and shuffling your feet when you walk, scowling at a person that is purchasing goods at your store is not acceptable.  The customer is the reason that you have a job - treat them as such.  If you can't handle the requirements, work somewhere else without human interaction.End of the soapbox spiel  :)Have a great week everyone!"},
{"title": "Are my Coupons not good enough for you?!", "date": "Sunday, January 19, 2014", "text": "I did a quick jaunt out to Target last night.  I had found some coupons in the Friday paper for things we needed.  As a rule I think that most coupons suck in Canada.  They are for junk and low value.  We are out of antiperspirant, shaving cream, mouthwash and shampoo and low and behold - a bunch of $2 off and 2 for 1 deals.So I am not a new couponer, when I was on mat leave 7 years ago I couponed in earnest.  You have to sign up and search and it takes effort to find good coupons here. (That's why I don't do it much now).  I know that it has to be exactly as stated to be valid so the right size etc...After finding clearance priced products that matched my coupons I happily go to the empty till.  There were 2 shampoo that had an \"Instant Save $3\", plus were on clearance - so I thought I scored them for 99 cents...The woman at the till, unsmiling said something that I couldn't understand as a greeting.  (Or it could have been she told me where to go and how to get there)  I point to the save $3 now stickers on the 2 shampoo bottles and she peels them off and then proceeds to stare at the bottles and then stare at me, like I'm being sized up as the enemy.  After the inspection was finished she informs me \"These expired Dec 31 - you can't use them\".  \"Fine\" I say \"Then I don't want to buy them\".I splay my remaining coupons out like a fan in plain sight as she rings through all of my finds.  I hold them up higher and say \"I have coupons\".Sour puss then scolds me (I assume as I don't speak whatever she mumbled).  Something about \"Next time... don't you do blah blah blah\"  She then, with more attention to detail than a CSI she scourers the coupons.  I bought 2 Degree deodorant - same size, same price but different scents.  She humphs and tells me they aren't the same. (again assuming what she said was something like that) I said that isn't a condition of the coupon.  Heavy sigh and she shuffles back to her manager that says - \"Yes they are the same\".  She shuffles back to the till scowling. (Huge pet peeve of mine - pick up your frickin' feet when you walk!)I had a solid 5 minutes of humphing and sighing and glaring to buy 13 things!!!  There was nobody behind me or I would have called a manager to help little miss nasty run her investigation.There was a \"Tell us how we are doing\" survey at the bottom of my receipt - so I did!  LOL!!So I think that I will now try to find a coupon and find that little twit to ring it in every time I am near the store.  The poor woman needs my help to improve and obviously likes to work hard on her investigative skills!!  I'm going to keep finding and \"helping\" her until she learns to give a proper greeting and enter in a coupon!Honestly Target: Epic Fail.On a good note - my family has no excuse to smell bad!  We are set for sweet smelling armpits and mouths for 6 months!"},

My. Boss.  One of the dirtiest snakes I have had to work with in 23 years.  I think at part time I can handle it. Or I can explore other jobs as well as my previous one being only part time.  With any luck the boss will be promoted as that is what usually happens to nasty SOB's and I can go back to full time.  I am not afraid of the decreased income but I am feeling guilt or something for wanting to pull back and slow down.I have a whack of vacation to burn up before my employer's fiscal year end or it will be paid out.  I would rather have paid time off!! So there are a lot of long weekends for me in the next 2.5 months!Tonight I am relishing quiet time alone.  Everyone else had somewhere to go and I opted out!  Yay!! A movie that I like, popcorn and a glass of wine!!﻿"},

{"title": "Surprise $$", "date": "Thursday, March 28, 2013", "text": "I was very surprised to find a couple of deposits in my bank account this last week.  Big, like $3,000 big.  In January I had a boatload of paperwork and crap to fill in because of my work injury.  I was told by my employer that I had to or I would not get my medical coverage or my pension benefits.So a ton of photocopies, 2 trips to the Dr., too many phone calls to count and I mailed and faxed in my life story.Apparently, I wasn't applying for what they told me or for what it said on the forms!  I had called the company and clarified twice, told them I was working full time again.  I thought it was all tickety-boo.I got a letter from the same lady I had clarified why and for what all of the paperwork was for saying that this was my income supplement for when my employer dropped down my hours, and that they gave it to me even though I had applied 8 months too late!???Umm Hello???  I filled in all of the BS within a week of getting the forms from my employer!  I don't have access to these forms unless they are given by my employer.  Don't tell me I am 8 months late.  I was told it was for medical benefits and pension coverage.  That wasn't done at all.  Talk about screwed up departments.  I don't care, they are all a bunch of fools.  I will take the money.*edited to add:  I apparently met the criteria to receive it, even though not one dummy told me about it when my wage was cut by 3/4*So I added money to my 2 savings accounts of 1. House stuff /crap happens and 2.  Vacation.My little #3 had his other test done and it was a nightmare.  I don't even like to think about it.  I knew it had to be done but he didn't cope well and had a lot of discomfort.Now we wait and find out what needs to happen.  3 options: 1.big surgery 2. small surgery no external work, just a scope and injection in the bladder 3. nothing - live with it and hope it doesn't get worse.I am going to phone the specialists office today.DH has been at his new job all week.  It is identical behavior that he has done for his last 6 jobs.  He phones me (no matter where I am or what I'm doing), tells me he hates it, tells me he's quitting.  Pretty much has a panic attack and acts like he's 4.  I tell him that we have been through this 6 times now and for the 6th time he will be fine and if he doesn't want to work he can move home and live with his mommy.  Suck it up and be a man.  Honestly!  I didn't even have to finish my spiel this time... I said my usual lines \"and if you don't want to work you....\"  \"I can move home with my mother\"  \"There you go honey\"I'm tired, I too am doing a job that I don't love and find a breeze.  Trust me that the stress levels in what we do are not comparable at all.  I would love to have as little responsibility as he does.  His biggest decision this week was where to go for coffee!!!  I don't drive the sympathy bus.  I should be all gushy I suppose but really, I have supported my family for 10 years financially.  Until the mortgage was paid and since then - even with my reduced wage we split the bills in 1/2.  He does pay for the line of credit that the vehicles are on.  He could pay it off in its entirety today but he doesn't want to part with the cash.  His choice to pay the interest.My kid #1 got a full time job this summer.  (Yeah mom and the new resume!).  I helped with his cover letter too as his dad, my idiot x told him he could and should use the same one for all jobs he applies for!?No, you need to be specific to the job you are applying for.  He had a \"Group Interview\" with 6 others and he got the job.  I was very proud of him.  He's a friendly nice kid and should do fine working at this place over the summer.As soon as we find out the plan for little #3 we are going to book a holiday or 2.  I have also had a talk with DH that IF our little guy needs the big surgery I will not work anymore.  I'll take a leave for as long as it takes for him to be fine again.  I had planned to go part time at the end of 2013 and we would be financially fine.  If I have to work 0 hours and care for my son full time we will be more than fine too.  I will just stop the big RRSP monthly buy I'm doing and reduce or stop the RESP.It really never gets easy does it?The Good Things...free $$ as far as I'm concernedWe have jobs that pay wellmy older 2 have good jobs for summerI am prepared to do what I need to do for my son's healthThings that suck...I would do anything to trade places with my little guynot loving your jobstress"},

(I live 5 min away) visited us for 5 minutes on the way out of town.  They stood in the doorway and didn't take off thier coats.  They did bring a big parting gift of 3 things from the dollar store for kid #3.  Refused to join dh for lunch when he called and invited them earlier in the week - they were too tired from babysitting.  They looked after the 3 grand kids for 3 hours a day after school was done.The last conversation the final straw(s):  I was informed that I \"got a divorce because of the way that \"x\" put toothpaste on the toothbrush!\" I apparently got divorced \"for no good reason\". Whereas my perfect sibling has been done so wrong by her husband, how could he, how dare he!  She is without blame.  I was also informed that \"Your 2 kids don't know their cousins\"  Umm Dad, I have 3 children. And my dad \"feels sorry\" for my current dh because I have such anger towards my parents.  WTH?Anger takes energy and saps the life out of you.  I don't have extra to waste on them.Don't call me to fix things that go wrong in your lives anymore.  Call the neighbours.  When you are on your next trip (that you don't bother telling me that you are going on) and you have chest pain again at 6 am on a Sunday.  Don't wake me up again and have me arrange your medical care and insurance crap from 1000 miles away when you're in another country.  Call the golden daughter or call the wonderful neighbours.  Save your money because you will need it to hire someone to take care of you when you are old.  I'm not going to call in favours from friends when you need and want things anymore.  You have the people you value and then you have me at the bottom.  Adios.It is always a weight lifted when they go into silent mode.  I don't dread the phone ringing.  I go on with my life.  Things are complicated enough just going on our own way without having those 2 crazies trying to ruin things.  (My mother doesn't have any issues - she watches Dr. Phil everyday ya know!)I happen to be pretty happy these days.  Contrary to what I was informed how people put toothpaste on the toothbrush doesn't bother me in the least.  I don't even get worked up about globs of paste in the sink!)  I'm pretty sure that my dh loves me and doesn't require anyone's pity for being married to me.  On to some real financial things... I did not get the numbers on my T4 that I thought.  Things don't really match with the pay stubs.  I have to hope that some more forms come in the mail.  I will still get a good return, just not as good!  It will also affect the RRSP carry forward amount.  I will likely NOT carry forward anything this year.  Next year (effective March 1 this year) I will increase my RRSP contributions.  My goal is to equal 1 mortgage payment to equal my RRSP contribution every month.  With a wee bit of juggling it will be doable.  $850 a month to my future + my work pension.  I hope to retire before 65 too! The Good Things!a dozen roses - even when I said he didn't have tovacation days - even if I don't go anywhere Things that suck...my income tax is NOT straightforwards this year!  ﻿"},
{"title": "Getting Ready for Taxes", "date": "Monday, February 11, 2013", "text": "Thank you everyone that wished me well!  I really appreciate all of the support that I have here.  I have been so exhausted from work, and new meds that I am asleep by 8:30 every night.  Not much time to read or leave comments on others blogs.  This blog and the group that I read and follow have been a great source of ideas, commiserating, stress relief and humour!Last night dh and I plugged in some numbers to the tax program.  I don't have my T4 yet so there were a lot of guesses.  With me being off of work and getting paid by a third party, yet my employer pays me the third party funds...good grief!  It is one big ol' cluster of who paid what, income tax on what amount, pension, union dues...painful.  It looks like will be getting a refund because I didn't make a big wage like I have in years past.  In fact my salary dropped by $30k.  Every 2 weeks for the last year I have been grateful that I have had no mortgage money leaving my account.  We don't live an extravagant lifestyle, nor do we lack anything.  Slow and modest keeps you in the race!Speaking of pains, Jane I have an old version of something on this puter so I can't comment on your blog :( .  http://lifebeginsatretirement.blogspot.ca/   I too know C6 radiculopathy well, 14 months and counting...  I have a bulging disk at C6-7 and 2 more lower down.  I fully endorse acupuncture and gentle physio (where she slowly lowers my 1st rib and stretches my neck out)  I've also started my 13th new med and this one seems to work with only a bit of drowsiness as a side effect.  Finally the ache in my arms is gone, fingers are still numb, neck still stiff but not like it was. I may start the juice thing!I did some work with my RRSP's.  There were some that I took out of the \"high risk\" mutual funds and had moved into a short term GIC a couple months ago.  They are due on Wed.  After phoning my bank 4 times over 2 days and never reaching a human being, just a difficult to understand voice message that was not left by someone with an understanding of English, I said screw it.  They, for some reason can't get back to me within 7 hours.  (Yes I am calling the real bank and not a call center in who-know-where.) Yet when you physically go to this bank there are always employees standing around or jack-assing around behind the counter with no customers in the bank.  Nobody is smart enough to say \"hello\" and answer the phone when it rings.  Good-bye C!BC, Hello CWB.These guys answer the phone! A real person that talks to you! You can get in to meet with someone when it works for you!I've decided to keep these RRSP's in a GIC for 2 years, now with CWB.  Yes, there is a $50 fee to transfer.  I will make it up with a better rate.  And they have a promo on now that you can \"scratch and win\" a rate increase.  I got an extra 1/4% on the posted rate.  Not huge, but better than nothing, and will more than pay the transfer fee.After plugging in my approximate tax numbers you get the little hints at the end.  Well it looks like I will carry over my RRSP contributions into next year.  It doesn't make tax sense to use them for 2012 with my wage so low.  Now that I'm full time again (still lower than before b/c no overtime) I will use them for 2013.  The return that comes in will go towards the LOC that has the 2 vehicle's on it and some towards home improvements.  I am guessing that a new roof will be around 7k and doors ? maybe 2k.  Roof first, and worry about everything else after.What else is happening... Oh yes, I'm now old.  As declared by my 6 yr old!  I went to have my eyes checked as I do a lot of computer work now.  I need reading glasses.  I can still see to read quite well but after 4-5 hours of staring at the screen things start to blur!  I thankfully am fully covered by dh's insurance for the exam and the glasses.  I'm going to pick out a pair today as I could barely see from the drops they put in at the appointment.  Also taking the 3 kids to get there eyes checked too.  Kid #1 is 18 and is covered under the x's plan.  He needs new glasses (not that he will wear them!) grrrr!   Kid #2 and #3 are free exams because they are under 18.My Grandma is doing really really well since the bad episode at Christmas.  After taking her off of a crap-load of pills she was taking but didn't need, her mind is clear! She was a joy to talk to this weekend.  I love my Grandma and not just because she calls me \"Such a clever and pretty girl\"!  She is so happy that I'm working again and that dh has a job now.  She always prays for me and wants me to be healthy again and happy and successful.What else is happening... Sharon has a new address now:  http://midlifemommusings.com/I will fix my sidebar...The Good Things...tax returns!CWBmedical insurance for pretty glasses for \"an old mommy\"my gramThings that suck...getting oldpains in various placesmy parental units"},

(well I wouldn't do the shingles - just removing)  We need guesstimates and a timeline. ﻿My new position has now lost the manager that should have hired me and that got her hand slapped.  She is onwards and upwards as you know how things float to the top in any big organization.  Another new perk of my position is that one of my job sites is 5 minutes from home!  In the spring and summer I can do the 20 minute walk in the morning!  Plus, right by a Starbucks (which I have a couple gift cards for!)The Good Things...Both of us employed full timeIt is only -4 C right now (far cry from -38 last week!!)I have a quiet house to myselfGreat coffeeLoving in-lawsThings that suck...Little #3 has to go into some childcare before and after schoolMy \"newer\" winter coat has a broken zipper and my old one is rippedmy side of the family is the biggest bunch of screw ups possible"},

I got an awesome haircut yesterday and it was free!  I was able to help out my hairdresser a few months back and she was so grateful it was a freebie! (saved $55!)I found dress pants for the new job (that starts god knows when) for 75% off - $23 tax incl.  And I splurged on a pair of casual low black shoes. $120 yikes!  But I love them and will wear them likely every day!  My previous pair are 7-8 years old and pretty scuffed up.  For clothes I've lost 12+ lbs so nothing in the pants department of my closet really fits properly.  I don't like saggy bum and always having to hike up my pants. (unlike many teenage boys!)Having been through a few bouts of plantar fasciaitis good shoes are a must, not a splurge.  I can pay $30 every 6 months for cheap ones or $120 every 7-8 years.  Simple.For some reason I can't add pictures with Blogger today.The Good Things...Great free haircut!Healthy kidsI'm feeling better and moving betterMy in-laws at least care about their grand kid and my older 2 their step-grand kidsThings that suck...insurance paperworkas always, my side of the family"},

They don't want the tarnished golden daughter to have a dime until they are dead.  And not like I was ever the shining star either.  They did increase the Xmas gift this year to $100 per person, double from last year.  But if grandparents don't want to spend Christmas with grandchildren is it still a lovely gift?  The parental units went away this weekend.  Grandma is better.  So the first thought is not to see grand kids.  That makes it 2 years in a row nothing to do with my kids at Christmas.  I am finding it really hard to bite my tongue.  To take the high road.  The positive note is that I do know how I never want to be.  Maybe I'm the one that is abnormal?   I am thankful that dh and I are doing really good.  In spite of family problems, injuries, job loss, we are on the same page.  Our kids are OK and our finances are OK. We need a new roof in the spring, new tires for the suv, another semester for kid #1.  We have a plan and life goes on regardless.  ﻿"},

Christmas eve will be served. The 5 of us and my sister and 3 kids. Instead of a lump of coal, I got to spend 10 hours of \"alone travel time\" with my sister.  Not go to church like I wanted, and not have any of the food I bought.  Next day for Christmas I pulled 2 roasts out of the freezer and we had them with potatoes and veggies. Again for the 5 of us and my sister and 3 kids.  She brought... nothing.  Oh yes, on the way home her fancy vehicle had the engine light come on and felt like the transmission was going.  So rather than have her and 3 kids stranded at -30 I gave her the use of our car.  Then yesterday I drove her suv to the shop with dh following me and she has our car.  I'm sure at any moment I will get a thank-you!

(Not true, I like lots of things)I did an intervention on my investments.  I have some high risk RRSP's that were on a downward slide.  I pulled them out and put them into a short term interest account.  I am not doing much more with them until February.  Good thing too as I have saved $300 in the last 10 days!  I was loosing sleep at night about the US economy!  That is a sign that I need to move my money!  lol!Our EF Emergency Fund is in a TFSA and that will come due for renewal in January.  It is in a GIC (Guaranteed Investment Certificate) that we can withdraw from penalty free at any time but if you do you don't collect the interest.  Big whoop for how low the interest rate is.  But better than a slap in the belly with a wet fish!My side of the family is unravelling.  The perfect sibling is in such deep debt and is emotionally paralyzed.  She has been in denial for so long that she can not function.  Her husband is running around with anything that breathes, drinking heavily (then driving) and gambling all of the time!  So when the going gets tough, princess gets a $150 hair cut, colour and highlights, and wants to get a new $300 North Face jacket...yep, that will make it all go away....I don't know how crappy her marriage has to get before she says \"Enough\".  Rock bottom is at a different level for every person.  Hers level is pretty darn low I tell ya!  I'm just sitting back and watching the carnage and it isn't pretty.  There are 3 kids being left by the wayside in all of this nonsense!I am hosting Christmas for the parents and the sibling.  She would be alone with the kids if I didn't.  It's been done to me (ignored at Christmas) but I won't reciprocate.  If I died tomorrow I would know that I chose to treat my family better than they have me and my children.  It's different now.  A giant emotional step back helps a lot.  I told my parents and sister what time, what is on the menu, what is expected of them (to bring) and that my own family of 5 will be going to church service Christmas eve as we have done and enjoyed the last 3 years.  They can choose to join us or not.  My house, my family traditions.  It shouldn't be too much extra cost.  I have a big turkey that I was going to cook the 25th.  Now less leftovers is all.  Maybe I'll stuff the bird with Prozac so that we all get along!!"},

{"title": "Good Bye Forever Mortgage!", "date": "Friday, October 26, 2012", "text": "This could be my last post about the mortgage. Ever!Yesterday in the mail came the discharge from land titles.  It only took 8 months.  Good thing I wasn't holding my breath!!It is done, finished, over, kaput.  Good bye and good riddance to that mortgage lender!!!I would like nothing more than for my name to be the only thing on that sheet of paper but, alas, there is a HELOC.  That was used for the car and SUV financing.I don't pay any money towards it, only the hubs does.  It was cheaper than dealer financing, and I was leery about being cash poor so I agreed.We didn't plan to purchase 2 vehicles in less than 4 months but crap happens.  A car accident could quite easily be argued a good use for emergency funds but I don't want to touch it.  With job uncertainty and health problems I want that money left where it is.When buying our cars neither were new, both will hold value as much as a car can, and I do not drive all over the province in winter in a beater.  \"End of story\" as my 6 yr old says.So I suck it up and share the title on my house with the TD bank.  There are worse things than having available credit.  It will be paid off inside of 3 years is the deadline the hubs put on himself and I'm OK with that.Last week my kid #2 had his dental surgery.  It was by a very lovely surgeon who treated my son and I with professionalism and TLC.  My son remembers nothing except sitting in the chair and then waking up in another room with my hubs and I with him.  Like a true teenage boy he was ready to eat that day and didn't stop since!  I went through a lot of eggs and pudding and jello!He's almost 75% back to normal with the bruising and swelling.  I am so relieved that it is behind him now.The cost was less than the original quote... only $2130.00  a real deal!  I've submitted to my insurance but still haven't heard anything.  I should by Monday or else I will have to call into the land of \"Press 1 for English\"  \"Press 8 for wanting to scream and bang the phone against your own head\"Life is otherwise finally nice and boring.  I have to go out and get some Halloween candy.  We get about 100-125 kids per year.  I like Kit Kats and Rockets - and soooo that's what I give out (in hopes of leftovers ;-))Tonight we are going out for dinner with a gift card that the hubs won golfing earlier this year.My savings are all automated these days, I treat them like bills and plan spending accordingly.  Payroll continues to screw with my paycheques so I think that there will be a big whopping payday in December as it takes them 4 months to rub their minds together and figure out where they screwed up.So I'm going to keep rolling along and try to avoid bumps in the road.  Maybe, just maybe, I can go on vacation sometime this winter?!  Meanwhile I will continue to pretend that hockey rinks are mini getaway's (ha ha ha)The Good Things....Healthy happy kidsI'm feeling betterThings that suck...I am freezing my tush off these days!"},
{"title": "It's going to be a \"Rainy Day\" on Wednesday....", "date": "Monday, October 15, 2012", "text": "With my kid #2 that is the orthodontic challenge we learned on the last visit that he needs all the wisdom teeth out.  The lower ones are looking like they are \"angry\" and the uppers are heading sideways.  Early in life for a kid to need them out but whatever.  The orthodontist sent a letter to a dental surgeon (too complicated for a regular dentist) and we would wait to hear back.  Well if I don't get a call 2 weeks later and an appointment in less than a week.  I don't know about anyone else but around here to get a call and then get in to a specialist in less than 3 weeks is nothing short of a miracle.The caveat... $2300 due Wednesday morning.  No billing to the insurance company first, cash on the dash thank-you.I think that I should get $800 from my insurance and I will bill the x half of the $2300 so 1150 - 800 = 350 when the dust clears in a month or two.  But still need it up front.Luckily my credit card balance is 0.  I think and I hope that we are done with funerals for awhile.  This business of driving all day, come home, do laundry, repack and drive again wiped me right out last week.  $45 clothes for kid #3, $300 in gas, $130 hotel, $30 dry cleaning, $50 eating out.  Not in the agenda but what can you do?More than my wallet, my heart can't take anymore.  I don't know if I even ate 2000 calories all last week.  Grieving, the stress of my mother, my perfect idiot sibling, so many people around (my family members funeral had 350 people) it was hard to handle.  We've made a point to have quiet family time at home.  I'm making our favorite roast tonight and a pie made this morning.  Comfort food for us.  The kids have all talked about the way they feel over the losses and I think they are doing well.  My little ones teachers are such caring and loving people.  They have given him lots of love and support over the last couple of weeks.The Good Things...My little familyWonderful teachersMoney in the rainy day fund so that I don't stress when things like this come upCarla's bread recipe that is now all my kids will eat!

{"title": "On the Bright Side....", "date": "Thursday, July 26, 2012", "text": "There seems to be quite a bit of badness about.  I have been watching the news this past week with such sadness and a bit of anger too.  Things aren't sunshine and lollipops for quite a few bloggers as well.I like to use my blog as a place to vent and moan about how tough I have things but really in the grand scheme of things I have nothing to complain  about.Kid #1 has been sick for a month with a cough and sinus cold.  Over the counter meds aren't cutting it.  Maybe pneumonia or maybe bronchitis... Bright side = able to be seen immediately at walk in clinic, chest x-ray done and prescription for antibiotics for $10 and a physicians sample of steroid inhaler for free.Kid #2 got paid for a couple of days work.  Bright side = now he can pay me back for the $90 textbook he lost.Kid #3 had a birthday.  Super bright side = I used Shoppers Drugmart points super redemption weekend and got him a Nintendo ds and 2 games for free :)  He is over the moon happy!  He's also having a kid party today with friends and cake.  Pizza and games for 4 friends at our house.  Cost will be under $75The man had to do a \"test\" of sorts at work.  There will be one man left standing after the cuts in his department and they will use this to select the most suitable candidate.  Makes for very uncomfortable times.  These guys are all friends.  There are 4 of them.  I don't think it is likely that dh will stay as he is the least senior.  There have been job opportunities come up in other places and even in Ottawa (where I said that I would consider moving).  However if I move my benefits will be terminated from my work insurance.  I would not be hired anywhere with the current state of my back.  We are staying put for now as we couldn't survive without a huge lifestyle change on only his salary.  I also won't leave my older 2 here with the x.Bright side = emergency fund is still in place, I've been putting everything extra to savings accounts so there is a parachute for us.My back is a little better.  I have 60% hand strength in my right hand now.  Bright side = better than the 30% of 5 months ago!My yard is looking after itself!!  Thankfully all of the work I did last year with moving perennials and mulch has made it presentable.  The rain that we've been getting has also helped!Here is one of my big peonies before the wind blew it all apart...    My daylilies are happy in the new bed they got last year.  I had no idea what colour this little guy was when I planted it.  I like it!Here's hoping for a better month next month..."},
